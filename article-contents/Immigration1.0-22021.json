L. 113-\n128), comprehensive legislation that reforms and modernizes the public workforce system. It reaffirms the role of \nthe public workforce system, and brings together and enhances several key employment, education, and training \nprograms. WIOA provides resources, services, and leadership tools for the workforce system to help individuals find \n\n\n\ngood jobs and stay employed and improves employer prospects for success in the global marketplace. It ensures \nthat the workforce system operates as a comprehensive, integrated and streamlined system to provide pathways to \nprosperity for those it serves and continuously improves the quality and performance of its services.\n\nThe Department of Labor is publishing this NPRM to implement those provisions of WIOA that affect the core \nprograms under titles I and III, and the Job Corps and national programs authorized under title I which will \nadministered by the Department. In addition to this NPRM, the Departments of Education (ED) and Labor (DOL) are \njointly publishing an NPRM to implement those provisions of WIOA that affect all of the WIOA core programs (titles \nI-IV) and which will have to be jointly overseen and administered by both Departments. Readers should note that \nthere are a number of cross-references to the Joint NPRM published by ED and DOL, with particular focus on those \nprovisions in the Joint NPRM that have to do with performance reporting among all the core programs. Finally, this \nNPRM has been structured so that the proposed Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts will align with the Joint \nNPRM CFR parts in once all of the proposed rules of have been finalized.\n\nWIOA seeks to deliver a broad array of integrated services to individuals seeking jobs and skills training, as well as \nemployers seeking skilled workers by improving the workforce system, more closely aligning it with regional \neconomies and strengthening the network of about 2,500 one-stop centers. Customers must have access to a \nseamless system of high-quality services through coordination of programs, services and governance structures. \nThe Act builds closer ties among key workforce partners\u2014business leaders, workforce boards, labor unions, \ncommunity colleges, non-profit organizations, youth-serving organizations, and State and local officials\u2014in striving \nfor a more job-driven approach to training and skills development.\n\nWIOA will help job seekers and workers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed \nin the labor market and match employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy. \nThe purposes of WIOA described in the Act include:\n\n    Increasing access to and opportunities for the employment, education, training, and support services that \nindividuals need, particularly those with barriers to employment.\n\n    Supporting the alignment of workforce investment, education, and economic development systems, in support of \na comprehensive, accessible, and high-quality workforce development system.\n\n    Improving the quality and labor market relevance of workforce investment, education, and economic \ndevelopment efforts.\n\n    Promoting improvement in the structure and delivery of services.\n\n    Increasing the prosperity of workers and employers.\n\n    Providing workforce development activities that increase employment, retention, and earnings of participants and \nthat increase post-secondary credential attainment and as a result, improve the quality of the workforce, reduce \nwelfare dependency, increase economic self-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of employers, and enhance \nproductivity, and competitiveness of the nation.\n\nWIOA is complemented by the groundwork laid by the Administration-wide review of employment, education, and \ntraining programs to ensure Federal agencies do everything possible to prepare ready-to-work-Americans with \nready-to-be-filled jobs. The review identified seven priorities for these Federal programs:\n\n    Work up-front with employers to determine local or regional hiring needs and design training programs that are \nresponsive to those needs;\n\n    Offer work-based learning opportunities with employers\u2014including on-the-job training, internships, and pre-\napprenticeships and registered apprenticeships\u2014as training paths to employment;\n\n    Make better use of data to drive accountability, inform what programs are offered and what is taught, and offer \nuser-friendly information for job seekers to choose what programs and pathways work for them and are likely to \nresult in a job;\n\n    Measure and evaluate employment and earnings outcomes;\n\n\n\n    Promote a seamless progression from one educational stepping stone to another, and across work-based \ntraining and education, so individuals' efforts result in progress;\n\n    Break down barriers to accessing job-driven training and hiring for any American who is willing to work, including \naccess to supportive services and relevant guidance; and\n\n    Create regional collaborations among American Job Centers, education institutions, labor, and nonprofits.\n\nAs WIOA implementation progresses, success in accomplishing the purposes of WIOA at the State, local, and \nregional levels, will be assessed by whether:\n\n    One-stop centers are recognized as a valuable community resource and are known for high quality, \ncomprehensive services for customers.\n\n    The core programs and one-stop partners provide seamless, integrated customer service.\n\n    Program performance, labor market and related data drive policy and strategic decisions and inform customer \nchoice.\n\n    Youth programs reconnect out-of-school youth (OSY) to education and jobs.\n\n    Job seekers access quality career services either online or in a one-stop career center through a \u201ccommon front \ndoor\u201d that connects them to the right services.\n\n    One-stop centers facilitate access to high quality, innovative education and training.\n\n    Services to businesses are robust and effective, meeting businesses' workforce needs across the business \nlifecycle.\n\nII.

Background\n\nA. Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Principles\n\nOn July 22, 2014, President Obama signed the WIOA, the first legislative reform of the public workforce system in \nmore than 15 years, which passed Congress by a wide bipartisan majority. WIOA supersedes the Workforce \nInvestment Act of 1998 (WIA) and amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), the Wagner-\nPeyser Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. WIOA presents an extraordinary opportunity for the workforce \nsystem to accelerate its transformational efforts and demonstrate its ability to improve job and career options for our \ncitizens through an integrated, job-driven public workforce system that links diverse talent to our nation's \nbusinesses. It supports the development of strong, vibrant regional economies where businesses thrive and people \nwant to live and work.\n\nWIOA reaffirms the role of the customer-focused one-stop delivery system, a cornerstone of the public workforce \ninvestment system, and enhances and increases coordination among several key employment, education, and \ntraining programs. Most provisions in WIOA take effect on July 1, 2015, the first full program year (PY) after \nenactment, although the new State plans and performance accountability system take effect July 1, 2016. Title IV, \nhowever, took effect upon enactment.\n\nWIOA presents an extraordinary opportunity for the workforce system to accelerate its transformational efforts and \ndemonstrate its ability to improve job and career options for our citizens through an integrated, job-driven public \nworkforce system that links diverse talent to our nation's businesses. It supports the development of strong, vibrant \nregional economies where businesses thrive and people want to live and work.\n\nWIOA is designed to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in \nthe labor market and to match employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy. \nWIOA has six main purposes: (1) Increasing access to and opportunities for the employment, education, training, \nand support services for individuals, particularly those with barriers to employment; (2) supporting the alignment of \nworkforce investment, education, and economic development systems in support of a comprehensive, accessible, \nand high-quality workforce development system; (3) improving the quality and labor market relevance of workforce \ninvestment, education, and economic development efforts; (4) promoting improvement in the structure and delivery \nof services; (5) increasing the prosperity of workers and employers; and (6) providing workforce development \nactivities that increaseemployment, retention, and earnings of participants and that increase post-secondary \ncredential attainment and as a result, improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, increase \neconomic self-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of employers, and enhance productivity and competitiveness of \nthe nation.\n\n\n\nBeyond achieving the requirements of the new law, WIOA offers an opportunity to continue to modernize the \nworkforce system, and achieve key hallmarks of a customer centered workforce system, where the needs of \nbusiness and workers drive workforce solutions, where one-stop career centers and partners provide excellent \ncustomer service to job seekers and businesses, where the workforce system pursues continuous improvement \nthrough evaluation and data-driven policy, and where the workforce system supports strong regional economies.\n\nRegulations and guidance implementing titles I and III are issued by DOL, with the exception of joint regulations that \nwill be issued by DOL and ED on the provisions in title I relating to unified and combined planning, performance, \nand the one-stop delivery system. Regulations and guidance on implementing titles II and IV will be issued by ED.\n\nWIOA retains much of the structure of WIA, but with critical changes to advance greater coordination and \nalignment. Under title I-A, each State will be required to develop a single, unified strategic plan that is applicable to \nfour core workforce development programs. The core programs consist of (1) the adult, dislocated worker, and \nyouth formula programs administered by the Department under title I of WIOA; (2) the Adult Education and Family \nLiteracy program administered by ED under title II of WIOA; (3) the Wagner-Peyser Act employment services (ES) \nprogram administered by the Department, as amended by title III of WIOA; and (4) the vocational rehabilitation (VR) \nprograms under title I of the Rehabilitation Act administered by ED, as amended by title IV of WIOA. In addition to \ncore programs, WIOA provides States the opportunity to include other key one-stop partner programs such as the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Unemployment Insurance (UI), Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families (TANF), and Perkins Career Technical Education in a Combined State Plan. The law also includes \na common performance accountability system applicable to all of the core programs.\n\nThe remainder of WIOA title I authorizes the adult, dislocated worker, and youth formula programs; the State and \nlocal workforce development (formerly investment) boards; the designation of regions and local areas; local plans; \nthe one-stop system; national programs, including Job Corps, YouthBuild, Indian and Native American programs, \nand Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) programs; technical assistance and evaluations; and general \nadministrative provisions currently authorized under title I of WIA. Title II retains and amends the Adult Education \nand Family Literacy Program currently authorized under title II of WIA. Title III contains amendments to the Wagner-\nPeyser Act relating to the ES and Workforce and Labor Market Information System (WLMIS), and requires the \nSecretary to establish a Workforce Information Advisory Council (WIAC). Title IV contains amendments to the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, which were also included under title IV of WIA; it also requires the Secretary of Labor to \nestablish an Advisory Committee on Increasing Competitive Integrated Employment for Individuals with Disabilities. \nFinally, title V contains general provisions similar to the provisions applicable under title V of WIA as well as the \neffective dates and transition provisions.\n\nSince the enactment of WIOA, the Department has used a variety of means to coordinate with other Federal \nagencies that have roles and responsibilities under the Act. The Department works closely with staff at ED and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) on all shared policy and implementation matters. Key areas of \ncollaboration include the Unified State Plan, performance reporting, one-stop service delivery, and services to \ndisconnected youth and to individuals with disabilities. WIOA created an opportunity to enhance coordination and \ncollaboration across other Federal programs through the Combined State Plan and the Department meets with the \nother Federal agencies regarding those plans.\n\nBefore publishing the NPRM, the Department solicited broad input through a variety of mechanisms including:\n\n    Issued Training and Employment Notice (TEN) No. 05-14 to notify the public workforce system that WIOA was \nenacted, accompanied by a statutory implementation timeline, a fact sheet that identified key reforms to the public \nworkforce system, and a list of frequently asked questions.\n\n    Issued TEN No. 06-14 to announce a series of webinars to engage WIOA stakeholders in implementation of \nWIOA.\n\n    Issued TEN No. 12-14 to provide guidance to States and other recipients of funds under title I of WIA on the use \nand reporting of PY 2014 funds for planning and implementation activities associated with the transition to WIOA.\n\n\n\n    Established a WIOA Resource Page (www.doleta.gov/WIOA) to provide updated information related to WIOA \nimplementation to the public workforce system and stakeholders;\n\n    Established a dedicated email address for the public workforce system and stakeholders to ask questions and \noffer ideas related to WIOA (DOL.WIOA@dol.gov);\n\n    Conducted, in conjunction with ED and HHS outreach calls, webinars, and stakeholder and in-person town halls \nin each ETA region. The Department and its Federal partners hosted 10 town halls across the country, reaching \nover 2,000 system leaders and staff representing core programs and one-stop partners, employers, and \nperformance staff. This included a town hall with Indian and Native American leaders and membership \norganizations serving Indians and Native Americans, Hawaiians, and Alaskan Natives as well as a formal \nconsultation with members of the Native American Employment and Training Advisory Council to the Secretary of \nLabor.\n\n    Conducted readiness assessments to implement WIOA in all States and 70 local workforce areas to inform \ntechnical assistance.\n\nB. Major Changes From Current Workforce Investment Act of 1998\n\nThis section contains a summary of the major changes from the current WIA. As indicated above, WIOA retains \nmuch of the structure of WIA.\n\nMajor changes in WIOA are:\n\n    Aligns Federal investments to support job seekers and employers. The Act provides for States to prepare a \nsingle Unified State Plan that identifies a 4-year strategy for achieving the strategic vision and goals of the State for \npreparing an educated and skilled workforce and for meeting the skilled workforce needs of employers. States \ngovern the core programs as one system assessing strategic needs and aligning them with service strategies to \nensure the workforce system meets employment and skill needs of all workers and employers.\n\n    Streamlines the governing bodies that establish State, regional and local workforce investment priorities. WIOA \nmakes State and Local WorkforceDevelopment Boards more agile and well positioned to meet local and regional \nemployers' workforce needs by reducing the size of the boards and assigning them additional responsibilities to \nassist in the achievement of the State and local strategic workforce vision and goals. The State Workforce \nDevelopment Boards (State Boards) continue to have a majority of business representation and a business chair \nthat work for all workers and jobseekers, including low-skilled adults, youth, and individuals with disabilities, while \nthey foster innovation, and ensure streamlined operations and service delivery excellence.\n\n    Creates a common performance accountability system and information for job s eekers and the public. WIOA \nensures that Federal investments in employment, education, and training programs are evidence-based and data-\ndriven, and accountable to participants and the public. It establishes a performance accountability system that \napplies across the core programs, by generally applying six primary indicators of performance: entry into \nunsubsidized employment at two points in time, median earnings, attainment of post-secondary credentials, \nmeasurable skill gains, and effectiveness in serving employers.\n\n    Fosters regional collaboration to meet the needs of regional economies. WIOA promotes alignment of workforce \ndevelopment programs with regional economic development strategies to meet the needs of local and regional \nemployers.\n\n    Enhances access to high quality services through the network of one-stop system. WIOA helps jobseekers and \nemployers acquire the services they need in centers and online, clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the one-\nstop partner programs, adds the TANF program as a required one-stop partner unless the Governor objects, \nrequires competitive selection of one-stop operators, and requires the use by the one-stop system of a common \none-stop delivery identifier or brand that is to be developed by the Secretary of Labor.\n\nhttp://www.doleta.gov/WIOA\nmailto:DOL.WIOA@dol.gov\n\n\n    Improves services to individuals with disabilities. WIOA stresses physical and programmatic accessibility, \nincluding the use of accessible technology to increase individuals with disabilities' access to high quality workforce \nservices.\n\n    Makes key investments for disconnected youth. WIOA emphasizes services to disconnected youth to prepare \nthem for successful employment by requiring that a minimum of 75 percent of youth formula program funds be \nused to help OSY, in contrast to the 30 percent required under WIA. WIOA increases OSYs' access to WIOA \nservices, including pre-apprenticeship opportunities that result in registered apprenticeship. It adds a requirement \nthat at least 20 percent of formula funds at the local level be used on work-based training activities such as summer \njobs, on-the-job training (OJT), and apprenticeship.\n\n    Helps Employers Find Workers with the Necessary Skills. WIOA contributes to economic growth and business \nexpansion by ensuring the workforce system is job-driven\u2014matching employers with skilled individuals. WIOA \nrequires Local Boards to promote the use of industry and sector partnerships that include key stakeholders in an \nindustry cluster or sector that work with public entities to identify and address the workforce needs of multiple \nemployers.\n\nAdditionally, successful implementation of many of the approaches called for within WIOA, such as career \npathways and sector strategies, require robust relationships across programs and with businesses, economic \ndevelopment, education and training institutions, including community colleges and career and technical education, \nlocal entities, and supportive services agencies.\n\nC. Rule Format\n\nThe NPRM format reflects the Department's commitment to writing regulations that are reader-friendly. The \nDepartment has attempted to make this NPRM clear and easy to understand. To this end, the regulatory text is \npresented in a \u201cquestion and answer\u201d format and organized consistent with the Act. While the Department has \nprovided cross-references to the statute(s), the Department also has included the Act's provisions in the answers \nfor completeness.\n\nWhile the Department has anticipated many issues that may arise and provided appropriate directions, there are \nmany other areas where the Department continues to weigh options. Thus, the Department raises questions \nthroughout the preamble where the Department seeks additional information or where the Department is weighing \noptions and seek comments.\n\nD. Legal Basis\n\nOn July 22, 2014, the President signed the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128) into \nlaw. WIOA repeals WIA (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.). As a result, the WIA regulations no longer reflect current law. \nSection 503(f) of WIOA requires that the Department issue an NPRM and then a final rule that implements the \nchanges WIOA makes to the public workforce system in regulations. Therefore, DOL seeks to develop and issue a \nNPRM that proposes to implement WIOA. The Department of Labor will issue regulations regarding the Section 188 \nNondiscrimination provisions through separate rulemaking.\n\nIV. Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposal\n\nA. Part 603\u2014Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program Disclosure of Confidential Unemployment \nCompensation Information Under WIOA Sec. 116\n\nRelationship Between 20 CFR Part 603 and WIOA\n\nThe Department is amending its regulations at 20 CFR part 603 to help States comply with the WIOA. WIOA \nrequires that States use \u201cquarterly wage records\u201d in assessing the performance of certain Federally-funded \nemployment and training programs.\n\n\n\nStates must make available performance reports for local areas and for eligible training providers (ETPs) under title \nI of the WIOA. WIOA also requires that States cooperate in evaluations, by the Departments of Labor and \nEducation, of State programs overseen by those Federal agencies.\n\nTo help States comply with these requirements, the Department has determined that it would be useful to more \nclearly and specifically, describe in unemployment compensation (UC) confidentiality regulations, the standards for \ndisclosure between the State UC, workforce, and education systems. This proposal amends current regulations to \nclarify, in a limited fashion, those State government officials with whom the State may share certain confidential \ninformation in order to carry out requirements under the law. The regulations enumerate certain additional public \nofficials who may access confidential State wage records that are the basis for the State's performance reporting. \nEnsuring such access to these State records would allow State agencies to better manage the information for the \npurpose of making Federally-required reports on certain program outcomes, and to cooperate more effectively and \nbe more informative with respect to Federal program evaluations.\n\nWIOA section (sec.) 116(i)(2) and proposed regulation \u00a7 677.175 (a) require State workforce, training, and \neducation programs to use quarterly wage records to measure the progress ofthe State on State and local \nperformance accountability measures. Under WIA, the Department interpreted the reference to \u201cquarterly wage \nrecords\u201d in sec. 136(f)(2) to require States to use the confidential UC information in the employer-provided wage \nreports collected under sec. 1137 of the Social Security Act (SSA), 42 U.S.C. 1320b-7. (See 20 CFR 677.175.) \nThese are the reports that the State UC agency obtains from employers for determining UC tax liability, monetary \neligibility, or for cross-matching against State UC agencies' files to determine if improper payments have been \nmade. The Department adheres to this interpretation in implementing WIOA sec. 116(i)(2).\n\nThe \u201cwage information\u201d defined in \u00a7 603.2(k)\u2014which the regulations allow State agencies to disclose under limited \ncircumstances\u2014includes the three data categories or elements (wages, SSN(s), employer information) that States \nmust use as their data source for State and local performance reporting under WIOA. The proposed WIOA \nimplementing regulation at 20 CFR 677.175 (b) defines \u201cquarterly wage record information\u201d to include three data \nelements or categories of data elements: (1) A program participant's SSN(s); (2) information about the wages \nprogram participants earn after exiting from the program; and (3) the name, address, State and (when known) the \nFederal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) of the employer paying those wages. The disclosure of such wage \nrecord data is governed by UC part 603 regulations, which establish requirements for maintaining the confidentiality \nof UC information along with standards for mandatory and permissive disclosure of such information.\n\nPart 603 permits State agencies to disclose confidential UC information\u2014including \u201cwage information\u201d\u2014to \u201cpublic \nofficials\u201d (defined at \u00a7 603.2(d)) under limited circumstances (defined under \u00a7 603.5), and authorizes such \u201cpublic \nofficials,\u201d in turn, to use the information to develop Federally-required performance reports.\n\nAs explained in greater detail below, the Department proposes changes to \u00a7 603.2 (definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d) and \n\u00a7 603.5 (governing disclosures to public officials), to help States comply with WIOA's performance requirements, \nincluding the performance reports of the States, local areas, and ETPs. In addition, the Department proposes to \namend \u00a7 603.6 to add a provision requiring disclosure to implement the new statutory requirement on State \ncooperation with certain DOL and ED evaluations. These changes would facilitate States' obligations to report on \nperformance through the use of quarterly wage records, and to cooperate in DOL and ED evaluations.\n\nThe amendments the Department is proposing to part 603 relate only to State agency disclosures necessary to \ncomply with certain provisions of WIOA. The Department is not proposing to redefine or expand the confidential \nState information\u2014the confidential wage records or wage information\u2014that is currently the basis for State \nperformance reporting, and is not proposing to reduce in any way the significant privacy protections and \nconfidentiality requirements that currently govern that information. The Department is not proposing to change any \nrequirements relating to the permissible or mandatory disclosure of confidential UC information for any other \npurpose, or addressing any general UC issues. We note, in particular, that nothing in these proposed regulations \nexempts disclosures made under these regulations from the safeguards and security requirements in \u00a7 603.9, the \nrequirements in \u00a7 603.10 governing agreements, or the requirements for payment of costs under \u00a7 603.8(a).\n\n\n\nThe Department invites comments on our proposed additions to part 603, but will not consider or address \ncomments on part 603 or other UC matters that are outside the scope of this NPRM.\n\nSection 603.2(d)(2)-(5)\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 603.2(d)(2)-(5) expand the definition of who and what entities are considered \u201cpublic officials\u201d for \npurposes of complying with WIOA's requirements. Currently, \u00a7 603.2(d) defines \u201cpublic official\u201d as \u201can official, \nagency, or public entity\u201d in the executive branch of government with \u201cresponsibility for administering or enforcing a \nlaw,\u201d or \u201can elected official in the Federal, State or local government.\u201d Proposed \u00a7 603.5(e) allows disclosure to \npublic officials who need the information to carry out their official duties. This exception allows State agencies that \ncollect \u201cwage information\u201d (including the data required for performance reporting under WIOA sec. 677.175) to \nprovide that information to the State agencies responsible for administering and reporting on the WIOA core \nprograms and mandatory one-stop partner programs. For example, State UC agencies, which are governed by part \n603, may disclose confidential UC information to the State adult basic education agency for purposes of performing \ntheir official duties, as used in \u00a7 603.5(e).\n\nThe proposed amendments to \u00a7 603.2(d) would clearly enumerate that \u201cpublic official\u201d includes officials from public \npost-secondary educational organizations, State performance accountability and customer information agencies, \nthe chief elected officials (CEOs) of local Workforce Development Areas (as that term is used in WIOA sec. 106), \nand a public State educational authority, agency, or institution. Proposed \u00a7 603.2(d)(2) would permit disclosure to \npublic post-secondary educational institutions, regardless of how those institutions are structured or organized \nunder State law. The regulation, as proposed, specifically mentions three categories of institutions. Proposed \u00a7 \n603.2(d)(2)(i) would permit disclosure to public post-secondary educational institutions that are part of a State's \nexecutive branch, i.e., derive their authority either directly from the Governor or from an entity (State Board, \ncommission, etc.) somewhere in that line of authority. Proposed \u00a7 603.2(d)(2)(ii) would permit disclosure to public \npost-secondary educational institutions that are independent of the State's executive branch, which means those \ninstitutions whose directors derive their authority either directly from an elected official in the State other than the \nGovernor or from an entity (again, a State Board, commission, or other entity) in that line of authority. Proposed \u00a7 \n603.2(d)(2)(ii) covers any public post-secondary educational institution established and governed under State law, \nfor example, a State Board of Regents. Proposed \u00a7 603.2(d)(2)(iii) would allow disclosure specifically to State \ntechnical colleges and community colleges. (Those institutions may also be covered under (i) or (ii))\n\nProposed \u00a7 603.2(d)(5) permits disclosure to a public State educational authority, agency or institution\u201d as the \nterms are used in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to clarify that the Department considers \nthe heads of public institutions that derive their authority from a State educational authority or agency to be \u201cpublic \nofficials\u201d for purposes of part 603.\n\nThe Department proposes these changes to help States comply with WIOA's requirement to use wage records to \nmeasure performance (WIOA sec. 116(i)(2)) and to facilitate the performance reporting required for ETPs under \nsecs. 116(d) and 122 of WIOA. WIOA mandates the use of wage records to measure State and local performance. \nAs long as the recipients of the data adhere to all of the requirements in 20 CFR part 603, this proposed \nsectionwould permit States to make these disclosures to comply with WIOA requirements for Federal, State, or \nlocal government reporting on program outcomes and for other specified purposes.\n\nNon-public educational institutions, including non-profit or for-profit educational institutions or other ETPs which are \nnot subject to the authority of the executive branch or another State elected official would not be permitted to obtain \nconfidential UC information, including wage information, under this authority because they are not public entities. \nAny disclosures of confidential UC information to those entities for purposes of complying with WIOA would have to \nbe authorized under the provisions of \u00a7 603.5 other than \u00a7 603.5(e). However, it is permissible and encouraged to \ndevelop processes or systems, such as the Wage Record Interchange System, to enable a State agency or State \neducational authority (including a State Education Agency) that collects wage records to match program participant \ndata with wage records, and to provide aggregate participant outcome data to non-governmental educational \nentities, including ETPs under title I of WIOA.\n\nSection 603.5(e)\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 603.5(e), as amended, would assist State workforce and State education programs in complying with \nWIOA, and in particular with WIOA's sec. 116 performance accountability responsibilities, by explicitly stating that \nconfidential UC information may be disclosed to a \u201cpublic official\u201d as defined in \u00a7 603.2(d)(2) for limited, specified \nWIOA purposes.\n\nProposed \u00a7 603.5(e), as amended, in conjunction with the revised definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d under 603.2(d)(2), \nwould enable State UC agencies to disclose confidential UC information to State and local agencies and other \npublic officials authorized to carry out their responsibilities under WIOA for performance accountability, including \naudits and evaluations of the programs and other required reporting of outcomes, as described in proposed \u00a7 \n603.2(d)(2). To enable States to comply with WIOA, State UI agencies, or other State agencies responsible for \ncollection of wage record information, must collaborate with the entities under WIOA that are required to use wage \nrecord data for performance to make the data available pursuant to part 603.\n\nThe Department notes that the proposed amendment to \u00a7 603.5(e) would permit disclosure to a public official for \npurposes of performance accountability of the entities on the State's eligible training provider list (ETPL). In \naddition, disclosure of confidential UC information for other programs' performance accountability purposes (e.g., \nTANF or SNAP) may be accomplished under existing \u00a7 603.5, as these entities are public officials and are \nperforming their public duty, as defined in this section.\n\nA new clause (iii) under proposed \u00a7 603.5(e) would permit disclosures \u201cas otherwise required for education or \nworkforce training program performance accountability and reporting under Federal or State law.\u201d The Department \nintends that this provision apply only in the limited instance where a Federal or State law requires performance \nreporting for which data covered by part 603 is needed in a way that is not covered by the other WIOA-specific \nprovisions. In those instances, this provision would permit a State agency to disclose confidential UC information to \na \u201cpublic official\u201d seeking the information to comply with that statute.\n\nSection 603.6(8)\n\nProposed \u00a7 603.6(8) makes the disclosure of confidential UC information for certain Federal evaluations mandatory \nwhen the disclosure would not interfere with the efficient administration of State UC law. The Department proposes \nthis change to \u00a7 603.6 to implement the requirement, under WIOA sec. 116(e)(4), that States cooperate, \u201cto the \nextent practicable,\u201d in the conduct of evaluations by either the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education. \nWIOA sec. 116(e)(4) defines cooperation to include \u201cthe provision of data (in accordance with appropriate privacy \nprotections established by the Secretary of Labor)\u201d; this includes 20 CFR part 603 and any other privacy protections \nthe Secretary may establish. The proposed new regulation at \u00a7 603.6(8) would implement these requirements for \npurposes of providing confidential UC information regulated by part 603. The new regulation would require \ndisclosure of confidential UC information to Federal officials, or their agents or contractors, requesting such \ninformation in the course of an evaluation covered by WIOA \u00a7 116(e)(4) and 116(e)(1), to the extent that such \ndisclosure is \u201cpracticable.\u201d\n\nIn these cases, the Department interprets \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d to mean that the disclosure would not interfere \nwith the efficient administration of State UC law. This standard is consistent with the standard the regulation applies \nto disclosures under \u00a7 603.5, in situations where the disclosure is permitted but a State must determine, first, that \nthe disclosure would not interfere with the efficient administration of State UC law. In effect, the proposed provision \nwould require that State UC agencies make disclosures to Federal education and labor agencies carrying out \nevaluations when it would not interfere with the efficient administration of the State UC law. The Department \nanticipates this cooperation and related disclosures would include responding to surveys and allowing site visits, as \nwell as disclosure of confidential UC information needed for the evaluation.\n\nB. Part 675\u2014Introduction to the Regulations for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Systems Under Title I of \nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\nProposed part 675 discusses the purpose of title I of the WIOA, explains the format of the regulations governing title \nI, and provides additional definitions which are not found and defined in the Act.\n\nProposed \u00a7 675.100 describes the purposes of title I of WIOA.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 675.200 outlines the structure of the proposed WIOA regulations.\n\nProposed \u00a7 675.300 provides a list of proposed definitions that are applicable across the WIOA regulations.\n\nIn addition to the definitions in the WIOA regulations and at secs. 3, 142, 166(b), 167(i), 170(a), 171(b), 203, 302, \nand 404 of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 675.300 provides additional definitions that apply to the programs and activities \nauthorized and funded under title I of WIOA.\n\nIncluded in this list of definitions, the Department proposes to adopt the following relevant definitions from the Office \nof Management and Budget's (OMB) \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards\u201d found at 2 CFR part 200: Contract, Contractor, Cooperative Agreement, \nFederal Award, Federal Financial Assistance, Grant Agreement, Non-Federal Entity, Obligations, Pass-Through \nEntity, Recipient, Subaward, Subrecipient, Unliquidated Obligations, and Unobligated Balance. All other definitions \nat 2 CFR part 200 apply to these regulations where relevant, but have not been included in this section.\n\nContract: The proposed definition for \u201ccontract\u201d incorporates the definition established by OMB at 2 CFR 200.22. \nSpecifically, the proposed term \u201ccontract\u201d refers to the legal document that a non-Federal entity uses to purchase \nproperty or services used to carry out its duties under a grant authorized under WIOA. If theDepartment determines \nthat a particular transaction entered into by the entity is a Federal award or subaward it will not be considered a \ncontract.\n\nContractor: The proposed definition of \u201ccontractor\u201d incorporates the definition contained in OMB's Uniform \nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.23. The Uniform Guidance has replaced the term \u201cvendor\u201d with the term \u201ccontractor.\u201d As \nused in these regulations, the term \u201ccontractor\u201d includes entities that the Act refers to as \u201cvendors.\u201d Additionally, it \nis important to note that contractors are not subrecipients. Additional guidance on distinguishing between a \ncontractor and a subrecipient can be found at 2 CFR 200.330.\n\nCooperative Agreement: The proposed definition of \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d incorporates the definition contained \nin the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.24.\n\nDepartment or DOL: This proposed term refers to the United States DOL, its agencies, and organizational units.\n\nEmployment and Training Activity: As used in these regulations, the proposed term \u201cemployment and training \nactivity\u201d refers to any workforce investment activities carried out for an adult or dislocated worker under sec. 134 of \nWIOA and 20 CFR part 678.\n\nEqual Opportunity (EO) Data: This proposed term refers to the data required by the Department's regulations at 29 \nCFR part 37 implementing sec. 188 of WIOA.\n\nETA: This proposed term refers to the ETA, an agency of DOL, or its successor organization.\n\nFederal Award: This proposed definition incorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.38.\n\nFederal Financial Assistance: The proposed definition of \u201cFederal financial assistance\u201d incorporates the definition \ncontained in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.40.\n\nGrant or Grant Agreement: The proposed definition of \u201cgrant agreement\u201d incorporates the definition contained in the \nUniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.51. Because both WIOA and these regulations use \u201cgrant\u201d and \u201cgrant agreement\u201d \ninterchangabily, the inclusion of both terms here clarifies that the terms are synonymous.\n\nGrantee: The proposed definition of \u201cgrantee\u201d refers to a recipient of funds under a grant or grant agreement. \nGrantees are also referred to as recipients in these regulations.\n\nIndividual with a Disability: This proposed definition adopts the definition from sec. 3 of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, as amended, and is further defined at 29 CFR 37.4.\n\n\n\nLabor Federation: This proposed definition remains unchanged from the definition used in the regulations under \nWIA at 20 CFR 660.300.\n\nLiteracy: The proposed definition for \u201cliteracy\u201d as used in these regulations is a measure of an individual's ability to \nparticipate and successfully function both in the workplace and in society.\n\nLocal Board: This proposed definition clarifies that the term \u201cLocal Board\u201d as used in these regulations refers to the \nLocal Workforce Development Boards established under sec. 107 of WIOA.\n\nNon-Federal Entity: The proposed definition of \u201cnon-Federal entity\u201d incorporates the definition contained in the \nDepartment's Exceptions to the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 2900.2.\n\nObligations: The definition of \u201cobligations\u201d incorporates the definition contained in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \n200.71.\n\nOutlying Area: The proposed term \u201coutlying area\u201d refers to those Territories of the United States which are not \nwithin the definition of \u201cState,\u201d including the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, and, in certain circumstances, the Republic of Palau.\n\nPass-through entity: The proposed definition of pass-through entity incorporates the definition in the Uniform \nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.74.\n\nRecipient: The proposed definition of \u201crecipient,\u201d which is different than the current definition of recipient under WIA \nat 20 CFR 660.300, incorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.86.\n\nRegister: The proposed definition of \u201cregister\u201d means the point at which an individual seeks more than minimal \nassistance from staff in taking the next step towards self-sufficient employment. This is also when information that is \nused in performance information begins to be collected. At a minimum, individuals must provide identifying \ninformation to be registered.\n\nSecretary: This proposed term refers to the Secretary of the U.S. DOL, or their officially delegated designees.\n\nSecretaries: This proposed term refers to the Secretaries of the U.S. DOL and the U.S. ED, or their officially \ndesignated designees.\n\nSelf-Certification: The proposed term \u201cself-certification\u201d refers to the certification made by an individual that they are \neligible to receive services under title I of WIOA.\n\nState: The proposed term \u201cState\u201d refers to each of the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, \nand the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nState Board: This proposed definition clarifies that the term \u201cState Board\u201d as used in these regulations refers to the \nState Boards established under sec. 101 of WIOA\n\nSubgrant or Subaward: This proposed term incorporates the definition of \u201csubaward\u201d in the Uniform Guidance at 2 \nCFR 200.92. This term replaces the term \u201csubgrant\u201d found in WIA at 20 CFR 660.300. Because both WIOA and \nthese regulations use \u201csubgrant\u201d and \u201csubaward\u201d interchangeably, the inclusion of both terms here clarifies that the \nterms are synonymous.\n\nSubrecipient: The proposed definition of \u201csubrecipient\u201d incorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \n200.93. This term is synonymous with the term \u201csubgrantee.\u201d\n\nUnliquidated Obligations: The proposed definition of \u201cunliquidated obligations\u201d incorporates the definition contained \nin the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.97.\n\nUnobligated Balance: The proposed definition of \u201cunobligated balance\u201d incorporates the definition in the Uniform \nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.98.\n\n\n\nWagner-Peyser Act: As used in these regulations, the proposed term \u201cWagner-Peyser Act\u201d refers to the Wagner-\nPeyser Act passed on June 6, 1933, and codified at 29 U.S.C. 49, et seq.\n\nWIA Regulations: The proposed term \u201cWIA Regulations\u201d as used in this regulation or subsequently by the \nDepartment refers to the regulations 20 CFR parts 660-672. This definition is necessary because, as described in \nthe introduction to these regulations, the Department has chosen to retain the WIA regulations at parts 660-672 of \ntitle 20 of the CFR.\n\nWIOA Regulations: This proposed term, as used in this regulation or generally by the Department means those \nregulations in 20 CFR parts 675 through 687, the Wagner-Peyser Act regulations in 20 CFR part 652, subpart C, \nand the regulations implementing WIOA sec. 188 in 29 CFR part 37.\n\nWorkforce Investment Activities: The proposed term \u201cworkforce investment activities\u201d is a general term that \ndescribes the broad array of activities and services provided to eligible adults, dislocated workers, and youth under \nsecs. 129 and 134 of title I of WIOA.\n\nYouth Workforce Investment Activity: The proposed term \u201cyouth workforce investment activity\u201d refers to those \nactivities carried out for eligible youth that fall within the broad definition of \u201cworkforce investment activity.\u201d\n\nC. Part 679\u2014Statewide and Local Governance of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity System Under Title I of \nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Subpart A\u2014State Workforce Development Board\n\nThis subpart A sets forth the conditions under which the Governor must establish the State Board.\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 679.100(a)-(e) explain the purpose of the State Board. The State Board represents a wide variety of \nindividuals, businesses, and organizations throughout the State. WIOA is designed to help job seekers and \nworkers access employment, education, training, and support services needed to succeed in the labor market, and \nmatch employers with the skilled workers needed to compete in the global economy. Further, the Department \nenvisions a State Board that takes leadership to ensure that the one-stop system in each State is customer driven. \nThe State Board can help lead this effort by aligning Federal investments in job training, integrating service delivery \nacross programs, and ensuring that the workforce system is job-driven and matches employers with skilled \nindividuals.\n\nThe Department envisions that the State Board will serve as a convener of State, regional, and local workforce \nsystem partners to enhance the capacity and performance of the workforce development system; align and improve \nemployment, training, and education programs, and through these efforts, promote economic growth.\n\nThe State Board must be a strategic convener that promotes partnerships and engages key stakeholders. This role \ncan only be accomplished if each State Board member is an active participant in the business of the board. State \nBoard members must establish a platform in which all members actively participate and collaborate closely with the \nrequired partners of the workforce development system, including public and private organizations. This \nengagement is crucial in the State Board's role to help integrate and align a more effective job-driven workforce \ninvestment system that invests in the connection between education and career preparation.\n\nSection 679.100What is the vision and purpose of the State Board?\n\nA key goal of Federally-funded training programs is to get more Americans ready to work with marketable skills and \nsupport businesses to find workers with the skills that are needed. The role of the State Board in achieving this \ngoal includes engaging employers, education providers, economic development, and other stakeholders to help \nthe workforce development system achieve the purpose of WIOA and the State's strategic and operational vision \nand goals outlined in the State Plan. The Department encourages the State Board to develop a comprehensive and \nhigh-quality workforce development system by working with its workforce, education, business, and other partners \nto improve and align employment, training, and education programs under WIOA.\n\n\n\nThe Department encourages the State to take a broad and strategic view when considering representatives of the \nState Board, and also in establishing processes which it will use to include necessary perspectives in carrying out \nState Board functions. For example, alignment of required one-stop partner investments is essential to achieving \nstrategic and programmatic alignment at the State, regional, and local level. Further, States are encouraged to \nexamine factors like the natural bounds of regional economies, commuting patterns, and how economic sectors \nimpact the State, which may benefit from inputs either from formal members of the board, or through other \nengagement. Further, a broad geographic representation as well as a reflection of diversity of populations within the \nState is critical.\n\nSection 679.110What is the State Workforce Development Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110 describes the membership requirements of the State Board. WIOA sec. 101(b) uses the terms \n\u201crepresentative\u201d and \u201crepresentatives\u201d in several places. In this section the Department interprets \u201crepresentatives\u201d \nto mean two or more individuals and \u201crepresentative\u201d as one individual.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(a) explains that States must establish State Boards in accordance to the requirements of \nWIOA sec. 101 and these regulations. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.200(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b) generally requires, in accordance with sec. 101(b)(2) of WIOA, that the State Board \nmembership represent the diverse geographic areas of the State. Employers' and workers' challenges and needs \ndiffer among the urban, rural, and suburban areas of the States due to demographics, labor market information and \nconditions, and business and worker needs and access to the workforce development system. Accordingly, the \nDepartment strongly encourages that each category of membership on the Board\u2014the members of the State \nlegislature, business representative, workforce and labor representatives, and State and local officials\u2014represent \nthe diverse geographic areas of the State to ensure that the workforce development system meets the education, \nemployment, and skill needs of workers, jobseekers, and businesses, no matter their location in the State.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(1) and (2) implement secs. 101(1)(A) and (B) of WIOA by requiring that the board include \nthe Governor of the State and one member of each chamber of the State legislature.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C), implementing sec. 101(b)(1)(C)(i) of WIOA, require the majority of \nState Board representatives to be from businesses or organizations in the State. These representatives must either \nbe the owner or chief executive of the business or be an executive with optimum policy-making or hiring authority \nas defined in proposed \u00a7 679.120. These representatives must also come from businesses or organizations that \nrepresent businesses which provide employment and training opportunities that include high-quality, work-relevant \ntraining, and development opportunities in in-demand industry sectors or occupations. Work-relevant and \ndevelopment opportunities may include customized training, registered apprenticeship, or OJT. Finally, the \nGovernor must appoint these members based on nominations from business organizations and trade associations \nin the State. The Department envisions that these members will be individuals that will be able to drive the board to \nalign the workforce investment, education, and economic development systems in support of a comprehensive, \naccessible, and high-quality workforce development system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(i)(D) requires, at a minimum, that one member of the State Board represent small \nbusiness as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Small businesses are a critical component of and \nmajor contributor to the strength of local economies and present new employment opportunities. The Department \nproposes to require a small business representative because the presence of at least one small business \nrepresentative on the State Board will allow the board as a whole to more readily receive the unique perspectives, \nexperiences, and needs of small businesses.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) require that not less than 20percent of the members of the State Board \nbe representatives of the workforce. Such representatives must include representatives from labor organizations \nand registered apprenticeship programs within the State, in accordance with sec. 101(b)(1)(ii). This provision \nmaintains WIA's emphasis and requirement that State Board representatives include members of the workforce \nand labor organizations. The Department anticipates that the inclusion of workforce and labor representatives will \n\n\n\nfoster cooperation between labor and management, strengthening the operation and effectiveness of the State \nworkforce development system. This proposed section also encourages representation from CBOs that have \ndemonstrated experience and expertise, as defined in proposed \u00a7 679.120, in addressing the employment, training, \nor education needs of individuals with barriers to employment across the State including organizations that serve \nveterans or that provide or support competitive, integrated employment for individuals with disabilities, and \norganizations that have demonstrated experience and expertise in addressing the employment, training, or \neducation needs of eligible youth, including organizations that serve OSY.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(iii)(A)(1) and (2), implementing WIOA sec. 101(b)(1)(iii)(I), require the Governor to \nappoint to the State Board representatives of government that include the lead State officials with primary \nresponsibility for each of the core programs and two or more CEOs that represent both cities and counties, where \nappropriate. The inclusion of State officials with primary responsibility for each of the core programs and CEOs on \nthe State Board is important so that they can support and improve the service delivery of each core program \nthrough their experience in workforce investment activities and positions as public leaders. This provision also \nrequires that where the State official with primary responsibility for a core program represents more than one core \nprogram, that official must ensure adequate representation on the State Board of the needs of all the core \nprograms under their jurisdiction. Additionally, the CEOs must be able to represent their geographic area such as \ntheir surrounding cities and counties in the area.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(iii)(B), in accordance with WIOA sec. 101(b)(1)(C)(iii)(II), allows the Governor to \ndesignate other representatives and officials to the Board, including but not limited to, representatives and officials \nsuch as State agency officials from agencies that are responsible for one-stop partners, State agency officials \nresponsible for economic development or juvenile justice programs, individuals who represent an Indian tribe or \ntribal organizations, and State agency officials responsible for education programs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(c), implementing sec. 101(c) of WIOA, requires the Governor to select a chairperson for the \nState Board from the business representatives on the board. This proposed section retains the same requirements \nfound at 20 CFR 661.200(g).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(d) requires the Governor to establish by-laws that help improve operations of the State \nBoard. Proposed \u00a7 679.110(d)(1) through (7) require that at a minimum the by-laws address the nomination \nprocess used by the Governor to select the State Board chair and members, term limitations and how the term \nappointments will be staggered to ensure only a portion of memberships expire in a given year, the process to notify \nthe Governor of a board member vacancy to ensure a prompt nominee, the proxy and alternative designee process \nthat will be used when a board member is unable to attend a meeting and assigns a designee, brokers relationships \nwith stakeholders, and any other conditions governing appointment or membership on the State Board as deemed \nappropriate by the Governor. In addition to these required elements, the Governor must include any additional \nrequirements in the board's by-laws that he or she believes is necessary to ensure the orderly administration and \nfunctioning of the board. An effective State Board establishes clear roles, responsibilities, procedures, and \nexpectations through its by-laws, and that these requirements will help State Boards to be more agile and proactive \nin reacting to board turnover, increase board participation when board members are not able to physically attend \nboard meetings, improve board functionality, and help ensure that the public is informed about the operation of the \nboard.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(e) requires, as a general condition of State Board membership, that members who represent \nthe non-business organizations, agencies, or other entities described in proposed \u00a7 679.110(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) have \noptimum policy-making authority. Because WIOA sec. 101(d) adds State Board functions, such as identifying and \ndisseminating information on best practices and developing and reviewing statewide policies affecting the \ncoordinated provision of services through the State's one-stop delivery system, all members, not just those \nrepresenting the business community, should have optimum policy-making authority to accomplish the purposes of \nWIOA and conduct the State Board required functions.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(f) implements the multiple-entity representation limitations for State Board members at WIOA \nsec. 101(b)(3). Robust representation in each of the categories is essential to ensure that the State Board benefits \nfrom the diversity and experience of board members.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(f)(1) explains that a State Board member may not represent more than one of the three \nmembership categories: Business representatives, workforce representatives, or government representatives. For \nexample, one member could not serve as a business representative and a joint labor-management apprenticeship \nprogram even if the member would otherwise satisfy the criteria for both categories.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(f)(2) explains that a State Board member may not serve as a representative of more than one \nsubcategory under (b)(3)(ii). Under this provision, a single board member could not serve as a representative of an \norganized labor organization and an apprenticeship program (or the optional subcategories) even if the member \nwould otherwise satisfy the criteria for either category.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(f)(3) prohibits a government representative from serving as a representative of more than one \nsubcategory under (b)(3)(iii). However, where a single government agency is responsible for multiple required \nprograms, the head of the agency may represent each of the required programs. In some instances, it would be \nappropriate and beneficial for one representative to represent multiple programs on the State Board. For example, \nthe head of a State Workforce Agency might represent both the WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser programs. This \narrangement could serve to improve integration of these two programs and/or help the State Board better achieve \nthe colocation requirements at WIOA sec. 123(c)(3). In other instances, such an arrangement would be less \nbeneficial. For example, where vocational rehabilitation services fall under the State Workforce Agency, appointing \na single representative to satisfy the membership requirements of WIOA title I, Wagner-Peyser, and vocational \nrehabilitation services may limit the voice and influence of a core program partner. The Department encourages \nGovernors to use discretionwhen appointing board members to represent multiple subcategories under (b)(3)(iii).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.110(g) requires that all required board members have voting privileges and allows the option for \nthe Governor to convey voting privileges to non-required members. All required board members must have a \nvoice in the State Board's decisions to ensure that the interests of all members of the community represented by \nthe required members are taken into account by the board. Requiring voting rights allows the required board \nmembers to have an effect on the State Board's key decisions and initiatives and enables the required board \nmembers to effectively represent the individuals and organizations of their communities. This proposed section also \npermits the Governor to grant voting privileges to the non-required members of the board, and the Department \nencourages the Governor to do so if doing so, in their opinion, would further the mission and goals of the board.\n\nSection 679.120What is meant by the terms \u201coptimum-policy-making authority\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated experience and \nexpertise\u201d?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.120(a) defines the term \u201coptimum policy-making authority\u201d as an individual who can reasonably be \nexpected to speak affirmatively on behalf of the entity he or she represents and to commit that entity to a chosen \ncourse of action. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.203(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.120(b) defines the term \u201cdemonstrated experience and expertise\u201d as an individual who has \ndocumented leadership in developing or implementing workforce development, human resources, training and \ndevelopment, or a core program function. WIOA sec. 101(d) adds new State Board functions, such as the \ndevelopment of strategies for aligning technology and data systems across one-stop partner programs to enhance \nservice delivery and improve efficiencies in reporting on performance accountability measures. This provision will \nensure that the State Board will include members that will assist the board in fulfilling these functions. The \nDepartment seeks public comment on how to further define \u201cdemonstrated experience and expertise\u201d and examples \nof the types of qualifications that would meet such a definition.\n\nSection 679.130What are the functions of the State Board?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130 implements sec. 101(d) of WIOA and describes the role and functions of the State Board. \nProposed \u00a7 679.130(a), (d) through (e), and (g) through (k) reiterate the relevant statutory requirements at secs. \n101(d)(1), (4)-(5), and (7)-(11). These functions are the primary functions of the State Board.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130 is consistent with WIOA's statutory requirement that the State Board must assist the Governor \nin the development, implementation, and modification of the 4-year State Plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(b) is consistent with WIOA sec. 101(d)(2) and reiterates the statutory requirements. The \nproposed regulation states the review of statewide policies, programs, and recommendations on actions that must \nbe taken by the State to align workforce development programs to support a comprehensive and streamlined \nworkforce development system. Such review of policies, programs, and recommendations must include a review \nand provision of comments on the State plans, if any, for programs and activities of one-stop partners that are not \ncore programs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(c)(1) through (7) are consistent with WIOA secs. 101(d)(3)(A) through (G) and reiterate \nWIOA's requirements that the State Board assist the Governor in development and continuous improvement of the \nState's workforce development system, including removing barriers to aligning programs and activities, developing \ncareer pathways to support individuals to retain and enter employment, developing customer outreach strategies, \nidentifying regions and designating local workforce areas, developing and continuously improving the one-stop \nsystem, and developing strategies to train and inform staff.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(d) and (e) reiterate statutory language requiring State Boards to assist in the development of \nState performance and accountability measures and to identify and disseminate best practices.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(f)(1) through (3) are consistent with WIOA secs. 101(d)(6)(A) through (C) to assist in the \ndevelopment and review of statewide policies on coordinated service provisions, which includes criteria for Local \nBoards to assess one-stop centers, allocation of one-stop center infrastructure funds, and the roles and \ncontributions of one-stop partners within the one-stop delivery system. In addition, it is important for the State Board \nto consult with CEOs and Local Boards when establishing objective criteria and procedures for Local Boards to use \nwhen certifying one-stop centers. Where Local Boards serve as the one-stop operator, the State Board must use \nsuch criteria to assess and certify the one-stop center to avoid inherent conflicts of interest in a Local Board \nassessing itself.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(g) through (k) reiterate statutory language requiring State Boards to assist in the \ndevelopment of strategies for technological improvements to improve access and quality of service, align \ntechnology and data systems across one-stop partner programs to improve service delivery and effectiveness in \nreporting on performance accountability, develop allocation formulas for distribution of adult and youth programs, \nand in accordance with WIOA and these regulations, prepare the annual report and develope the statewide WLMIS.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.130(l) is consistent with WIOA sec. 101(d)(12). This proposed regulation requires the State Board \nto assist the Governor in the development of other policies that promote statewide objectives and enhance the \nperformance of the workforce development system in the State.\n\nSection 679.140How does the State Board meet its requirement to conduct business in an open manner under \n\u201csunshine provision\u201d of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act sec. 101(g)?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.140 implements sec. 101(g) of WIOA, requires that the State Board conduct its business in an \nopen and transparent manner, and describes several pieces of information that the board is required to provide to \nensure transparency.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.140(b)(1) through (4) requires the State Board to make certain information available on a regular \nbasis to ensure that it is conducting its business in an open manner. Transparency promotes accountability and \nprovides valuable information to citizens on the Federal, State, and local government's activities. Therefore, the \nState Board must make available to the public on a regular basis, through electronic means and open meetings, \ninformation about State Board activities such as the State Plan, modifications to the State Plan, board \n\n\n\nmembership, the board's by-laws, the minutes of meetings. This information must be easily accessed by interested \nparties. Ensuring that this information is widely available promotes transparency andprovides access to the public \non how the State Board works to align, integrate, and continuously improve the workforce development system.\n\nSection 679.150Under what circumstances may the Governor select an alternative entity in place of the State \nWorkforce Development Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.150(a) and (b) implement the requirements of WIOA sec. 101(e)(1) and describe the \ncircumstances by which the Governor may select an alternate entity in place of a State Board. Paragraph (b) lists \nthe conditions that must be met if a State uses an alternative entity in place of the State Board and requires that \nthe entity meets the requirements of \u00a7 679.110.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.150 (c)(1) through (3) stipulate that if the alternative entity does not provide representatives for \neach of the categories required under WIOA sec. 101(b), the State Plan must explain the manner in which the \nState will ensure an ongoing role for any unrepresented membership group in the workforce development system. \nThe proposed section further requires that the State Board ensure that the alternative entity maintain a meaningful, \nongoing role for unrepresented membership groups, including entities carrying out the core programs, and to inform \nthe Board's actions.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.150(d) stipulates if the membership structure of the alternative entity had a significant change after \nAugust 7, 1998, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the State Board. In such a case, the \nGovernor must establish a new State Board which meets all of the criteria of WIOA sec. 101(b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.150 (e)(1) and (2) define a significant change in the membership structure which includes a change \nin the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which \nrequires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of \nthe alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. This \nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.210(e).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.150(f) stipulates all State Board references in 20 CFR parts 675 through 687 also apply to an \nalternative entity used by a State. This proposed section implements sec. 101(e)(2) of WIOA.\n\nSection 679.160Under what circumstances may the State Board hire staff?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.160 implements sec. 101(h) and describes the board's authority to hire staff. Per proposed \u00a7 \n679.160(c), the pay provided to the director and staff hired by the board is subject to the limitations on the payment \nof salary and bonuses described in WIOA sec. 194(15).\n\n2. Subpart B\u2014Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Local Governance (Workforce Development Areas)\n\nThe WIOA envisions a workforce development system that is customer-focused on both the job seeker and \nbusiness, and is able to anticipate and respond to the needs of regional economies. It requires Workforce \nDevelopment Boards and CEOs to design and govern the system regionally, aligning workforce policies and \nservices with regional economies and supporting service delivery strategies tailored to these needs. To support this \nregional approach, WIOA requires States to identify intrastate and interstate regions which may be comprised of \nmore than one local area, and requires local areas to plan regionally. WIOA envisions a regional system where not \nonly do local areas plan regionally, but workforce system leaders partner and provide leadership as part of \ncomprehensive, regional workforce and economic strategies. This subpart provides the requirements for \ndesignation of regions and local areas under WIOA.\n\nSection 679.200What is the purpose of a region?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.200 describes the purpose of requiring States to identify regions: to align workforce development \nresources to regional economies to ensure coordinated and efficient services to both job seekers and employers. \nWIOA requires States to establish regions in order to ensure that training and ES support economic growth and \nrelated employment opportunities and are meeting the skill competency requirements of the regions. The \ndevelopment of comprehensive regional partnerships facilitates alignment of workforce development activities with \n\n\n\nregional economic development activities, and better supports the execution and implementation of sector \nstrategies and career pathways. Regional cooperation may also lower costs and increase the effectiveness of \nservice delivery to businesses that span more than one local workforce development area within a region and to job \nseekers through coordination of shared services, processes, and operations. The Department encourages States \nto use these processes to identify any performance, fiscal, or planning challenges and to ensure that local and \nregional planning areas are aligned to support improved service delivery, improved training and employment \noutcomes, better meet employer needs, and greater effectiveness and efficiency in achieving these outcomes.\n\nSection 679.210What are the requirements for identifying a region?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210 outlines the requirements for identifying a region.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(a) requires that the Governor assign local areas to a region prior to the submission of the \nState Unified or Combined Plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(b) explains that the Governor must develop a policy for designation of a region prior to \nsubmission of the State Unified or Combined Plan, in order to receive WIOA title I-B adult, dislocated worker, and \nyouth allotments. The regional assignment is important because regional economic development areas do not \nnecessarily correspond to State, county, or local workforce development areas, or municipal boundaries.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(b) clarifies the required factors that a Governor must consider when identifying a region and \nthe parties the Governor must consult, implementing WIOA sec. 106(a)(1). The considerations for identifying a \nplanning region are consistent with those for local area designation outlined in proposed \u00a7 679.240(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(c) provides additional criteria the Governor may consider when identifying regions. These \nadditional criteria, which provide a more comprehensive picture of regional economies and labor markets, provide \nadditional data points to inform the Governor's decision to assign local areas to regions. However, the Department \nseeks comment on the appropriateness of these factors and requests suggestions of additional data points for \ndefining a regional economy and labor market.\n\nThe Department has included \u201cpopulation centers\u201d in proposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(1) because they and their contiguous \nareas of growth are a basic factor distinguishing economic development areas and planning regions.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(2) allows the consideration of \u201ccommuting patterns\u201d because commuting pattern data can \nshow the movement of workers from their residence to their workplace. Astrong flow of commuters from one local \narea, municipality, or county into another is an indication of the economic interdependence of the two areas.\n\n\u201cLand ownership\u201d is included in proposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(3) because land ownership can significantly affect the \neconomic development potential of an area.\n\n\u201cIndustrial composition\u201d has been proposed as a factor in \u00a7 679.210(c)(4) because it is primarily based upon \nindustry employment patterns. The factors used in determining regions could be jobs by industry and share of total \nemployment by industry.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(5) permits the Governor to consider \u201clocation quotients,\u201d which are ratios that could be \ncomputed by dividing a local area's percentage of employment in a particular industry by the State's percentage of \nemployment in a particular industry. The economic base of a local area includes those industries in which the local \narea has a higher proportion of employment than the State as a whole, or a higher location quotient. Adjacent local \nareas with similar economic bases are strong candidates for placement in the same region.\n\n\u201cLabor force conditions\u201d is proposed as a factor in \u00a7 679.210(c)(6). Local area labor force employment and \nunemployment data could provide a measure of labor availability throughout the State. Adjacent local areas with \nsimilar labor force characteristics, such as unemployment rates, might have similar workforce/economic \ndevelopment needs, thus joining those areas into a region may be beneficial.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(7) suggests that the Governor consider \u201cgeographic boundaries\u201d when setting regions \nbecause they may serve to facilitate or hinder the movement of people and commerce between areas, thereby \nnaturally delineating regional boundaries.\n\nFinally, proposed \u00a7 679.210(c)(8) indicates that the Secretary may suggest additional factors in future guidance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.210(d), implementing sec. 106(a)(2) of WIOA, outlines the types of regions and how local areas \nmay be assigned to regions. A region may consist of a single local area, two or more contiguous local areas with a \nState, or two or more contiguous local areas in two or more States. When the Governor(s) assigns two or more \nlocal areas to a region, the region, per WIOA sec. 3(48), is considered a planning region, which is required to \ncoordinate regional service strategies, regional sector initiatives, the collection and analysis of regional labor market \ndata, administrative costs, transportation, partnership with economic develop agencies, and the negotiation of local \nperformance consistent with the regional planning requirements at \u00a7 679.510. A single local area may not be split \nacross two planning regions. Local areas must be contiguous in order to be a planning region and effectively align \neconomic and workforce development activities and resources. The Department anticipates providing additional \nguidance regarding the creation and management of interstate planning regions.\n\nSection 679.220What is the purpose of the local workforce development area?\n\nDistinct from the regional designation, WIOA also provides for local workforce development areas. As described \nabove, these local areas may be identified individually or in combination, as regions. Proposed \u00a7 679.220 describes \nthe purpose of the local workforce development area (local area). The Governor must designate local areas in order \nto receive WIOA title I adult, dislocated worker, and youth allotments, as required by WIOA sec. 106. Local areas \nserve as a jurisdiction for the administration of workforce development activities and execution of adult, dislocated \nworker, and youth funds allocated by the State. States allocate workforce investment funds based on various \npopulation characteristics of the local area. Local areas may correspond to regions identified in WIOA sec. \n106(a)(1) or may be smaller geographic areas within a planning region, each with its own Local Workforce \nDevelopment Board.\n\nSection 679.230What are the general procedural requirements for designation of local workforce development \nareas?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.230 describes the procedural requirements that the Governor must use for the designation or \nredesignation of a local workforce development area. Proposed \u00a7 679.220 (a) through (c), implementing WIOA sec. \n106(b)(1)(A), requires the Governor to consult with the State Board and CEO, and consider public comments from \na wide range of stakeholders consistent with provisions at WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(e)(iii)(II) as part of the process of \nidentifying the local area. The Governor has the discretion to establish the process and procedures to solicit \ncomments that it determines appropriate; however a wide-reaching, inclusive process allows sufficient time for \nstakeholders to provide substantive comments that will enable the Governor to receive meaningful feedback from \nall interested stakeholders, ensuring that the Governor is able to consider all relevant information, data, and \nopinions before making a decision to designate or redesignate a local area.\n\nSection 679.240What are the substantive requirements for designation of local workforce development areas that \nwere not designated as local areas under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.240 provides the substantive requirements that Governor must use for the designation or \nredesignation of local workforce development areas.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.240(a) explains that the Governor must develop a policy for designation or redesignation of local \nworkforce development areas, including the factors that the Governor must consider. The statute requires that the \nGovernor designate local areas that \u201care consistent\u201d with labor market and regional economic development areas: \nThe Department interprets this to mean that within a local area, there must be common labor markets and \neconomic development areas. Better integration between the workforce and economic development systems \nserves to best connect the employment needs of workers with the skilled workforce needs of employers. This \nsection implements sec. 106(b)(1)(B) of WIOA.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.240(b) permits the Governor to approve a local area designation request from any unit of local \ngovernment, including a combination of multiple units. This provision implements sec. 106(b)(4) of WIOA and \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.250(c). Proposed paragraph (c) permits the Governor to \nredesignate a local area that has been designated or redesignated under \u00a7 679.240(a) or has been designated \nunder \u00a7 679.250(a) or (c) if the local area requests, and the Governor approves, the redesignation.\n\nSection 679.250What are the requirements for initial and subsequent designation of workforce development areas \nthat had been designated as local areas under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250 describes the requirements for initial and subsequent designation of local areas that had been \ndesignated as local areas under WIA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(a) implements sec. 106(b)(2) of WIOA that requires, during the first 2 full PYs following the \nenactment of WIOA, a Governor is to approve a request for initial designation from any local area designated as a \nlocal area under WIA as long as the entitywas designated a local area under WIA, performed successfully, and \nmaintained sustained fiscal integrity for 2 years prior to the enactment of WIOA. This provision requires the \nGovernor to continue the designation of local areas that performed well and maintained sound fiscal practices under \nWIA. If a local area that was designated under WIA requests initial designation under WIOA but does not meet all of \nthe requirements of \u00a7 679.250(a), the Governor has the discretion to approve the initial designation under WIOA or \nto redesignate the local area pursuant to the procedures described in \u00a7 679.240.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(b) clarifies that initial designation applies to PYs 2015 and 2016, as per WIOA sec. 106.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(c), in accordance with sec. 106(b)(3) of WIOA, describes the requirements for the subsequent \ndesignation of local workforce development areas that were initially designated under \u00a7 679.250(a). Specifically, the \nGovernor must approve requests for subsequent designation as long as the local area performed successfully, \nsustained fiscal integrity, and in the case of a local area in a planning region, met the planning region requirements \nduring the 2-year period of initial designation. Local areas that are able to demonstrate successful performance and \nfiscal integrity must be permitted to continue to operate and may not be redesignated without the consent of the \nLocal Board and CEO in the local area.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(d) describes the role of the Governor in reviewing a local area's subsequent designation. \nParagraph (d)(1) permits the Governor to evaluate a local area at any time to ensure the local area continues to \nmeet the requirements for subsequent eligibility at paragraph (c). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the Governor to review \nlocal areas to ensure they continue to satisfy the requirements at paragraph (2) as part of each 4-year State \nplanning cycle. Sections 116(g)(2)(A) and 184(b)(1) of WIOA describe the required actions that the Governor must \ntake in the event that a local workforce area fails to meet its negotiated levels of performance or does not comply \nwith administrative requirements, respectively. Under these provisions the Governor retains the authority to take \ncorrective action in light of failure of performance or fiscal management short of redesignation, and is not required \nto redesignate a local area that has failed to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c). Furthermore, the Governor \nmay redesignate local areas at any time with the cooperation of the CEO and Local Board in a given local area.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(e) presumes that local areas will be considered to have requested continued designation \nunless the CEO and the Local Board directly notify the Governor that they no longer wish operate as a local area. \nThis newly proposed paragraph reduces the administrative burden of maintaining local area status, while still \nholding local areas accountable to the requirements of paragraph (c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(f) specifies that the requirements for subsequent designation do not apply to local areas that \nare designated or redesignated under \u00a7 679.240 or are single-area States designated under \u00a7 679.270.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.250(g) clarifies that rural concentrated employment programs are not eligible to apply for initial \ndesignation as a local area. WIOA allows any unit of local government (or combination of units of local \ngovernment) to request designation as a local area; however, unlike under WIA, this provision does not extend to \nrural concentrated employment programs.\n\n\n\nSection 679.260What do the terms \u201cperformed successfully\u201d and \u201csustained fiscal integrity\u201d mean for purposes of \ndesignating local areas?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.260 defines the terms \u201cperformed successfully\u201d and \u201csustained fiscal integrity\u201d used in \u00a7 679.250. \nThis section implements sec. 106(e) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.260(a) defines the term \u201cperformed successfully\u201d for the purpose of initial designation to mean that \nthe local area met or exceeded all performance levels the Governor negotiated with Local Board and CEO under \nWIA sec. 136(c) for the last 2 full PYs before the enactment of WIOA. It also requires that the local area not fail any \nindividual measure for the last 2 consecutive PYs before the enactment of WIOA. Proposed \u00a7 679.260(a)(1) \nrequires the Governor, in order to determine if a local area has performed successfully, to have defined the terms \n\u201cmet or exceeded\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d at the time the performance levels were negotiated. Proposed \u00a7 679.260(a)(2) \nclarifies that the Governor may not retroactively apply any higher WIOA threshold to performance negotiated and \nachieved under WIA for the purposes of local area designation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.260(b) defines the term \u201cperformed successfully\u201d for the purpose of subsequent designation to \nmean that the local area met or exceeded the levels of performance the Governor negotiated with Local Board and \nCEO for core indicators of performance described at WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). It also requires the Governor to have \ndefined the terms \u201cmet or exceeded\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d in the State Plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.260(a) and (b) expand on the definition at WIOA sec. 106(e)(1) to ensure that the initial and \nsubsequent designation of local areas is conducted in a fair and transparent manner by ensuring that the local \narea's performance is judged on the contemporaneous standards agreed to between the State and local area at the \ntime rather than under subsequently imposed performance standards.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.260(c) defines the term \u201csustained fiscal integrity\u201d for the purpose of determining initial and \nsubsequent local area designation to mean that the Secretary has not made a formal determination that either the \ngrant recipient or any other entity charged with expending local area funds misexpended such funds due to willful \ndisregard of the requirements of the provision involved, gross negligence, or failure to comply with accepted \nstandards of administration for the 2-year period preceding the determination.\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 679.250 and 679.260 allow for an orderly transition from WIA to WIOA and protects the designation \nstatus of local areas that meet or exceed performance targets negotiated in good faith under the relevant \nauthorizing legislation while allowing the Governor both to oversee properly the performance of the local areas and \ntake action necessary to improve the area's performance in a timely fashion.\n\nSection 679.270What are the special designation provisions for single-area States?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.270 outlines the special designation provisions for single-area States. Under WIOA sec. 106(d), \nthe Governor of any single-area State under WIA may choose to continue to designate the State as a single-State \narea. However, proposed \u00a7 679.270(b) clarifies that the Governor must identify the single-area status of the State \nin its Unified or Combined State Plan and proposed \u00a7 679.270(c) further clarifies that the State Board in a single-\narea State must continue to carry out the functions of the State and Local Boards. This section is intended to clarify \nsingle-area States' responsibilities and functions: Key local functions, such as monitoring; entering into a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) with one-stop partners; selecting one-stop operators; selecting eligible \nproviders of youth activities, career services and training services; andcertifying one-stop centers, are essential to \nthe proper functioning of the public workforce system and remain so within single-area States.\n\nSection 679.280How does the State fulfill the requirement to provide assistance to local areas within a planning \nregion that wish to redesignate into a single local area?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.280 describes how the State fulfills the requirement to provide assistance to local areas within a \nplanning region that wish to redesignate into a single local area.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.280(a) asserts that the State must authorize statewide funds for transition activities when all local \nareas in a planning region petition the Governor for redesignation as a single local area as required by WIOA sec. \n106(b)(6). WIOA introduces redesignation assistance as a required statewide activity. This provision will help local \nareas consolidate where appropriate for the purposes of cost savings and streamlined service delivery.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.280(b) clarifies that when statewide funds are exhausted in a given PY, the State may fulfill the \nrequirement to provide redesignation assistance in the following PY. This section provides States with the flexibility \nto balance priorities while ensuring local areas receive redesignation assistance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.280(c) provides examples of the activities that local areas may elect to pursue with the \nredesignation assistance received from the State. However, the State may establish policy on what other activities \nlocal areas may use funds received for the purposes of redesignation or leave such determination to the local \nareas.\n\nSection 679.290What right does an entity have to appeal the Governor's decision rejecting a request for \ndesignation as a workforce development area?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.290 outlines the appeals process for an entity that submits a request for initial or subsequent \ndesignation as a local workforce development area that is rejected by the Governor. This section implements sec. \n106(b)(5) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.290(a) establishes that entities that are not approved as local areas may follow the process \nestablished at 20 CFR 683.640. This section is essentially unchanged from WIA. However, while provisions at \nWIOA sec. 106(b) permit any unit of local government or combination of units to apply for designation as a local \narea, the law does not specify that rural concentrated employment programs may apply for designation as a local \narea. The intent of this section was to prohibit such an arrangement under WIOA and that this prohibition logically \napplies to the appeals process.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.290(b) establishes that an entity making an unsuccessful appeal to the State Board may request a \nreview of the appeal by the Secretary of Labor if the State does not respond to the appeal in a timely manner or if \nthe appeal for designation is denied by the State. The Department defines a `timely manner' to be 60 days after the \nsubmission of the appeal. This provides adequate time for the State to review and make a ruling on the appeal \nwhile not being so long as to delay unreasonably the appeal and designation processes.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.290(c) summarizes the circumstances under which the Secretary of Labor may require an entity to \nbe designated as a local area. Specifically, the Secretary may require designation upon a finding of either a denial \nof procedural rights or a finding that the area meets the requirements for designation. This section was updated \nfrom WIA to reflect that neither the `automatic' nor `temporary and subsequent' designation statuses exist under \nWIOA.\n\n3. Subpart C\u2014Local Boards\n\nSection 679.300What is the vision and purpose of the Local Workforce Development Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.300 explains the purpose of the Local Board. The Local Board represents a wide variety of \nindividuals, businesses, and organizations throughout the local area. The Local Board serves as a strategic \nconvener to promote and broker effective relationships between the CEOs and economic, education, and workforce \npartners.\n\nThe Local Board must develop a strategy to continuously improve and strengthen the workforce development \nsystem through innovation in, and alignment and improvement of, employment, training, and education programs to \npromote economic growth. Local Board members must establish a platform in which all members actively \nparticipate and collaborate closely with the required and other partners of the workforce development system, \nincluding public and private organizations. This is crucial to the Local Board's role to integrate and align a more \neffective, job-driven workforce investment system.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.300(b)(1) and (2) outlines the purposes of the Local Board. A key goal of Federally-funded training \nprograms is to prepare job seekers ready to work with marketable skills. This includes providing strategic and \noperational oversight in collaboration with required and other partners to help the workforce development system \nachieve the purposes outlined in WIOA sec. 2, and assist in the achievement of the State's strategic and \noperational vision and goals outlined in the State Plan. The Local Board must work to develop a comprehensive \nand high-quality workforce development system by collaborating with its workforce and education partners to \nimprove and align employment, training, and education programs under WIOA.\n\nSection 679.310What is the Local Workforce Development Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310 defines the Local Workforce Development Board. Proposed \u00a7 679.310(a) explains that the \nCEO in each local area appoints the Local Board in accordance with WIOA sec. 107(b) and that the Governor must \ncertify the Local Board on a biannual basis. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.300(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310(b) describes that the Local Board sets policy within the local area in partnership with the CEO, \nconsistent with State policy. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.300(b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310(c), asserts that the CEO may enter into an agreement with the Local Board that describes the \nrespective roles and responsibilities of the parties. However, the CEO remains liable for funds received under title I \nof WIOA unless they reach an agreement for the Governor to act as the local grant recipient and bear such liability. \nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.300(c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310(d) describes that the Local Board, in partnership with the CEO, are responsible for the \ndevelopment of the local plan. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.120(d).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310(e) affirms that in local areas with more than one unit of general local government, the CEOs \nof the respective units may execute an agreement to describe their responsibilities for carrying out their roles and \nresponsibilities. If the various parties cannot come to an agreement, the Governor may appoint the Local Board. \nThis proposed section retains thesame requirements found at 20 CFR 661.300(3).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.310(f) indicates that in single-State areas, the State Board must fulfill the functions of the Local \nBoard, which the Department also required under the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 661.300(f). As required by WIOA \nsec. 107(c)(4)(B)(iii), the proposed section clarifies that the State is not required to establish or report on local \nperformance measures. This clarification presents a logical approach to local performance because the local area \nperformance will be reflected in the State performance reports.\n\nProposed paragraph (g) requires the CEO to establish by-laws, consistent with State policy, that help improve \noperations of the Local Board. Proposed \u00a7 679.310(g)(1) through (7) require that at a minimum the by-laws \naddress the nomination process used by the CEO to elect the Local Board chair and members, term limitations and \nhow the term appointments will be staggered to ensure only a portion of memberships expire in a given year, the \nprocess to notify the CEO of a board member vacancy to ensure a prompt nominee, the proxy and alternative \ndesignee process that will be used when a board member is unable to attend a meeting and assigns a designee, \nthe use of technology to improve board functions, brokers relationships with stakeholders, and any other conditions \ngoverning appointment or membership on the Local Board as deemed appropriate by the CEO. In addition to these \nrequired elements, the CEO must include any additional requirements in the board's by-laws that it believes is \nnecessary to ensure the orderly administration and functioning of the board. An effective Local Board establishes \nclear roles, responsibilities, procedures, and expectations through its by-laws, and that these requirements will help \nLocal Boards to be more agile and proactive in reacting to board turnover, increase board participation when board \nmembers are not able to physically attend board meetings, improve board functionality, and help ensure that the \npublic is informed about the operation of the board.\n\nSection 679.320Who are the required members of the Local Workforce Development Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320 explains that the CEO in a local area must appoint a Local Workforce Development Board and \nprovides guidelines on requirements and options for the CEO to follow in appointing members to the Local Board.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(b) requires that a majority of the Local Board members must represent businesses as per \nWIOA sec. 107(b)(2)(A). Business representatives include owners, chief executive or operating officers, and other \nbusiness executives, including small businesses, and business organizations. As reflected in proposed paragraph \n(b)(2), WIOA requires that business representatives on the Local Board must represent business that provide \nemployment opportunities in in-demand industry sectors or occupations as defined in WIOA sec. 3(25). Employers \nwith employment opportunities in high-growth sectors are uniquely suited to communicate the emerging workforce \nneeds of employers in these high-growth, in-demand sectors to the Local Board.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(c) explains the required and optional member categories that must make up at least 20 \npercent of the Local Board membership representing labor organizations, or where they do not exist, employee \nrepresentatives. Proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) require that the Local Board must include two or more \nrepresentatives of labor organizations (or other employee representatives if there are no labor organizations \noperating in the local area) and one or more representatives of a joint-labor management registered apprenticeship \nprogram (or other registered apprenticeship program if there is no joint labor-management program in the local \narea). The use of the word `representatives' with respect to labor organization membership indicates a requirement \nfor two or more members. In areas with joint apprenticeship programs, the apprenticeship representative must be a \nmember of a labor organization or a training director.\n\nIn addition to these required members, proposed paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) explain that the CEO may appoint one \nor more representatives of CBOs with experience in addressing the employment needs of individual barriers to \nemployment including organizations that serve veterans or that provide or support competitive integrated \nemployment for individuals with disabilities, and one or more representative of organizations with experience \naddressing the employment needs of WIOA-eligible youth, including serving OSY. While not mandatory, the two \nrepresentative categories in proposed paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) count towards reaching the 20 percent threshold. \nProposed \u00a7 679.320(c) underscores both the importance of registered apprenticeship, a proven training strategy \nthat effectively meets the needs of both employers and workers, (1) and the role of organized labor in workforce \ndevelopment, particularly in developing registered apprenticeship programs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(d)(1) and (2) describe the entities required to be on the board to provide an adult education \nperspective and representation. These sections require that Local Boards include a minimum of one member with \nexperience providing adult education and literacy activities under title II of WIOA and at least one member from a \nhigher education institution, which may include community colleges, that provides workforce training.\n\nProposed paragraph (d)(3) sets forth the statutory requirement that a minimum of one Local Board member must be \nincluded from each of the following organizations: Economic or community development organizations, the State \nES Office under Wagner-Peyser serving the local area, and programs carried out under title I of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 720, et seq.) other than sec. 112 or part C of that title.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(e) provides examples of other appropriate optional members of the board. In addition to the \nentities described in (e)(1) through (3), proposed paragraph (e)(4) explains that the CEO may appoint other \nindividuals to the board at his or her discretion. This provides the CEO the flexibility to assemble a Local Board that \nconnects all key resources and stakeholders.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(f) requires that Local Board members possess optimum policy-making authority in the \norganizations they represent. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.315(c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(g) explains the nomination criteria for business and labor representatives, as well as \nrepresentatives of adult education and literacy activities under title II when there are multiple institutions providing \nthese services in a local area. These nomination requirements are unchanged from the requirements at 20 CFR \n661.315(e), however, a formal policy ensures that business and labor organizations are provided the opportunity to \nprovide input on board member selection. When there is more than one local area provider of adult education and \nliteracy activities under title II, or multiple institutions of higher education providing workforceinvestment activities as \ndescribed in WIOA 107(b)(2)(C)(i) or (ii), the CEO must solicit nominations from those particular entities. This \nrequirement provides for a representative selection process for these membership categories.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(h) explains that an individual may be appointed as a representative of more than one entity if \nthe individual meets all the criteria for representation, including the criteria described in paragraphs (c) through (g) \nof this section, for each entity. While such \u201cmultiple entity\u201d representation may not be appropriate in all cases, the \nDepartment proposes to allow an individual to represent more than one entity, because there may be instances \nwhen such representation may be an effective tool for reducing board size while still ensuring that all entities \nentitled to representation receive effective representation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.320(i) explains that all required board members must have voting privileges and that the CEO may \ngive voting privileges to non-required members. Voting rights allow the required board members to have an effect \non the Local Board's key decisions and initiatives. This will enable the required board members to effectively \nrepresent the individuals and organizations of their communities.\n\nSection 679.330Who must chair a Local Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.330 affirms that the Local Board must elect a chairperson from the business representatives on the \nLocal Board. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.320.\n\nSection 679.340What is meant by the terms \u201coptimum policy-making authority\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated experience and \nexpertise\u201d?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.120 explains what is meant by \u201coptimum policy-making authority\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated experience \nand expertise\u201d for members of the Local Board under sec. 107(b)(5) of WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a) defines an \nindividual with \u201coptimum policy-making authority\u201d as someone who can reasonably be expected to speak \naffirmatively on behalf of the entity he or she represents and to commit that entity to a chosen course of action. In \norder for the decisions of the board to have the greatest possible impact, all board members must be able to speak \nauthoritatively when committing their organization to a decided course of action.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) define the qualifications that satisfy the \u201cexperience and expertise\u201d \nrequirement for Local Board members. The CEO has a duty to appoint only those board members that have the \nskills and practical knowledge to contribute fully to the strategic vision of the local area's workforce system.\n\nSection 679.350What criteria will be used to establish the membership of the Local Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.350 affirms that the CEO appoints the Local Board in accordance with the criteria in WIOA sec. \n107(b) and applicable State criteria. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.325.\n\nSection 679.360What is a standing committee, and what is its relationship to the Local Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.360 establishes the roles and responsibilities of standing committees within the Local Board \nstructure. Such committees were not legislated in the past, are optional under WIOA, and may be used to assist the \nLocal Board in carrying out its responsibilities as outlined in WIOA sec. 107. The Department encourages the use of \nstanding committees to expand opportunities for stakeholders to participate in board decision-making, particularly \nfor representatives of organizations that may no longer sit on the Local Board but continue to have a stake in the \nsuccess of board decisions. Such committees also expand the capacity of the board in meeting required functions.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) expressly authorizes Local Boards to establish standing committees that include \nindividuals who are not formal members of the board, but who have expertise to advise on issues that support the \nboard's ability to attain the goals of the State, local and regional plans, and the objective of providing customer-\nfocused services to individuals and businesses. The subpart provides examples of areas where standing \ncommittees may be particularly beneficial, including serving targeted groups of customers such as individuals with \ndisabilities and youth, and addressing one-stop system issues.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) provides for Local Board discretion in terms of what kinds of standing committees, in any, \nthe Local Board creates.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (c) allows Local Boards to designate an entity in existence on the date that WIOA was \nenacted, such as an effective youth council, to fulfill the requirements of a standing committee as long as the entity \nmeets the requirements outlined in paragraph (a).\n\nSection 679.370What are the functions of the Local Board?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.370 provides the functions of the Local Boards as enumerated in statute. Under WIOA, the Local \nBoard, in partnership with the CEO, must perform a variety of functions to support the local workforce system. Many \nof these functions have been expanded and enhanced under WIOA. Proposed \u00a7 661.305(a), (c), (d), (g), (h), (j), (o), \nand (p) reiterate the relevant statutory requirements at WIOA secs. 107(d)(1) through (3), (6), (7), (9), (12), and \n(13); no further discussion of these provisions is provided below.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) discusses a new role for Local Boards that are part of a planning region that includes \nmultiple local areas. This regulation repeats the new statutory requirement that Local Boards that are part of a \nplanning region must develop and submit a regional plan in collaboration with the other Local Boards in the region. \nUnder WIOA, the local plan is incorporated into the regional plan, where required, in accordance with \u00a7 679.540.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) explains the role of the Local Boards in engaging employers, promoting business \nrepresentation on the board, and developing and implementing proven or promising strategies for meeting the \nneeds of employers and workers (like industry or sector partnerships) and providing linkages and coordination \namong employers and the workforce system. It enhances the Local Board's role in engaging employers beyond \nwhat was required by WIA by requiring the board to develop and implement promising strategies for meeting the \nemployment skill needs of workers and employers. Engaging employers presents an opportunity to meet the \nlocal area's labor market and workforce development needs and connect customers seeking jobs or career \nadvancement to greater employment prospects.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) requires the Local Board to connect with representatives of secondary and post-secondary \neducation programs in the local area in order to develop and implement career pathways. This regulation supports \nthe statute's focus on career pathways.\n\nProposed paragraph (i) enhances the oversight role of the Local Board beyond what was required in WIA. It \nrequires the Local Board to conduct oversight, in partnership with the CEO, of the use and management of funds, \nincludingensuring the appropriate management and investment of funds to maximize performance outcomes under \nWIOA sec. 116.\n\nProposed paragraph (k) requires that the Local Board must negotiate with CLEO and required partners on the \nmethods for funding the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in the local area in accordance with \u00a7 678.715. This \nprovision ensures each partner in the one-stop system is provided resources equitably.\n\nProposed paragraph (l) also expands and enhances the Local Board's role in the selection of eligible service \nproviders in the local area which must be conducted consistent with 2 CFR part 200. The regulation maintains the \nboard's role in the identification of eligible providers of youth workforce investment activities, but now requires, \nconsistent with WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(B), that this identification be accomplished through the award of grants or \ncontracts on a competitive basis. It also adds that the recommendations of the youth standing committee, if one is \nestablished, must be taken into account. It also indicates that the Local Board must identify eligible providers of \ncareer services through the award of contracts, if the one-stop operator does not provide such services. This \nprovision does not impact those services provided by State merit staff. The final proposed expansion in this subpart \nis the requirement that Local Boards select one-stop operators through the competitive process described in \u00a7\u00a7 \n678.600 through 678.635.\n\nProposed paragraph (m) describes the requirement that the Local Board work with the State to ensure that there \nare sufficient numbers and types of providers of career and training services in the local area so that consumer \nchoice and opportunities for employment for individuals with disabilities are maximized.\n\nProposed paragraph (n) reflects a number of new functions for the Local Board related to coordination with adult \neducation and literacy providers in the local area. The regulation requires the Local Board to review applications to \n\n\n\nprovide adult education and literacy activities under title II to determine whether such applications are consistent \nwith the local plan. It also requires the board to make recommendations to the eligible agency to promote \nalignment with the local plan. Further information regarding Local Board coordination with adult education and \nliteracy providers is provided at 34 CFR 463 which requires the eligible agency to establish in its competition, a \nprocesses by which applicants must submit an application to the Local Board for review prior to its submission to \nthe eligible agency. This subpart also includes a role for the board in replicating and implementing cooperative \nagreements in accordance with subparagraph (B) of sec. 101(a)(11) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \n721(a)(11)), and implementing cooperative agreements in accordance with that section with the local agencies \nadministering plans under title I of that Act (29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.) (other than sec. 112 or part C of that title (29 \nU.S.C. 732, 741) to enhance the provision of services to individuals with disabilities and other individuals.\n\nProposed paragraph (q) requires the Local Board to certify one-stop centers in accordance with \u00a7 662.600.\n\nSection 679.380How does the Local Board satisfy the consumer choice requirements for career services and \ntraining services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.380 describes how the Local Board satisfies the consumer choice requirements for career services \nand training services. While WIA required the Local Board to maximize consumer choice for training services, \nconsumer choice for career services is a new requirement under WIOA. Clarification of the board's role will \nminimize confusion for one-stop managers and frontline staff.\n\nProposed paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) describe the process of how the Local Board assists the State Board in \nidentifying providers, ensures a sufficient number of providers, and provides performance and cost information \nthrough the one-stop system.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) describe how the Local Board satisfies the requirement to provide consumer \nchoice for career services. In general, the Local Board must decide which services are best provided by the one-\nstop operator and which services may require a contracted provider. Furthermore, these paragraphs require the \nboard to identify a wide range of services based on the needs in the local area with special attention to services for \nindividuals with disabilities and literacy services. Requiring the board to identify a wide array of potential career \nservice providers, while still allowing the board to ultimately determine the career service providers, balances board \nflexibility and customer choice. There is no requirement to provide customers with a choice of providers for a given \ncareer service.\n\nSection 679.390How does the Local Board meet its requirement to conduct business in an open manner under the \n\u201csunshine provision\u201d of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.390 maintains the Local Board's requirement to conduct business in an open manner, but expands \non the scope of what the public must be made aware of and requires that information be shared by electronic \nmeans as well as through open meetings as provided for in WIOA sec. 107(e). These new requirements facilitate \nthe transparent functioning of the board and contribute to smoother board operations. This can only be \naccomplished by each Local Board member actively participating during Local Board meetings, and by developing \neffective by-laws that outline the nomination process, which includes steps for a prompt nominee during a vacancy, \nterm limitations, and encourage the use of technology and active participation.\n\nSection 679.400Who are the staff to the Local Board and what is their role?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.400 describes the Local Board's authority to hire staff and the appropriate roles for board staff. \nThis proposal clarifies and differentiates the staff's role and requires the Local Board to hire only qualified staff.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) authorizes the board to hire a director and other staff. The volunteer board may not have \nthe capacity to fulfill the required board functions at WIOA sec. 107(d). Board support ensures these functions are \nachieved.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) requires the board to apply objective qualifications to the board director. It is in the best \ninterest of the public workforce system to ensure the director of the board is competent and experienced with \nworkforce programs and service delivery.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (c) limits the board staff's role to assisting the board fulfill the functions at WIOA sec. 107(d) \nunless the entity selected to staff the board enters into a written agreement with the board and CEO as noted in \nparagraph (e) and described more fully in \u00a7 679.430 of this part. The reasons that the Department proposes to \nrequire a written agreement if the staff provide functions outside of those in WIOA sec. 107(d) are discussed in the \npreamble to \u00a7 679.430 of this part.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) requires Local Boards that elect to hire a director to establish objective qualifications to \nensure that the selected candidate possesses the knowledge and skills toassist the board in carrying out its \nfunctions.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) limits the payment of the Local Board director and board staff to the basic pay rate for level \nII of the Executive Schedule under sec. 5313 of title 5, U.S.C. This requirement ensures that board staff are \ncompensated at a reasonable level.\n\nSection 679.410Under what conditions may a Local Board directly be a provider of career services, or training \nservices, or act as a one-stop operator?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.410 explains the situations in which the Local Board may directly act as a one-stop operator, a \nprovider of career services or training services. Proposed \u00a7 679.410(a)(1)(i) and (ii) establishes that a Local Board \nmay act as a one-stop operator where a Local Board successfully participates in a competition or if the board meets \nthe criteria for sole source procurement. Under both circumstances, as required by proposed \u00a7 679.410(a)(2), \nimplementing WIOA sec. 107(g)(2), the Governor and CEO must agree to such selection. This clarifies the \ninteraction between sec. 122(d)(2)(A) of WIOA, which requires that Local Boards select a one-stop operator \nthrough a competitive process, and WIOA sec. 107(g)(2), which states that a Local Board can be designated as a \none-stop operator only with the agreement of the Governor and CEO in the local area. One interpretation of sec. \n107(g)(2) is that Local Boards, with approval of the Governor and CEO, could be selected as one-stop operators \nwithout undergoing a competitive process. However, such a non-competitive selection is only appropriate after a \ncompetitive process has been conducted as required by WIOA sec. 122(d)(2)(A). The Department welcomes \ncomments regarding this interpretation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.410(a)(3) also requires that where a Local Board acts as a one-stop operator, the State must \nensure certification of one-stop centers. Local Boards are required to certify one-stop centers; however, States \nmust fulfill that role when a Local Board acts as a one-stop operator to avoid conflicts of interest with a Local Board \ncertifying its own performance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.410(b) provides that a Local Board may act as a provider of career services only with the \nagreement of the CEO in the local area and the Governor. The Department interprets WIOA sec. 107(g)(2) to \noperate as a general exception from the requirement that the Local Board award contracts to providers of career \nservices consistent with 2 CFR part 200. A Local Board acting as a direct provider of services is not optimal, as the \nLocal Board is designed to oversee the one-stop system and its services, not provide them. However, unlike the \nselection of one-stop operators, which are statutorily required to be competitively selected, there is no similarly \nclear statutory requirement for providers of career services. Therefore, the Department does not propose to require \nthat a competition fail before the Local Board may provide career services.\n\nProposed 679.410(c) specifies that a Local Board is prohibited from providing training services unless the Governor \ngrants a waiver in accordance with WIOA sec. 107(g)(1). Proposed \u00a7 679.410(c)(1) requires the State to develop a \nprocedure to review waiver requests received from Local Boards and the limitations of the waiver that incorporates \nthe criteria listed at WIOA sec. 107(g)(1)(B)(i). While WIA contained provisions for a similar waiver, it did not include \nany such criteria. The intent of this waiver is to provide the option for Local Boards to provide training services in \nextenuating circumstances only, such as rural areas with limited training providers. A formal procedure facilitates \ntransparency and clarity regarding the criteria for the training waiver and ensures that any Local Board that applies \nis subject to the same criteria. Furthermore, the new criteria underscore that the waiver is not appropriate for local \nareas that have a robust network of training providers.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.410(c) indicates that the local area must make the request to be designated as a training provider \navailable through public comment for a period of 30 days or more and include those comments in the local area's \nfinal request to the State. The proposed section also outlines the timeline for approval and Governor's authority to \nrevoke a waiver if the Governor determines it is no longer needed or the Local Board demonstrates a pattern of \ninappropriate referrals. This proposed section helps ensure that the local area is acting in good faith when asserting \nthat there are insufficient providers in the local area and protects against a conflict of interest.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.410(d) affirms that the general prohibitions that apply to Local Boards directly providing career \nservices or training services also apply to board staff.\n\nSection 679.420What are the functions of the local fiscal agent?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.420 describes the role of the local fiscal agent when the CEO in a local area elects to designate a \nfiscal agent. While the term `fiscal agent' was widely used under WIA, the term was never defined, which led to \ninconsistent understanding of their role and function throughout the workforce system. This section clarifies the role \nof a fiscal agent to create a common understanding of that role.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) describes that the CEO or the Governor, where the Governor serves as the local grant \nrecipient for a local area, may designate an entity to serve as a local fiscal agent.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) provides a list of the key functions of a fiscal agent. The appropriate role of fiscal agent is \nlimited to accounting and funds management functions rather than policy or service delivery. Proposed fiscal agent \nfunctions include those listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) and (c) provide additional potential functions for \nsingle State areas. The Department requests comment from State and local stakeholders regarding appropriate \nfunctions for a fiscal agent.\n\nSection 679.430How do entities performing multiple functions in a local area demonstrate internal controls and \nprevent conflict of interest?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.430 clarifies how entities performing multiple functions in a local area demonstrate internal controls \nand prevent conflict of interest. This proposed provision requires a written agreement with the Local Board and \nCEO when a single entity operates in more than one of the following roles: Local fiscal agent, Local Board staff, \none-stop operator, or direct provider of career services or training services. The proposed paragraph clarifies how \nthe organization will carry out its responsibilities while demonstrating compliance with WIOA and corresponding \nregulations, relevant OMB circulars, and the State's conflict of interest policy. While it may be appropriate in some \ninstances for a single organization to fulfill multiple roles, a written agreement between the Local Board, CEO, and \nthe organization fulfilling multiple roles is the best method to limit conflict of interest or the appearance of conflict of \ninterest, minimize fiscal risk, and develop appropriate firewalls within a single entity performing multiple functions.\n\n4. Subpart D\u2014Regional and Local Plan\n\nWIOA provides designated regions and local workforce areas the responsibility and opportunity to develop \nemployment and training systems tailored specifically to regional economies. These systems must meet the needs \nof the full range of learners and workers, including those withbarriers to employment. The system must also \naddress the specific needs of regional employers and the skills they require. WIOA requires the Local Board, in \npartnership with the CEO, to submit a local plan to the Governor. If the local area is part of a planning region, the \nLocal Board will submit its local plan as part of the regional plan and will not submit a separate local plan. The local \nor regional plan provides the framework for local areas to define how their workforce development systems will \nachieve the purposes of WIOA. The regional or local plans serve as 4-year action plans to develop, align, and \nintegrate the region and local area's job-driven workforce development systems, and provides the platform to \nachieve the local area's visions and strategic and operational goals. Since the local plan is only as effective as the \npartnerships that operationalize it, it must represent a collaborative process among local elected officials, boards, \nand required and other partners (including economic development, education, and private sector partners) to \ncreate a shared understanding of the local area's workforce investment needs, a shared vision of how the workforce \ninvestment system can be designed to meet those needs, and agreement on the key strategies to realize this \nvision.\n\n\n\nSection 679.500What is the purpose of the regional and local plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.500 describes the purpose of the regional and local plans. Proposed \u00a7 679.500(a)(1) through (4) \nexplain that the local plan is the primary vehicle for communicating the Local Board's vision for the local workforce \nsystem and aligning and integrating local service delivery across Federal programs in a region to foster better \nalignment of Federal investments in job training, integrate service delivery across programs, and ensure that the \nworkforce system is job-driven and matches employers with skilled individuals. Proposed \u00a7 679.500(b) clarifies that \nwhen a State-designated region encompasses two or more local areas, the regional plan must meet the purposes \nof the local plan and coordinate resources across the region and across local areas. This approach is intended to \nalign resources between multiple Local Boards.\n\nSection 679.510What are the requirements for regional planning?\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 679.510, 679.520, and 679.530 describe the required contents of the regional plan, the approval \nprocess, and when the regional plan must be modified. While sec. 106(c) of WIOA clearly describes the required \ncontents of the regional plan, it provides less detail about the approval and modification process, saying only that \nofficials in the planning region must \u201cprepare, submit, and obtain approval\u201d of the plan. Because the local plan is a \ncomponent of the regional plan, the Department has decided to apply the approval and modification requirements, \nincluding the requirement to seek public comment and sunshine provision, to the regional plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.510 implements sec. 106(c) of WIOA and describes the State and local requirements for regional \nplanning. Proposed \u00a7 679.510(a)(1) requires Local Boards and CEOs to participate in a regional planning process. \nIn some instances, where a single local workforce development area comprises a region, the local area will carry \nout its planning in this context.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.510(a)(2) describes the regional plan contents and submission process. The Local Boards and \nCEOs must submit a regional plan to the Governor for approval that includes the activities listed at proposed \u00a7 \n679.510(a)(1) and incorporates the local plans developed for each local area. Local areas are not required to \nsubmit an additional local plan outside of the regional planning process. The coordination required for regional \nplanning is an effective method for local areas to identify areas of efficiency, coordinate effective practices, and \nstreamline service delivery. While the regional plan requires coordination of local performance negotiations with the \nState, each CEO, as required by \u00a7 677.210(b) and (c) will negotiate performance goals with the State and will \nremain ultimately responsible for ensuring that the local area meets or exceeds those goals.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.510(b) requires Local Boards to make the regional plan available for comment before submitting \nthe plan to the Governor and describes the steps necessary to ensure adequate public comment. This requirement \nprovides all affected entities and the public an opportunity to provide input to inform plan development.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.510(b)(5) specifically requires the public comment process to be consistent with the `sunshine \nprovisions' at WIOA sec. 107(e), which requires that the Local Boards must make the plan available through \nelectronic means and open meetings. This requirement ensures greater transparency in the planning process, and \nencourage regions to consider efforts to maximize the transparency and inclusiveness of the process.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.510(c) requires the State to provide technical assistance and labor market data to facilitate \nregional planning. Because States possess a broader understanding of labor market information across \njurisdictions and tools for analysis that individual local areas may not possess, States have a responsibility to \nprovide and instruct local areas on the effective use of regional labor market information.\n\nSection 679.520What are the requirements for approval of a regional plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.520 describes the approval of the comprehensive 4-year regional plan. This section requires that \nthe Governor review completed plans and stipulates that unless the Governor determines that any of the conditions \ndescribed in proposed paragraphs (a) through (c) are met the plan will be considered approved 90 days after \nsubmission of the plan to the Governor.\n\nSection 679.530When must the regional plan be modified?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.530 describes when a regional plan must be modified. Proposed \u00a7 679.530(a) requires the \nGovernor to establish procedures governing regional plan modification, which will help ensure that the biannual \nmodification of regional plans is conducted consistently throughout the State.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.530(b) explains that the Local Boards and appropriate CEOs in the planning region must review \nthe regional plan every 2 years and submit a modification based on significant changes in labor market and \neconomic conditions and other factors including changes to local economic conditions, and any changes in the \nfinancing available to support WIOA title I and partner-provided WIOA services. This proposed requirement helps \nensure that planning regions use their plans to drive economic development, sector, career pathway, and customer-\nfocused service delivery strategies.\n\nSection 679.540How are local planning requirements reflected in a regional plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.540 outlines how local planning requirements are reflected in a regional plan. WIOA is silent on the \ncoordination of the regional and local plan, noting only that the regional plan must \u201cincorporate local plans for each \nof the local areas in the planning region.\u201d The Department has determined that the most appropriate and least \nburdensome approach to implementing this provision is to incorporate the local plans within the regional plan. In \nthis arrangement, the regional plan is completed incooperation with the Local Boards and CEOs in a planning \nregion, per \u00a7 679.510(a). Each individual Local Board and CEO will respond to the local planning requirements at \u00a7 \n679.560(b) through (e) individually. The Local Boards and CEOs in a planning region must cooperate to develop a \ncommon response to the local planning requirements that discuss regional labor market information, as required by \n\u00a7 679.540(a), and any other appropriate requirements permitted by the Governor per \u00a7 679.540(b). When these \nactivities are completed, the planning region submits one regional plan to the Governor that includes the common \ndiscussion of regional labor market information and other requirements as required by the Governor, as well as \neach local plan in a single document.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.540(a) requires regional plans to include the items identified in \u00a7\u00a7 679.510 and 679.560, which \nimplement secs. 106(c)(1) and 108(b) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.540(b) specifies the Governor may issue regional planning guidance that allows local areas to \nprovide a common response to any local requirements it deems as a shared regional responsibility, which may \ninclude regional economic analysis. The Department recognizes there are many planning requirements and \nencourages Governors to minimize the individual local area burden by reducing duplication and encouraging a \ncoordinated service delivery strategy.\n\nSection 679.550What are the requirements for the development of the local plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.550 explains the requirements for the development of the local plan. This section emphasizes the \nimportance of collaboration and transparency in the development and submission of the local plan and subsequent \nmodifications.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.550(a) implements sec. 108(a) of WIOA and describes the general requirements for the \npreparation and content of the local plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.550(b) requires Local Boards to make the local plan available for comment before submitting the \nplan to the Governor and describes the steps necessary to ensure adequate public comment. This requirement \nprovides all affected entities and the public an opportunity to provide input to inform plan development. This section \nimplements sec. 108(d) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.550(b)(5) requires the public comment process to be consistent with the `sunshine provisions' at \nWIOA sec. 107(e) and proposed \u00a7 679.390 and that the Local Board must make the plan available through \nelectronic means and in open meetings. This requirement ensures transparency to the public. This provision \nimplements sec. 107(e) of WIOA.\n\nSection 679.560What are the contents of the local plan?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560, consistent with sec. 108(b) of WIOA, explains what information must be included in the local \nplan. These requirements set the foundation for WIOA principles, by fostering strategic alignment, improving service \nintegration, and ensuring that the workforce system is industry-relevant, responding to the economic needs of the \nlocal workforce development area and matching employers with skilled workers. In addressing these planning \nrequirements, boards engage strategic partners to develop and implement regionally aligned workforce \ndevelopment priorities and streamlined service delivery. Local and regional planning also is expected to lead to \ngreater efficiencies by reducing duplication and maximizing financial and human resources. WIOA significantly \nexpands the content requirements for the local plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(a)(1) specifies that the local plan must meet the requirements of WIOA sec. 108(b)(1). Of \nrelevance to this section, the use of economic and labor market information ensures that the local strategies are \nbased on a thorough understanding of the economic opportunities and workforce needs of the region, and inform \nthe alignment of strategies to the best interests of job seekers and employers with the economic future of the \nState. Similarly, the contents of the plan must include an analysis of the workforce development activities in the \nregion, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such services to address the identified education \nand skill needs of the workforce and employment needs in the region. A thorough assessment of the best available \ninformation or evidence of effectiveness and performance information for specific service models in the region, as \nwell as a plan to improve the effectiveness of such programs by adopting proven or promising practices, is an \nimportant part of this assessment and strategic vision. In addition, the regional analyses described in this proposed \nsection may be conducted in cooperation with the other local areas in a local planning region as part of the regional \nplanning requirements described at \u00a7 661.290 and must not be conducted by each local area.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(a)(1)(iii), consistent with sec. 108(c) of WIOA permits local areas to use an existing analysis to \nmeet the requirements in \u00a7 679.560(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b) outlines the required contents of the local plan that are required by secs. 108(b)(2)-(21) of \nWIOA to ensure that a local plan presents a comprehensive, customer-focused, and actionable service delivery \nstrategy. This section emphasizes alignment and coordination to a greater extent than that required by WIA. \nExcept where noted, the requirements outlined in \u00a7 679.560(b)(2) through (21) simply reiterate the statutory \nrequirements without additional explanation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(2) requires elaboration on the strategies for alignment by requiring that the Local Board \ndescribe how such alignment will improve access to services and to activities that lead to a recognized post-\nsecondary credential. Proposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(2)(ii) explains that the Local Board must describe how they will work \nwith entities carrying out core programs to facilitate the development of career pathways and co-enrollment, as \nappropriate, in core programs. Co-enrollment allows partners to leverage resources, while providing a more \ncomprehensive service delivery strategy that meets the needs of customers with several barriers to employment. \nAdditionally, coordination of services in a customer-focused manner minimizes the possibility of subsequent reentry \ninto the public workforce system in cases where needed services were not provided or possible barriers not \naddressed.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(4) explains that the Local Board must describe how they will coordinate local workforce \ninvestment activities with regional economic development activities that are carried out in the local area and how \nthe Local Board will promote entrepreneurial skills training and microenterprise services. Alignment between the \npublic workforce system and local economic development activities is critical in order to identify and fulfill industry \ntalent needs by training customers for emerging and in-demand job skills. Furthermore, microenterprise services \nrefers to training for the purposes of self-employment. This training strategy may be appropriate for individuals or \nparticipants with multiple barriers to employment, including persons with disabilities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(5) focuses on the delivery of services through the one-stop delivery system in the local \nareaand requires descriptions regarding how the Local Board will ensure the continuous improvement of eligible \nproviders of services, including through the promotion of proven and promising approaches and evaluation; how the \nLocal Board will facilitate access to services, including in remote areas, through the use of technology and other \nmeans; how entities within the one-stop delivery system, including one-stop operators and the one-stop partners, \n\n\n\nwill comply with WIOA sec. 188, if applicable, and applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) regarding physical and programmatic accessibility; and the roles and resource \ncontributions of the one-stop partners. WIOA, and the corresponding regulations at \u00a7 678.420, establishes the roles \nof one-stop partners. These include providing access to the partner's programs through the one-stop system; \nmaking program funds available to maintain the one-stop delivery system, including infrastructure costs; providing \napplicable career services; entering into a MOU with the Local Board regarding one-stop operation; ongoing \nparticipation in the one-stop system; and providing representation on State and Local Workforce development \nboards as required and Board committees as needed. Additionally, one-stop partners are responsible for sharing \ninfrastructure and career services costs. Documenting how one-stop partners will manage their shared roles and \ncontribute to the funding of the one-stop in the local plan increases accountability and transparency.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(6) through (11) focus on coordination activities for improving services and avoiding \nduplication. Proposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(11) reflects a new statutory requirement not contained in WIA that the local \nplan include plans, assurances and strategies for maximizing coordination with Wagner-Peyser Act services and \nother services provided through the one-stop system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(12) and (13) are also new requirements under WIOA. Proposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(12) speaks to \ncoordination with adult education and literacy activities under title II of WIOA and requires a description of how the \nLocal Board will carry out the review of local applications submitted under title II. Proposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(13) is \nintended to enhance the provision of services to individuals with disabilities through cooperative agreements, as \ndefined in WIOA sec. 107(d)(11), and other collaborative efforts between the Local Board and the local VR entity. \nAll such collaborative efforts must be described in the local plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(16) requires the Local Board to include local levels of performance that the board has \nnegotiated with the Governor in the local plan. Additionally, this section proposes that the local plan must include \nthe standards, process, or performance measures that the Local Board will use to evaluate the performance of the \nlocal fiscal agent where the CEO has designated such an entity. These proposed requirements increase \ntransparency and public accountability, while helping ensure the Local Board has the information it needs to ensure \nsustained fiscal integrity of public funds.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(19) maintains the requirement that the local plan include a description of the process used \nby the Local Board to provide for public input into the development of the plan and for public comment on the \ncompleted plan prior to its submission. Unlike WIA, this regulation identifies the 30-day timeframe for public \ncomment prior to submission of the plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(20), new to WIOA, requires a description of how the one-stop centers are implementing \nand transitioning to an integrated, technology-enabled intake and case management information system for \nprograms carried out under WIOA and by one-stop partners.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(b)(21) requires that the plan include the process by which priority of service must be applied \nby the one-stop operator, but also clarifies that such priority is for adult career and training services and must be \ngiven to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient. \nThe Department is proposing to include this requirement under the authority to require additional reporting, \nrecordkeeping, and investigations. Including the priority service policy in the local plan will help ensure a more \nuniform application of the policy throughout the local area.\n\nAs permitted by sec. 108(b)(22) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 679.560(c) requires that the plan include any additional \ninformation required by the Governor.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(d) recommends that the local plan identify the portions of the local plan that the Governor has \ndesignated as appropriate for common response among all local areas in a planning region, as per the regulations \nat 20 CFR 679.540.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.560(e) reflects the requirement in WIOA sec. 108(e) that any comments submitted during the \npublic comment period that represent disagreement with the plan must be submitted with the local plan.\n\n\n\nSection 679.580When must the local plan be modified?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.580(a) requires the Governor to establish procedures governing local plan review and modification \nto ensure that the biannual review and modification of local plans is conducted consistently throughout the State.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.580(b) explains that the Local Board and appropriate CEOs must review the local plan every 2 \nyears and submit a modification as needed, based on significant changes in labor market and economic conditions \nand other factors including changes to local economic conditions, changes in the financing available to support \nWIOA title I and partner-provided WIOA services, changes to the Local Board structure, or a need to revise \nstrategies to meet performance goals. This requirement is consistent with WIOA sec. 108(a). This proposed \nrequirement helps ensure that local areas use their plans to drive service delivery strategies and the activities the \nlocal area is performing remains consistent with the plan.\n\nSection 679.570What are the requirements for approval of a local plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.570 describes the approval of the comprehensive 4-year local plan. Proposed \u00a7 679.570(a) \nrequires that the Governor review completed plans and stipulates that unless the Governor determines that the \nconditions described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) are met the plan will be considered approved 90 days after \nsubmission of the plan to the Governor. This section implements sec. 108(e) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.570(b) outlines the processes, roles, and responsibilities for situations in which the State is a single \nlocal area. Proposed \u00a7 679.570(b)(1) clarifies the State must incorporate the local plan in the State's Unified or \nCombined State Plan submitted to DOL. Proposed \u00a7 679.570(b)(2) states that the Secretary of Labor will perform \nthe roles assigned to the Governor as they relate to local planning activities. Proposed \u00a7 679.570(b)(3) indicates the \nSecretary of Labor will issue planning guidance for single area States. This section implements sec. 106(d) of \nWIOA.\n\nThe Department recognizes that the development of the local plan is dependent on several other essential State \nand local WIOA implementation activities and that local areas may not beable to respond fully to each of the \nrequired elements of the local plan in the timeframe provided. The Department seeks comment on the scope of the \nchallenges local areas may face regarding regional and local planning, and potential actions that the Department \ncan take to help local areas address these challenges.\n\n5. Subpart E\u2014Waivers/WorkFlex (Workforce Flexibility Plan)\n\nThis subpart describes the statutory and regulatory waiver authority provided by WIOA sec. 189(i), and the \nrequirements for submitting a Workforce Flexibility Plan under WIOA sec. 190. WIOA provides States the flexibility \nto request a waiver of program requirements in order to implement new strategic goals for the improvement of the \nstatewide workforce development system and to provide better customer service in exchange for accountability for \nexpected programmatic outcomes. A Workforce Flexibility plan provides additional flexibility to the State. In general, \na State with an approved Workforce Flexibility plan is given the authority to identify local level provisions to waive \nwithout further approval from the Secretary of Labor to achieve outcomes specified in the plan.\n\nA description of what provisions of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser may and may not be waived is included, along with \nan explanation of the procedures for requesting a waiver. The subpart also describes what may and may not be \nwaived under a Workforce Flexibility Plan, and the procedures for obtaining approval of a plan. The WIOA \nrequirements for obtaining approval for a waiver or Workforce Flexibility Plan are similar to those in WIA secs. \n189(i) and 192, respectively; therefore, many of the proposed regulations are the same as the regulations \nimplementing WIA.\n\nSection 679.600What is the purpose of the General Statutory and Regulatory Waiver Authority in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.600(a) explains that the purpose of the general statutory and regulatory waiver authority, provided \nunder WIOA sec. 189(i)(3), is to provide flexibility to States and local areas to enhance their ability to improve the \nstatewide workforce investment system to carry out WIOA's goals and purposes.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.600(b) explains that a waiver may be requested to address impediments to a strategic plan that is \nconsistent with the purposes of title I of WIOA, which are identified at \u00a7 675.100(a) through (h).\n\nSection 679.610What provisions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the Wagner-Peyser Act may \nbe waived, and what provisions may not be waived?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.610(a) implements WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A)(i), and explains that the Secretary may waive for a \nState or local area any of the statutory or regulatory requirements of WIOA title I, subtitles A, B, and E, except for \nthe requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (12). As noted in this section, the purposes of title I of WIOA \nare described at 20 CFR 675.100(a) through (h). The Department will provide examples of requirements that it will \nnot waive in subsequently issued guidance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.610(b) follows WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A)(ii), and explains that the Secretary may waive the statutory \nor regulatory requirements of Wagner-Peyser secs. 8 through 10, except for the requirements listed in paragraphs \n(b)(1) and (2).\n\nSection 679.620Under what conditions may a Governor request, and the Secretary approve, a general waiver of \nstatutory or regulatory requirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(a) through (f) implements WIOA sec. 189(i)(3) and describes the conditions under which a \nGovernor may request, and the Secretary may approve a waiver of statutory or regulatory requirements.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(a) explains that the Secretary will issue guidelines on waiving WIOA and Wagner-Peyser \nrequirements. States will be required to follow the Secretary's guidelines, which supplement the requirements \nlisted in 20 CFR 679.600 through 679.620. The guidelines will be issued contemporaneously with State planning \nguidance. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.420(f).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(b) explains that the Governor may request a general waiver in consultation with the \nappropriate CEOs by submitting a waiver plan which accompanies the State's WIOA 4-year Unified or Combined \nState Plan, 2-year modification, or by directly submitting a waiver plan at any time after a State's WIOA Plan is \napproved. This approach is consistent with WIOA secs. 102 and 103, which require the State to submit either a 4-\nyear Unified or Combined State Plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(c) explains that a Governor's waiver request may seek waivers for the entire State or for one \nor more local areas within the State. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.420(b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(d) lists the required components of a waiver plan for the improvement of the statewide \nworkforce development system and includes the requirements of WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(B). Specifically, the plan must \nidentify the statutory or regulatory requirements that are requested to be waived, and the goals that the State or \nlocal area intend to achieve as a result of the waiver. The plan must also describe the actions that the State or local \narea has taken to remove State or local statutory or regulatory barriers; the goals of the waiver and the expected \nprogrammatic outcomes if the waiver is granted; the individuals affected by the waiver; and the processes used to \nmonitor the progress in implementing the waiver, provide notice to any Local Board affected by the waiver, and \nprovide any Local Board affected by the waiver an opportunity to comment on the request.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(d)(1) requires that the waiver plan explain how the goals of the waiver relate to the Unified or \nCombined State Plan. Waivers must support State strategies as enumerated in the State Plan. Waivers are not \nseparate or detached from the Unified or Combined State Plan: An approved waiver constitutes a modification of \nthe State Plan.\n\nAdditionally, as required by \u00a7 679.620(d)(4), the waiver plan must describe how the waiver will align with the \nDepartment's priorities, such as supporting employer engagement, connecting education and training strategies, \nsupporting work-based learning, and improving job and career results. The Department's priorities may change and \nevolve to reflect major changes in the economy, changes in the needs of the workforce, and new developments in \nservice strategy approaches. This new requirement ensures that the Department is issuing waivers that align with \n\n\n\nand help achieve the priorities of the Department. As noted in \u00a7 679.620(d)(4)(v), a more complete list of current \npriorities will be articulated in future guidance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(d)(5) requires the waiver plan to generally describe the individuals affected by the proposed \nwaiver. This section specifically requires that the plan describe how the waiver will impact services for \ndisadvantaged populations and individuals with multiple barriers to employment. One of the primary purposes of \nWIOA is to increase and enhance education, employment, andtraining opportunities for individuals with barriers to \nemployment, including low-income individuals, individuals with disabilities, the Native American population, and the \nother groups identified in sec. 3(24) of the Act. The Department has added this specific requirement to ensure that \nthe State, as part of its waiver request, considers the employment and training needs of these groups and how the \nproposed waiver would affect these populations.\n\nAn additional requirement at proposed \u00a7 679.620(d)(6)(iv) is that the plan must describe the processes used to \nensure meaningful public comment, including comment by business and organized labor. This requirement was \nincluded to ensure as transparent a process as possible, to make sure that the public is given an opportunity to \nvoice their concerns or support of potential changes in the public workforce system, while the Governor is afforded \nan opportunity to reflect on the opinions of the public before proceeding with a waiver request. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.420(c)(5)(iv).\n\nThe Governor must also describe, per \u00a7 679.620(d)(6)(v), the process used to collect and report information about \nthe goals and outcomes achieved under the waiver plan in the State's WIOA Annual Report. The Department \napproves waivers in order to assist States and local areas in achieving goals and outcomes that will improve the \nstatewide workforce development system. This collection and reporting requirement holds States accountable for \nthe goals and outcomes to be achieved with the approved waivers and provides a regular and public assessment of \nthe effectiveness of States and local areas in doing so.\n\nFinally, proposed \u00a7 679.620(d)(7) explains that if a waiver is up for renewal, the Secretary may require that States \nprovide the most recent data available about the outcomes achieved under the existing waiver. This requirement \nwill ensure that the Department has the most recent, relevant information before deciding whether to renew a \nwaiver. As part of its decision the Department may take other factors into account when deciding to renew or deny a \nwaiver.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(e) specifies that the Secretary will issue a decision on a waiver request within 90 days of the \nreceipt of the waiver, consistent with WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(C).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(f) implements the requirements of WIOA secs. 189(i)(C)(i) and (ii), and explains that the \nSecretary will approve a waiver request only to the extent that the Secretary determines that the requirements for \nwhich a waiver is requested impede the ability of either the State or local area to implement the State's plan to \nimprove the statewide workforce investment system, and the State has executed a MOU with the Secretary \nrequiring the State to meet, or ensure that the local area meets, agreed-upon outcomes and to implement other \nappropriate measures to ensure accountability. This section also makes approval of the waiver contingent on the \nSecretary's determining that the waiver plan meets all of the requirements of WIOA sec. 189(i)(3) and \u00a7\u00a7 679.600 \nthrough 679.620. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.420(e), except that \nthe statutory reference has changed from sec. 189(i)(4) to sec. 189(i)(3).\n\nConsistent with current practice, proposed \u00a7 679.620(g) authorizes the Secretary to approve a waiver for as long as \nthe Secretary determines is appropriate; however, the duration of the waiver may not exceed the duration of a \nState's current Unified or Combined State Plan. For example, a waiver granted during the third year of the Plan \nwould have to be reconsidered as part of the subsequent plan submission and approval cycle, at the latest. By \nlimiting the duration of the waiver, the Department will be able to ensure that the waiver is consistent with the goals \nof the State's plan and remains consistent with the priorities of the Department.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.620(h) gives the Secretary the authority to revoke a State's waiver under certain circumstances. \nThe Secretary has an obligation to oversee the implementation and performance of States under their State plan, \nincluding any waivers granted by the Department. As part of this responsibility, the Department proposes to allow \n\n\n\nthe Secretary to revoke a waiver granted under this section if the State fails to meet the agreed upon outcomes and \nmeasures, the State fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the MOU or other document that includes the \nterms and conditions of the waiver, and if the Secretary determines that the waiver no longer meets any of the \nrequirements of \u00a7\u00a7 679.600 through 679.620. Limiting the Secretary's authority to revoke to these circumstances \nbalances the State's need for flexibility with the Secretary's duty to oversee the implementation of the waiver.\n\nSection 679.630Under what conditions may the Governor submit a Workforce Flexibility Plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630 describes the conditions under which the Governor may submit a workforce flexibility (work-\nflex) plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(a) includes the requirements of WIOA sec. 190(a), and explains that a State may submit a \nworkforce flexibility plan for approval by the Secretary, under which three categories of statutory or regulatory \nrequirements can be waived.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(a)(1), implementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(1), permits a State to waive any of the statutory or \nregulatory requirements that are applicable to local areas under WIOA title I (if the local area requests the waiver), \nexcept for the requirements listed in proposed paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv). In addition to the statutory \nexceptions, this proposed section adds the requirement that any of the statutory provisions essential to WIOA's title \nI purposes cannot be waived.\n\nThe second category, described in proposed \u00a7 679.630(a)(2), and implementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(2), explains that \nany of the statutory or regulatory requirements applicable to the State under Wagner-Peyser Act secs. 8 through 10 \nmay be waived, except for requirements listed at \u00a7 679.630(a)(2)(i) and (ii). This proposed section retains the same \nrequirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(a)(2).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(a)(3), implementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(3), permits waiver of the statutory or regulatory \nrequirements applicable under the Older Americans Act of 1965 to State agencies on aging with respect to \nactivities carried out using funds allotted under sec. 506(b) of the Older Americans Act, except the for requirements \nidentified at \u00a7 679.630(a)(3)(i) through (iv).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b) explains what States are required to include in their workforce flexibility plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(1) and (3) implement the requirements at WIOA sec. 190(b)(1), and specify that a State \nworkforce flexibility plan must include a description of the process by which local areas in the State may submit and \nobtain State approval of applications for waivers, and the requirements of title I of WIOA that are likely to be waived \nby the State under the plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(2) adds the requirement that the plan include a description of the criteria that the State will \nuse to approve local area waiver requests and how such requests support implementation of the goals identifiedin \nthe State plan. These criteria must be addressed in the waiver review process discussed at \u00a7 679.630(b)(1). This \nrequirement ensures that all local waiver requests are evaluated consistently by the State.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(4) implements the requirements of WIOA sec. 190(b)(2) and requires a description of the \nWagner-Peyser Act secs. 8 through 10 that are proposed for waiver, if any. This proposed section retains the same \nrequirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(c)(3).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(5) implements the requirements of WIOA sec. 190(b)(3) and requires a description of the \nrequirements of the Older Americans Act that are proposed for waiver, if any. This proposed section retains the \nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(c)(4).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(6) implements the requirements of sec. 190(b)(4) of WIOA by requiring that the plan \ndescribe the outcomes to be achieved by the waivers. The section explains that \u201coutcomes\u201d include, when \nappropriate, revisions to adjusted levels of performance included in the State or local plan under WIOA title I, and a \ndescription of the data or other information the State will use to track and assess outcomes. This provision allows \nthe Department to measure more effectively the impact of waivers. For some waivers, it may be difficult to make a \n\n\n\ndirect connection between the waiver and a direct impact on performance; in those instances the State must \ndiscuss the impact of a waiver on performance to the extent that the State has available data.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(b)(7) implements WIOA sec. 190(b)(5) and requires that the plan include the measures to be \ntaken to ensure appropriate accountability for Federal funds in connection with the waivers. This proposed section \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(b)(6).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(c) explains that a State's workforce flexibility plan may accompany the State's Unified or \nCombined State Plan, the required 2-year modification of the State's Unified or Combined State Plan, or may be \nsubmitted separately as a plan modification. This requirement emphasizes that the State may submit a workforce-\nflexibility plan at any time.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(d) explains that the Secretary may approve a workforce flexibility plan consistent with a period \nof approval of the State's Unified or Combined State Plan, and not more than 5 years. For example, if a workflex \nplan is approved in the third year of a 4-year Unified Plan, the approval would be for the remainder of the period \ncovered by the plan and then would need to be reconsidered as part of the subsequent Unified Plan or Combined \nPlan. Approving a workforce flexibility plan for the life of a currently approved Unified or Combined State Plan \nensures that the waivers granted under the plan are consistent with the strategies outlined in the State Plan. The \nperiod of up to 5 years is consistent with sec. 190(c) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(e) implements WIOA sec. 190(d) and requires the State to provide notice and opportunity for \ncomment on the proposed waiver request to all interested parties and the general public before submitting the \nworkforce flexibility plan to the Secretary. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.430(e).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.630(f) explains that the Secretary will issue guidelines under which States may request \ndesignation as a workflex State. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(f) \nand notes that the Secretary's guidelines may include requirements for a State to implement an evaluation of the \nimpact of work-flex in that State.\n\nSection 679.640What limitations apply to the State's Workforce Flexibility Plan authority under the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.640 explains the limitations that apply to the State's Workforce Flexibility Plan authority under \nWIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.640(a)(1) specifies that under work-flex waiver authority, a State must not waive WIOA, Wagner-\nPeyser Act, or Older Americans Act requirements which are excepted from the work-flex waiver authority and \ndescribed in \u00a7 679.630(a). This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.440(a)(1).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.640(a)(2) explains that requests to waive title I of WIOA requirements that are applicable at the \nState level may not be granted under work-flex waiver authority granted to a State. These requests may only be \ngranted by the Secretary under the general waiver authority which is described at \u00a7\u00a7 679.610 through 679.620. The \nDepartment included this provision to emphasize that work-flex waivers are issued under separate authority than \ngeneral waivers, and that States may not use work-flex waiver authority as a substitute for the general State-level \nwaivers available under sec. 189(i)(3). This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n661.440(a)(2).\n\nProposed \u00a7 679.640(b) expands on \u00a7 679.630(b)(6) by explaining that once approved the Secretary may terminate \na work-flex designation if the State fails to meet agreed-upon outcomes or the terms and conditions contained in its \nworkforce flexibility plan. The Department included this provision to emphasize that the Department reserves the \nauthority to terminate a workflex plan if a State is not meeting the terms and conditions agreed to between the \nDepartment and the State, including the relevant performance outcomes.\n\nD. Part 680\u2014Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn this part of the proposed rule, the Department describes requirements relating to the services that are available \nfor adults and dislocated workers under WIOA. Adult services are provided to job seekers who are at least 18 \nyears old; the statute and the proposed rule, in providing for such services, establish a priority for serving low-\nincome individuals, participants on public assistance, and individuals lacking basic work skills. Dislocated worker \nservices are targeted for workers who are unemployed and have lost a job, through no fault of their own, \nsometimes through mass layoffs that happen during the business cycle. The goal of these services is to provide for \nthe return of these individuals to quality employment. Dislocated workers generally include an individual who:\n\n    Has been terminated or laid off, or has received a notice of termination or layoff from employment;\n\n    Is eligible for or has exhausted entitlement to UC or has been employed for a duration sufficient to demonstrate \nattachment to the workforce but is not eligible for UC due to insufficient earnings or works for an employer not \ncovered under State UC law; and\n\n    Is unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation.\n\nUnder WIOA, adults and dislocated workers may access career services and training services. WIOA provides for \na workforce system that is universally accessible, customer centered, and training that is job-driven. WIOA will \nprovide for career and training services at the nation's nearly 2,500 one-stop centers. Training is supported through \na robust ETPL, comprised of entities with a proven capability of securing participants with quality employment. \nWIOA also provides enhanced accessand flexibility for work-based training options, such as OJT, customized \ntraining, and incumbent worker training. In this part, the Department also discusses supportive services and needs-\nrelated payments that can be provided, based on customer needs, to enable them to participate in WIOA career \nand training services.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Delivery of Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis subpart discusses the role of WIOA adult and dislocated worker services through the one-stop delivery \nsystem. The one-stop delivery system is the foundation of the workforce system. The system provides universal \naccess to career services to meet the diverse needs of adults and dislocated workers. The grant recipient(s) for the \nadult and dislocated worker program is a required partner in the one-stop delivery system and is subject to the \nrequired partner responsibilities set forth in \u00a7 678.415.\n\nCareer and training services, tailored to the individual needs of jobseekers, form the backbone of the one-stop \ndelivery system. While some jobseekers may only need self-service or other basic career services like job listings, \nlabor market information, labor exchange services or information about other services, some jobseekers will need \nservices that are more comprehensive and tailored to their individual career needs. These services may include \ncomprehensive skills assessments, career planning, and development of an individual employment plan that \noutlines the needs and goal of successful employment. Under WIA, career services were identified as core and \nintensive services and generally participants would go through each level of service in order to eventually receive \ntraining. WIOA clarifies that individuals receiving services in the one-stop centers must receive the service that is \nneeded to assist the individual to meet his or her job search goals, and does not need to follow a fixed sequence of \nservices that may not be necessary to effectively serve the individual.\n\nUnder WIOA, the Department proposes to classify career services into two categories: Basic and individualized \ncareer services. This grouping is not designed to create barriers to training, but rather identifies the importance that \nthese two types of career services can have in helping individuals obtain employment. Basic career services must \nbe made available to all job seekers and include services such as labor exchange services, labor market \ninformation, job listings, and information on partner programs. Individualized career services identified in WIOA and \ndescribed in these proposed regulations are to be provided by local areas as appropriate to help individuals to \nobtain or retain employment.\n\n\n\nUnder WIA, participants often were required to undergo a sequence of core and intensive services in order to \nreceive training. WIOA clarifies that there is no sequence of service requirement in order to receive training. \nTraining is made available to individuals after an interview, assessment or evaluation determines that the individual \nrequires training to obtain employment or remain employed. Supportive services, including needs-related \npayments, can be essential to enable individuals to participate in career and training services.\n\nSection 680.100What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker programs in the one-stop delivery system?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.100 directs that the one-stop system is the foundational system through which adult and dislocated \nworker program services are provided to eligible individuals. WIOA merges the categories of core services and \nintensive services under WIA into the category of career services.\n\nSection 680.110When must adults and dislocated workers be registered and considered a participant?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.110 addresses the important distinction between registration and participation\u2014two separate \nactions in the process by which adults and dislocated workers seek direct, one-on-one staff assistance from the \none-stop system. The distinction is important for recordkeeping and program evaluation purposes. Individuals who \nare primarily seeking information are not treated as participants and their self-service or informational search \nrequires no registration. When an individual seeks more than minimal assistance from staff in taking the next step \ntowards self-sufficient employment, the person must be registered and eligibility must be determined. To register, \nas defined in \u00a7 675.300, is the point at which information that is used in performance information begins to be \ncollected. Participation is the point at which the individual has been determined eligible for program services and \nhas received or is receiving a WIOA service, such as career services, other than self-service or informational \nservice and is the point at which an individual is to be included in performance calculations for the primary \nindicators in 20 CFR part 681.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.110(a) describes the registration process for collecting information to support a determination of \neligibility for the WIOA adult and dislocated worker programs. This section explains that registration can be done \nelectronically, through interviews, or through an application. This section proposes to distinguish the term \n\u201cparticipation\u201d from registration by providing that participation occurs after IC and eligibility determination, when an \nindividual receives a WIOA service, other than self-service or informational activities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.110(b) requires that adults and dislocated workers who receive services other than self-service \nand informational activities must be registered and considered a participant for WIOA title I services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.110(c) maintains the requirement in WIA regulation \u00a7 663.105(c) that EO data be collected on \nevery individual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or \ntraining, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the \nservice provider.\n\nSection 680.120What are the eligibility criteria for career services for adults in the adult and dislocated worker \nprograms?\n\nAn individual must be 18 years of age or older to receive career services in the adult program. Priority for \nindividualized career services and training services funded with title I adult funds must be given to low-income \nadults and public assistance recipients and individuals who are basic skills deficient, in accordance with WIOA sec. \n134(c)(3)(E) and proposed \u00a7 680.600.\n\nSection 680.130What are the eligibility criteria for career services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated \nworker programs?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.130(a) states that an individual must meet the definition of \u201cdislocated worker\u201d in WIOA sec. 3(15) \nto receive career services in the dislocated worker program.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.130(b) provides that Governors and Local Boards may develop policies and procedures for one-\nstop operators to use in determining a dislocated worker's eligibility for career services consistent with the \ndefinitions provided in the statute,regulations and any guidance issued by the Secretary.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.130(b)(1) and (2) allows for Governors and Local Boards to develop policies and procedures for \nwhat constitutes a \u201cgeneral announcement\u201d of a plant closing. These policies and procedures could include policies \nand procedures for what constitutes a \u201cgeneral announcement\u201d of a plant closing or for what constitutes \n\u201cunemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or \nbecause of natural disasters\u201d for individuals who are self-employed, including family members and ranch hands.\n\nSection 680.140What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I adult and dislocated worker services are \nLocal Boards required and permitted to provide?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.140 describes generally the availability of funds for use in providing services for adult and \ndislocated workers under title I of WIOA. Local areas have significant flexibility when providing services with adult \nand dislocated worker funds. In addition to the required career and training services, local areas may use these \nfunds to provide additional job seeker services, business services, as well as facilitate enhanced coordination \nbetween other partner programs and entities at the State and local level. Local areas can use these funds to \ndevelop new types of technical assistance, develop new intake procedures, test new procurement methods which \nmay lead to better outcomes for jobseekers, and ensure robust services to businesses throughout the workforce \nsystem.\n\nParagraph (a) provides that WIOA title I adult and dislocated worker funds to local areas must be used to provide \ncareer and training services through the one-stop delivery system. Local areas have discretion in the appropriate \nmix of services, but both career and training services must be made available through the one-stop system for \nprovision to eligible individuals served through the system.\n\nParagraph (b) describes the services that may be provided with WIOA title I adult and dislocated worker funds in \nlocal areas.\n\nSubparagraph (b)(1) identifies \u201cJob Seeker Services.\u201d These services include customer support activities to help \nindividuals with barriers to employment, training programs for displaced homemakers and individuals training for \nnontraditional occupations, work support activities for low-wage workers, supportive services and needs-related \npayments, and providing transitional jobs to individuals with barriers to employment who are chronically \nunemployed or have an inconsistent work history.\n\nParagraph (b)(2) identifies \u201cEmployer Services.\u201d These services include customized screening and referral of \nqualified participants in training to employers, customized employment-related services to employers, and \nbusiness services.\n\nParagraph (b)(3) identifies \u201cCoordination Activities.\u201d Coordination is required among training and employment \nactivities under WIOA, child support agencies and services, Department of Agriculture extension programs, \nfacilitating remote access by using technology and the one-stop delivery system, economic development agencies, \nlinkages between the public workforce system and employers and those between the one-stop delivery system \nand unemployment insurance programs, and organizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities.\n\nParagraph (b)(4) authorizes local areas to enter into pay-for-performance contracts as part of a training strategy. \nLocal areas may use up to 10 percent of their total adult and dislocated worker funds under this procurement \nmethod.\n\nParagraph (b)(5) provides for technical assistance for one-stop operators, partners, and ETPs regarding the \nprovision of services to individuals with disabilities.\n\n\n\nParagraph (b)(6) provides for local areas to adjust the economic self-sufficiency standards for local areas. Levels of \nself-sufficiency may vary by local area and the local economy; this flexibility allows local areas to tailor their services \nin a way that works in their local economy.\n\nParagraph (b)(7) provides for the implementation of promising services to workers and employers. Local areas \ncan build upon promising practices to improve service delivery to both job seekers and employers.\n\nParagraph (b)(8) provides for the use of funds for incumbent worker training. Local areas can use up to 20 percent \nof their combined adult and dislocated worker funds to do incumbent worker training consistent with subpart F of \nthis part.\n\nSection 680.150What career services must be provided to adults and dislocated workers?\n\nAt a minimum, all of the basic career services described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(i)-(xi) and \u00a7 678.430(a) must be \nprovided in each local area through the one-stop delivery system. These services include referrals to partner \nprograms, initial assessments, and labor exchange services.\n\nIn addition, services described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) and \u00a7 678.430(b), such as career counseling and the \ndevelopment of an individual employment plan, must be made available if appropriate for an individual to obtain or \nretain employment. These services are categorized as \u201cIndividualized Career Services\u201d in \u00a7 678.430(b). An \nindividual employment plan is discussed in connection with proposed \u00a7 680.180.\n\nAppropriate follow-up services must be made available to a participant placed in unsubsidized employment for a \nminimum of 12 months following the participant's first date of employment. Follow-up services can be useful for \nparticipants in order to maintain employment. One-stop staff can provide workplace information and tips for success \nin a workplace environment. Additionally, follow-up services provide a continuing link between the participant and \nworkforce system; these services allow the one-stop to assist with other services the participant may need once he \nor she obtains employment. Examples may include assistance with employer benefits, health insurance, and \nfinancial literacy and budgeting assistance.\n\nSection 680.160How are career services delivered?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.160 explains that career services must be provided through the one-stop delivery system. Career \nservices may be provided by the one-stop operator or through contracts with service providers approved by the \nLocal Board. A Local Board may not be the provider of career services unless it receives a waiver from the \nGovernor and meets other statutory and regulatory conditions.\n\nSection 680.170What is an internship or work experience for adults and dislocated workers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 683.170 defines an internship or work experience as a planned, structured, time-limited learning \nexperience that takes places in a workplace. An internship or work experience may be paid or unpaid, as \nappropriate. An internship or work experience may be provided in the private for-profit, non-profit, or public sectors. \nLabor standards apply to any internship or work experience in which an employee/employer relationship exists \nunder applicable law. The Department recognizes the role work experiences and internships play inhelping \nindividuals obtain the skills they need to succeed in the workplace. An internship or work experience for a \nparticipant in WIOA is classified as an Individualized Career Service as described in \u00a7 678.430(b). Internships and \nwork experiences provide a helpful means for an individual to gain experience that leads to unsubsidized \nemployment.\n\nSection 680.180What is the individual employment plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.180 explains that an individual employment plan is an individualized career service, as described in \n\u00a7 678.430(b), jointly developed by the participant and career planner, that may be appropriate for an individual. The \nplan includes an ongoing strategy to identify employment goals, achievement objectives, and an appropriate \ncombination of services for the participant to obtain these goals and objectives. Individual employment plans are \none of the most effective ways to serve individuals with barriers to employment, and to coordinate the various \nservices including training services they may need to overcome these barriers.\n\n\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Training Services\n\nIntroduction\n\nTraining services are discussed at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 680.200 through 680.230. WIOA is designed to increase participant \naccess to training services. Training services are provided to equip individuals to enter the workforce and retain \nemployment. Training services may include, for example, occupational skills training, OJT, registered \napprenticeship which incorporates both OJT and classroom training, incumbent worker training, pre-apprenticeship \ntraining, workplace training with related instruction, training programs operated by the private sector, skill upgrading \nand retraining, entrepreneurial training, and transitional jobs. Training services are available for individuals who, \nafter interview, evaluation or assessment, and case management are determined to be unlikely or unable to obtain \nor retain employment that leads to self-sufficiency or higher wages from previous employment through career \nservices alone. The participant must be determined to be in need of training services and to possess the skills and \nqualifications to successfully participate in the selected program. The Department explains that some participants \nmay need additional services to assist their vocational training, such as job readiness training, literacy activities \nincluding English language training, and customized training.\n\nSection 680.200What are training services for adults and dislocated workers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.200 directs the reader to WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(D) for a description of available training services. \nThe proposal provides a series of examples that is not all-inclusive.\n\nSection 680.210Who may receive training services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.210(a) discusses the process used to determine when and what training services must be made \navailable to an individual. Under WIOA, an individual may receive training services after an interview, evaluation, or \nassessment, and career planning if the one-stop operator or partner determines the individual is unlikely or unable, \nby only receiving career services, to retain employment that leads to economic self-sufficiency or wages \ncomparable to or higher than wages from previous employment. Additionally, the one-stop operator or partner must \nalso determine that the training the individual receives would result in employment leading to economic self-\nsufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than wages from previous employment. The one-stop operator or \npartner must also determine that the individual has the skills and qualifications to successfully participate in and \ncomplete the training. Upon a determination that career services are unlikely to obtain these employment outcomes, \nthe individual may be enrolled in training services. The individual should have the skills and qualifications needed to \nsuccessfully participate in and complete the training services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.210(b) requires that individuals, for whom training has been deemed appropriate, select a training \nprogram linked to employment opportunities in the local area or in an area to which the individual is willing to \ncommute or relocate. The selection of this training program should be fully informed by the performance of relevant \ntraining providers, and individuals must be provided with the performance reports for all training providers who \nprovide a relevant program.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.210(c) explains that WIOA training services must be provided when other sources of grant \nassistance are unavailable to the individual.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.210(d) requires that training services provided under the WIOA adult funding stream must be \nprovided in accordance with the State or Local Board's priority system.\n\nSection 680.220Are there particular career services an individual must receive before receiving training services \nunder Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nWIOA removed the requirement under WIA that an individual had to receive an intensive service before receiving \ntraining services. The proposal explains that, other than an interview, evaluation, or assessment and career \nplanning there is no requirement that additional career services must be provided before an individual enrolls in \ntraining. Where an assessment is provided, a previous assessment may be adequate for this purpose. There is no \nrequirement for a sequencing of services under WIOA. If individuals are determined to be in need of training \nconsistent with WIOA sec. 134(c)(3) then they may be placed in training services. The Department encourages the \n\n\n\nuse of individualized career services under \u00a7 678.420(b) when appropriate for an individual; an individual \nemployment plan or career counseling informed by local labor market information and training provider performance \nreports often will be appropriate before an individual receives training services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.220(b) requires that the case files for individuals must document the participant eligibility for \ntraining services and explain how this determination was made\u2014by interview, evaluation or assessment, career \nplanning, or other career service, such as an individual employment plan. It is important that the one-stop gather \nenough information, by whatever means, be they through an interview or through career services, to justify the need \nfor training services.\n\nSection 680.230What are the requirements for coordination of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act training \nfunds and other grant assistance?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.230 restates the requirements for coordination with other forms of assistance that apply under WIA. \nThe Department has also added a sentence to \u00a7 680.230(a)(2) to reflect the new provision in WIOA sec. \n134(c)(3)(B)(iii) that one-stop operators and one-stop partners may take into account the full cost of the training, \nincluding the cost of supportive services. The Department encourages program operators to do so.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.230(a) states that when coordinating other grant assistance the one-stop operator orpartner may \ntake into account the full cost of participating in training services, including the cost of dependent care and \ntransportation and other appropriate costs. Additionally, the one-stop operator or partner must coordinate training \nfunds available and make funding arrangements with one-stop partners and other entities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.230(b) states that WIOA participants may enroll in WIOA-funded training while the participant has \na Pell Grant application pending as long as the one-stop operator has made arrangements with the training provider \nand the WIOA participant regarding the award of the Pell Grant. The training provider must reimburse the one-stop \noperator or partner the amount of the WIOA funds used to pay for the training costs covered by the Pell Grant in the \nevent that one is approved after WIOA-funded training has begun. Reimbursement from the participant for \neducation-related expenses is not required.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Individual Training Accounts\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndividual Training Accounts (ITAs) are key tools used in the delivery of many training services. The Department \nseeks to provide maximum flexibility to State and local program operators in managing ITAs. These proposed \nregulations do not establish the procedures for making payments, restrictions on the duration or amounts of the ITA, \nor policies regarding exceptions to the limits. The authority to make those decisions resides with the State or Local \nBoards. The authority that States or Local Boards may use to restrict the duration of ITAs or restrict funding \namounts must not be used to establish limits that arbitrarily exclude eligible providers.\n\nThrough the one-stop center, individuals will be provided with quality and performance information on providers of \ntraining and, with effective career services, case management, and career planning with the ITA as the payment \nmechanism. ITAs allow participants the opportunity to choose the training provider that best meets their needs. \nUnder WIOA, ITAs can more easily support placing participants into registered apprenticeship programs than under \nWIA.\n\nSection 680.300How are training services provided?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.300 explains that in most circumstances an individual will receive training services through an ITA. \nAn ITA is established on behalf of the participant, where services are purchased from eligible providers selected in \nconsultation with a career planner. Payments may be made through electronic transfers of funds, vouchers, or other \nappropriate methods. Payments may be made at the beginning of the training program or on an incremental basis; \nthe payment processes must be decided at the local level. As explained in proposed \u00a7 680.300, an ITA is used by \nan individual to access training services from an entity on the State's ETPL. In some circumstances involving work-\nbased training, such as OJT, customized training, registered apprenticeship, incumbent worker training and \ntransitional jobs, the Local Board may contract out the training services. The section allows for a Local Board itself \n\n\n\nto provide the training services if it receives a waiver from the Governor. Local Boards must coordinate funding for \nITAs with funding from other Federal, State, local, or private job training programs or sources to assist individuals in \nobtaining training services.\n\nSection 680.310Can the duration and amount of Individual Training Accounts be limited?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.310 maintains the State and local flexibility to impose limits on ITAs that exists under WIA.\n\nSection 680.320Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than Individual Training Accounts be used to \nprovide training services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.320(a) discusses the exceptions to the otherwise required use of an ITA for training. In situations \ncovered by these exceptions, a contract for services may be used to provide for training. The exceptions include:\n\n1. OJT, which could include placing participants in a registered apprenticeship, customized training, incumbent \nworker training, or transitional jobs.\n\n2. Where a Local Board determines there are an insufficient number of eligible providers in the local area to \naccomplish the purpose of an ITA. The local plan must describe how this determination was made and the process \nused for contracting for services. This exception maintains the same language as WIA.\n\n3. If the Local Board determines a CBO or other private organization provides effective training services to \nindividuals with barriers to employment. The Local Board must develop criteria to show that the program is \neffective.\n\n4. Training for multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations, as long as the contract does not \nlimit the individual's consumer choice.\n\n5. Circumstances in which a pay-for-performance contract is appropriate, consistent with \u00a7 683.510.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.320(b) includes the term \u201cindividuals with barriers to employment\u201d in place of the term \u201cspecial \nparticipant,\u201d as used under WIA. \u201cIndividuals with barriers to employment\u201d is broader than \u201cspecial participants.\u201d \n\u201cIndividuals with barriers to employment\u201d includes: Displaced homemakers (see \u00a7 680.630); low-income individuals; \nIndians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians; individuals with disabilities; older individuals; ex-offenders; \nhomeless individuals; youth who are in or have aged out of the foster care system; individuals who are English \nlearners, have low literacy levels, or face substantial cultural barriers; eligible MSFWs; individuals within 2 years of \nexhausting lifetime eligibility under TANF; single parents (including pregnant women); long-term unemployed \nindividuals; and members of other groups identified by the Governor.\n\nSection 680.330How can Individual Training Accounts, supportive services, and needs-related payments be used to \nsupport placing participating adults and dislocated workers into a registered apprenticeship program and support \nparticipants once they are in a registered apprenticeship program?\n\nThis regulation is designed to ensure States and local areas have the flexibility to serve individuals in both being \nplaced into a registered apprenticeship as well as to assist currently registered apprentices. WIOA provides a new \nopportunity for registered apprenticeship programs to automatically qualify to be placed on the State's ETPL, \nallowing ITAs to support participants in registered apprenticeship programs, and more directly connecting \napprenticeship programs to job seekers in one-stop centers. Some apprenticeship programs are with a single \nemployer, whereas others may operate through a joint labor-management organization where participants are \nselected for the apprenticeship but not immediately hired by a specific employer. The Department is seeking \ncomment on how registered apprenticeship programs and individuals enrolled or seeking to be enrolled in such \nprograms may be best served within the one-stop delivery system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.330(a) states that participants may use an ITA to receive training at a pre-apprenticeship program \nthat is on the State's ETPL. Pre-apprenticeship programs provide training to increase math, literacy, and other \nvocational skills needed to gain entry to a registered apprenticeship program. A pre-apprenticeship program funded \nwith an ITA must have at least one registered apprenticeship partner; such pre-apprenticeship programs must \n\n\n\npossess or develop a strong record of enrolling their pre-apprenticeship graduates into a registered apprenticeship \nprogram. The Department is also open to comment on how pre-apprenticeship programs and individuals enrolled or \nseeking to be enrolled in such programs may be best served within the one-stop delivery system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.330(b) explains that the cost of tuition may be paid through an ITA to the training provider involved \nin a registered apprenticeship program. In such instances, the training provider may be an employer, a joint labor-\nmanagement entity, a labor organization, or an outside training provider.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.330(c) states that supportive services may be provided to support the placement of a participant \ninto a registered apprenticeship program, consistent with the rules governing supportive services in subpart H.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.330(d) explains that needs-related payments may be provided to support the placement of a \nparticipant into a registered apprenticeship program, consistent with the rules governing needs-related payments in \nsubpart H.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.330(e) provides a citation to the regulations on using OJT funds with registered apprenticeships.\n\nSection 680.340 What are the requirements for consumer choice?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.340 largely restates the consumer choice requirements established under WIA. The term \u201ccareer \nplanner,\u201d used in WIOA, replaces the term \u201ccase manager,\u201d used in WIA. Proposed \u00a7 680.340(e) provides that one-\nstop operators may coordinate funding for ITAs with other funding sources in order to assist the individual in \nobtaining training services. Proposed \u00a7 680.340(f) requires that priority consideration be given to programs that are \naligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in the local area.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Eligible Training Providers\n\nThis part describes the methods by which organizations qualify as eligible providers of training services under \nWIOA. It also describes the roles and responsibilities of the State and Local Boards in managing this process and \ndisseminating ETPLs. The State ETPL and the related eligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality, and \nlabor-market relevance of programs of training services that receive funds through WIOA title I-B. The regulations \nemphasize that the list and accompanying information must be easily understood and disseminated widely, in order \nto maximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population groups.\n\nThe State plays a leadership role in ensuring the success of the eligible provider system in partnership with Local \nBoards, the one-stop system, and its partners. The Governor must establish eligibility criteria and procedures for \ninitial determination and renewals of eligibility for training providers and training programs to receive funds under \nWIOA title I-B. In doing so, the Governor may establish minimum performance levels for eligibility and the \nDepartment encourages Governors to do so. In establishing minimum performance levels for eligibility, the Govenor \nshould take into consideration the need to serve targeted populations. The Local Board may establish additional \nperformance levels for program eligibility within a local area.\n\nThe proposed regulations implement WIOA sec. 122 and refer to WIOA secs. 107, 116, and 134 where those \nsections affect provider eligibility, the ETPL, the use of ITAs, and the inclusion of registered apprenticeship \nprograms on the ETPL. In \u00a7 680.410, the regulations clarify that all training providers, including those operating \nunder the ITA exceptions, must qualify as eligible providers, except for those engaged in OJT and customized \ntraining (for which the Governor must establish qualifying procedures as discussed in \u00a7 680.530). The proposed \nregulations also explain how registered apprenticeship programs, which WIOA treats differently than other providers \nin some respects, are to be included in the list. Finally, the regulations describe how the State ETPL must be \ndisseminated with accompanying performance and cost information. The performance information must be \npresented in a way that is easily understood, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and serve all \nsignificant population groups. Separately, ETP performance reports, which require providers to supply performance \ninformation for all individuals enrolled in a program are addressed in \u00a7 677.230.\n\nIn response to concerns expressed by stakeholders that some providers of training would face difficulties in \nparticipating in this WIOA-revised system, the Department has clarified the interrelated eligibility requirements and \n\n\n\nexplained that while WIOA places an emphasis on quality training as measured by performance criteria, State and \nLocal Boards and training providers must work together in attaining this goal. The proposed regulations emphasize \nthe Governor's discretion in offering financial or technical support to training providers where the information \nrequirements of this section result in undue cost or burden. Making a wide variety of high-quality training programs \navailable to participants will increase customer choice and that training providers may find performance information \nuseful to improve their programs of study, which in turn will provide a direct benefit to participants. The Department \nalso encourages the Governor to work with ETPs to return aggregate performance information to the provider in \nways that will help the training providers improve their program performance. Given that training providers may \nhave many programs of study within their institution, the department is seeking comment on ways that States can \nhelp streamline performance reporting for training providers and minimize the burden associated with reporting on \nmultiple programs of study. The State and Local Boards must work together to ensure sufficient numbers and types \nof training providers and programs in order to maximize customer choice while maintaining the quality and integrity \nof training services. In addition, the proposed regulations explain that CBOs have the opportunity to deliver training \nfunded under WIOA through contracts for services rather than ITAs, provided the local area determines this is \nnecessary to meet local customer needs and also that the provider meets training performance requirements. \nBecause of WIOA's emphasis on ensuring the provision of quality training, and the importance of using \nperformance criteria to obtain such quality, the Department does not intend to waive any of the requirements of this \nsection. The Department is seeking comment on possible adaptations of ETP eligibility and reporting requirements \nto ensure small CBOs, especially those serving hard toserve participant populations, have the capacity to qualify as \nETPs.\n\nSection 680.400What is the purpose of this subpart?\n\nThe workforce development system established under WIOA emphasizes informed consumer choice, job-driven \ntraining, provider performance, and continuous improvement. The quality and selection of providers and programs \nof training services is vital to achieving these core principles. As required by WIOA sec. 122, proposed \u00a7 680.400 \nexplains that States, in partnership with Local Boards, must identify providers of training services that are qualified \nto receive WIOA funds to train adults and dislocated workers. Therefore, WIOA requires that each State must \nmaintain a list of ETPs. The list must be accompanied by relevant performance and cost information and must be \nmade widely available, including in electronic formats, and presented in a way that is easily understood, in order to \nmaximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population groups.\n\nSection 680.410What entities are eligible providers of training services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.410 defines the types of entities that may be considered eligible to provide training services and \nthe specific funds to be used for this purpose. This proposed section explains that training providers, including \nthose operating under the ITA exceptions, must qualify as eligible providers, except for those engaged in OJT and \ncustomized training (for which the Governor must establish qualifying procedures as discussed in \u00a7 680.530). The \nproposed regulations identify registered apprenticeship programs as included in the list as long as the program \nremains registered. This is further explained in proposed \u00a7 680.470.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) explains that only providers that the State determines to be eligible, as required in WIOA \nsec. 122, may receive training funds under WIOA title I-B. This refers to funds used to provide training for adult and \ndislocated worker participants who enroll in a program of training services. Proposed paragraph (a) states that the \nGovernor will establish the criteria and procedures for determining eligibility. These criteria must take into account, \nat a minimum the items in WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(A). Under the requirements of WIOA sec. 122, the procedures for \ndetermining eligibility of providers are established at the State level and include application and renewal \nprocedures, eligibility criteria, and information requirements.\n\nProposed paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) list the categories of potentially eligible training entities. This list is largely \nunchanged from WIA. Potentially eligible entities include post-secondary education institutions, registered \napprenticeship programs, other public or private providers of training, Local Boards that meet certain conditions, \nand CBOs or private organizations providing training under contract with the Local Board.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) specify that these eligibility requirements apply to adult and dislocated worker \nfunds. The requirements apply to both participants who seek training using ITAs and those who seek training \nthrough the exceptions described in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 680.320 and 680.530. Under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(G), limited \nexceptions allow local areas to provide training through a contract for services rather than ITAs in order to maintain \nconsumer choice. These exceptions include: OJT training, customized training, incumbent worker training, or \ntransitional employment; instances where the Local Board determines there are insufficient numbers of eligible \nproviders of training services in the local area; where the Local Board determines an exception is necessary to \nmeet the needs of individuals with barriers to employment (including assisting individuals with disabilities or adults \nin need of adult education and literacy services); where the Local Board determines that it would be most \nappropriate to award a contract to an institution of higher education or other eligible provider to facilitate the \ntraining of multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations (where the contract does not limit \ncustomer choice); and, for pay-for-performance contracts.\n\nProposed paragraph (b)(2) explains that the requirements to become an eligible provider of training services apply \nto all organizations providing training to adults and dislocated workers, with the specific exception for registered \napprenticeship programs. WIOA makes a change from WIA in that registered apprenticeship programs must be \nincluded and maintained on the list for as long as the program remains registered. Registered apprenticeship \nprograms are not subject to the same application and performance information requirements as other ETPs. \nHowever, because it is possible that particular registered apprenticeship programs may prefer not to be included on \nthe list, the proposed regulation requires registered apprenticeship programs to indicate their interest in being on \nthe State list, according to a mechanism established by the Governor. The pertinent requirements for registered \napprenticeship programs are explained in proposed \u00a7 680.470.\n\nSection 680.420What is a \u201cprogram of training services\u201d?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.420 defines the term \u201cprogram of training services,\u201d which is used throughout this part. The \nDepartment explains that a program of training services includes a structured regimen that leads to specific \noutcomes. Our definition reinforces a key principle of WIOA to improve accountability and performance. Proposed \nparagraphs (a) through (c) align the outcomes for a program of training services with the performance requirements \ndescribed in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). These potential outcomes include post-secondary credentials, industry-\nrecognized credentials, employment, and measurable skill gains toward credentials or employment.\n\nSection 680.430Who is responsible for managing the eligible provider process?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.430 explains the roles of the Governor and Local Boards in administering the eligible provider \nprocess. Throughout this subpart, the Department emphasizes the Governor's discretion, in consultation with \nstakeholders, to establish eligibility procedures. The eligible provider process under WIOA sec. 122 requires the \nGovernor to establish eligibility procedures and to clarify State and Local Board roles and responsibilities. In various \nsections, WIOA assigns responsibilities to Local Boards concerning ETPs and identifies additional optional activities \nthat may be undertaken by Local Boards. For the convenience of stakeholders and the public, the Department has \nlisted in proposed \u00a7 680.430 these required and potential activities.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) explains the Governor's responsibilities for managing the process for determining eligibility, \ndeveloping and maintaining the State's list of ETPs, and disseminating the list to Local Boards, as required by \nWIOA sec. 122. In keeping with WIOA secs. 122(a)(1) and (c)(1), proposed paragraph (a) further requires that \nGovernors consult with the State Board when establishing these procedures. Proposed paragraph (b) authorizes \nthe Governor to designate a State agency to carry out the requirements of this section. While WIOA sec. 122 does \nnot address this point, the Department anticipates that most States will work through a designated State agency (or \nappropriate State entity) to administer therequirements of this section. The Department proposes paragraph (b) to \nmake this option explicit.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) describe the State's responsibilities for developing and maintaining the \nState list of providers. The State may establish minimum performance levels. The State is responsible for \ndetermining if such performance targets are met. It is also the State's responsibility to determine whether accurate \ninformation has been submitted, take enforcement actions as needed, and disseminate the list to the Local Boards, \n\n\n\nthe one-stop system, its partner programs, and the public. This includes dissemination through Web sites and \nsearchable databases and any other means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers. Under WIA, \nsimilar responsibilities were primarily assigned to the Local Workforce Boards. In establishing greater accountability \nand flexibility at the State level, WIOA sec. 122 specifically requires the State to manage the ETP process. \nProposed paragraph (b) describes these responsibilities and notes the Governor's primary role in exercising these \nresponsibilities, including the assignment of duties to be undertaken by Local Boards.\n\nParagraph (c) identifies the required responsibilities of Local Boards, which are found in WIOA secs. 107 and 134. \nThese include responsibilities assigned to Local Boards statutorily as well as responsibilities that may be assigned \nby the Governor. Proposed paragraph (c)(1) makes clear that the Local Board must carry out procedures assigned \nto it by the State, as provided for under WIOA sec.122(c)(1). The Department provides examples of the \nresponsibilities that the Governor may choose to assign to Local Boards, including duties similar to those \nundertaken by Local Boards under WIA.\n\nProposed paragraph (c)(2) explains the Local Boards' responsibility to work with the State to ensure that there are \nsufficient number and variety of programs to provide participants, as consumers, adequate choice among providers, \nas described in WIOA sec. 107. Local Boards are charged with working with the State to ensure that there are \nsufficient numbers and types of providers to meet the skill development needs of adults and dislocated workers, \nincluding those who are disabled and/or require adult literacy assistance. This proposed paragraph emphasizes \nthat Local Boards and the State must work together to ensure adequate consumer choice.\n\nProposed paragraph (c)(3) explains, as required by WIOA sec. 134(a)(2)(B), that Local Boards must also ensure \nthat the State' eligible training provider list is disseminated publicly through the local one-stop system, and its \npartner programs. The list is a tool to assist one-stop customers in evaluating training programs and provider \noptions. The dissemination of the list is also discussed under proposed \u00a7 680.500.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) explains the roles that a Local Board may choose to exercise in the eligible provider \nprocess. The Governor's procedure may not prevent Local Boards from exercising these options.\n\nProposed paragraph (d)(1) emphasizes the potential for Local Board input into the Governor's development of the \neligible provider procedure. WIOA sec. 122(e) requires the Governor to provide an opportunity for interested \nmembers of the public to make recommendations and submit comments regarding the eligibility procedure. \nAlthough not explicitly addressed in the WIOA sec. 122, the Department interprets its language to encompass Local \nBoards and thus have included this requirement in the proposed paragraph.\n\nProposed paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) include the provisions at WIOA sec. 122(b)(3), which allow Local Boards to set \nadditional eligibility criteria, information requirements, and minimum performance levels for local providers beyond \nwhat is required by the Governor's procedure. Stakeholders and the public must note that any additional \nrequirements imposed by a Local Board will only affect a program's eligibility and performance requirements within \nthe local area.\n\nSection 680.440What are the transition procedures for Workforce Investment Act-eligible providers to become \neligible under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.440 explains the procedure established by WIOA sec. 122(c) for training providers that were \neligible as of the date WIOA was enacted, July 21, 2014, to continue their eligibility under WIOA. The Department \nanticipates the majority of providers previously eligible under WIA will be affected by this transition.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) explains that the Governor may establish a transition period and states that providers that \nwere eligible on July 21, 2014 will remain eligible under WIOA until December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as the \nGovernor may set. Proposed paragraph (b) explains that in order to retain eligibility after the transition period, these \nproviders will be subject to the application procedure established by the Governor for providers that have previously \nbeen found eligible, as further explained in proposed \u00a7 680.460. Proposed paragraph (c) explains that providers \nthat have previously been found eligible are not subject to the initial eligibility procedures, as described in proposed \n\n\n\n\u00a7 680.450. As discussed in \u00a7 680.450, the initial eligibility procedures apply only to providers that were not \npreviously eligible under WIA or WIOA.\n\nSection 680.450What is the initial eligibility procedure for new providers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.450 describes the process for adding \u201cnew\u201d' providers to the ETPL (i.e., those that have not \npreviously been found eligible under sec. 122 of either WIA or WIOA). Such providers must first apply for initial \neligibility according to procedures set by the Governor. In accordance with WIOA sec. 122(b)(4), this proposed \nsection describes the factors the Governor must take into consideration in developing this procedure and take into \naccount in setting criteria for initial eligibility. Eligibility is determined on a program-by-program basis for each \nprovider. Proposed \u00a7 680.450 distinguishes between registered apprenticeship programs seeking inclusion on the \nlist and other providers. Registered apprenticeship programs, consistent with WIOA sec. 122(a)(3), are not subject \nto the initial eligibility application procedure. However, registered apprenticeship programs are required to indicate \ntheir interest to be included in the ETPL, according to a mechanism established by the Governor, as discussed in \u00a7 \n680.470.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) explains that the Governor's procedure must require that providers of training seeking \ninitial eligibility submit required information in order to receive initial eligibility.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) explains the exception for providers who are carrying out registered apprenticeship \nprograms under the National Apprenticeship Act. Such programs are included and maintained on the list of eligible \nproviders of training for as long as the program remains registered. Therefore, registered apprenticeship programs \nare not subject to a period of initial eligibility or to initial-eligibility procedures. Rather, the Department proposes \nparagraph (b) to require the Governor to establish a procedure whereby registered apprenticeship programs may \nindicate their interest to be included and maintained on the list. This requirement is further discussed in \u00a7 680.470.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) explains the requirement that the Governor must consult with Local Boards and \nsolicitpublic comment in determining the initial eligibility procedure. While the Governor is responsible for \ndeveloping the initial eligibility procedure, input by the Local Board and public comment remain important for \nshaping a public workforce system that is responsive to local needs. The Local Board is responsible for working \nwith the State to ensure that there are sufficient numbers and types of providers of career and training services, as \nrequired by WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E) and described in proposed \u00a7 679.370(m). Therefore, the Department is \nrequiring that the Governor consult with Local Boards about the initial eligibility procedure in order to maximize \nconsumer choice at the local level. This is also in keeping with WIOA sec. 122(e) on the requirements for public \ncomment. In addition, although WIOA does not address this point, the Department proposes requiring the \nGovernor to describe the procedure, eligibility criteria, and information requirements for initial eligibility in the State \nPlan. Although States will need a separate mechanism for public comment during the first year of implementation, \nin subsequent years the State Plan process will afford the opportunity to solicit comments and recommendations \nfrom key stakeholders. In addition, the State Plan submission and review process allows the Department to ensure \ncompliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and identify promising practices and technical assistance \nneeds.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor must establish criteria and State requirements for non-exempt \nproviders seeking initial eligibility. These initial requirements apply to providers that were not previously eligible \nunder this section (or sec. 122 of WIA, as in effect on the day before the enactment of WIOA).\n\nProposed paragraph (e) describes the factors that the Governor must take into account in establishing the criteria \nfor determining initial eligibility. For those institutions that are not exempt from complying with the ETP application \nprocess, the State must establish consistent and uniform criteria for providers seeking initial eligibility. The \ninformation that must be submitted to the State for review will be defined by the Governor, but must, at a minimum, \naddress factors related to program elements included in both WIOA secs. 122(b)(4)(D) and 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV). \nThe Department has listed these required elements in proposed paragraphs (e)(2) through (5). The elements taken \nfrom WIOA sec. 122 include information addressing factors related to program performance indicators, any \npartnership a program has with a business, attributes indicating high quality training services and credentialing, and \n\n\n\nthe alignment of the program's services with in-demand industry sectors. WIOA requires that providers provide \n\u201cverifiable program-specific performance information.\u201d The Department is interested in comments about the types of \nverifiable program specific-information this would include. The Department is particularly interested in the methods \nof providing verifiable information that are the least costly to the training provider and the easiest to verify to reduce \nthe cost to the State or local area. The Department has added a requirement that the applicant provide a \ndescription of the program. The Department thinks this information is not burdensome and is essential to enable \ncustomers to understand whether the program meets their training needs.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) describes the Governor's discretion to establish minimum performance standards. As with \nthe application procedures described in \u00a7 680.460, the Governor may establish minimum performance levels in the \ninitial eligibility procedures, and the Department encourages them to do so.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.450(g) emphasizes the time limit for initial eligibility, which is 1 fiscal year for a particular program, \nper WIOA sec. 122(b)(4)(B).\n\nProposed paragraph (h) clarifies that after the period of initial eligibility, these training providers are subject to the \nGovernor's application procedure, described at proposed \u00a7 680.460 in order to remain eligible.\n\nSection 680.460What is the application procedure for continued eligibility?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.460 explains the detailed application process for previously WIA-eligible providers to remain \neligible under WIOA. Eligibility is determined on a program-by-program basis for each provider.\n\nProposed paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) list the two groups of providers that are subject to the requirements of proposed \n\u00a7 680.460. These include new training providers that were previously eligible under WIA (following the Governor's \ntransition period, which ends December 31, 2015 or such earlier date established by the Governor) as well as new \ntraining providers whose initial eligibility expires after 1 fiscal year.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) explain that the Governor is required to gather and consider input from Local \nBoards, providers, and the public, including representatives of business and labor organizations. The Local Board is \nresponsible for working with the State to ensure that there are sufficient numbers and types of providers of career \nand training services, as required by WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E) and described in proposed \u00a7 679.370(m). Therefore, \nthe Department is requiring that the Governor consult with Local Boards regarding training provider eligibility \nprocedures in order to maximize consumer choice among quality training providers at the local level. This is also in \nkeeping with WIOA sec. 122(e) regarding the requirements for public comment. While WIOA does not specify a \ntimeframe within which the consultation and determination must be completed, proposed paragraph (b)(3) requires \nthe Governor to establish a timeframe for that purpose while leaving the amount of time to the Governor's \ndiscretion. The same requirements for Local Board consultation and a public comment period are described above \nin connection with proposed \u00a7 680.450(c) for the Governor's development of initial eligibility procedures.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) clarifies that registered apprenticeship programs are exempted from these application \nprocedures. Under WIOA sec. 122(a)(3), registered apprenticeship programs must be included and maintained on \nthe State list for as long as the program remains registered. While registered apprenticeships are considered \neligible, not all registered apprenticeship sponsors may wish to be included. As described in \u00a7 680.470, the \nDepartment proposes that the Governor's procedure must include a means for registered apprenticeship program \nto indicate interest in being included on the list.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor's procedure must describe the roles of the State and local \nareas in the application and eligibility process. WIOA gives the Governor discretion to assign some of the \nresponsibility for receiving, reviewing, and making eligibility determinations to local areas. WIOA emphasizes the \nGovernor's discretion in establishing eligibility procedures.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) requires the Governor's procedure to be described in the State Plan. Although WIOA does \nnot address this point, the Department proposes requiring the Governor to describe the procedure, eligibility \ncriteria, and information requirements for initial eligibility in the State Plan. Although States will need a separate \nmechanism for public comment during the first year of implementation, in subsequent years the State Plan process \n\n\n\nwill afford the opportunity to solicitcomments and recommendations from key stakeholders. In addition, the State \nPlan submission and review process allows the Department to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory \nrequirements and identify promising practices and technical assistance needs.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) explains the factors that the Governor must take into account in developing the eligibility \ncriteria. These include nine required factors and any additional factors that Governor considers appropriate. The \nproposed language closely tracks the language from WIOA sec. 122(b), providing a comprehensive description of \nthe requirements for the application process. WIOA sec. 122(b) includes multiple cross-references to WIOA sec. \n116 which identifies required performance accountability measures. Proposed paragraph (f)(1) generally describes \nthe kinds of performance information which training providers must submit as part of their application, which pertain \nto participants receiving training under WIOA title I-B. The Department recommends the Governor's procedure \nemphasize these performance indicators as a way of establishing minimum standards and a means for comparison \namong training providers offering similar training in similar areas. The Department recommends States use these \nmeasures to ensure performance accountability, continuous improvement, training provider quality, and informed \nconsumer choice. The Department anticipates that complete performance data as required under (f)(1) may not be \navailable until PY 2018, given the lag time inherent in the performance indicators. Proposed pargraph (f)(1) allows \nthe Govenor to take into account alternate factors for any performance information that is not yet available until \nsuch performance data are available. The Department seeks comment on alternate factors related to performance \nthat may be used to establish eligibility during this time.\n\nProposed paragraphs (f)(2) through (10) list the other factors that the Governor's criteria must take into account. \nThese include the need to ensure access to training services in rural areas, information regarding Federal and \nState training programs other than within WIOA title I-B, alignment with in-demand industry sectors, State licensure \nrequirements, encouraging industry-recognized credentials, provision of post-secondary credentials, the quality of \nprogram and training services, and meeting the needs of individuals with barriers to employment.\n\nProposed paragraph (f)(10) requires the Governor's criteria to take into account whether the providers timely and \naccurately submitted eligible training provider performance reports, as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4). This \nrequirement is consistent with the requirement under WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(A)(ii) that the criteria to be taken into \naccount include the outcomes of the training programs for students in general with respect to employment and \nearnings under the indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(d)(2). The ETP reports provide \ninformation on these employment and earnings outcomes for all individuals in a program of study, and the failure to \nsubmit such reports on a timely and accurate basis would undermine the ability of the Governor to take such \noutcomes into account. The Department seeks comment on how best to apply the timely and accurate submission \nof these ETP performance reports as a factor for eligibility.\n\nProposed paragraph (f)(11) explains the Governor's discretion to take into account other factors. This paragraph \nechoes the key principles of the ETPL and WIOA to ensure performance accountability, to meet the needs of local \nemployers and participants, and to ensure informed customer choice.\n\nProposed paragraph (g) lists the information that training providers are required to provide as part of their \napplication. As discussed in paragraph (k), the Governor has broad discretion to prescribe additional types of \ninformation.\n\nProposed paragraph (h) establishes two additional requirements concerning performance, cost, and information \ncollection. Proposed paragraph (h)(1) states that eligible providers must submit performance and cost information \nrequired by paragraph (g) and the Governor's procedure to the State (WIOA secs. 122(b)(1) and (2)). In \naccordance with the State accountability and flexibility intended by WIOA, the timeframe and manner for submitting \nthis information is to be determined by the State but at least every 2 years. Proposed paragraph (h)(2) states that \nthe collection of information required to demonstrate compliance with the criteria cannot be unduly burdensome or \ncostly to providers, citing to WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv).\n\nProposed paragraph (i) explains that the Governor's eligibility procedure must provide for the State to biennially \nreview training provider eligibility information and assess the renewal of training provider eligibility, per WIOA sec. \n\n\n\n122(c)(2). In keeping with WIOA's emphasis on providing discretion to the Governor, the Department has not \nprescribed in paragraph (i) the timeline and manner in which this biennial review takes place. These particulars are \nto be established by State procedure. The Governor or State agency is not required to establish minimum levels of \nperformance, although the Department encourages them to do so. If minimum levels are established, the \nGovernor's procedure must state these requirements and the State may require eligible providers to meet them in \norder to remain eligible.\n\nProposed paragraph (j) requires the Governor's procedure to verify the status of registered apprenticeship \nprograms as a part of the biennial review of the State list. Although registered apprenticeship programs are not \nsubject to the same review procedures as other providers, the State must verify the status of the registered \napprenticeship programs in order to remove from the list any apprenticeship programs that are no longer registered.\n\nProposed paragraph (k) establishes that, as was the case under WIA, Local Boards may set additional criteria for \neligibility to provide services in a local area. WIOA includes this provision at sec. 122(b)(3).\n\nProposed paragraph (l) explains that the Governor may establish procedures for providing technical assistance in \norder to assist eligible providers in meeting these requirements. This is in addition to financial assistance the \nGovernor may provide, as described in proposed \u00a7 680.490.\n\nSection 680.470What is the procedure for registered apprenticeship programs that seek to be included on the \nState's eligible training provider list?\n\nWIOA encourages registered apprenticeship programs to be active partners in the public workforce system. These \nprograms are proven job-driven strategies that provide workers with career pathways and opportunities to earn \nwhile they learn. Under WIOA sec. 122(a)(3), a registered apprenticeship program is included on the list of ETPs so \nlong as the program remains registered. This allows a participant enrolled in a registered apprenticeship who is \neligible to use WIOA title I-B funds to use those funds toward apprentice training, consistent with their availability \nand limitations as prescribed by proposed \u00a7 680.300. The use of ITAs and other WIOA title I-B funds toward \napprenticeship training is further described in proposed \u00a7 680.330. Registered apprenticeship programs differ from \nother training providers in some respects, notably that a participant's enrollment occurs onlythrough an agreement \namong the participant, the registered apprenticeship program sponsor, and an employer.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.470 explains how registered apprenticeship programs are included and maintained on the ETPL. \nRegistered apprenticeship programs are not subject to the application procedures and information requirements of \nother training providers to be included on the ETPL, in light of the detailed application and vetting procedures under \nwhich apprenticeship programs become registered.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) requires registered apprenticeship programs to indicate interest in being on the State list \nof ETPs. While registered apprenticeship programs are automatically eligible, not all registered apprenticeship \nsponsors may wish to be included on the list. The Department proposes that the Governor's procedure include a \nmechanism for registered apprenticeship programs to indicate their interest.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) explains that a registered apprenticeship program will remain on the list until it loses its \nregistration or notifies the State that it no longer wishes to be included on the list.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) explains that when a registered apprenticeship program is included on the State ETPL, this \nallows an individual who eligible to use WIOA title I-B funds to use those funds toward apprentice training, \nconsistent with their availability and limitations as prescribed by proposed \u00a7 680.300.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) addresses performance reporting requirements for apprenticeship programs. Registered \napprenticeship programs are not subject to the same information reporting requirements as other training programs. \nHowever, in light of WIOA's emphasis on performance accountability and informed customer choice, the \nDepartment encourages Governors to consult with the State and Local Boards, the Department's Office of \nApprenticeship, recognized State apprenticeship agencies (where they exist in the Governor's State), or other \nState agencies, to establish voluntary reporting of performance information.\n\n\n\nSection 680.480May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.480 describes enforcement provisions that are largely unchanged from WIA. The Governor has the \nability to remove training providers or programs of training services from the State list according to the Governor's \neligibility and review procedures. Under WIOA sec. 122(f), States must remove from the eligibility list any providers \nthat willfully supply false performance information or that substantially violate requirements of WIOA. Under WIOA, \na provider may also be removed from the list following the Governor's biennial review of the provider's program. \nThese provisions support key principles of WIOA by reinforcing performance accountability and ensuring the high \nquality of training programs made available.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) affirms that a provider must deliver positive results and provide accurate information in \norder to maintain eligibility.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) explains that if a provider intentionally provides inaccurate information or substantially \nviolates any provision of WIOA or its regulations the provider must be removed from the State list for a period of not \nless than 2 years and is liable to repay all adult and dislocated worker funds it received during the period of non-\ncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures which individual or entity is responsible for making these \ndeterminations and the process by which the determination will be made, which must include an opportunity for a \nhearing.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) allows the Governor to remove a program or programs from the list for failing to meet \nState-established criteria or performance levels. The Department seeks comment on how to strengthen \nenforcement with non-compliant providers over time.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor must establish an appeal procedure for providers to appeal a \ndenial of eligibility under this section. An appeals process is required by WIOA sec. 122 (c)(1). Proposed \u00a7 \n683.630(b) explains the appeal process for the denial or termination of a training provider's eligibility.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) provides that a local area may remove a program or programs from the list for failing to \nmeet higher local standards. The local area must also provide the program with an appeal process.\n\nSection 680.490What kind of performance and cost information must eligible training providers provide for each \nprogram of training?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.490 describes the performance information that providers are required to submit to the State in \norder to establish or renew eligibility, as described in WIOA sec. 122(b)(2).\n\nProposed paragraph (a) requires ETPs to submit performance information at least every 2 years, according to \nprocedures established by the Governor. While the Governor may require reporting at more frequent intervals, the \nDepartment interprets WIOA sec. 122 to require that provider performance information for eligibility purposes must \nbe submitted to the State at least biennially.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) list the program-specific performance information, described in WIOA sec. \n122, that must be submitted by training providers. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) includes a cross-reference to the \nperformance elements described at WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV). These elements are further discussed in \nproposed \u00a7 680.460(g)(i) through (iv). Proposed paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) list additional information that must \nbe supplied by providers; this includes information on post-secondary credentials offered, program costs, and the \ncompletion rate for WIOA participants in the program.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) explains that the Governor may require any additional performance information that he or \nshe considers appropriate for determining or renewing eligibility. Separate reporting requirements for the State's \nETP performance reports under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4) are addressed in \u00a7 677.230.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) emphasizes the collaborative relationship between a State and its training providers and \nexplains that the Governor must assist providers in supplying the information required of them under WIOA and the \nproposed regulations. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) states the statutory requirement, at WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv), \n\n\n\nthat the Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of information. Proposed \nparagraphs (d)(2) and (3) explain that the Governor may provide technical and other assistance to providers in \nhelping them to meet the performance requirements and that funds reserved for statewide activities under WIOA \nsec. 134 (a)(2)(B) may be used for this purpose. While WIOA emphasizes performance accountability, it is also \nimportant to assist ETPs in maintaining their eligibility, especially as training providers adjust to the more \ndemanding reporting requirements of WIOA.\n\nSection 680.500How is the State list of eligible training providers disseminated?\n\nThe public's ability to access and easily understand the State ETPL and its accompanying information are \ncornerstones of informed customer choice and transparency. In keepingwith WIOA's intent for program alignment \nand service integration, the Department proposes strengthening the distribution of the list to emphasize \ndissemination to the public through one- stop partner programs in addition to the one-stop system. The ETP \nperformance reports at WIOA sec. 116(d)(4) are addressed separately in \u00a7 677.230, which requires the \ncoordinated dissemination of the performance reports with the ETPL and the information required to accompany \nthe list.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.500 explains the requirements for distributing the list and accompanying information about the \nprograms and providers on the list. These requirements recognize the central importance of the list as the means to \nprovide participants, as consumers of employment and training activities, effective choices among programs and \nproviders of these services. As discussed previously, informed consumer choice is a key principle under WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) requires the State to disseminate the list with accompanying performance and cost \ninformation to Local Boards in the State and to members of the public online including Web sites and searchable \ndatabases, through whatever means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers, including the one-\nstop delivery system and its program partners. Local Boards must disseminate the list through the one-stop system \nas well, as described in proposed \u00a7 680.430(c)(3). Proposed paragraph (b) requires the list to be updated \nregularly, while provider eligibility is reviewed biennially. The Department is making a distinction between the \neligibility of individual providers and updates to the actual list because the Department anticipates the list may be \nupdated on an on-going basis, even though the review of a particular provider's eligibility status may occur \nbiennially.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) requires the State list and accompanying information to be easily available to all one-stop \ncustomers through the one-stop system and its partner programs. The State list is a key piece of the State one-\nstop system. As such, it must be made available to individuals seeking information on training programs as well as \nparticipants receiving career services funded under WIOA and other programs. Proposed paragraph (c) further \nexplains that the list must be available to individuals who are eligible for training under WIOA as well as to \nindividuals whose training is supported by other one-stop partners.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) describes the information that must accompany the list to help participants in making \ninformed choices regarding training programs and providers. Proposed paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) describe the \ninformation that must accompany the list, including recognized post-secondary credentials offered, other \ninformation as may be required by the Governor's eligibility criteria, and performance and cost information. The \ninformation available for programs in the initial eligibility stage will be different from, and less extensive than, the \ninformation available from programs in the continuing eligibility stage.\n\nProposed paragraph (d)(3) includes the requirement that the State must disseminate the provider list with \u201cother \nappropriate information.\u201d The Department interprets this language to include the performance and cost information \ndescribed at \u00a7 680.490.\n\nProposed paragraph (d)(4) states that the Governor may include any additional information to accompany the list \nas he or she considers appropriate. The Department encourages States to include any information that, consistent \nwith WIOA's goal of promoting consumer choice, will assist participants in choosing training activities and providers.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (e) requires, as described in WIOA sec. 122(d)(3), that the accompanying information must \nnot reveal personally identifiable information about an individual participant. In addition, disclosure of personally \nidentifiable information from an education record must be carried out in accordance with the FERPA, including the \ncircumstances relating to prior written consent.\n\nThe Department is interested in comments on specific ways to structure the accompanying information so that it \nprovides a complete and easily understandable picture of provider performance but is not so detailed or complex \nthat it discourages users from consulting it or limits its utility to the lay person. Should, for example, there be a \nsummary sheet that is easy and quick to read and, if so, what information must be on the summary sheet?\n\nSection 680.510In what ways can a Local Board supplement the information available from the State list?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.510 explains that Local Boards may choose to supplement the criteria and information \nrequirements established by the Governor's procedure in order to facilitate informed consumer choice in a local \narea.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) states that a Local Board may require that providers of training services furnish additional \ncriteria and information as allowed under WIOA sec. 122(b)(3). These requirements impact the provision of services \nin the local area involved.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) explain the type of additional information that the Local Board may require \nproviders to supply in their application to become eligible. These provisions are largely unchanged from the WIA \nregulations. The Local Board may request that the provider of training services explain how the training program \nspecifically links to occupations that are in demand within the local area. The Local Board may also request specific \nprogram performance and cost information particular to a local area where programs are offered at multiple sites. \nThe Department further explains that Local Boards may request information from training providers that indicates \nhow programs are responsive to these local requirements, as provided for in WIOA sec. 122(b)(3).\n\nSection 680.520May individuals choose training providers located outside of the local area?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.520 explains that an individual may choose a training provider located outside the local area, and, \nin some instances, in other States. States may enter into reciprocity agreements with other States under which \nproviders of training services are allowed to accept ITAs provided by another State. Providers of training services \nthat are located outside the local area may not be subject to State eligibility procedures if the provider has been \ndetermined eligible by another State with such an agreement. The option to enter into reciprocity agreements \ndiminishes the burden on States and providers of training services to be subject to duplicative procedures and is \nallowable under WIOA sec. 122(g). This provision also expands the array of training options available for individuals \nseeking training.\n\nSection 680.530What requirements apply to providers of on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker \ntraining, and other training exceptions?\n\nIn proposed \u00a7 680.530, the Department explains that providers of OJT, customized training, incumbent worker \ntraining, internships, paid or unpaid work experience, or transitional employment are not subject to the eligibility \nrequirements under WIOAsecs. 122(a)-(f), but are required to provide performance information established by the \nGovernor. The Department further explains that the local one-stop operator is required to collect and disseminate \ninformation that identifies these providers as meeting the Governor's performance criteria. Although these providers \nare not included on the State ETPL they are considered to be eligible providers of training services.\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Priority and Special Populations\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe services provided with adult funds can be a pathway to the middle class for low-income adults, public \nassistance recipients, and individuals who are basic skills deficient. The proposed regulations implement the \nstatutorily-required priority for the use of adult funds. This subpart contains proposed regulations about how \nparticipants from certain populations are able to access adult and dislocated worker services and establish priority \n\n\n\naccess to these services. WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E) provides that priority must be given to recipients of public \nassistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient. Under WIA, this priority \napplies only when adult funds are limited. Under WIOA, however, priority access to services by members of this \ngroup applies automatically. Nonetheless, WIOA allows one-stop operators to provide individualized career services \nto individuals who are not members of these groups, if determined appropriate by the one-stop operator.\n\nThe Department strongly encourages close cooperation between WIOA-funded programs and other Federal and \nState sources of assistance for job seekers. Coordination between WIOA-funded programs and the TANF program \nis a crucial element in serving individuals who are on public assistance. TANF is a required partner in the one-stop \ndelivery system. Through close cooperation, each program's participants will have access to a much broader range \nof services to promote employment retention and self-sufficiency than if they relied only on the services available \nunder a single program.\n\nIn this subpart, the Department explains how displaced homemakers may be served with both adult and dislocated \nworker funds. Under WIOA, a displaced homemaker qualifies as an \u201cindividual with a barrier to employment\u201d (see \nproposed \u00a7 680.320(b) and its discussion above). WIOA provides a focus on serving \u201cindividuals with a barrier to \nemployment\u201d to ensure they have opportunities to enter meaningful employment; this term is defined in WIOA sec. \n3(24). Additionally, displaced homemakers meet the definition of a \u201cdislocated worker,\u201d as defined in WIOA sec. \n3(15)(D). The proposed regulations implement WIOA's requirements and effectuate its purpose to aid displaced \nhomemakers, whose work, albeit without a formal connection to the workforce, is recognized for its value, but who \nmay need WIOA services to develop further work skills. WIOA also expands the definition of displaced homemakers \nto include dependent spouses of the Armed Forces on active duty to ensure they have access to WIOA title I \nservices.\n\nThis subpart ensures that veterans and certain service members have access to adult and dislocated worker \nprograms. Under WIOA, as was the case under WIA, veterans receive priority of service in all Department-funded \nemployment and training programs. The proposed regulations describe what is meant by \u201cpriority of service.\u201d The \nDepartment has proposed a regulation consistent with guidance it issued in Training and Employment Guidance \nLetter (TEGL) 22-04 that separating service members meet the eligibility requirements for dislocated worker \nactivities. This proposed regulation will ensure that service members will have access to the full array of services \navailable through the one-stop delivery system.\n\nSection 680.600What priority must be given to low-income adults and public assistance recipients and individuals \nwho are basic skills deficient served with adult funds under title I?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.600 provides priority access to career services and training services funded under WIOA sec. \n134(c)(2)(A)(xii) and adult title I. In \u00a7 678.430(b), the Department proposes to categorize these services as \nindividualized career services. WIOA builds on the priority given under WIA to providing training services to low-\nincome individuals and individuals receiving public assistance. Under WIOA, the priority also extends to individuals \nwho are basic skills deficient.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.600(a) explains that individualized career services and training services must be given on a priority \nbasis to low-income adults, public assistance recipients, and individuals who are basic skills deficient in the local \narea under the WIOA adult program. For adults, the term \u201cbasic skills deficient\u201d is defined in WIOA sec. 3(5)(B) and \napplies when an individual is unable to compute or solve problems, or read, write, or speak English, at a level \nnecessary to function on the job, in the individual's family, or in society. Priority must be given regardless of funding \nlevels.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.600(b) requires States and local areas to establish criteria for providing priority to individualized \ncareer services and training services with WIOA adult funds under title I. The criteria may include other resources \nand funds for providing career and training-related services in the local area, as well as the needs of specific groups \nin the local area, as well as other factors the local areas determines appropriate.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.600(c) clarifies that while priority must be given under WIOA adult funds to low-income individuals, \npublic assistance recipients, or individuals who are basic skills deficient for individualized career services and \ntraining services, the Local Board and Governor may establish a process that also gives priority to other individuals.\n\nSection 680.610Does the statutory priority for use of adult funds also apply to dislocated worker funds?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.610 clarifies that the statutory priority for low-income individuals, public assistance recipients, and \nindividuals who are basic skills deficient only applies to the WIOA adult program and not the WIOA dislocated \nworker program.\n\nSection 680.620How does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program relate to the one-stop delivery \nsystem?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.620 explains how the TANF program relates to the one-stop delivery system. Cooperation among \nrequired partner programs is vital to build pathways to the middle class for individuals on public assistance and \nlow-income individuals. Partners, working together, can ensure the best mix of services for each individual seeking \nto enhance their lives and employment.\n\nUnder WIOA, TANF is a required partner in the one-stop system, unless the Governor opts out. TANF provides \nassistance to needy families and by coordinating closely with WIOA local areas can ensure programs and services \ninclude the needs of individuals on public assistance. This section encourages cooperation among the WIOA and \nTANF programs to maximizeservices available to participants eligible under both programs.\n\nSection 680.630How does a displaced homemaker qualify for services under title I?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.630 explains displaced homemakers' eligibility for dislocated worker activities. A displaced \nhomemaker can qualify for either adult or dislocated worker funds. First, if an individual meets the definition of a \ndisplaced homemaker under WIOA sec. 3(16), the individual is eligible for dislocated worker career and training \nservices. Second, the displaced homemaker may be served with title I adult funds if the individual meets the \neligibility requirements for this program; generally priority in the adult program is given to low-income individuals, \nindividuals on public assistance, or if they lack basic work skills. A State may also use reserve funds that target \ndisplaced homemakers in which they would be eligible.\n\nUnder WIOA, the definition of a displaced homemaker is expanded to explicitly include dependent spouses of a \nmember of the Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in sec. 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code) and \nwhose family income is significantly reduced because of a deployment, a call or order to active duty, a permanent \nchange in station, or the service-connected death or disability of the service member.\n\nSection 680.640May an individual with a disability whose family does not meet income eligibility criteria under the \nAct be eligible for priority as a low-income adult?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.640 explains that under WIOA an individual with a disability whose family does not meet income \neligibility criteria will still qualify for priority as a low-income adult if the individual meets the low-income criteria in \nWIOA sec. 3(36). Additionally, the Department proposes that if an individual with a disability meets the income \neligibility criteria for payments under any Federal, State, or local public assistance program that individual will also \nbe eligible for priority as a low-income adult consistent with WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(i). This includes recipients of \nSNAP, TANF, and recipients of the Supplemental Security Income program.\n\nSection 680.650Do veterans receive priority of service under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.650 builds on the Department's efforts to ensure veterans are entitled to priority of service in all \nDepartment-funded training programs under 38 U.S.C. 4215 and 20 CFR 1010. The proposal states that veterans \nmust receive priority of service in programs for which they are eligible. In programs that require income-based \neligibility to receive services, amounts paid while on active duty or paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nfor VR, disability, or other related VA programs are not considered as income when determining low-income status. \nGenerally, this means many separating service members may qualify for the WIOA adult program because it \nprovides priority for low-income individuals and military earnings are not to be considered income for this purpose.\n\n\n\nSection 680.660Are separating service members eligible for dislocated worker activities under the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.660 explains, consistent with the Department's long-standing policy, that service members exiting \nthe military qualify as dislocated workers. Dislocated worker funds under title I can help separating service \nmembers enter or reenter the civilian labor force.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.660(a) clarifies that a notice of separation, a DD-214 from the Department of Defense, or other \nappropriate documentation that shows a separation or imminent separation from the Armed Forces qualifies as a \nnotice of termination or layoff required for the dislocated worker definition.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.660(b) clarifies that a separating service member meets the dislocated worker requirements \nconcerning UC.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.660(c) clarifies that a separating service member meets the dislocated worker requirement that an \nindividual is unlikely to return to his or her previous industry or occupation.\n\n7. Subpart F\u2014Work-Based Training\n\nIntroduction\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 680.700 through 680.850 are proposed regulations for work-based training under WIOA. The \nproposed regulations apply to (OJT) training, customized training, incumbent worker training, and transitional jobs. \nThe proposed regulations include specific information about general, contract, and employer payment \nrequirements. Work-based training is employer-driven with the goal of unsubsidized employment after participation. \nGenerally, work-based training involves a commitment by an employer or employers to fully employ successful \nparticipants after they have completed the program. Registered apprenticeship training is a type of work-based \ntraining that can be funded in the adult and dislocated worker programs; additionally pre-apprenticeships may be \nused to provide work experiences that can help participants obtain the skills needed to be placed into a registered \napprenticeship.\n\nWork-based training can be an effective training strategy that can provide additional opportunities for participants \nand employers in both finding high quality work and in developing a high quality workforce. Each of these work-\nbased models can be effectively used to target different job seeker and employer needs. OJT is primarily designed \nto provide a participant with the knowledge and skills necessary for the full performance of the job. Incumbent \nworker training is designed to ensure that employees of a company are able to gain the skills necessary to retain \nemployment and advance within the company or to provide the skills necessary to avert a layoff. Customized \ntraining is designed to provide local areas with flexibility to ensure that training meets the unique needs of the job \nseekers and employers or groups of employers.\n\nBoth training providers and OJT providers must be providing the highest quality training to participants. OJT \ncontracts must be continually monitored so that WIOA funds provided through OJT contracts are providing \nparticipants with successful employment. It is important that OJTs have a strong ability to provide participants with \nin-demand skills with opportunities for career advancement and employers with a skilled workforce.\n\nUnder WIA, States could apply for a waiver to increase reimbursement amounts of the OJT wage rate. Under \nWIOA, the statute enables a Governor or Local Board to increase this rate to 75 percent without a waiver. This \nchange is designed to give States and Local Boards additional flexibility in developing OJT opportunities that work \nbest with the participating employers and in the local economy.\n\nWIOA also explicitly allows for incumbent worker training at the local level. WIOA introduces incumbent worker \ntraining as an allowable type of training for a local area to provide. Under WIA, States could use their statewide \nactivities funds to conduct incumbent worker training, and local areas could conduct incumbent worker training \nwith an approved waiver. Incumbent worker training is designed to either assist workers in obtaining the skills \nnecessary to retain employment or to avert layoffs and must increase both a participant's and a \ncompany'scompetitiveness. Local areas may use up to 20 percent of their local adult and dislocated worker funds \n\n\n\nfor incumbent worker training. In this proposed regulation, the Department seeks to ensure that incumbent worker \ntraining is targeted to improving the skills and competitiveness of the participant and increasing the competitiveness \nof the employer. The training should, wherever possible, allow the participant to gain industry-recognized training \nexperience, and ultimately should lead to an increase in wages. To receive incumbent worker funding under WIOA, \nan incumbent worker must have an employer-employee relationship, and an established employment history, with \nthe employer. Incumbent workers are employed at the time of their participation, and the contract funds are paid \nto the employer for training provided to the incumbent worker either to avert a lay-off or otherwise retain \nemployment. An ideal incumbent worker training would be one where a participant acquires new skills allowing him \nor her to move into a higher skilled and higher paid job within the company, thus allowing the company to hire a job \nseeker to backfill the incumbent worker's position. The Departments are seeking comment on the best way to \nstructure these arrangements to maximize the likelihood that this ideal outcome occurs.\n\nWIOA also discusses transitional jobs as a way for adults and dislocated workers with barriers to employment who \nare experiencing chronic unemployment or have an inconsistent work history to develop a work history and basic \nwork skills essential to keeping a job. Transitional jobs are time-limited, subsidized employment in the private, non-\nprofit, or public sectors.\n\nSection 680.700What are the requirements for on-the-job training?\n\nOJT is a type of training that is provided by an employer to a participant. During the training, the participant is \nengaged in productive work in a job for which he or she is paid, and the training provides the knowledge or skills \nessential to the full and adequate performance of the job. Studies over the past 3 decades have found that in the \nUnited States formal OJT programs have positive employment and earnings outcomes. (2) OJT is a critical tool that \ncan help jobseekers enter into successful employment.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.700(a) explains that OJT may be provided under contract with an employer in the public, private \nnon-profit, or private sectors. Under WIOA, the reimbursement level may be raised up to 75 percent of the wage \nrate, in contrast to 50 percent of the wage rate under WIA. Typically, the OJT contract provides reimbursement to \nthe employer for a portion of the wage rate of the participant for the extraordinary costs of providing training and \nsupervision related to the training.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.700(b) states that contracts must not be entered into with an employer that received payments \nunder previous contracts under WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of failing to provide OJT \nparticipants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages, employment benefits, or \nworking conditions at the same level as other employees performing the same type of work for the same length of \ntime.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.700(c) continues the requirement under WIA that OJT contracts must be limited in duration to the \ntime necessary for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which they are receiving the OJT training. \nWhen determining the length of the contract, the Governor or Local Boards must take into account the skill \nrequirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, \nand the participant's individual employment plan.\n\nSection 680.710What are the requirements for on-the-job training contracts for employed workers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.710 is unchanged from the WIA regulations. The proposal identifies the requirements for OJT \ncontracts used to train employed workers.\n\nSection 680.720What conditions govern on-the-job training payments to employers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.720 identifies the conditions that govern OJT payment to employers. OJT payments are to be \ncompensation to the employer for the extraordinary costs associated with training participants. The Department \ndoes not seek to define through this regulation what \u201cextraordinary costs\u201d are, and is seeking public comment on \nthis issue. The Department generally believes extraordinary costs are those costs the employer has in training \nparticipants who may not yet have the knowledge or skills to obtain the job through an employer's normal \nrecruitment process.\n\n\n\nSection 680.730Under what conditions may a Governor or Local Board raise the on-the-job training reimbursement \nrate up to 75 percent of the wage rate?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.730(a) identifies the factors that a Governor or Local Board must consider and document in \ndetermining whether to raise the reimbursement rate for OJT contracts up to 75 percent of the wage rate.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.730(1) allows for the wage rate to be up to 75 percent after taking into consideration, among other \nfactors, the characteristics of the participants (WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(H)(ii)(I)), including whether the OJT contract is \nleading to employment for individuals with barriers to employment. Proposed \u00a7 680.730(2) states that the size of \nthe employer is a factor that must be considered; proposed \u00a7 680.730(3) states that the quality of employer-\nprovided training and advancement opportunities is a factor that must be considered. Proposed \u00a7 680.730(4) states \nthat the Governor or Local Board may consider other factors in determining whether it is appropriate to raise the \nreimbursement rate. Such other factors may include the number of employees participating, wage and benefit levels \nof employees both before and after OJT completion, and relation of training to the competitiveness of the \nparticipant. Proposed \u00a7 680.730(b) requires that the Governor or Local Board must document the factors that they \nconsidered when deciding to increase the wage reimbursement levels above 50 percent up to 75 percent. The \nDepartment is seeking comments from the public on how the relation of training to the competitiveness of the \nparticipant must be analyzed when implementing this provision.\n\nSection 680.740How can on-the-job training funds be used to support placing participants into a registered \napprenticeship program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.740(a) clarifies that an OJT contract may be made with a registered apprenticeship program for \ntraining participants. OJT contracts are made with the employer, and registered apprenticeships generally involve \nboth classroom and on-the-job instruction. The OJT contract may be made to support the OJT portion of the \nregistered apprenticeship program. The Department also notes that registered apprenticeship programs vary in \nlength, so the OJT may support the entire duration of training while other meansmay support the beginning of the \nregistered apprenticeship training. The Department is seeking comments on what an appropriate maximum amount \nof time would be for OJT funds to be used to support participants in registered apprenticeships.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) clarifies that in some instances a registered apprenticeship is operated by the employer \nand in others it is operated by a training provider with a direct connection to an employer or group of employers. If \na participant is in a registered apprenticeship and employed as part of that arrangement, then the OJT must be \ntreated as other OJTs provided for employed workers as described in \u00a7 680.710. If a participant is in a registered \napprenticeship but is unemployed, the OJT funds may be provided in same manner as other OJTs as described in \n\u00a7 680.700.\n\nSection 680.750Can Individual Training Account and on-the-job training funds be combined to support placing \nparticipants into a registered apprenticeship program?\n\nLocal areas may use an ITA to support classroom portions of a registered apprenticeship program and OJT funds \nmay be used to support the on-the-job portions of the registered apprenticeship program. This is to ensure local \nareas have maximum flexibility in serving participants and supporting their placement into registered apprenticeship \nprograms.\n\nSection 680.760What is customized training?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.760 explains that customized training is to be used to meet the special requirements of an \nemployer or group of employers, conducted with a commitment by the employer to employ all individuals upon \nsuccessful completion of training. The employer must pay for a significant share of the cost of the training.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.760(a) and (b) are unchanged from WIA. In paragraph (c) under WIA employers were required to \npay for not less than 50 percent of the cost of the training, WIOA removes the precise figure and says that the \nemployer must pay for a \u201csignificant cost of the training.\u201d\n\nSection 680.770What are the requirements for customized training for employed workers?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.770 identifies the eligibility requirements for employed workers to receive customized training. \nThere may be instances where a worker is employed but then receives customized training under contract \nbetween the local area and the employer. In order for the employed worker to qualify, the employee must not be \nearning a self-sufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy, the requirements of customized training in \nproposed \u00a7 680.760 must be met, and the training must incorporate new technologies, processes, or procedures; \nskills upgrades; workplace literacy; or other appropriate purposes, as identified by the Local Board. Proposed \u00a7 \n680.770 is unchanged from WIA. The Department is interested in comments that discuss how to distinguish \ncustomized training from OJT. Should they focus on different service populations, different training strategies, or \ndifferent types of jobs?\n\nSection 680.780Who is an \u201cincumbent worker\u201d for purposes of statewide and local employment and training \nactivities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.780 is designed to update the definition of an incumbent worker from WIA. An incumbent worker \nis employed with the company when the incumbent worker training starts. The Department is seeking comment on \nthe appropriate amount of time an employee must have worked for the employer before being eligible for \nincumbent worker training. The Department is proposing a minimum of 6 months, but is seeking substantive \ncomments on this proposal. The Department is also seeking comments on how incumbent worker training should \nincrease the competitiveness of the employee or employer for the purposes of identifying high-quality incumbent \nworker opportunities.\n\nSection 680.790What is incumbent worker training?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.790 discusses the purposes served by and the conditions relating to incumbent worker training as \nprescribed by WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)(B).\n\nIncumbent worker training is designed to meet the special requirements of an employer (including a group of \nemployers) to retain a skilled workforce or avert the need to lay off employees by assisting the workers in \nobtaining the skills necessary to retain employment. The employer or group of employers must pay for a portion of \nthe cost of providing the training to incumbent workers.\n\nSection 680.800What funds may be used for incumbent worker training?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.800 provides that under WIOA, local areas may use up to 20 percent of their combined total of \nadult and dislocated worker allotments for incumbent worker training. States may use their statewide activities \nfunds and Rapid Response funds for statewide incumbent worker training activities.\n\nSection 680.810What criteria must be taken into account for an employer to be eligible to receive local incumbent \nworker funds?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.810 provides the criteria a Local Board must use when deciding on using funds for incumbent \nworker training with an employer. Paragraphs (a) through (c) address participant characteristics, the relationship of \nthe training to the competitiveness of the participant and employer, and other factors that the Local Board \ndetermines appropriate. These factors may include the number of employees in training, wages and benefits \n(including post-training increases), and the existence of other training opportunities provided by the employer.\n\nSection 680.820Are there cost sharing requirements for local area incumbent worker training?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.820 clarifies that there are cost sharing requirements for employers participating in incumbent \nworker training to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of providing training to incumbent workers of the \nemployers.\n\nSection 680.830What is a transitional job?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.830 explains that transitional jobs are time-limited work experiences that are subsidized for \nindividuals with barriers to employment who are chronically unemployed or have an inconsistent work history. \n\n\n\nThese jobs may be in the public, private, or non-profit sectors. Transitional jobs can be effective solutions for \nindividuals to gain necessary work experience that they would otherwise not be able to get through training or an \nOJT contract. The goal is to establish a work history for the individual, demonstrate work success, and develop \nskills that lead to entry into unsubsidized employment. The difference between a transitional job and an OJT \ncontract is that in a transitional job there is no expectation that the individual will continue his or her hire with the \nemployer after the work experience is complete.\n\nSection 680.840What funds may be used for transitional jobs?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.840 states that local areas may reserve up to 10 percent of their combined total of adult and \ndislocated worker allotments for transitional jobs and must be providedalong with comprehensive career services \nand supportive services.\n\nSection 680.850May funds provided to employers for work-based training be used to assist, promote, or deter \nunion organizing?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.850 clarifies that there is an explicit prohibition on the use of work-based training funds which \nincludes OJT, customized training, incumbent worker training, transitional jobs or registered apprenticeship for \nassisting, promoting, or deterring union organizing activities.\n\n8. Subpart G\u2014Supportive Services\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis section defines the scope and purpose of supportive services and the requirements governing their \ndisbursement. A key principle in WIOA is to provide local areas with the authority to make policy and administrative \ndecisions and the flexibility to tailor the workforce system to the needs of the local community. To ensure maximum \nflexibility, the regulations provide local areas the discretion to provide the supportive services they deem \nappropriate subject to the limited conditions prescribed by WIOA. Local Boards must develop policies and \nprocedures to ensure coordination with other entities to ensure non-duplication of resources and services and to \nestablish limits on the amount and duration of such services. Local Boards are encouraged to develop policies and \nprocedures that ensure that supportive services are WIOA-funded only when these services are not available \nthrough other agencies and that the services are necessary for the individual to participate in title I activities. \nSupportive services may be made available to anyone participating in title I activities.\n\nNeeds-related payments are designed to provide a participant with resources for the purpose of enabling them to \nparticipate in training services. The Department recognizes that many individuals in need of training services may \nnot have the resources available to participate in the training. Needs-related payments can help individuals meet \ntheir non-training expenses and help them to complete training successfully. A participant must be enrolled in a \ntraining program in order to receive needs-related payments.\n\nSection 680.900What are supportive services for adults and dislocated workers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.900 explains that supportive services are services, such as transportation, child care, dependent \ncare, housing, and needs-related payments, that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in career and \ntraining services. Referrals to supportive services are one of the career services that must be made available to \nadults and dislocated workers through the one-stop delivery system. The proposed section also provides that Local \nBoards, in consultation with the one-stop partners and other community service providers, must develop a policy on \nsupportive services that ensures resource and service coordination in the local area. The policy must address \nprocedures for referral to such services, including how such services will be funded when they are not otherwise \navailable from other sources. When developing this policy, the Department encourages Local Boards to consider \nincorporating local legal aid services. Legal aid is able to reduce barriers to employment and establish employment \neligibility such as by helping secure a driver's license, expunging criminal records, and addressing debts or credit \nreporting issues.\n\nIn the context of a coordinated one-stop delivery system envisioned by WIOA, the one-stop needs to take into \nconsideration all of the available supportive service resources so that participants may receive the best supportive \n\n\n\nservices available and to ensure that funds are spent to maximize participants' opportunity to participate in career \nand training services.\n\nSection 680.910When may supportive services be provided to participants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.910 states that supportive services may only be provided to participants who are in career or \ntraining services, unable to obtain supportive services through other programs providing supportive services, and \nthat they must be provided in a manner necessary to enable individuals to participate in career or training services. \nThe proposed rule removes references to \u201ccore\u201d and \u201cintensive\u201d services, terms now characterized as \u201ccareer \nservices\u201d under WIOA.\n\nSection 680.920Are there limits on the amounts or duration of funds for supportive services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.920 provides that Local Boards may establish limits on providing supportive services or allow the \none-stop operator to establish limits, including caps on the amount of funding and length of time for supportive \nservices to be made available. The rule text makes no changes from WIA.\n\nSection 680.930What are needs-related payments?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.930 defines needs-related payments as financial assistance to a participant for the purpose of \nenabling the individual to participate in training. Needs-related payments are a type of supportive service that \nprovides direct financial payments to a participant, and unlike other supportive services, the participant must be \nenrolled in training to receive needs-related payments. The rule text makes no substantive changes from WIA; it \nprovides updated citations to WIOA.\n\nSection 680.940What are the eligibility requirements for adults to receive needs-related payments?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.940 clarifies that for an adult to receive a needs-related payment he or she must be unemployed, \nnot qualify for or have ceased to qualify for UC, and be enrolled in a training program.\n\nSection 680.950What are the eligibility requirements for dislocated workers to receive needs-related payments?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.950 provides that dislocated workers may receive needs-related payments if they are \nunemployed, ceased to qualify for UC or trade readjustment allowance under Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), \nand be enrolled in training by certain deadlines. It makes one clarification from WIA in that it provides that the \ndislocated worker must be enrolled in training.\n\nSection 680.960May needs-related payments be paid while a participant is waiting to start training classes?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.960 states that payments may be provided if the participant has been accepted into a program that \nwill begin within 30 calendar days.\n\nSection 680.970How is the level of needs-related payments determined?\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.970(a) explains that the needs-related payment level for adults must be established by the Local \nBoard. The Department recognizes the costs of different labor markets and believes that payment levels are best \nset locally to ensure the needs-related payments meet their purpose of enabling participants to receive training \nservices.\n\nProposed \u00a7 680.970(b) explains how needs-related payments for dislocated workers are calculated. If the \nparticipant is a dislocated worker and has established eligibility for UC, the needs-related payment must not \nexceed thehigher of the weekly level of UC the participant receives or an amount equal to the poverty level for an \nequivalent time period. If the participant qualifies for dislocated worker services, but not for UC as a result of the \nqualifying layoff, the needs-related payment must not exceed the higher of the weekly level of UC the participant \nwould receive if she or he had qualified, if the weekly benefit amount that the participant would have received can \nbe determined, or an amount equal to the poverty level for an equivalent time period. Local Boards must adopt \npolicies to adjust the weekly payment level if there are changes in total family income.\n\nE. Part 681\u2014Youth Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\n\nUnder WIOA, Federal, State, and local partnerships that put the youths' interests first will help the nation's \ndisconnected youth to succeed. The common performance measures across WIOA core programs, adult and youth \nprograms under WIOA title I, and Adult Education and Vocational Rehabilitation programs under WIOA titles II and \nIV provide a mechanism to support youth service alignment. WIOA envisions the Department's youth programs, \nincluding Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the youth formula-funded program, coordinating to support systems alignment \nand service delivery for youth. Local and State plans will articulate this vision of youth workforce investment \nactivities and help ensure a long-term supply of skilled workers and leaders in local communities.\n\nWIOA affirms the Department's commitment to providing high quality services for youth and young adults beginning \nwith career exploration and guidance, continued support for educational attainment, opportunities for skills training \nin in-demand industries and occupations, and culminating with a good job along a career pathway or enrollment in \npost-secondary education. All of the Department's youth-serving programs continue to promote evidence-based \nstrategies that also meet the highest levels of performance, accountability, and quality in preparing young people for \nthe workforce. The Department's focus on performance and accountability is emphasized through the \nimplementation of the new primary indicators of performance for eligible youth across programs and through their \nuse of the primary indicators for program management and decision-making.\n\nWIOA maintains WIA's focus on OSY in Job Corps and YouthBuild, while greatly increasing the focus on OSY in \nthe WIOA youth formula-funded program. The shift in policy to focus on those youth most in need is based on the \ncurrent state of youth employment. With an estimated 6 million 16-24 year olds in our country not employed or in \nschool, WIOA youth programs provide a continuum of services to help these young people navigate between the \neducational and workforce systems. The Department, working with its Education and Health and Human Services \npartners, plans to provide intensive technical assistance around meeting the needs of this population.\n\nWIOA calls for customer-focused services based on the needs of the individual participant. This includes the \ncreation of career pathways for youth in all title I youth programs, including a connection to career pathways as part \nof a youth's individual service strategy in the youth formula-funded program. In addition, many services under title I \nyouth programs are based on the individual needs of participants. WIOA also calls for this population to be \nintimately involved in the design and implementation of services so the youth voice is represented and their needs \nare being met.\n\nThis integrated vision also applies to the workforce system's other shared customer-employers. By repositioning \nyouth as an asset to employers with a need for skilled workers, the value of employers engaging the youth \nworkforce system and programs is enhanced. Employers are critical partners that provide meaningful growth \nopportunities for young people through work experiences that give them the opportunity to learn and apply skills in \nreal-world setting and ultimately jobs that young people are ready to fill given the opportunity.\n\nThe Department recognizes that much of this alignment and integration is already happening in local areas and \nregions across the country. WIOA aims to build upon these existing efforts through an emphasis on system \nalignment, an increased focus on serving OSY and those most in need, an emphasis on the needs of individual \nparticipants, and the prioritization of connections with employers, especially through work experience opportunities. \nThe Department recognizes that WIOA also includes major shifts in approach and is committed to working with the \nyouth workforce investment system to partner in the implementation of these changes through guidance and \ntechnical assistance.\n\nWIOA supersedes the youth formula-funded program under title I, subtitle B, chapter 2 Youth Workforce Investment \nActivities. It further aligns the WIOA youth program with the other ETA youth training programs, including \nYouthBuild and Job Corps, as well as with titles II and IV of WIOA by requiring common performance measures \nacross all core programs.\n\nWIOA includes a number of significant changes for the youth formula-funded program. The biggest change under \nWIOA is the shift to focus resources primarily on OSY. WIOA increases the minimum percentage of funds required \nto be spent on OSY from 30 percent to 75 percent. This intentional shift refocuses the program to serve OSY during \na time when large numbers of youth and young adults are out of school and not connected to the labor force. While \n\n\n\nthe Department recognizes this transition to serve more OSY will take time to implement, it is critical that States \nand local areas begin to incorporate strategies for recruiting and serving more OSY.\n\nThese strategies must incorporate strong framework services which must include intake, objective assessments, \nand the development of individual service strategy, case management, supportive services, and follow-up services. \nThey must also consider how to ensure that American Job Center staff have the requisite knowledge and sensitivity \nto the needs of OSY to effectively serve them. The Department plans to release subsequent guidance on these \nmatters but also welcomes comments at this time on preferred approaches.\n\nIn addition, WIOA includes a major focus on providing youth with work experience opportunities. WIOA prioritizes \nwork experiences with the requirement that local areas must spend a minimum of 20 percent of local area funds on \nwork experience. Under WIOA, work experience becomes the most important of the program elements. WIOA also \nintroduces five new program elements: Financial literacy; entrepreneurial skills training; services that provide labor \nmarket and employment information about in-demand industry sectors or occupations available in the local areas; \nactivities that help youth prepare for and transition to post-secondary education and training; and education offered \nconcurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation \nor occupational cluster.\n\nWIOA enhances the youth program design through an increased emphasis on individual participant needs by \nadding new components to the objective assessment and individual service strategy. WIOA incorporates career \npathways as part of both the objective assessment and development of the individual service strategy. In addition, \nthe individual service strategy must directly link to one or more of the performance indicators. The program design \nunder WIOA also includes effective connections to employers, including small employers, in in-demand industry \nsectors and occupations.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Standing Youth Committees\n\nSection 681.100What is a standing youth committee?\n\nThis proposed section describes a standing youth committee. WIOA eliminates the requirement for Local Boards to \nestablish a youth council; however, the Local Board may choose to establish, \u201ca standing committee to provide \ninformation and to assist with planning, operational, and other issues relating to the provision of services to youth, \nwhich must include CBOs with a demonstrated record of success in serving eligible youth\u201d (WIOA sec. \n107(b)(4)(A)(ii)). The Department recognizes the difficulty under WIA in some local areas in maintaining the \nrequired youth council partnerships. The Department encourages Local Boards to consider establishing standing \nyouth committees, taking advantage of the flexibility under WIOA to design standing youth committee membership \nto meet the local area's needs. Additionally, the law further clarifies that an existing youth council may be \ndesignated as the youth standing committee if they are fulfilling the requirements of a standing committee which \nmeans that they have members of the Local Board who have the appropriate experience and expertise in youth \neducational and workforce development (WIOA sec. 107(b)(4)(C)). The Department encourages Local Boards to \ndesignate high performing youth councils as standing youth committees if appropriate. Local Boards are \nresponsible for the oversight of youth programs. Under WIA, youth councils were mandated to fulfill this function for \nthe Board. Local Boards now may choose to fulfill the oversight responsibility, or have the discretion to delegate this \nfunction to a standing youth committee. If Local Boards choose not to delegate this function to a standing youth \ncommittee, they are responsible for conducting oversight of youth workforce investment activities under WIOA sec. \n129(c).\n\nSection 681.110Who is included on a standing youth committee?\n\nThis proposed section describes the members of a standing youth committee if the Local Board chooses to \nestablish such a committee based on WIOA secs. 107(b)(4)(A)(ii) and 129(c)(3)(C). The members must include a \nmember of the Local Board, who must chair the committee, members of CBOs with a demonstrated record of \nsuccess in serving eligible youth and other individuals with appropriate expertise and experience who are not \nmembers of the Local Board. The committee may also include parents, participants, and youth. A Local Board may \ndesignate an existing entity such as an effective youth council as the standing youth committee if its membership \nmeets the WIOA membership requirements.\n\n\n\nSection 681.120What does a standing youth committee do?\n\nThis proposed section describes the duties of a standing youth committee if the Local Board chooses to establish \nsuch a committee based on WIOA secs.107(b)(4)(A)(ii) and 129(c)(3)(C). The standing committee's main function is \nto inform and assist the Local Board in developing and overseeing a comprehensive youth program. The details of \nits responsibilities are assigned by the Local Board.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Eligibility for Youth Services\n\nSection 681.200Who is eligible for youth services?\n\nThis proposed section based on WIOA sec. 3(18) describes eligibility for the WIOA title I youth formula-funded \nprogram which includes two groups: In-school youth (ISY) and OSY and establishes specific criteria for each group. \nThe eligible WIOA title I youth population represents youth who face challenges and barriers to success in the labor \nmarket.\n\nSection 681.210Who is an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d?\n\nThis proposed section describes how one meets the eligibility for an OSY for purposes of the title I WIOA youth \nprogram. OSY youth must not attend any school, be between the ages of 16 and 24 at time of enrollment, and meet \none or more of a list of eight criteria. With one exception, the WIOA criteria are generally the same as those under \nWIA. The section clarifies that age is based on time of enrollment and as long as the individual meets the age \neligibility at time of enrollment they can continue to receive WIOA youth services beyond the age of 24. Unlike \nunder WIA or under the definition of an ISY, low income is not a requirement to meet eligibility for most categories \nof OSY under WIOA. However, low income is now a part of the criteria for youth who need additional assistance to \nenter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment. Also, WIOA has made youth with a \ndisability a separate eligibility criterion.\n\nIn addition, WIOA includes a new criterion: A youth who is within the age of compulsory school attendance, but has \nnot attended school for at least the most recent school year calendar quarter. Because school districts differ in what \nthey use for school year quarters, the time period of a school year quarter is based on how a local school district \ndefines its school year quarters. WIOA lists this criterion as the second on the list of eight that satisfy the third of the \nthree primary requirements.\n\nSection 681.220Who is an \u201cin-school youth\u201d?\n\nThis proposed section describes how one meets the eligibility for an ISY for purposes of the WIOA title I youth \nprogram. ISY youth must be attending school, including secondary or post-secondary school, be between the ages \nof 14 and 21 at time of enrollment, be low-income, and meet one or more of a list of seven criteria. These are \nessentially the same criteria as under WIA but the disability criterion has been separated from the \u201cneeds additional \nassistance\u201d criterion. The section clarifies that age is based on time of enrollment and as long as the individual \nmeets the age eligibility at time of enrollment they can continue to receive WIOA youth services beyond the age of \n21. WIOA includes a youth as low-income if he or she receives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced price lunch \nunder the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).\n\nSection 681.230What does \u201cschool\u201d refer to in the \u201cnot attending or attending any school\u201d in the out-of-school and \nin-school definitions?\n\nThe term school refers to both secondary and post-secondary school as defined by the applicable State law for \nsecondary and post-secondary institutions. This proposed section provides that for purposes of title I of WIOA, the \nDepartment does not consider providers of adult education under title II of WIOA, YouthBuildprograms, or Job \nCorps programs as schools. Therefore, if the only \u201cschool\u201d the youth attends is adult education provided under title \nII of WIOA, YouthBuild, or Job Corps, the Department will consider the individual an OSY youth for purposes of title \nI of WIOA youth program eligibility.\n\nWIOA emphasizes the importance of coordination among Federally-funded employment and training programs, \nincluding those authorized under titles I and II. Many disconnected youth age 16 to 24 meet eligibility requirements \nfor both WIOA title I youth activities and WIOA title II adult education. Co-enrollment between these two programs \n\n\n\ncan be very beneficial to disconnected youth as they can receive work experience and occupational skills through \ntitle I funding and literacy skills through title II funding. Because the eligibility for title II is similar to that for an OSY \nunder title I, an individual who is not enrolled or required to be enrolled in secondary school under State law, it is \nconsistent to consider such youth already enrolled in title II as an OSY for purposes of title I WIOA youth eligibility.\n\nSection 681.240When do local youth programs verify dropout status, particularly for youth attending alternative \nschools?\n\nThis proposed section provides that dropout status is determined at the time of enrollment for eligibility as an OSY \nand that once a youth is enrolled as an OSY, that status continues, for purposes of the 75 percent OSY enrollment \nrequirement, for the duration of the youth's enrollment, even if the youth later returns to a school. Because WIOA \ndoes not define the term alternative school, States must develop a definition. The Department advises States to \ndefine alternative school consistent with their State education agency alternative school definition. As of September \n2014, 43 States and the District of Columbia have formal definitions of alternative education. The intent of WIOA is \nto serve more OSY who are disconnected from school and work, while continuing to develop strategies and provide \nservices to ISY in collaboration with community partners.\n\nSection 681.250Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply to?\n\nThis proposed section discusses the low-income eligibility criteria for OSY and ISY. For OSY, only those youth who \nare the recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either basic skills deficient or \nan English language learner and youth who require additional assistance to enter or complete an educational \nprogram or to secure or hold employment must be low-income. For OSY who are subject to the justice system, \nhomeless, pregnant or parenting, or have a disability, income eligibility documentation is not required by statute. All \nISY must be low-income. Under WIOA, there are circumstances when local areas will find documenting low income \nfor youth formula program eligibility less burdensome than it was under the WIA youth program. For example, for \nISY a local program can use eligibility for free or reduced price lunch as low-income documentation. For all youth, \nthose living in a high-poverty area are considered low-income. The section also sets out the exception to the low-\nincome requirement that up to 5 percent of youth who meet all the other eligibility requirements need not be low-\nincome. The 5 percent is calculated based on all youth served in the WIOA local youth program in a given PY.\n\nSection 681.260How does the Department define \u201chigh poverty area\u201d for the purposes of the special rule for low-\nincome youth in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nWIOA contains a new provision that allows for youth living in a high-poverty area to automatically meet the low-\nincome criterion that is one of the eligibility criteria for ISY and for some OSY. In order to maintain consistency \nacross the country, the Department proposes that a high-poverty area be defined as a Census tract; a set of \ncontiguous Census tracts; Indian Reservation, tribal land, or Native Alaskan Village; or a county that has a poverty \nrate of at least 30 percent as set every 5 years using American Community Survey 5-Year data. While there is no \nstandard definition for the term \u201chigh-poverty area\u201d in Federal programs, the Census Bureau uses two similar \nconcepts. One is \u201cpoverty area,\u201d that is an area with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and the other is \u201carea with \nconcentrated poverty,\u201d that is an area with a poverty rate of at least 40 percent. The term high-poverty area implies \nan area that has more poverty than a \u201cpoverty area\u201d but not as much poverty as an \u201carea with concentrated \npoverty.\u201d In addition, current Department competitive grant programs for ex-offenders define high poverty areas as \ncommunities with poverty rates of at least 30 percent. The Department is seeking comments on whether the poverty \nthresholds the Department is proposing are the most appropriate levels for youth living in a high poverty area.\n\nSection 681.270May a local program use eligibility for free or reduced price lunches under the National School \nLunch Program as a substitute for the income eligibility criteria under title I of the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section describes a change from WIA in which a local program can use eligibility for free or reduced \nprice lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act as one of the factors to determine whether a \nparticipant meets the low-income criteria for eligibility for the WIOA youth program.\n\nSection 681.280Is a youth with a disability eligible for youth services under the Act if their family income exceeds \nthe income eligibility criteria?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section reiterates the WIOA provision that, for an individual with a disability, income level for \neligibility purposes is based on his/her own income rather than his/her family's income.\n\nSection 681.290How does the Department define the \u201cbasic skills deficient\u201d criterion in this part?\n\nThis proposed section reiterates the basic skills deficient criterion that is part of the eligibility criteria for both OSY \nand ISY, for purposes of title I of WIOA. For the second part of the definition, which reads \u201ca youth who is unable to \ncompute or solve problems, or read, write, or speak English at a level necessary to function on the job, in the \nindividual's family, or in society,\u201d the State and/or Local Board must further define how the State or Local Board will \ndetermine if a youth is unable to demonstrate these skills well enough to function on the job, in their family, or in \nsociety as part of its respective State or local plan. The section also provides that local programs must use valid \nand reliable assessment instruments and provide reasonable accommodations to youth with disabilities in the \nassessment process in making this determination.\n\nSection 681.300How does the Department define the \u201crequires additional assistance to complete an educational \nprogram, or to secure and hold employment\u201d criterion in this part?\n\nThis proposed section allows States and/or local areas to define the \u201crequires additional assistance . . .\u201d criterion \nthat is part of the OSY and ISY eligibility. It clarifies that if this criterion is not defined at the State level and a local \narea uses this criterion in their OSY or ISY eligibility, the localarea must define this criterion in their local plan.\n\nSection 681.310Must youth participants enroll to participate in the youth program?\n\nThis proposed section clarifies that there is no self-service concept for the WIOA youth program and every \nindividual receiving services under WIOA youth must meet ISY or OSY eligibility criteria and formally enroll in the \nprogram. It defines enrollment as the collection of information to support an eligibility determination and participation \nin any one of the 14 program elements. Under WIA the Department received many questions about the point in time \nthat a youth became enrolled in the program. The Department hopes the proposed addition of connecting \nenrollment to receipt of a program element clarifies the moment at which enrollment occurs. The reference to EO \ndata in the corresponding section under WIA was dropped because all rules related to data collection are covered \nin \u00a7 677 on performance management.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Youth Program Design, Elements, and Parameters\n\nSection 681.400What is the process used to select eligible youth providers?\n\nWIA regulations did not address the process for identifying and selecting eligible youth providers required in WIA \nsec. 123. The Department has received numerous inquiries asking for clarification on the competitive selection of \nyouth providers and which services must be provided by entities identified in accordance with WIA sec. 123. This \nproposed regulation clarifies which youth activities may be conducted by the local grant recipient and which \nservices must be provided by entities identified in accordance with WIOA sec. 123. Consistent with \u00a7 664.405(a)(4), \nthe competitive selection requirement in WIOA sec. 123 does not apply to framework services if the grant \nrecipient/fiscal agent provides these services. The Department allows this because in some cases the grant \nrecipient/fiscal agent may be best positioned to provide such services. For example, the grant recipient/fiscal agent \nthat provides framework services can ensure continuity of WIOA youth programming as youth service providers \nchange.\n\nSection 681.410Does the requirement that a State and local area expend at least 75 percent of youth funds to \nprovide services to out-of-school youth apply to all youth funds?\n\nThis proposed section describes the new minimum expenditure requirement under WIOA that States and local \nareas must expend a minimum of 75 percent of youth funds on OSY. Under WIA, local areas were required to \nspend at least 30 percent of funds to assist eligible OSY. This represents a significant shift in the focus of the WIOA \nyouth program and the Department recognizes such a shift will require additional technical assistance and \nguidance, including assistance to other youth-serving programs. This section also describes that the minimum 75 \npercent OSY expenditure applies to both local area funds and statewide youth activities funds reserved by the \nGovernor. However, only those statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are subject to the OSY \n\n\n\nexpenditure requirement. Funds spent on statewide youth activities that do not provide direct services to youth, \nsuch as most of the required statewide youth activities listed in WIOA sec. 129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY \nexpenditure requirement. In addition, local area administrative costs are not subject to the 75 percent OSY \nminimum expenditure. The OSY expenditure rate is calculated for statewide funds after subtracting out funds that \nare not spent on direct services to youth. The OSY expenditure rate is calculated for local area funds after \nsubtracting the funds spent on administrative costs. For example, if a local area receives $1 million and spends \n$100,000 on administrative costs, the remaining $900,000 is subject to the OSY expenditure rate. In this example, \nthe local area would be required to spend at least $675,000 (75 percent) of the $900,000 on OSY.\n\nThis section also clarifies the guidelines by which a State that receives a minimum allotment under WIOA sec. \n127(b)(1) or under WIOA sec. 132(b)(1) may request an exception to decrease the expenditure percentage to not \nless than 50 percent. The OSY exception language at WIOA sec. 129(a)(4)(B) references sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv) and \nsec. 132(b)(1)(B)(iv), which includes States that receive 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the preceding \nyear under the youth or adult formula programs (WIOA secs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(I) and 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(I)) and States \nthat receive the small State minimum allotment under either program (WIOA secs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) and \n132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II)). Under WIA this exception was only available to States receiving the small State minimum \nallotment, and no State submitted a request for the exception. The Department proposes to limit the approval of \nrequests described in WIOA sec. 129(a)(4)(B) to only those States that receive the small State minimum allotment \nunder WIOA secs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) and 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II). Thus, requests to decrease the percentage of funds \nto be used to provide activities to OSY will not be granted to States based on their having received 90 percent of \nthe allotment percentage for the preceding year. When the Secretary receives such a request from a State based \non having received 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the preceding year, the request will be denied without \nthe Secretary exercising further discretion.\n\nWhile the list of States receiving the small State minimum allotment is generally consistent, there is an almost \ncomplete yearly turnover of the States receiving the 90 percent minimum allotment. Given this continuous turnover, \napproving a request from these States for an exception to the 75 percent expenditure requirement would cause \nsignificant disruption in the operation of local youth programs. In particular, States and local areas would be unable \nto develop and implement long-term service delivery strategies and plans and would be unable to establish the \nappropriate infrastructure necessary to meet the 75 percent expenditure requirement. These disruptions would \nadversely affect the quality of services that could be delivered to youth program participants, particularly OSY, \nthereby undermining one of the most significant changes in priorities from WIA to WIOA. Given the disruption and \nharm that would result from approving requests from States receiving the 90 percent minimum allotment for an \nexception to the 75 percent expenditure requirement, the Department proposes to limit the approval of this \nexception to States receiving the small State minimum allotment.\n\nEven in those States receiving a small State minimum allotment, it will be very difficult for a State to make an \naffirmative determination that, after analysis of the local area's youth population, the local area \u201cwill not be able\u201d to \nuse 75 percent of its funds for OSY, which is a required element of any request.\n\nSection 681.420How must Local Boards design Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth programs?\n\nThis proposed section describes the framework for the WIOA youth program design. The framework includes an \nobjective assessment; an individual service strategy, which programs must update as needed to ensure \nprogression through the program; and general case management; and follow-up services that lead toward \nsuccessful outcomes for WIOA youth program participants. WIOA makes two significant changes to WIA's \nrequirements for service strategies. One is that the service strategy must be linked to one or more of the indicators \nof performance in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii). The other is that the service strategy must identify career pathways \nthat include appropriate education and employment goals. For both objective assessment and individual service \nstrategy, programs may use recently completed assessments or service strategies conducted by another education \nor training program rather than create new assessments or service strategies if they determine it is appropriate to \ndo so.\n\nThis proposed section also describes the requirement that Local Boards must link to youth-serving agencies and \nadds local human services agencies to the list that WIA required. It provides that Local Boards must provide \n\n\n\neligible youth with information about the full array of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local \nBoard or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners. It also provides that Local Boards must refer eligible youth to \nappropriate services that have the capacity to serve them on a concurrent or sequential basis. The proposed \nsection also provides that eligible providers must refer youth who either do not meet the enrollment requirements for \nthat program or cannot be served by that program for further assessment, if necessary, or to appropriate programs \nto meet the skills and training needs of the participant. Local Boards must also involve specific members of the \ncommunity, including parents and youth participants, in designing and implementing the WIOA youth program.\n\nA new provision in WIOA allows the Local Board to use up to 10 percent of their funds to implement pay-for-\nperformance contracts for the program elements described in \u00a7 681.460. Pay-for-performance contracts are \nfurther described in \u00a7 683.500.\n\nSection 681.430May youth participate in both the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth and adult \nprograms concurrently, and how do local program operators track concurrent enrollment in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act youth and adult programs?\n\nThis proposed section provides that youth may participate in both the WIOA youth program and the adult program \nat the same time if they are eligible for both and it is appropriate. If such concurrent enrollment occurs, local \nprograms must track expenditures separately by program. This section eliminated the reference, included in the \nWIA regulations, to concurrent enrollment in the dislocated worker program because any youth meeting eligibility \nfor the dislocated worker program would have already successfully attained a job and would most likely be more \nappropriately served under the dislocated worker program. The section also provides that youth who are eligible \nunder both programs may enroll concurrently in WIOA title I and II programs.\n\nSection 681.440How does a local youth program determine if an 18 to 24 year old is enrolled in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act youth program or Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act adult program?\n\nIndividuals aged 18 to 24 are eligible for the WIOA adult and youth programs and local areas must determine \nwhether to serve such individuals in the youth program, adult program, or both. This proposed section provides that \na local youth program must determine whether to enroll an 18 to 24 year old in the youth program or adult program \nbased on the individual's career readiness as determined through an objective assessment.\n\nSection 681.450For how long must a local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth program serve a \nparticipant?\n\nThe Department proposes this new section because the Department's monitoring of local areas commonly found \nWIA youth were exited before successfully completing the program due to artificial time constraints or the ending of \nyouth service provider contracts. In order to ensure that youth are not prematurely exited from the WIOA youth \nprogram, the Department proposes that youth programs serve participants for the amount of time necessary to \nensure they are successfully prepared to enter post-secondary education and/or unsubsidized employment. While \nthere is no minimum or maximum time a youth can participate in the WIOA youth program, programs must link \nprogram participation to a participant's individual service strategy and not the timing of youth service provider \ncontracts or PYs.\n\nSection 681.460What services must local programs offer to youth participants?\n\nThis proposed section lists the 14 program elements, including 5 new youth program elements in WIOA sec. \n129(c)(2) that were not included under WIA. These new elements are (1) education offered concurrently with and in \nthe same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster; \n(2) financial literacy education; (3) entrepreneurial skills training; (4) services that provide labor market and \nemployment information about in-demand industry sectors or occupations available in the local area, such as career \nawareness, career counseling, and career exploration services; and (5) activities that help youth prepare for and \ntransition to post-secondary education and training. In addition, WIOA has revised some of the WIA program \nelements. For example, the element on tutoring, study skills training, instruction leading to the completion of \nsecondary school, including dropout prevention strategies, has been revised to provide that the dropout prevention \n(and recovery) strategies must be evidence-based and to make clear that the completion of secondary school can \nbe accomplished by attainment of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent, including a certificate of \n\n\n\nattendance or similar document for individuals with disabilities. This change is consistent with WIOA's emphasis on \nevidence-based programs. WIOA also combines the two WIA elements of summer youth employment programs \nand work experiences so that summer youth employment programs become one item in a list of work experiences \nand adds pre-apprenticeship programs to the list of work experiences. Finally, WIOA expands the description of the \noccupational skill training element to provide for priority consideration for training programs that lead to recognized \npost-secondary credentials that are aligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations if the programs meet \nWIOA's quality criteria. This change is consistent with WIOA's increased emphasis on credential attainment. The \nsection clarifies that while local WIOA youth programs mustmake all 14 program elements available to WIOA youth \nparticipants, local programs have the discretion to determine which elements to provide to a participant based on \nthe participant's assessment and individual service strategy.\n\nSection 681.470Does the Department require local programs to use Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nfunds for each of the 14 program elements?\n\nThis proposed section clarifies that local WIOA youth programs must make all 14 program elements available to \nyouth participants, but not all services must be funded with WIOA youth funds. Local programs may leverage \npartner resources to provide program elements that are available in the local area. If a local program does not fund \nan activity with WIOA title I youth funds, the local area must have an agreement in place with the partner to offer the \nprogram element and ensure that the activity is closely connected and coordinated with the WIOA youth program if \nenrolled youth participate in the program element. By closely connected and coordinated, the Department means \nthat case managers must contact and monitor the provider of the non-WIOA-funded activity to ensure the activity is \nof high quality and beneficial to the youth participant.\n\nSection 681.480What is a pre-apprenticeship program?\n\nThis proposed section defines a pre-apprenticeship program, which is one of the types of work experiences listed \nunder WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C). The reference to pre-apprenticeship programs is new in WIOA. The definition is \nbased on TEN No. 13-12 that defined a quality pre-apprenticeship program. Local youth programs must coordinate \npre-apprenticeship programs to the maximum extent feasible with registered apprenticeship programs, which are \ndefined in WIOA sec. 171(b)(10), and require at least one documented partnership with a registered apprenticeship \nprogram. Quality pre-apprenticeship programs play a valuable role in preparing entrants for registered \napprenticeship and contribute to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce. Pre-apprenticeship programs \ncan be adapted to meet the needs of participants, the various employers and sponsors they serve, and the specific \nemployment opportunities available in a local labor market. Pre-apprenticeship training programs have successfully \ndemonstrated that obstacles such as low math skills, poor work habits, lack of access to transportation, and lack of \nknowledge of sector opportunities can be overcome when coordinated training and support is provided to workers.\n\nSection 681.490What is adult mentoring?\n\nThis proposed section describes the adult mentoring program element. It provides that mentoring must last at least \n12 months and defines the mentoring relationship. It clarifies that mentoring must be provided by an adult other \nthan the WIOA youth participant's assigned case manager since mentoring is above and beyond typical case \nmanagement services. Mentoring may take many forms, but at a minimum must include a youth participant \nmatched with an individual adult mentor other than the participant's case manager. Mentoring services may include \ngroup mentoring, mentoring via electronic means, and other forms as long as it also includes individual mentoring \nfrom an assigned mentor. Local programs should use evidence-based models of mentoring to design their \nprograms. The Department recommends that programs provide rigorous screening, training, and match support for \nmentors, and frequent contact with youth and parents as the match progresses.\n\nSection 681.500What is financial literacy education?\n\nThis proposed section describes the financial literacy program element, new under WIOA. Financial literacy is \ndescribed in the allowable statewide youth activities in WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(D) and the proposed section reiterates \nwhat was stated in the allowable statewide activities section of supporting financial literacy. The Department has \nadded an element on informing participants about identity theft to the list in WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(D). The \n\n\n\nDepartment recognizes the importance of equipping workers with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve \nlong-term financial stability and solicits comments on how best to achieve this goal.\n\nSection 681.510What is comprehensive guidance and counseling?\n\nThis proposed section describes the types of guidance and counseling services that fall under the program element \ncomprehensive guidance and counseling, which includes referral to services provided by partner programs, as \nappropriate. When referring participants to necessary counseling that cannot be provided by the local youth \nprogram or its service providers, the local youth program must coordinate with the organization it refers to in order \nto ensure continuity of service.\n\nSection 681.520What are leadership development opportunities?\n\nThis proposed section includes all of the examples of leadership development opportunities included in WIA \nregulations and adds two new examples of appropriate leadership development opportunities that a local area may \nconsider when providing leadership development opportunities. One new example is civic engagement activities; \nthe other is activities which put the youth in a leadership role.\n\nSection 681.530What are positive social and civic behaviors?\n\nWhile WIA included positive social behaviors as part of the description of leadership development opportunities, \nWIOA adds \u201ccivic behaviors\u201d to the description of the leadership development program element. This proposed \nsection expands the examples of positive social behaviors to include keeping informed of community affairs and \ncurrent events.\n\nSection 681.540What is occupational skills training?\n\nThis proposed section provides a definition for the occupational skills training program element. It was not \npreviously defined under WIA. WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(D) further sharpens the focus on occupational skills training by \nrequiring local areas to give priority consideration for training programs that lead to recognized post-secondary \ncredentials that align with in-demand industries or occupations in the local area. The Department interprets this \nrequirement to mean that when seeking occupational skills training for a participant, local areas must first seek \ntraining programs that lead to recognized post-secondary credentials in in-demand industries or occupations and \nonly if none are available should they refer a participant to a training program that does not lead to a recognized \npost-secondary credential. The Department has further defined this priority by requiring that such training be \noutcome oriented and focused on an occupational goal in a participant's individual service strategy and that it be of \nsufficient duration to impart the skills needed to meet that occupational goal. In all cases, local areas must ensure \nthat the training program meets the quality standards in WIOA sec. 123.\n\nSection 681.550Are Individual Training Accounts permitted for youth participants?\n\nPrior WIA regulations provide that ITAs are not an authorized use of youth funds. However, more than 30 States \nreceived waivers under WIA to use ITAs for older and OSY to: (1) Expand training options; (2) increase program \nflexibility; (3) enhance customer choice; and (4) reduce tracking, reporting and paperwork that comes with dual \nenrollment. ITAs have therefore become a critical component in WIA to provide training services to older and OSY. \nWIOA is silent on the use of ITAs for youth participants.\n\nThis proposed section allows ITAs for older OSY aged 18 to 24. This change will enhance individual participant \nchoice in their education and training plans and provide flexibility to service providers. ITAs also reduce the burden \nfor local areas by eliminating duplicative paperwork needed for enrolling older youth in both youth and adult formula \nprograms. ITAs will benefit disconnected youth and reinforce WIOA's emphasis on increasing access to and \nopportunities for workforce investment services for this population. To the extent possible, local programs must \nensure that youth participants are involved in the selection of their educational and training activities. The \nDepartment welcomes comments on the proposed allowance of ITAs for older OSY.\n\nSection 681.560What is entrepreneurial skills training and how is it taught?\n\nThis proposed section defines entrepreneurial skills training, a new program element under WIOA. While \nentrepreneurial skills training was previously listed as an example of a work experience in WIA, under WIOA it is a \n\n\n\nseparate program element. The Department has also provided a list of possible methods of teaching youth \nentrepreneurial skills training. The Department is specifically seeking comments from stakeholders around \ndevelopmentally appropriate types and methods of teaching entrepreneurial skills.\n\nSection 681.570What are supportive services for youth?\n\nThis proposed section lists examples of supportive services for youth and includes two additional examples which \nwere not listed in WIA youth regulations. Needs-related payments were listed as an example of an adult supportive \nservice under WIA and also can be critical to youth living on their own who participate in a youth program. WIOA \nlists needs-related payments as a supportive service at sec. 3(59). In addition, the Department lists assistance with \neducational testing and accommodations as examples because they are prime example of services that can be \nnecessary to enable an individual to participate in activities authorized by WIOA. For example, assistance with \neducational testing can provide OSY with the opportunity to take high school equivalency tests, as well as other \nexams for occupational certifications and credentials, while accommodations may be necessary for youth with \ndisabilities to participate in certain assessments and to have equal access and opportunity to participate in a variety \nof work-based learning activities.\n\nSection 681.580What are follow-up services for youth?\n\nThis proposed section discusses the importance of follow-up services and lists examples of follow-up services for \nyouth, which WIOA requires be provided for a minimum of 12 months. It clarifies that follow-up services may be \ndifferent for each individual based on his or her individual needs. It also clarifies that follow-up services are more \nthan a contact attempted or made to gather information for reporting purposes because follow-up services provide \nthe necessary support to ensure the success of youth post-program. Therefore, to meet follow-up requirements, \nprograms must do more than just make an attempt to contact to gather reporting information. The Department \nseeks comments on whether this section includes reasonable requirements for follow-up services.\n\nSection 681.590What is the work experience priority?\n\nThe proposed section discusses the 20 percent minimum expenditure requirement on the work experience program \nelement in WIOA sec. 129(c)(4). Work experience is a critical WIOA youth program element, arguably the most \nimportant program element as signaled by the minimum expenditure requirement. Work experience helps youth \nunderstand proper workplace behavior and what is necessary in order to attain and retain employment. Work \nexperience can serve as a stepping stone to unsubsidized employment and is an important step in the process of \ndeveloping a career pathway for youth. Research shows work experience is correlated with higher high school \ngraduation rates and success in the labor market. This is particularly important for youth with disabilities.\n\nSection 681.600What are work experiences?\n\nThe proposed section defines the work experience program element using language similar to the corresponding \nWIA regulation and includes the four work experience categories listed in WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C). In addition, the \nsection eliminates the language under the corresponding WIA rule that OJT is not an appropriate work experience \nactivity for youth. WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C)(4) explicitly enumerates OJT opportunities as one type of work \nexperience.\n\nWork experiences are designed to enable youth to gain exposure to the working world and its requirements. Work \nexperiences should help youth acquire the personal attributes, knowledge, and skills needed to obtain a job and \nadvance in employment.\n\nSection 681.610How will local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth programs track the work experience \npriority?\n\nThis proposed section discusses the new requirement under WIOA that a local youth program must use not less \nthan 20 percent of the funds allocated to the local area to provide youth participants, both ISY and OSY, with paid \nand unpaid work experiences. In order to ensure that local WIOA youth programs meet this requirement, the \nDepartment proposes that local WIOA youth programs track program funds spent on paid and unpaid work \nexperiences and report such expenditures as part of the local WIOA youth financial reporting. Program \nexpenditures on the work experience program element include wages as well as staffing costs for the development \n\n\n\nand management of work experiences. Like the 75 percent OSY expenditure requirement, local area administrative \ncosts are not subject to the 20 percent minimum work experience expenditure requirement. The work experience \nexpenditure rate is calculated for local area funds after subtracting out funds spent on administrative costs and is \ncalculated based on remaining total local area youth funds rather than calculated separately for in-school and OSY.\n\nSection 681.620Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act require Local Boards to offer summer \nemployment opportunities in the local youth program?\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C), summer employment opportunities are one of four suggested components of the \npaid and unpaid work experiencesprogram element. While local WIOA youth programs must provide paid and \nunpaid work experiences, they may take the form of a number of activities including: summer employment \nopportunities and employment opportunities available throughout the year, pre-apprenticeship programs, \ninternships and job shadowing, and OJT. While summer employment opportunities are an allowable activity and a \ntype of work experience that counts toward the work experience priority (which requires a minimum of 20 percent \nof funds allocated to a local area are spent on work experience) they are not a required program element as they \npreviously were under WIA.\n\nSection 681.630How are summer employment opportunities administered?\n\nLocal areas must adhere to the provisions outlined in WIOA sec. 123 for selecting service providers when \nadministering summer employment opportunities. This proposed section discusses that WIOA requires local areas \nto identify youth providers of youth workforce investment activities, including work experiences such as summer \nemployment opportunities, by awarding grants or contracts on a competitive basis. As provided in WIOA sec. 123, \nif there is an insufficient number of eligible providers of youth workforce investment activities, Local Boards may \naward grants or contracts on a sole source basis. This section also clarifies that the summer employment \nadministrator does not need to select the employers who are providing the employment opportunities through a \ncompetitive process.\n\nSection 681.640What does education offered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation \nactivities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster mean?\n\nThis proposed section describes the new program element at WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(E): \u201ceducation offered \nconcurrently and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or \noccupational cluster.\u201d The new program element requires integrated education and training to occur concurrently \nand contextually with workforce preparation activities and workforce training for a specific occupation or \noccupational cluster for the purpose of educational and career advancement. Youth participants will not be \nrequired to master basic academic skills before moving on to learning career-specific technical skills. This \napproach aligns with recent research which found students using an integrated education and training model had \nbetter rates of program completion and persistence than a comparison group (Jenkins 2009).\n\nSection 681.650Does the Department allow incentive payments for youth participants?\n\nThis proposed section clarifies that incentives under the WIOA youth program are permitted. The Department has \nincluded the reference to 2 CFR 200 to emphasize that while incentive payments are allowable under WIOA, the \nincentives must be in compliance with the requirements in 2 CFR part 200. This is not a change; under WIA, \nincentives must have followed the Uniform Administrative Requirements at 29 CFR parts 95 and 97 and the cost \nprinciples at 2 CFR parts 220, 225, and 230. The Uniform Administrative Requirements were recently consolidated \ninto 2 CFR part 200. For example, under 2 CFR part 200, Federal funds may not be spent on entertainment costs. \nTherefore, incentives may not include entertainment, such as movie or sporting event tickets or gift cards to movie \ntheaters or other venues whose sole purpose is entertainment. Additionally, under 2 CFR part 200, there are \nrequirements related to internal controls to safeguard cash which also apply to safeguarding of gift cards, which are \nessentially cash.\n\nSection 681.660How can parents, youth, and other members of the community get involved in the design and \nimplementation of local youth programs?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section discusses the requirement in WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(C) for the involvement of parents, \nparticipants, and community members in the design and implementation of the WIOA youth program and provides \nexamples of the type of involvement that would be beneficial. The Department has also included in this proposed \nsection the requirement in WIOA sec. 129(c)(8) that Local Boards must also make opportunities available to \nsuccessful participants to volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors, or in other activities.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014One-Stop Services to Youth\n\nSection 681.700What is the connection between the youth program and the one-stop service delivery system?\n\nThis proposed section reiterates the connections between the youth program and the one-stop system that were \nprovided in the WIA regulations and includes additional examples of such connections including collocating WIOA \nyouth program staff at one-stop centers and/or equipping one-stop centers and staff with the information necessary \nto advise youth on programming to best fit their needs. The intent behind this section is to encourage staff working \nwith youth under titles I, II, and IV of WIOA to coordinate better services for youth. This could include youth-focused \none-stop centers in locations where youth tend to gather and making one-stops more accessible to youth.\n\nSection 681.710Do Local Boards have the flexibility to offer services to area youth who are not eligible under the \nyouth program through the one-stop centers?\n\nConsistent with WIA, this proposed section clarifies that Local Boards may provide services to youth through one-\nstop career centers even if the youth are not eligible for the WIOA youth program.\n\nF. Part 682\u2014Statewide Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWIOA provides a reservation of funds for employment and training activities to be undertaken on a statewide basis. \nThese activities are undertaken by the States, rather than by Local Boards. WIOA requires States to undertake \ncertain statewide activities, but authorizes States to undertake a much wider range of activities. These required \nand allowable activities are addressed by this part of the proposed regulations. WIOA designates the percentage of \nfunds that may be devoted to these activities from annual allotments to the States\u2014up to 15 percent must be \nreserved from youth, adult, and dislocated worker funding streams, and up to an additional 25 percent of dislocated \nworker funds must be reserved for statewide rapid response activities.\n\nThe up to 15 percent funds from the three funding streams may be expended on employment and training activities \nwithout regard to the source of the funding. For example, funds reserved from the adult funding stream may be \nused to carry out statewide youth activities and vice versa. These funds must be used for certain specified activities, \nsuch as for State evaluations and for provision of data for Federal evaluations and research. If funds permit, States \nhave authority to provide a variety of other activities. State set-aside funds allow States to continually improve their \ncomprehensive workforce programs, ensure a national system that meets the needs of job seekers, workers and \nemployers, and contribute to building a body of evidence to improve the effectiveness of services under WIOA.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014General Description\n\nThis subpart describes what is encompassed by the term \u201cstatewide employment and training activities.\u201d It explains \nthat States have both required and allowable activities to be undertaken on a statewide basis for adults, dislocated \nworkers and youth. States have significant flexibility in the development of policies and strategies for the use of \ntheir statewide funds.\n\nSection 682.100What are the statewide employment and training activities under title I of the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.100 provides that there are both required and allowable statewide employment and training \nactivities. States may use up to 15 percent of adult, youth and dislocated worker funds for statewide activities \nrelating to youth, adult, dislocated workers. The States are encouraged to develop policies and strategies for \nutilizing these funds, and must include descriptions of these activities in their State Plan.\n\nSection 682.110How are statewide employment and training activities funded?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.110 does not change how statewide employment and training activities from how such activities \nwere funded under WIA. The Governor has authority to use up to 15 percent of the adult, dislocated worker, and \nyouth funds allocated to the State for statewide activities. The regulation provides that the adult, dislocated worker \nand youth 15 percent funds may be combined for use on required or allowed statewide activities regardless of the \nfunding source.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Required and Allowable Statewide Employment and Training Activities\n\nThis subpart first discusses required statewide activities. WIOA continues the activities that were required under \nWIA, but adds several additional required activities, such as assistance to State entities and agencies described in \nthe State Plan, alignment of data systems, regional planning, implementation of industry or sector partnerships, and \ncooperation in providing data for Federal evaluation and research projects. Required statewide activities under WIA \nand continued under WIOA include: Outreach to businesses, dissemination of information on the performance and \ncost of attendance for programs offered by ETPs, and conducting evaluations.\n\nThis subpart also discusses allowable statewide activities. The Department provides States with a significant \namount of flexibility in how these funds may be used for statewide activities. States can test and develop promising \nstrategies. This regulation is not designed to be an exhaustive list, but more illustrative of the types of allowable \nstatewide activities that may be provided with these funds.\n\nSection 682.200What are required statewide employment and training activities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(a) explains that rapid response activities are a required statewide employment and training \nactivity, as described in \u00a7 682.310.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(b) explains the different types of information States are required to disseminate to the \nworkforce system, including ETPLs, providers of work-based training providers, business partnership and outreach \ninformation, promising service delivery strategies, performance information about training providers, eligible \nproviders of youth activities, and information about physical and programmatic accessibility for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(c) states that the information listed in \u00a7 682.200(b) be made widely available. It explains that \nthis may be achieved by various means, including posting information on State Web sites, physical and electronic \nhandouts for dissemination to one-stop centers, and other appropriate means of sharing information.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(d) explains that under WIOA sec. 134(a)(2)(B)(vi), States are required to use the 15 percent \nset aside to conduct evaluations in accordance with WIOA sec. 116(e) whose requirements are implemented in \u00a7 \n682.220.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(e) requires States to provide technical assistance to local areas in carrying out activities \ndescribed in the State Plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(f) requires States to assist local areas, one-stop operators, and eligibile providers in providing \nopportunities for individuals with barriers to employment to enter in-demend industry sectors, and developing \nexemplary program activities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(g) and (h) require States to assit local areas carry out the regional planning and service \ndelivery efforts, and provide local areas information on and support for the effective development, convening, and \nimplementation of industry and sector partnerships.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(i) requires the States to provide technical assistance to local areas that fail to meet their \nperformance goals.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(j) requires the State to carry out monitoring and oversight activities of the programs providing \nservices to youth, adults and dislocated workers in WIOA. Under this authority, States may conduct reviews that \ncompare services provided to male and female youth.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(k) clarifies that States may provide additional assistance to local areas that have high \nconcentrations of eligible youth to ensure a transition to education or unsubsidized employment.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.200(l) requires States to operate a fiscal and management accountability system. This system is \nvital to ensure high levels in integrity of managing Federal funds and conveying important information on the \nservices being provided to job seekers and employers. As required by WIOA, the Department will consult with a \nwide range of stakeholders to establish guidelines for this system (see WIOA sec. 116(i)(1)).\n\nSection 682.210What are allowable statewide employment and training activities?\n\nIn addition to the required statewide activities, States are provided with significant flexibility to innovate within the \nworkforce system with various allowable statewide employment and training activities. These allowable activities \nare vital to ensuring a high quality workforce system, and can be used to ensure continuous improvement \nthroughout the system. This regulation is not designed to be an exhaustive list, but more illustrative of the types of \nallowable statewide activities that may be provided with these funds.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(a) provides that State administration of the adult, dislocated worker, and youth employment \nand training activities is an allowable statewide employment and training activity. This proposed section maintains \nthe same 5 percent administrative cost limit that existed under WIA and clarifies that the 5 percent is calculated \nbased on the total allotment received by the State and counts towards the amount reserved for statewide activities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(b) permits States to use WIOA funds to develop and implement innovative programs \nandstrategies designed to meet employer needs, including small business needs. The workforce system provides \nservices to dual customers\u2014the job seeker and the employer. The Department values ways in which States can \nengage businesses with all levels of the workforce system. Under this section, States have authority to carry out a \nvariety of programs identified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(i), such as sectoral and industry cluster strategies, \nmicroenterprise and entrepreneurial training, and utilization of business intermediaries.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(c) permits States to develop and implement strategies for serving individuals with barriers to \nemployment and encourages States to partner with other agencies to coordinate services among all the one-stop \npartners.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(d) and (e) allow the development and identification of education and training programs that \nrespond to real-time labor market analysis, that allow for use of direct or prior assessments, and that provide credit \nfor prior learning, or which have other characteristics identified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(iii). States can also use \nthese funds to increase training for individuals placed in non-traditional employment.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(f) permits States to undertake research and demonstrations related to meeting the education \nand employment needs of youth, adults and dislocated workers, as stated in WIOA secs. 129(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) \nand sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(ix).\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(g) provides that States may utilize statewide funds to support the development of alternative, \nevidence-based programs, and other activities which increase the choices available to eligible youth and encourage \nthem to reenter and complete secondary education, enroll in post-secondary education and advanced training, \nprogress through a career pathway, and/or enter unsubsidized employment that leads to economic self-sufficiency.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(h) provides that States may utilize statewide funds to support the provision of career services \nthroughout the one-stop delivery system in the State.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(i) provides that States may incorporate a variety of financial literacy identified in WIOA sec. \n129(b)(23)(D) activities into the service delivery strategy within the one-stop delivery system. Financial literacy \nactivities are important services for job seekers to receive as part of their career services. The Department \nencourages States to develop and implement strategies for local areas to utilize to coordinate financial literacy \nservices to participants under this authority and to provide financial literacy activities to youth under \u00a7 682.210(i).\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(j) allows for States to provide incentive grants to local areas for reaching performance goals. \nIncentive grants can be an effective way to develop and maintain a culture of continuous improvement throughout \nthe workforce system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(k) allows for States to provide technical assistance to local areas, CEOs, one-stop operators, \none-stop partners, and eligible providers in local areas for the development of exemplary program activities and the \nprovision of technology to facilitate remote access to services provided through the one-stop delivery system in the \nState (WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(E));\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(l) allows States to provide technical assistance to local areas using pay-for-performance \ncontract strategies. Under WIOA, pay-for-performance is an allowable use of funds that could potentially be an \neffective mechanism to improve participant outcomes. Technical assistance will be of vital importance to ensure \nthese strategies are being implemented effectively. Under this authority, such technical assistance may include \nproviding assistance with data collections, meeting data entry requirements, identifying levels of performance, and \nconducting evaluations of pay-for-performance strategies.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(m) allows for States to utilize technology to allow for remote access to training services \nprovided through the one-stop delivery system. The Department recognizes that there are many different means by \nwhich individuals may get training and that the use of technology may be particularly helpful to participants in rural \nareas. The Department encourages States to develop and build upon strategies that enable job seekers to connect \nwith the workforce system remotely.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(n) allows States to conduct activities that increase coordination between workforce investment \nactivities and economic development approaches. This proposed regulation also allows States to undertake \nactivities that provide coordination with services provided by other agencies, such as child support services and \nassistance (provided by State and local agencies carrying out part D of title IV of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.)), \ncooperative extension programs (carried out by the Department of Agriculture), programs in the local areas for \nindividuals with disabilities (including the programs identified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(viii)(II)(cc)), adult education \nand literacy activities including those carried out by public libraries, and activities in the corrections system to \nconnect ex-offenders reentering the workforce. The Department strongly encourages States to engage in these \ncoordination activities. States are also encouraged to use funds to develop and disseminate workforce and labor \nmarket information (WLMI).\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(o) allows States to implement promising practices for workers and businesses as described \nin WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A).\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(p) allows States to develop economic self-sufficiency standards that specify the income needs \nof families, including the number and ages of children. The Department recognizes that different regions in a State \nmay have different levels of self-sufficiency; therefore the proposed regulation allows for States to take \ngeographical considerations into account in developing self-sufficiency standards.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(q) allows States to develop and disseminate common intake procedures across core and \npartner programs, including common registration procedures. The Department strongly encourages States to utilize \nthis approach in a customer-focused way. By developing common procedures one-stop staff can reduce duplication \nand enhance the job seeker experience in the workforce system.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.210(r) encourages coordinating activities with the child welfare system to facilitate provision of \nservices to children and youth who are eligible for assistance.\n\nSection 682.220What are States' responsibilities in regard to evaluations and research?\n\nThe Department proposes to add rules on new State responsibilities and opportunities in regard to evaluation and \nresearch under WIOA sec. 116(e). State and Federal evaluations and research are intended to improve the quality \nand effectiveness of programs under WIOA, and contribute to an expanding body of knowledge on customers, their \nneeds, existing services, and innovative approaches. Examples of the strategies that might be explored in \n\n\n\nevaluation and research include, but are not limited to, interventions envisioned in WIOA itself, such as integrated \nsystems, coordinated services, career pathways, and multiple forms of engagement with businesses.\n\nWIOA continues the long-standing support of evaluation and research found in prior law, but strengthens it in \nseveral ways, including permitting States to evaluate activities under all of the title I-IV core programs, including \nadult education and vocational education, and permitting the use of funds from any of these programs for \nevaluations. WIOA expands coordination and the consultative process regarding evaluations and research beyond \nthe workforce system to State agencies for the other core programs. Further, WIOA now also requires States to \ncoordinate their own studies with evaluations and research projects undertaken by the Departments of Labor and \nEducation, as well as to cooperate in provision of data and information for such Federal evaluations.\n\nProvisions on the Department's role in evaluation and research, now found under WIOA sec. 169 (corresponding to \nsecs. 171 and 172 in WIA), authorize a wide array of studies. Evaluation and research projects, permissible under \nWIOA sec. 169 include process and outcome studies, pilot and demonstration projects, analyses of programmatic \nand economic data, impact and benefit-cost analyses, and use of rigorous designs to test the efficacy of various \ninterventions, such as random assignment. WIOA also implies that State evaluations are synonymous with multiple \nforms of research to test various interventions and to examine program services and outcomes in greater depth and \nover a longer time frame than is typically done for performance accountability purposes for State and local \nprograms.\n\nSection 169 also includes numerous examples of studies to be conducted in collaboration with other Federal \nDepartments. WIOA sec. 169 also requires several research projects (evaluations of title I programs, a study of \ncareer pathways in health and child care, and research on equivalent pay), suggests seven research projects \n(relating to disconnected youth, business needs, nontraditional occupations, performance indicators, public housing \nassistance recipients, older workers, and credentials for prior learning), and permits studies of Federally-funded \nemployment-related programs and activities under \u201cother provisions of law.\u201d An evaluation of Job Corp is also \nrequired under WIOA sec. 161.\n\nWIOA recognizes in sec. 116(e) the vital role of States in providing various forms of quantitative and qualitative \ndata and information for Federal evaluations and research. Data, survey responses, and site visit information, from \nboth the State and local levels are essential in Federal research designed to understand and evaluate various \nexisting systems and services as well as new interventions. All of these forms of data and information are needed \nto understand key participant characteristics, labor market outcomes, the role of decision-makers, how faithfully \ninterventions are implemented, and the quality of the customer experience. Further, there are multiple potential data \nsources which could include, for example, UI administrative data and wage records, data from other workforce \nprograms, various documents, and individual or focus group interviews with State officials, local program staff and \ncustomers.\n\nTo assure that data are consistently available from all States, the rules emphasize the need for States to \ncooperate, to the extent practicable, in data collection activities for evaluations conducted by the Departments of \nLabor and Education, as related to services under WIOA and to other employment-related programs and activities. \nThe rules also clarify the need for States to provide data from sub-State level and from State and local workforce \nboards and, further, to encourage provision of data by other partner programs. A method for informing the \nDepartment about possible problems in providing the various forms of data and for resolving such problems is also \nproposed below.\n\nSpecifically, the rules include the following:\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(a)(1) explains that under WIOA secs. 116(e), 129(b)(1)(A) and 134(a)(2)(B)(vi), States are \nrequired to use funds reserved by the Governor for statewide activities (the State set-aside) to conduct evaluations \nof activities of the core programs. Paragraph (b)(1) requires States to coordinate such evaluations with Federal \nevaluation and research activities under WIOA secs. 169 and 242(c)(2)(D) (regarding adult education), under the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and under the Wagner-Peyser Act [29 U.S.C. 49i(b)]. Paragraph (a) delineates the role of \n\n\n\nevaluations and research in promoting continuous improvement and high performance in existing programs and \nidentifies an additional purpose of evaluation activities: Testing innovative services and strategies.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(a)(2) clarifies that the States may use set-aside funds to conduct other research and \ndemonstration projects that relate to the education and employment needs for youth, adults and dislocated \nworkers. Proposed \u00a7 682.220(a)(3) clarifies that States may use funds from other WIOA title II-IV core programs \nbut only as determined through the consultative processes required with State and Local Boards and agencies \nresponsible for the core programs as referenced in paragraph (b)(1). Paragraph 682.220(e) highlights the \nopportunity for States to use and combine funds from other sources (consistent with Federal and State law, \nregulation, and guidance). The sources might include other Federal and State grants and contracts, as well as \nprivate philanthropic or other sources.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(b) promotes State efforts to conduct evaluations and research, assure they relate to State \ngoals and strategies, and are coordinated and designed in conjunction with State and Local Boards and other \nagencies responsible for the core programs. The proposed rule also lists some key features that States can include \ntheir evaluations and research projects when appropriate and feasible, not as a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d checklist of \nrequirements for every evaluation and research project. As such, paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) implement WIOA \nsec. 116(e), but qualifies the requirements for States to include an analysis of customer feedback and of outcome \nand process measures when appropriate, to coordinate with Federal evaluations to the extent feasible, and to use \nthe most rigorous analytical and statistical methods that are reasonably feasible.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(c) implements sec. 116(e)(3) of WIOA, which requires States to share their evaluations with \nthe public, including through electronic means, such as posting the results of all types of research and evaluations \nthat States conduct on the relevant State Web site.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(d)(1) implements sec. 116(e)(4) of WIOA, which requires States to cooperate, to the extent \npracticable, in providing data, responding to surveys, and allowing site visits in a timely manner for Federal \nevaluation, research, and investigation activities conducted by the Secretaries of Labor and Education or their \nagents under WIOA secs. 169 and 242, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Wagner-Peyser Act, as listed in \u00a7 \n682.200(d) and above. (The provision of UI data for Federal evaluations and research is subject to regulations \nfound in 20 CFR part 603.) The Department of Labor intends to work with States and the United States Census \nBureau (Census) to explore the potential to meet the requirement that States provide UI wage record data for \nFederal evaluations and research using the wage record dataStates currently provide to Census for the \nLongitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. This approach to provision of UI data may reduce \nburden on State UI infrastructure, while also making the LEHD data set more useful to a broad array of \nresearchers. Since data and survey responses from local subgrantees and State and local workforce boards are \noften critical in Federal evaluation and research projects, the rule also requires that States provide timely data and \nsurvey responses from these entities and that States assure that subgrantees and boards allow timely site visits for \nFederal evaluations. States are proposed to assume these responsibilities because of their relationship with and \nsupport of the boards as well as their role in overseeing the operation of subgrantees. Since States do not set the \nrequirements for other one-stop partners, proposed \u00a7 682.220(d)(2) requires States to encourage these partners \nto cooperate in data provision for the relevant Federal evaluations and research.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.220(d)(3) requires a Governor to inform the Secretary in writing if a State finds that it is not \npracticable to participate in timely provision of data, survey responses and site visits for Department of Labor or \nDepartment of Education evaluations and research, and, further, to explain why it is not practicable for the State to \nprovide the requested information. This explanation will help the Department to work more effectively with the State \nto accommodate its concerns and mitigate or overcome any problems preventing the State from providing the \ninformation needed for Federal evaluations or research conducted under the various authorities cited in \u00a7 \n682.200(d).\n\nProposed \u00a7 665.220(e) provides that States may use or combine funds, consistent with Federal and State law, \nregulation, and guidance, from other public or private sources, to conduct evaluations, research, and demonstration \nprojects relating to activities under the WIOA title I-IV core programs. The Department will provide information, \n\n\n\ntechnical assistance, and guidance to support States in conducting their own evaluations and research, at the \nhighest levels of quality and integrity, consistent with State goals and priorities, and using methodologies \nappropriate to the research objectives and the funds available. The technical assistance and guidance will also \naddress how States can coordinate with studies conducted by the Departments of Labor and Education under \nWIOA and cooperate in providing data and other information for such Federal research.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Rapid Response Activities\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis subpart discusses the important role that rapid response plays in providing customer-focused services both to \ndislocated workers and employers, thereby ensuring immediate access to affected workers to help them quickly \nreenter the workforce. The proposed regulations reflect the Department's experience in managing the PYs and \nlessons learned from the innovations and best practices of various rapid response programs around the country in \nplanning for and meeting the challenges posed by events precipitating substantial increases in the number of \nunemployed individuals in States, regions and local areas. The proposed regulations provide a comprehensive \nframework for operating successful rapid response programs in a way that promotes innovation and maintains \nflexibility to enable States to successfully manage economic transitions.\n\nSection 134(a)(2) of WIOA authorizes the use of reserved funds for statewide activities to plan for and respond to \nevents that precipitate substantial increases in the number of unemployed individuals. Except for a new provision, \nat sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(ii), that addresses the use of unobligated funds for rapid response activities, WIOA largely \nreplicates the language in sec. 134 of WIA. The proposed regulations provide additional, detailed direction \nregarding required and optional rapid response activities. The WIA regulations concerning the rapid response \nprogram provided substantial flexibility in program design and implementation. This flexibility allowed for customized \nplanning and responses based upon specific factors in a given situation\u2014an important component to delivering \neffective services. However, some States and local operators did not understand the full range of activities \nallowable under the program. In crafting the proposed regulations, the Department has worked to maintain the \nsame flexibility that the current regulation allows, while providing more detailed information about appropriate \nactivities, such as layoff aversion, engaging business, and illustrating how these funds can be used.\n\nOur proposed approach is based on the premise that successful rapid response programs are flexible, agile, and \nfocused on promptly delivering comprehensive solutions to businesses and workers in transition. Rapid response, \nwhen operated successfully, delivers on the promises that the workforce system makes to businesses, workers, \nand communities\u2014to provide economically valuable solutions to businesses and critically important services to \nworkers at the time when they are most needed. These proposed regulations are designed to ensure that rapid \nresponse programs in all States are capable of meeting those promises, that service levels are consistent in quality \nyet customized to specific events, and activities are driven always by the goal of preventing or minimizing \nunemployment. The proposed regulations also focus specifically on anticipating needs and planning for them, rather \nthan only responding to layoff events.\n\nSection 682.300What is rapid response, and what is its purpose?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.300 describes the purpose of rapid response\u2014to promote economic development and vitality\u2014and \nidentifies the activities and responsibilities to meet this purpose. Proposed \u00a7 682.300(a) identifies as key \ncomponents of rapid response the strategies and activities necessary to plan for and respond to layoffs or other \ndislocation events, including natural or other disasters. While many States will provide rapid response services for \nlayoffs of all sizes, some States have restricted rapid response services to layoffs of 50 or more workers, or for \nwhich they received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notice. While rapid response is \nrequired for closures and mass layoffs, the Department's intention is that effective services are provided to as \nmany workers and companies as possible. Most employers have fewer than 50 workers, and thus, a substantial \npercentage of layoffs do not qualify for WARN coverage; therefore, using either of these criteria as the only triggers \nfor the provision of rapid response assistance means that most companies and workers affected by dislocations \nwill not be provided rapid response services. Establishing a strict threshold is counter to the purpose of rapid \nresponse, and prevents many workers and companies from receiving valuable services at a time when they are \nneeded.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the proposed regulations do not define any threshold for the size of a layoff for which rapid response \nservices are provided. The regulation does not specifically address plant closures because the Department \nconsiders the layoffs associated with closures to be covered under the general principles applicable to layoffs. \nBased on the fact that most companies employ fewer than 50 workers and the rapid response services provide \nsignificantvalue to both affected workers and businesses, the Department expects that States and local areas will \nprovide rapid response services to layoffs and closures of all sizes, as practicable. However, for any plant closure \nor layoff of 50 or more, rapid response services must be provided per the statutory reference to mass layoffs. \nAdditionally, rapid response must be provided for any layoff which receives a WARN notice. State and local area \nrapid response providers must establish policies and procedures that allow them to serve the most companies and \naffected workers or to determine the specific scenarios which meet this criterion and for which they will provide \nrapid response services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.300(a) identifies the need to expeditiously deliver services in order to enable dislocated workers to \ntransition quickly to new employment. The two critical phrases in this section\u2014\u201cplan for and respond\u201d and \u201cas \nquickly as possible\u201d\u2014demonstrate that rapid response must include strategic planning and other activities that will \nensure that dislocated workers can be reemployed as soon as possible.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.300(b) explains that the purpose of rapid response is a proactive, strategic set of actions, not \nsimply a response to layoffs. The proposal establishes rapid response as a critical tool in managing economic \ntransition and supporting economic growth in communities. As stated in the proposal, rapid response includes a \nwide array of strategies and activities of which layoff aversion is a key component. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) \ndescribes the direct and informational services rapid response must provide to workers affected by layoffs.\n\nProposed paragraph (b)(2) describes the services that rapid response must provide to businesses. Building and \nmaintaining relationships with the business community, throughout the growth and decline that characterizes the \nbusiness cycle, is a critical aspect of rapid response; establishing and maintaining these relationships allows for \nearly knowledge of potential layoffs. This information not only provides time for undertaking actions that may \nprevent the layoffs from occurring but may also allow affected workers to connect, in a timely manner, with \nbusinesses that can use their skills, thereby avoiding unemployment or minimizing its duration.\n\nEngaging with businesses and delivering effective solutions to their needs is critical\u2014to allow rapid response teams \nto meet and work with individuals affected by layoff, preferably before layoff and on company time, but also to \nidentify companies that are growing and may hire dislocated workers or to deliver services that may prevent \nworkers at those companies from being laid off in the future.\n\nProposed paragraph (b)(3) describes the role that rapid response must play in developing strong, comprehensive \nnetworks of partners and service providers to ensure that all needed services are provided to businesses, workers, \nand communities.\n\nProposed paragraph (b)(4) covers the need for rapid response to undertake strategic planning and data gathering \nto ensure readiness to act appropriately whenever the need arises.\n\nSection 682.310Who is responsible for carrying out rapid response activities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.310 is a new section that was split from \u00a7 665.300 under the current regulations. Its text follows the \ncurrent regulation, \u00a7 665.300(b), without substantive change, but it changes the verb used to describe the delivery \nof rapid response from \u201cprovide\u201d to \u201ccarry out\u201d to track the language used in WIOA sec. 134(a)(2).\n\nSection 682.320What is layoff aversion, and what are appropriate layoff aversion strategies and activities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.315 significantly enhances the required activities from those set forth in the current regulation. \nRapid response experience under WIA has shown the importance of layoff aversion as a critical component of a \nsuccessful rapid response program, to be used by States and Local Boards to prevent or minimize layoffs. This \nsection describes strategies and activities which are designed to prevent or minimize the duration of unemployment.\n\n\n\nLayoff aversion is a comprehensive approach requiring the integration of data, relationships, partnerships, and \npolicies and procedures to allow an assessment of the economic situation that exists within a given area. This \napproach enables the development of a plan that may be applied, at any time, to intervene and manage transition \nthat occurs within that area. Layoff aversion strategies and activities are customized to specific needs, quickly \ndeployable, informed by economic data, and designed and coordinated with partners as necessary. This proposed \nsection describes examples of these strategies and activities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.315 provides a definition for layoff aversion, which has been adapted from TEGL 30-09, and \ndescribes a number of potential layoff aversion strategies and activities that rapid response programs must include, \nmany of which were first described in (TEN) 9-12.\n\nSection 682.330What rapid response activities are required?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330 describes rapid response activities that are required to be carried out with rapid response \nfunds. The elements include activities that have been previously discussed in guidance and through technical \nassistance; elements that are required by the current regulation; and elements that were previously allowable, but \nwhich are now required. In particular, the regulation now specifically identifies layoff aversion activities and the \nprovision of additional assistance to local areas experiencing increased dislocation events as required rapid \nresponse activity (paragraphs (a) and (i)) and adds new responsibilities in paragraphs (g) through (k). The \nDepartment's experience under WIA has shown that such activities are critical for a successful rapid response \nprogram. To meet the needs of affected workers and businesses, a rapid response program must be proactive, \ndata-driven, engaged with businesses, and focused on preventing layoffs or minimizing their negative impacts. \nSubstantially increasing the level of required activities under rapid response is designed to drive those outcomes. \nBy undertaking these activities, the State and local areas will be able to effectively manage, review and evaluate \nrapid response and layoff aversion efforts.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(a) describes layoff aversion as a required rapid response activity. Layoff aversion strategies \nand activities are described in proposed \u00a7 682.315. The proposal requires that States and local areas have the \ncapability to conduct layoff aversion; however, it is left to the discretion of the operators of rapid response programs \nto determine which strategies and activities are applicable in a given situation, based upon specific needs, policies, \nand procedures within the State and operating areas. The current regulation requires rapid response operators to \nassess the potential for averting layoffs; this proposal expands on this requirement by listing a number of specific \nstrategies and activities that are critical to maintaining readiness and ensuring the ability to capitalize on \nopportunities that will prevent, or minimize the duration of, unemployment.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(b) through (e) are consistent with the current regulations; these activities are retained as \nrequired under the proposed WIOA regulations.\n\nThis proposed regulation does not define the term \u201cemergency services\u201d asused in proposed \u00a7 682.330(f); however, \nin the past States and local areas have used rapid response teams and resources for a wide array of activities in \nresponse to disaster situations. Such activities have included outreach, support, and assistance for impacted \nindividuals with accessing UI or disaster unemployment assistance; acquisition of and support for mobile one-stop \nunits; demographic information gathering for potential emergency grant applications; and coordination with Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) or other disaster-response organizations. State and local area rapid \nresponse providers must work closely with other State and local agencies and other critical partners through \nstrategic planning processes to ensure effective and immediate responses can be undertaken when the need \narises.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(g) discusses the requirement that State or local rapid response programs collect and utilize \ndata as a core component of their work. Proposed \u00a7 682.330(g)(1) requires States and/or local areas to identify \nsources of information that will provide early warning of potential layoffs, and to gather this data in a manner that \nbest suits their needs. Proposed \u00a7 682.330(g)(2) requires the processing and analysis of a range of economic data \nand information to ensure the best possible services are delivered to businesses and workers at the appropriate \ntime. Proposed \u00a7 682.330(g)(3) requires that States and/or local areas track data and other information related to \n\n\n\nthe activities and outcomes of the rapid response program, so as to provide an adequate basis for effective \nprogram management, review, and evaluation of rapid response and layoff aversion efforts.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(h) highlights the need for strategic and operational partnerships. Rapid response operators \nmust develop and maintain partnerships with a wide range of partners to ensure the capability to deliver needed \nservices and resources to businesses, workers, and communities whenever the need arises. The proposal \nprovides some examples of organizations with which to partner, but States and local areas should establish \npartnerships with those organizations that are necessary to ensure the successful functioning of their rapid \nresponse program. Proposed \u00a7 682.330(h)(1) discusses the use of these partnerships to conduct strategic planning \nand to ensure that assistance provided to companies, workers, and communities is comprehensive. Proposed \u00a7 \n682.330(h)(2) requires that the partnerships developed to support rapid response programs actively share \ninformation on resources available on a regular basis to ensure that the needs of businesses, workers, and \ncommunities will be met at the time they are needed.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(i) requires rapid response services to be provided to workers upon the filing of a petition for \nTAA. If the Department no longer processes TAA petitions due to an expiration or termination of the program, there \nwill be no explicit requirement pertaining to TAA participants. However, such individuals, as dislocated workers, will \ncontinue to receive rapid response services upon notification of layoff consistent with State or local area procedure.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(j) requires States to provide additional assistance to local areas that experience an event that \ncauses significant layoffs that exceed the capacity of the local area to respond to with existing formula resources. \nThis requirement is found in the current regulation at \u00a7 665.300(b); the Department has made slight wording \nchanges and moved it to this part. The additional assistance is required by WIOA sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(II). Proposed \u00a7 \n682.330(j) establishes the requirement that such assistance be provided; proposed \u00a7 682.350 defines and \ndescribes what additional assistance entails.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.330(k) describes the role of rapid response in organizing or supporting labor management \ncommittees. This proposed paragraph uses the language from the current regulation that addresses this point, 20 \nCFR 655.310(c)(1) and (2). This support is required by WIOA sec. 3(51), as it was under WIA sec. 101(38), where \nlabor and management voluntarily agree that the establishment of such a committee is appropriate. It has been the \nDepartment's experience that in some circumstances such committees have proven ineffective; therefore, their \nestablishment is not a required rapid response activity. However, where labor and management desire to establish \nsuch a committee, guidance and financial support must be provided by rapid response.\n\nThe proposal does not include the requirement, now in 20 CFR 655.310(c)(3), that a neutral chairperson be \nappointed for such a committee. Based on feedback received regarding the difficulties involved in obtaining a \nneutral chairperson who is familiar with the immediate problem, the leadership of such a committee is better left to \nthe discretion of the parties involved.\n\nThe proposal does not include the language in the current regulation referring to \u201cworkforce transition \ncommittees\u201d\u2014the Department now refers to these as groups as \u201ccommunity transition teams.\u201d Their role is \nexplained in proposed \u00a7 682.340.\n\nSection 682.340May other activities be undertaken as part of rapid response?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.340 identifies additional activities that may be undertaken as part of the rapid response program. \nProposed \u00a7 682.340(a) is designed to allow for innovative approaches and to ensure additional flexibility to prepare \nfor and respond to layoffs, and to react to unusual or unforeseeable situations. Although the proposal leaves \nconsiderable discretion, any allowable activities must be designed to prevent or minimize the duration of \nunemployment, or to develop strategies or activities that will lead to better programmatic outcomes.\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.340(b) provides for the creation and operation of community transition teams. Community transition \nteams are designed to expand the ability of the public workforce system to enlist partners, community \norganizations, and others to provide services and resources in communities or areas in response to major layoffs or \nother events that have caused significant impact that are beyond the capacity of the public workforce system to \n\n\n\naddress. Rapid response funds may be used to organize or sustain community transition teams that are organized \nto provide relief to impacted communities.\n\nSection 682.350What is meant by \u201cprovision of additional assistance\u201d in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nSection 665.330 of the current regulations is not maintained in the proposed regulations. The North American Free \nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) program to which it refers has ended. Proposed \u00a7 682.350, which describes the \nprovision of \u201cadditional assistance\u201d to local areas, has been largely maintained from the existing WIA regulations. \nThe Department has made a slight change to the language in the existing regulations for clarity, but the concept \nhas not changed. While the provision of additional assistance is required, as described in proposed \u00a7 682.330(i), \nthe mechanisms by which such assistance may be provided are left to the discretion of the States.\n\nSection 682.360What rapid response, layoff aversion, or other information will States be required to report to the \nEmployment and Training Administration?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.360 does not appear in the current regulations; it requires that States report information about the \nreceipt of rapid response services by individuals enrolled as dislocated workers. This information is currently \nrequired under WIA reporting guidelines. The Department also reserves authority to issue further guidance on the \nreporting of rapid response activities. Should such reporting become required, the Department will work with \nStates and local areas to ensure that reporting burdens are minimized while still meeting program reporting goals.\n\nSection 682.370What are \u201callowable statewide activities\u201d for which rapid response funds remaining unspent at the \nend of the year of obligation may be recaptured by the State?\n\nProposed \u00a7 682.370 addresses the WIOA provision at sec. 134(a)(2)(B) that allows a State to \u201crecapture\u201d any funds \nreserved for rapid response that remain unspent at the end of the PY of obligation and utilize them for State set-\naside activities. The Department has provided further definition around required and allowable activities under the \nrapid response provisions of the WIOA, which may support States to more fully utilize rapid response funds while \nbetter serving businesses and workers.\n\nG. Part 683\u2014Administrative Provisions Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThis proposed part establishes the administrative provisions that apply to formula and discretionary grants and \ncooperative agreements authorized under title I of WIOA. Some administrative provisions are also applicable to \ngrants provided under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as indicated in specific sections of this part. The remaining Wagner-\nPeyser Act administrative rules are still located in 20 CFR part 658. Wagner-Peyser grants are included in this part \nto ensure consistent application of the common administrative provisions that apply to all grants awarded under title \nI of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act. For instance, the audit requirements for discretionary and formula grantees \nfor title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds can be found in one section. The internal control requirements for both \nprograms can be found in this part as well. However, contracts, rather than grants or cooperative agreements, are \nused to award most funds authorized for Job Corps. As such, the administrative provisions for Job Corps (subtitle C \nof title I of WIOA) will be addressed separately in 20 CFR part 686.\n\nMany of the proposed requirements in this part 683 are impacted by the Department's new rule \u201cUniform \nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards Final Rule,\u201d at 2 CFR \npart 2900 published on December 19, 2014, and OMB's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and \nAudit Requirements for Federal Awards Final Rule, dated December 26, 2013 found at 2 CFR part 200 (\u201cUniform \nGuidance\u201d or \u201c2 CFR part 200\u201d). The Uniform Guidance, which can be found at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-\n2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf, streamlines and consolidates OMB Circulars A-21 (2 CFR part 220), A-50, A-87 (2 \nCFR part 225), A-89, A-102 (29 CFR part 97), A-110 (29 CFR part 95), A-122 (2 CFR part 230), and A-133 (29 \nCFR part 96) into a single document. The Uniform Guidance standardizes the administrative, cost, and audit \nprovisions for nearly all grants across the Federal government including those awarded by the Department's WIOA \nFederal partners, including ED, HHS, and the Department of Agriculture. Federal agencies were allowed to submit \nexceptions, as defined at 2 CFR 200.102, that deviate from the Uniform Guidance. The list of the Department's \n\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf\n\n\nexceptions to the Uniform Guidance is available at 2 CFR part 2900. Requirements of this Uniform Guidance, \nincluding the Department's exceptions, apply to all grants and cooperative agreements provided under this part.\n\nIn this proposed part, the Department hopes to strengthen its administration of grants and enhance program results \nby providing consistent and uniform guidance that increases accountability and transparency, promotes fiscal \nintegrity, and reduces duplication.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Funding and Closeout\n\nThis subpart addresses the grant life cycle from fund availability to closeout for formula grants awarded to States \nunder WIOA title I, subtitle B, and the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the grant life cycle for discretionary or competitive \nWIOA grants, awarded under subtitle D of title I. This subpart identifies the three financial assistance instruments \nthat will be used to award funds under title I of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser: Contracts, grant agreements, and \ncooperative agreements. One shift from WIA to WIOA is that the Secretary will no longer use the \nGovernor/Secretary agreements used under WIA. In compliance with the Uniform Guidance, the Department will \nuse Notices of Award as the funding instrument for all grants, both formula and discretionary. Another shift to \npromote full expenditure of funds is to require that recipients expend the funds with the shortest period of \nperformance before expending other funds. This proposed subpart also implements the WIOA statute's flexibility in \nallowing a Local Board to transfer up to 100 percent of a PY allocation between the adult and dislocated workers \nfunding streams subject to the Governor's approval. Additionally, the subpart proposes processes on the handling \nof unobligated rapid response funds and ETA's role in the annual reallotment process that takes place between the \nStates and the Department after each PY. The proposed responsibility review provisions are also different from \nthose under WIA to reflect the new requirements in the Uniform Guidance. Lastly, this subpart outlines the closeout \nprocedures for title I of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser awards.\n\nSection 683.100When do Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant funds become available for obligation?\n\nThis proposed section describes the statutory requirements for the Department's release of formula funds under \ntitle I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act. WIOA youth funds may be released earlier than other formula funds, as \nearly as April, to assist States and locals in planning youth activities. Adult and dislocated worker funds will be \nawarded on a PY basis in two payments: In July after the beginning of the PY and a second release of funds in \nOctober of each PY. Wagner-Peyser funds will also be released on a PY basis, in July of each fiscal year. The \navailability of funds awarded on a competitive or discretionary basis will be dependent on the annual appropriation \nand on the grant or cooperative agreement.\n\nSection 683.105What award document authorizes the expenditure of funds under title I of the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act and the Wagner-Peyser Act?\n\nThis section recognizes the use of the three funding instruments that conform with the Uniform Guidance: Grant \nagreements, cooperative agreements, and contracts. The Department will no longer use the Governor/Secretary \nagreement, used under WIA, as afunding instrument because it is not consistent with the Uniform Guidance. \nProposed paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section specify the type of funding instruments that will be used for \ndifferent WIOA programs. Proposed paragraph (e)(3) implements WIOA sec. 169(b)(6)(B), which states that the \nDepartment may not award a contract or grant for research, studies, or multi-State projects \u201cto the same \norganization for more than 3 consecutive years unless such grant or contract is competitively reevaluated within \nsuch period.\u201d The Department interprets the central purpose of this provision to promote competition\u2014it prohibits \nthe Department from awarding lengthy contracts or grants on a non-competitive basis to the same organization. \nHowever, as long as the contract or grant is awarded on a competitive basis, the project (and therefore the award) \nmay span over a period of more than 3 years. This is consistent with the Department's need to conduct lengthy \nresearch and other projects and with the new flexibility to incrementally fund evaluations, research, and other \nprojects, provided in sec. 189(g)(2)(B)(ii) of WIOA. Finally, proposed paragraph (f) of \u00a7 683.105 makes clear that all \nthree funding instruments are subject to the closeout procedures in the Uniform Guidance.\n\nSection 683.110What is the period of performance of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-\nPeyser Act funds?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section describes the period of performance for different types of WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser \nAct grant awards. Proposed paragraph (a) provides a general explanation about expenditure periods. Specifically, \nthe period of performance for grants is the statutory period of availability for expenditure, unless otherwise provided \nin the grant agreement. Funds must be spent in a timely manner; if they are not expended by the end of the \nperformance period, they risk losing their availability. Grantees must expend funds with the shortest period of \navailability first, unless otherwise authorized in the agreement or in a subsequent modification. The proposed \nparagraph includes a sentence encouraging grantees to follow this rule, so that they use funds expeditiously and \neffectively. This approach should help reduce unexpended funds at the end of a grant's period of performance\n\nProposed \u00a7 683.110(b) through (h) restate the applicable periods of performance for WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser \nAct grants. WIOA did not change these periods for formula funds\u2014adult/dislocated worker and youth formula funds \nallotted during any PY are available for expenditure by the State only during that PY and the 2 succeeding PYs; \nfunds allocated by the State to a local area for any PY are available for expenditure only during that PY and the \nsucceeding PY (WIOA sec. 189(g)(2)). Proposed paragraph (c)(2) also requires that funds unexpended by a local \narea in the 2 year period be returned to the State and be used for specific purposes. This is unchanged from the \nWIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.107. However, proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii) notes an exception to the 2-year \nperformance period for local areas in the case of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracting strategies, a new option \nadded by secs. 129(c)(1)(D) and 134(d)(1)(iii) of WIOA and more fully discussed in proposed subpart E. Under this \nparagraph, and in accordance with sec. 189(g)(2)(D) of WIOA, funds used by local areas to carry out WIOA Pay-\nfor-Performance contract strategies remain available until expended. Additional information on this provision is \nexplained below in the discussion of proposed \u00a7 683.530. Proposed paragraph (h) also implements sec. 5(c) of the \nWagner-Peyser Act, and explains that funds allotted to States for grants under secs. 3 and 15 of the Wagner-\nPeyser Act for any PY are available for expenditure by the State receiving the funds only during that PY and the 2 \nsucceeding PYs.\n\nProposed paragraphs (d) and (e) provide the expenditure period for the Native American programs and MSFW \nprograms under secs. 166(c) and 167(a) of WIOA, respectively. In both programs, WIOA requires the Secretary to \nenter into grants or contracts with eligible entities every 4 years. Accordingly, the proposed paragraphs explain that \nfunds awarded by the Department under these programs are available for expenditure during the period identified in \nthe award document, which will not exceed 4 years.\n\nFor grants awarded for research or evaluations under WIOA sec. 169, funds remain available until expended, in \naccordance with sec. 189(g)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, or for the period of performance specified in the terms and conditions \nof the award. The Secretary has the authority to limit the period of expenditure of these funds in the terms and \nconditions of the grant award.\n\nFinally, proposed paragraph (f) explains that funds allotted for other programs under title I of WIOA, including secs. \n170 (National Dislocated Worker Grants (NDWGs) and 171 (Youthbuild program), are available for expenditure for \nthe period of performance identified in the grant or contract.\n\nSection 683.115What planning information must a State submit in order to receive a formula grant?\n\nThis proposed section implements the statutory requirement that an approved Unified State Plan or Combined \nState Plan be submitted before formula funds under title I, subtitle B, of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser can be issued. \nAs discussed in the preamble discussion of part 676, WIOA is apparently inconsistent as to whether outlying areas \nmust submit a Unified or Combined State Plan to receive funding under title I. The preamble discussion of part 676 \ndetails the apparent inconsistency and identifies potential options to resolve the inconsistency.\n\nSection 683.120How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I formula funds allocated to local areas?\n\nThis proposed section describes the timeframe and formula factors a Governor must employ when allocating funds \nto local areas under secs. 128 and 133. It also specifies the steps a Governor must take when issuing allocations, \nincluding consulting with Local Boards and elected officials prior to issuing the allocation. The Governors must issue \nthe funds to the local areas in a timely manner to allow for an adequate planning process.\n\n\n\nThis section also adopts the provision in sec. 134(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA that allows States to use unobligated rapid \nresponse funds, after the completion of the PY, for statewide activities.\n\nSection 683.125What minimum funding provisions apply to Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act adult, \ndislocated worker, and youth allocations?\n\nThis proposed section addresses the minimum funding thresholds for States funded under subtitle B of title I of \nWIOA. Minimum funding thresholds are established to offset the impact of fluctuations in the formula factors that \nresult from shifts in the economy that may be compounded by additional downturns in a particular industry or \nmarket in a particular State. Sections 128(b)(2)(A) and 133(b)(2)(A) of WIOA contain these minimum funding \nrequirements to avoid significant swings in the amount of funding a State receives from 1 year to the next and to \navoid any disruption of services or planning.\n\nSection 683.130Does a Local Board have the authority to transfer funds between the adult employment and training \nactivities allocation and the dislocated worker employment and training activities allocation?\n\nThis proposed section provides flexibility to local areas to provide services in the areas of greatest need by allowing \nfund transfers of up to 100 percent of a PY allocation between the local adult and local dislocated worker \nallocations. Proposed \u00a7 683.130(b) requires a Local Board to obtain written approval of the Governor before \nmaking such a transfer. This flexibility to transfer funds is contained in sec. 133(b)(4) of WIOA.\n\nSection 683.135What reallotment procedures does the Secretary use?\n\nThis proposed section implements secs. 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA, and explains the Department's process for \nrecapture and reallotment of formula funds awarded to the States under title I. The proposed rule requires the \nSecretary to make the determination about whether the State has obligated 80 percent of the funds during the \nsecond quarter of each PY, rather than the first quarter. The procedures are the same as those in the WIA \nregulation at 20 CFR 667.150, with a few exceptions. The Department proposes to make the determination during \nthe second quarter because State financial reports for the end of the PY period are not locked for modification until \nthe next quarter's reports are submitted, which is during the second quarter of the PY. The Department also uses \nthe term \u201ceach\u201d to make it clear that the Department performs the reallotment procedures every PY with respect to \nthe prior PY. Further, the section clarifies that the amount subject to recapture is based on the unobligated balance \nof the prior \u201cprogram\u201d year, in accordance with secs. 127(c)(2) and 132(c)(2) of the statute. Finally, the proposed \nsection clarifies the language that the recapture amount, if any, is determined separately for each funding stream.\n\nProposed \u00a7 683.135(c) defines the term \u201cobligation\u201d in accordance with the new OMB Administrative Requirements \nat 2 CFR 200.71 (\u201c[w]hen used in connection with a non-Federal entity's utilization of funds under a Federal award, \nobligations means orders placed for property and services, contracts, and subawards made, and similar \ntransactions during a given period that require payment by the non-Federal entity during the same or a future \nperiod.\u201d). The Department is using this definition to be consistent in our application of 2 CFR part 200, which is \napplicable to all funds awarded as grants or cooperative agreements. The proposed rule includes the same \nadditions to the definition of \u201cobligation\u201d that are in the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.150(d)(1) and (2). The \nDepartment will continue to recognize the monies allocated to the local areas through the formula process under \nsubtitle B of title I as obligated by the States for the purposes of this section, and the Department has clarified this \nby adding the words \u201cto the local area\u201d in proposed paragraph (c)(1). Because of this, local transfers between the \nadult and dislocated worker funding streams do not impact the Department's recapture calculation for reallotment \namong the States. Similarly, the fact that up to 10 percent of local funds may be reserved for administrative costs \ndoes not affect the calculation. Recapture and reallotment of funds among States will occur during PY 2015 based \non obligations in PY 2014, because the procedures for realloting funds did not change from WIA to WIOA.\n\nNew in WIOA, sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(ii) permits the Governor to use rapid response funds that remain unobligated after \nthe first PY for which they were allotted to carry out statewide employment and training activities. The rapid \nresponse funds will be included in the calculation of unobligated funding to determine if a State is subject to \nreallotment. Sections 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA do not except rapid response funds from recapture\u2014a tool which \nprovides a strong incentive for States to expeditiously expend funds.\n\n\n\nExcepting rapid response funds from the reallotment calculation would effectively remove the reallotment provision \nout of the statute. The Department generally is able to recapture and reallot only dislocated worker funds, because \nStates immediately obligate 85 percent of their adult and youth program funds by allocating them to the local areas \nthrough the formula process. Because sec. 133(a)(2) of WIOA allows the Governor to reserve up to 25 percent of \ndislocated worker funds for rapid response activities, there may never be a situation where 80 percent of the \nremaining dislocated worker funds have not been obligated. Therefore, the Department includes rapid response \nfunds in the calculation of a State's unobligated funding to determine if the State is subject to recapture and \nreallotment.\n\nHowever, even if a State is subject to reallotment, the Governor may use the unobligated rapid response funds \ndescribed in WIOA sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(ii) that remain available after reallotment to carry out statewide employment \nand training activities (in addition to rapid response activities). This preserves the additional flexibility provided to \nthe Governors in WIOA sec. 134, by permitting Governors to use rapid response funds for statewide employment \nand training activities if not expended in the first year of availability. The Department welcomes comments on the \nproposed reallotment approach and potential impact on States, including the transfer flexibility.\n\n\u00a7 683.140What reallocation procedures must the Governors use?\n\nThis proposed section describes the procedures for reallocating youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds among \nlocal areas in the State, in accordance with secs. 128(c) and 133(c) of WIOA, and is unchanged from the WIA \nregulation at 20 CFR 667.160 except that proposed paragraph (a) requires the Governor to consult with the State \nBoard before reallocating, as required by secs. 128(c)(1) and 133(c)(1) of WIOA. Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies \nthat the amount to be recaptured, if any, must be separately determined for each funding stream, and the \ncalculations of unobligated balances in each stream must be adjusted to account for any funds that are transferred \nbetween funding streams under proposed \u00a7 683.130. The Department also notes that States and local areas are \nrequired to adhere to the definition of \u201cobligations\u201d in 2 CFR 200.71.\n\nSection 683.145What merit review and risk assessment does the Department conduct for Federal financial \nassistance awards made under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I, subtitle D?\n\nThis proposed section includes new requirements mandated by the Uniform Guidance. First, there is a requirement \nfor the use of merit review as a means to ensure that discretionary or competitive grants and cooperative \nagreements are awarded through a competitive, merit-based process. Second, this section incorporates the \nUniform Guidance requirement, found at 2 CFR 200.205, that an agency must have \u201ca framework for evaluating the \nrisks posed by applicants before they receive Federal Awards.\u201d The factors the Grant Officer will consider are listed \nin this section and drawn from 2 CFR 200.205. Additional guidance will be issued to further specify how the Grant \nOfficer will evaluate these factors in determining whether the applicantshould be precluded from receipt of Federal \nfinancial assistance.\n\nSection 683.150What closeout requirements apply to grants funded with Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \ntitle I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?\n\nThis proposed section is new; there is not one like it in the WIA regulations. It addresses closeout, which is an \nimportant component to complete the grant life cycle. This section paraphrases the Uniform Administrative \nrequirement sections on closeout and post-closeout adjustments (2 CFR 200.343-344). Specifically, when the \nperiod of performance ends, the Department will close out the Federal award after determining that all \nadministrative actions and required work have been completed by the grant recipient. The grant recipient must \nsubmit all required reports and liquidate all obligations and/or accrued expenditures within 90 days of the end of \nthe performance period. The Department will promptly reimburse the grant recipient for allowable reimbursable \ncosts under the Federal award being closed out. The non-Federal entity must promptly refund any balanced of \nunobligated cash that is owed to the Department. The Department will settle for any upward or downward \nadjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received. The grant recipient must account for \nany real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal government. The \nDepartment must complete all closeout actions no later than 1 year after receiving and accepting all required final \nreports; however, closeout does not affect the Department's right to disallow costs and recover funds, or obligations \nof the grantee, including audit, property management, and records retention requirements. After award closeout, a \n\n\n\nrelationship created under the award may be modified or ended. Grant recipients that award funds to subrecipients \nmust institute a timely closeout process after the end of performance to ensure a timely closeout in accordance with \nthis section.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Administrative Rules, Costs and Limitations\n\nFinancial and Administrative Rules. These proposed regulations provide the rules applicable to WIOA grants in the \nareas of fiscal and administrative requirements, audit requirements, and allowable cost/cost principles, and includes \nchanges as the result of the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200 and any exceptions to 2 CFR part 200 that have \nbeen released by the Department under 2 CFR part 2900. To support the fiscal integrity of the grant process, \nproposed \u00a7 683.220 requires recipients and subprecipients of WIOA or Wagner-Peyser Act funds to have an \ninternal control structure in place that provides safeguards to protect personally identifiable information and other \nsensitive information. This section is new to WIOA; there is no corresponding section in the WIA regulations. \nAnother new section provides rules for using real property with Federal equity. Under this provision, Federal equity \nacquired in real property through grants to States awarded under title III of the SSA or the Wagner-Peyser Act is \ntransferred to the States that used the grant to acquire the equity; the portion of the equity transferred must be used \nto carryout activities authorized under these programs and/or WIOA. The new section also provides instructions on \nusing properties funded with Reed Act equity or the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).\n\nCosts and Limitations. This proposed regulation in \u00a7 683.205 delineates activities and functions associated with the \ncost of administration as well as cost limitations (discussed in proposed \u00a7 683.205). The intent continues to be that \nthe function and intended purpose of an activity should be used to determine whether the costs are administrative \nor programmatic. There is a new section on salary and bonus limitations, which prescribes limits on salaries and \nbonuses in both WIOA and Wagner-Peyser programs. The proposed subpart also describes activities that are \nprohibited under WIOA, such as employment generating activities and activities that encourage business relocation.\n\nResponsibilities toward participants and employees. These proposed regulations provide rules on employee \ndisplacement, wage and labor standards, health and safety standards, and non-discrimination.\n\nOther rules. There is a new section addressing the allowability of earning under WIOA grants.\n\nSection 683.200What general fiscal and administrative rules apply to the use of Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser funds?\n\nThis proposed section describes the application of the Uniform Guidance and the corresponding exceptions \nauthorized by the Department at 2 CFR part 2900 for all grant recipients and subrecipients, including for-profit \norganizations and foreign entities. It references the cost principles, discusses when prior approval for certain \nexpenditures is required, and highlights a number of specific requirements in the Uniform Guidance and the WIOA \nstatute. For example, this section addresses the requirement that interest income be disposed of using the addition \nmethod and requires an entity to provide additional program services with those funds. This section also addresses \ntimes when income is earned and how it is recognized, reported, and applied to the program. It outlines the code of \nconduct and conflict of interest requirements that must be implemented under 2 CFR part 200, as well as certain \nrestrictions imposed on grant recipients and subrecipients when using WIOA and Wagner-Peyser funds, including \nthe Buy-American provision in sec. 502 of WIOA. Likewise, this section requires adherence to the mandatory \ndisclosure requirements found in 2 CFR part 200 on all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or \ngratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Additional disclosures on lobbying, drug-free workplace, \ndebarment, and suspension continue to be required as well. Such disclosures must be timely and in writing. Failure \nto make the required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in \u00a7 200.338, remedies for \nnoncompliance, including suspension or debarment.\n\nSection 683.205What administrative cost limitations apply to Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \ngrants?\n\nThis proposed section specifies the statutory administrative cost limitations on title I grant funds. States receiving \nformula WIOA funds are limited to spending no more than 5 percent of their annual allotment on administrative \ncosts. Local areas are limited to spending no more than 10 percent of their annual allocation on administrative \n\n\n\ncosts. Flexibility is provided to States and local areas in the statute by allowing administrative funds from the three \nformula funding streams awarded under subtitle B to be pooled and used together for administrative costs for any of \nthe three programs, at the State and locals' discretion. For other WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser funding, the \nadministrative cost limits can be found in the grant agreement and are subject to the Uniform Guidance.\n\nSection 683.210What audit requirements apply to the use of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and \ntitle III funds?\n\nThis proposed section specifies the audit requirements for all grant recipients and subrecipients of WIOA funds that \nexpend more than $750,000 in Federal funds during the fiscal year, including for-profit entities that are grant \nrecipients or subrecipients of WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser funds. As this proposed section notes, the audit \nrequirements do not normally pass through to contractors, but will in some situations, such as where the payments \nare found to constitute a Federal award rather than a payment for goods and services. This section seeks to \nimplement the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.\n\nSection 683.215What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I functions and activities constitute the costs of \nadministration subject to the administrative cost limitation?\n\nThe proposed section defines the functions and activities that constitute administration in accordance with sec. 3(1) \nof WIOA, and therefore are subject to the administrative cost limitations discussed in proposed \u00a7 683.205. The \nDepartment notes that this proposed section applies to activities performed under all grants awarded under title I of \nWIOA. It does not apply to activities funded through contracts, such as operation of Job Corps centers. The \nproposed rule is the same as the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.220 with a few exceptions. For clarification, fiscal \nagent responsibilities are now included in the list of enumerated administrative costs. Regions are also included in \nthe list of entities that can incur administrative costs, consistent with sec. 106 of WIOA. The Department made \nthese enhancements because services can be integrated and streamlined through regions that may cross \ngeographical boundaries or local economic areas. Additionally, the section refers to \u201ccontractors\u201d instead of \n\u201cvendors\u201d to be consistent with the Uniform Guidance, which replaces vendor with contractor and defines \n\u201ccontractor\u201d at 2 CFR 200.23.\n\nProposed \u00a7 683.215(c) describes some activities that can be administrative, programmatic, or both, depending on \nwhether the underlying functions which they support are classified as programmatic or administrative. These \ninclude costs of activities such as information systems development and operation, travel, and continuous \nimprovement. For example, the costs of developing an information system, which serves both administrative \nfunctions, and the tracking and monitoring of participants, would be allocated between program costs and \nadministrative costs in proportion to the use of the system for each intended purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, preparing program-level budgets and program plans are classified as program costs. The \nnegotiation of MOUs and one-stop infrastructure agreements, and certifications of one-stop centers are also \nprogram costs, because they build or support the one-stop delivery system and services to participants.\n\nThe Department welcomes comments regarding whether it is more advantageous to issue the proposed list of \nadministrative costs in \u00a7 683.215(b) as a regulation, or to provide a general description of administrative costs \nsimilar to the definition in sec. 3(1) of WIOA and provide a rationale for why such an approach is advantageous. \nThe Department also seeks comment on whether this list will need to be flexible, and subject to review and change \nperiodically, or whether it is anticipated to be stable. Additionally, the Department seeks comment as to whether \nindirect costs should be included as programmatic or administrative.\n\nFinally, proposed \u00a7 683.215(d) requires entities to make efforts to streamline administrative services and reduce \nadministrative costs by minimizing duplication and effectively using information technology to improve services. The \nDepartment expects that streamlining the administration of the program will minimize duplication of multiple \nsystems at different levels of grant administration so that more funds will be available for program activities.\n\nSection 683.220What are the internal control requirements for recipients and subrecipients of Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?\n\n\n\nThis proposed new section describes the internal controls that recipients and subrecipients must install and have in \nplace when expending WIOA and Wagner-Peyser Act funds, and is based on 2 CFR 200.303. The controls include \nhaving a structure and policies in place to protect personally identifiable and sensitive information, including \ninformation that the Department considers to be sensitive, and providing reasonable assurances that the recipient \nor subrecipient is managing the award in compliance with Federal law and the terms of the award, complying with \nFederal law and the conditions of the award, evaluating and monitoring the recipient's or subrecipient's compliance \nwith Federal law and award terms, and taking prompt action when noncompliance is identified. The internal controls \nmust meet the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework. The \nframework established has been used in the private sector for numerous years and provides standards to achieve \nreasonable assurance in the achievement of the following: Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; reliability of \nfinancial reporting; compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and safeguarding of assets. Complying with \nthe internal control requirements will increase accountability and transparency in the use of WIOA and Wagner-\nPeyser Act funds. Through past monitoring and oversight, the Department discovered that some grantees did not \nhave the tools or access to resources to build a strong internal control structure. The Department will work with \nStates and discretionary grantees to provide tools and assistance to achieve better results through its internal \ncontrol structure. Direct grant recipients must assist their subrecipients in achieving an internal control structure \nframework consistent with 2 CFR part 200 and COSO.\n\nSection 683.225What requirements relate to the enforcement of the Military Selective Service Act?\n\nThis proposed section specifies the requirements of the Military Selective Service Act for programs and activities \nauthorized under title I of WIOA and found in sec. 189(h) of WIOA. This proposed section is substantively the same \nas the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.250.\n\nSection 683.230Are there special rules that apply to veterans when income is a factor in eligibility determinations?\n\nThis proposed section addresses the laws governing the determination of eligibility for veterans and their spouses \nfor WIOA funded services with income qualification requirements. The parameters for the exclusion of certain \nincome from the eligibility determination process are outlined in this section. This section also states that the same \nmethod of excluding certain income of veterans must also be used when a local area imposes a priority of service \nthreshold when funding for program services is limited.\n\nSection 683.235May Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I funds be spent for construction?\n\nThis proposed section is different from the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.260. It is based on the requirements in \nthe Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.439(b)(3). The proposed text states that WIOA title I funds must not be spent \non construction, purchase of facilities or buildings, or other capital expenditures for improvements to land or \nbuildings except with prior approval of the Secretary. Under the statute, WIOA title I funds can be used for \nconstruction only in limited situations, including meeting obligations to provide physical and programmatic \naccessibility and reasonable accommodations, certain repairs, renovations, alterations, and capital improvements of \nproperty, and for disaster relief projects under WIOA sec. 170(d), YouthBuild programs under WIOA sec. \n171(c)(2)(A)(i), and for other projects that the Secretary determines necessary to carry out WIOA, as described by \nunder sec. 189(c) of WIOA. The proposed regulatory text is meant to include all these situations, but not offer an \nexclusive list to ensure that the Secretary is able to use the funds for construction in any situation where it might be \nnecessary.\n\nSection 683.240What are the instructions for using real property with Federal Equity?\n\nThe proposed section provides rules on State Employee Security Act (SESA) properties, Reed Act-funded \nproperties, and JTPA-funded properties. The proposed section provides guidance on these different properties \nbecause the use of these properties can play an integral part in WIOA's intent to align Federal investments to \nsupport jobs seekers and employers. Such efforts are not only achieved through strategic coordination among one-\nstop partners, but through physical presence at offices in the one-stop delivery system. Many buildings that have \nexisting Federal equity currently house Wagner-Peyser programs, and it seems logical to use these facilities as \nAmerican Job Centers if they are accessible and available and can support the requirements for colocation outlined \nin proposed \u00a7\u00a7 678.310 through 678.320. Properties with Reed Act equity may also play a role in the American Job \nCenter System. Lastly, the Department is aware that many local workforce development areas that were previously \n\n\n\nknown as service delivery areas (SDAs) continue to be used as facilities for WIA programs, and they should \ncontinue to be used for the one-stop delivery service system under WIOA. The Department welcomes feedback on \nthese provisions. Making use of these properties for the one-stop delivery system in accordance with statutory \nrequirements will maximize the investments already made in these buildings and help to achieve the goals of \nWIOA.\n\nWith respect to Federal equity in SESA properties, the proposed section restates the requirements of sec. 192 of \nWIOA, and explains that Federal equity acquired in real property through grants to States awarded under title III of \nthe SSA or the Wagner-Peyser Act is transferred to the States that used the grant to acquire the equity. The portion \nof the real property attributable to the Federal equity transferred must be used to carry out activities authorized \nunder WIOA, title III of the SSA, or the Wagner-Peyser Act. When the property is no longer needed to carry out \nthose activities, the States are directed to request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer. Proceeds from the \ndisposition must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, title III of the SSA, or the Wagner-Peyser \nAct.\n\nThe statutory limitation in sec. 192(b) of WIOA is provided as well. States are not permitted to use funds awarded \nunder WIOA, title III of the Social Security, or the Wagner-Peyser Act to amortize the costs of the real property that \nis purchased by any State after February 15, 2007.\n\nThe Department has also included the new requirement from sec. 121(e)(3) of WIOA and sec. 3(d) of the Wagner-\nPeyser Act that properties occupied by Wagner-Peyser ESs be collocated with one-stop centers.\n\nWith respect to Reed Act-funded properties, the proposed rule states that properties with Reed Act equity may be \nused for the one-stop delivery system to the extent that the proportionate share of Reed Act equity is less than or \nequal to the proportionate share of occupancy by the Wagner-Peyser and UC programs. However, subject to \nconditions specified in sec. 903(c)(2) of the SSA and any appropriations limitations, a State is permitted, at its \ndiscretion, to use Reed Act funds for \u201cthe administration of its UC law and public employment offices.\u201d When the \nproperty is no longer needed for these activities, the State must request disposition instructions from the Grant \nOfficer prior to sale. Because Reed Act funded properties are different than other Federal equity properties, \ndisposition instructions will include a requirement to return the funds attributable to the Reed Act equity to the \nState's account in the Unemployment Trust fund. See discussion in TEGL 3-07 \u201cTransfer of Federal Equity in State \nReal Property to the States.\u201d It is expected that additional guidance will be issued to update the guidance contained \nin TEGL 3-07, which will include instructions on the handling of such properties when considering colocation of \nWagner-Peyser, as required in sec. 121(e)(3) of WIOA and sec. 3(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act (as added by the \namendments in title III of WIOA).\n\nFor JTPA funded properties, the proposed rule states that real property that was purchased with JTPA funds and \ntransferred to WIA, is now transferred to the WIOA title I programs and may be used for WIOA purposes. It is the \nDepartment's position that the Federal equity remains with the property while in use. Many properties that were \npurchased with JTPA funds continue to be locations that house and serve individuals and staff persons under WIA, \nand as such, those same buildings must continue to be used for the purposes of WIOA. If JTPA properties that \nwere being used for WIA activities will not be used for WIOA programs, disposal of the property must occur. When \nthe real property is no longer needed for the WIOA activities, the recipient must seek instructions from the Grant \nOfficer prior to disposition or sale. A subrecipient would seek instructions from the State. Such instructions must be \nconsistent with 2 CFR part 200. The Department welcomes any feedback from the workforce development system \nthat promotes the use of these properties and streamlines the disposition process.\n\nSection 683.245Are employment generating activities, or similar activities, allowable under title I of the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section implements sec. 181(e) of WIOA, which restricts the use of WIOA funds for employment \ngenerating activities except where the activities are directly related to training for eligible individuals. The proposed \nsection states that employer outreach and job development activities are considered to be directly related to \ntraining for eligible individuals, and it lists a number of examples of acceptable activities. The section also describes \nthe conditions in which WIOA funds can be used for employer outreach.\n\n\n\nSection 683.250What other activities are prohibited under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section describes other activities that are expressly prohibitedin title I of WIOA, including foreign \ntravel paid for by WIOA formula funds (sec. 181(e) of WIOA) payment of wages of incumbent workers participating \nin economic development activities (sec. 181(b) of WIOA), contracts with persons falsely labeling products as \nmade in America (sec. 502(c) of WIOA), and others.\n\nSection 683.255What are the limitations related to religious activities in title I of the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section describes the limitations related to using WIOA funds to support religious activities, including \nthe preclusion on employment of participants for the construction, operation, or maintenance of facilities used for \nsectarian purposes or worship, which is contained in sec. 188(a)(3) of WIOA. This section also references 29 CFR \npart 2, subpart D, which describes other limitations in detail, along with certain exceptions. This proposed section \ncontains similar requirements as the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.266.\n\nSection 683.260What prohibitions apply to the use of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I funds to \nencourage business relocation?\n\nThis proposed section describes the prohibitions on the use of WIOA title I funds to encourage business relocation, \nincluding specific timeframes when entities can begin working with such businesses. This section also describes the \nStates' obligation to develop procedures to implement these rules. These provisions implement the requirements of \nsec 181(d) of WIOA. This proposed section contains the same requirements as the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n667.268.\n\nSection 683.265What procedures and sanctions apply to violations of this part?\n\nThis proposed section lists the provisions that provide for sanctions resulting from the violation of \u00a7\u00a7 683.235-260.\n\nSection 683.270What safeguards are there to ensure that participants in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nemployment and training activities do not displace other employees?\n\nThis proposed section outlines conditions and safeguards to ensure that any WIOA title I participant does not \ndisplace an existing employee by participating in a WIOA title I program or activity. It also states that an employee \ncan file a complaint alleging displacement. Section 181(b)(2) of WIOA did not change the WIA displacement \nrequirements at sec. 181(b)(2) of WIA. Accordingly, this regulation is unchanged from the WIA regulation at 20 CFR \n667. 270.\n\nSection 683.275What wage and labor standards apply to participants in activities under title I of the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section describes the wage and labor standards that apply to WIOA title I participants, including the \nrequirements under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and State and local minimum wage laws. The \nregulation is unchanged from the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.272, except that it includes two additional \nprovisions from sec. 181 of WIOA. The first is that the reference to the FLSA minimum wage requirement does not \napply to territorial jurisdictions in which the minimum wage requirement does not apply (WIOA sec. 181(a)(1)(B)), \nand the second is that WIOA title I funds must not be used to pay the wages of incumbent employees during their \nparticipation in economic development activities provided through a statewide workforce delivery system (WIOA \nsec. 181(b)(1)). This requirement is also found in proposed \u00a7 683.250(a)(1), but it is included here as well to give a \ncomplete list of the wage standards that apply to WIOA participants.\n\nSection 683.280What health and safety standards apply to the working conditions of participants in activities under \ntitle I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThe proposed section explains what health and safety standards and workers compensation laws apply to WIOA \ntitle I participants. The standards in WIOA are the same as those in WIA, so the regulation is unchanged from the \nWIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.274.\n\nSection 683.285What are a recipient's obligations to ensure nondiscrimination and equal opportunity, and what are \na recipient's obligations with respect to religious activities?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section describes the nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and religious activities requirements that \nrecipients, as defined in WIOA sec. 188 and at 29 CFR part 37, must adhere to when using WIOA title I funds. \nWIOA did not change these requirements, so the proposed section contains the same requirements as the WIA \nregulation at 20 CFR 667.275, with a few exceptions. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(1) of the proposed rule refers to \n\u201cJob Corps contractors,\u201d instead of \u201cvendors,\u201d to conform with 29 CFR part 37. Additionally, proposed \u00a7 \n683.285(a)(4) implements sec. 188(a)(4) of WIOA, which prohibits discriminating against an individual because of \nthat person's status as a WIOA title I participant. Proposed \u00a7 683.285(a)(5) also implements the requirement at \nsec. 188(a)(5) of WIOA that participation in WIOA title I programs and activities be available to citizens and \nnationals of the United States, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, refugees, asylees, and parolees, and \nother immigrants authorized by the Attorney General to work in the United States. Finally, the proposed section \nincludes the Wagner- Peyser program as an example of a Department program that is covered by 29 CFR part 2, \nsubpart D.\n\nSection 683.290Are there salary and bonus restrictions in place for the use of Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?\n\nThis proposed section implements the requirements of sec. 194(15) of WIOA related to salary and bonus \nrestrictions that apply to recipients or subrecipients. Although the statute applies the restrictions to WIOA title I \nfunding, the Department expanded application to Wagner-Peyser Act recipients and subrecipients. The \nappropriations acts for the last 9 years (Pub. L. 109-234 June 15, 2006) have applied the limitation to all ETA-\nfunded programs; thus, interpreting the provision as applying to Wagner-Peyser funded activities is appropriate. \nAdditionally, it is the Department's policy to ensure that funding is directed to substantive workforce employment \nand training activities to the greatest extent possible, rather than to administrative costs.\n\nThe proposed section restates the WIOA statutory provisions. Specifically, it prohibits recipients and subrecipients \nfrom paying the salary and bonuses of an individual, either as direct or indirect costs, at a rate in excess of the \nannual rate of basic pay prescribed for level II of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5313. Additionally, the \nlimitation does not apply to contractors providing goods and services as defined in OMB's Uniform Administrative \nrequirements (which supersedes OMB Circular A-133 cited in the statute). The Department has used the term \n\u201ccontractors\u201d instead of the statutory term \u201cvendor\u201d to be consistent with the term used in the Uniform Guidance. \nThe proposed rule also explains the provision at WIOA sec. 194(15)(B) that a State may establish a lower limit for \nsalaries and bonuses.\n\nFinally, the Department has provided direction for scenarios in which an employee may be funded by \nvariousprograms or work for multiple offices. If funds awarded under title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act pay \nonly a portion of the employee's salary or bonus, the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyer Act funds may only be charged \nfor the share of the employee's salary or bonus attributable to the work performed on the WIOA title I or Wagner-\nPeyser Act grant. That portion cannot exceed the proportional Executive level II rate. This restriction applies to the \nsum of salary and bonus payments made to an individual whether they are charged as direct costs or indirect costs \nunder title I of WIOA and Wagner-Peyer. When an individual is working for the same recipient or subrecipient in \nmultiple offices that are funded by title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act, the recipient or subrecipient must \nensure that the sum of the individual's salary and bonus payments does not exceed the prescribed limitation. These \nclarifications will help to ensure that WIOA and Wagner-Peyser Act funds are not overcharged for salary and bonus \npayments and that there are no \u201cloopholes\u201d in applying the limitation.\n\nSection 683.295Is earning of profit allowed under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section addresses earning profit under WIOA. As the network of training services and one-stop \noperators has changed over the years, the Department is including the proposed section to address working with \nfor-profit entities and the earning of profit by these entities. Proposed \u00a7 683.295(a)(2) includes a requirement for \ngrants and other Federal financial assistance awarded under secs. 121(d) and 134(b) of WIOA, which states that \nwhere a Federal financial assistance award authorizes one-stop operators, service providers, or ETPs to earn profit, \nthe pass through entity must follow 2 CFR 200.323 to ensure that the entities' charges are reasonable and fair. The \nrequirement in 2 CFR 200.323 that profit be negotiated as a separate element of the price will provide greater \ntransparency as to the amount of profit earned by for-profit entities whether they are subrecipients or \n\n\n\nsubcontractors. This paragraph (a)(2) describes an exception to the general rule that for-profit entities acting under \na contract are allowed to earn profit. When the for-profit entity is a recipient of a grant or other Federal financial \nassistance, the entities will now be covered by the Uniform Guidance rather than the Federal Acquisition \nRegulations. The general rule, for when for-profit entities are working as contractors, is included in proposed \u00a7 \n683.295(a)(3). The paragraph notes that the profit is allowable provided that the contractor abides by the \nrequirements of 2 CFR 200.323. Proposed \u00a7 683.295(b) states that for programs authorized by other sections of \nWIOA, profit will be prohibited unless authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Reporting Requirements\n\nThis subpart provides guidance for reporting that will promote transparency and accountability at the grant recipient \nlevel. With today's demand for data in an open and transparent environment, the Federal government meets the \nchallenges with initiatives such as the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, requiring the Department to \nopen access to data and use common data metrics. Performance and financial data, when made available, can \nlead to innovation. Not only does the Secretary seek to employ fresh and innovative approaches in serving job \nseekers and employers, the Department wants to utilize our resources and reporting portals to provide to the public \nvisualizations rich in data and metrics to assist in better understanding of the employment environment. It is the \nDepartment's intent to use data collected from the financial, performance, and annual reports to empower our \nworkforce system while providing transparency and accountability to our stakeholders. This subpart seeks to \npromote the government's initiative to manage information as an asset to increase operational efficiencies, reduce \ncosts, improve services, support mission needs, safeguard personal information, and increase public access. One \nway to promote this initiative is through the collection and transmission of data, using machine readable formats \nwhenever possible. To safeguard personally identifiable information, recipients and subrecipients must limit the \ncollection and transmission of such data and use encrypted transmission software. To increase operational \nefficiencies and reduce costs, the Department and its grantees work together to find solutions that allow for the \nstreamlining of reporting and the reduction of duplication of systems and efforts. The Department's existing financial \nexpenditure form (ETA-9130) will be modified to reflect new reporting requirements. The Secretary will issue \nadditional guidance on this topic.\n\n683.300What are the reporting requirements for programs funded under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct?\n\nTo continue with efforts for accountability and transparency as well as to provide data to our stakeholders, the \nDepartment requires its recipients to submit financial and performance reports, as well as an annual performance \nreport. The data contained in these reports must be generated and processed in formats that are compatible with \nother commonly used data systems and be in machine readable formats. This proposed section specifies the \nreporting requirements for grant recipients and the deadlines for such reports. This section also sets forth recipients' \nresponsibility to collect data from subrecipients. Pargraphs (b), (d), and (e) separately describe the performance \nreporting requirements for the core programs under sec. 116 of WIOA and part 677 and other grant programs \nauthorized under title I of WIOA.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Oversight and Resolution of Findings\n\nThis proposed subpart addressees the oversight and resolution responsibilities of the Department and grant \nrecipients of WIOA funds. Oversight and monitoring is a valuable tool in effectively managing grants and this \nsubpart emphasizes the need for careful application of these requirements by the Department and by recipients.\n\nOversight. These regulations which provide for oversight and resolution responsibilities of the Department and its \ngrant recipients are an important part of the Department's overall strategy to improve grant administration and to \npromote the vision of WIOA. As in WIA, States will review their subrecipients and validate their compliance with the \nUniform Guidance on an annual basis and certify compliance to the Secretary every 2 years. The States and grant \nrecipients must also install a monitoring system that meets the requirements of the Uniform Guidance and includes \nthe examination of such items as performance, program goals, non-discrimination, conflict of interest, and \nmandatory disclosures.\n\n\n\nResolution. The resolution of findings that arise from audits, investigations, monitoring reviews, and the Grant \nOfficer resolution process is specified in this proposed subpart. It also provides clarification on the effect of the \nUniform Guidance on the resolution process at the subrecipient level. When action to resolve findings is \ninadequate, the Department will take additional actionagainst the State or other direct grant recipient to reach \nresolution. Such action will include the Grant Officer resolution process, including the initial and final determination \nprocess, as described in proposed \u00a7 683.440.\n\n\u00a7 683.400What are the Federal and State monitoring and oversight responsibilities?\n\nThis proposed section identifies the requirements of the Department in performing oversight and monitoring of its \ngrant recipients and of the Department's grant recipients' responsibility for subrecipients. Proposed \u00a7 683.400(c) \ndescribes the requirements WIOA has placed on the States to create a monitoring system for their subrecipients. \nProposed paragraph (d) also requires the retention of evidence related to monitoring functions and resolution \nactions. This section also covers the new requirements under the Uniform Guidance which requires an \nexamination of recipient and subrecipient non-discrimination and conflict of interest policies, mandatory disclosures \nof all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal \naward.\n\nSection 683.410What are the oversight roles and responsibilities of recipients and subrecipients of Federal financial \nassistance awarded under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Wagner-Peyser?\n\nThis proposed section defines the roles and areas in which oversight must be conducted by the recipients and \nsubrecipients, including ensuring compliance with relevant rules and developing a monitoring system. Proposed \nparagraph (b) of the section also discusses a number of requirements for the States' monitoring systems and the \nGovernor's biannual certification. The Department has always placed significant emphasis on monitoring as a tool \nin providing effective grants managements and this emphasis is further supported by the inclusion of monitoring in \nthe Uniform Guidance. Monitoring and oversight also helps in identifying technical assistance needs, areas for \nimprovement, and best practices.\n\nSection 683.420What procedures apply to the resolution of findings arising from audits, investigations, monitoring, \nand oversight reviews?\n\nProposed \u00a7 683.420(a) describes the steps and procedures that must be taken by grant recipients to resolve \nfindings at the subrecipient level. For formula funds, sec. 184(a) of WIOA requires States to use the procedures \nthey have in place for other Federal grant programs or, in the absence of such procedures, write standards for this \nprogram. Paragraph (a)(2) states that non-formula grant recipients must have written monitoring and resolutions \nprocedures that adhere to the Uniform Guidance governing monitoring of subrecipients. All recipients must ensure \nthat the rules governing the use of WIOA funds are being followed, including adherence to cost categories and cost \nlimitations. Proposed \u00a7 683.420(b) also describes the processes the Department will use to resolve findings of its \ndirect grant recipients, and proposed paragraph (c) describes the processes to resolve findings regarding the non-\ndiscrimination provisions in sec. 188 of WIOA.\n\nSection 683.430How does the Secretary resolve investigative and monitoring findings?\n\nThis proposed section describes the actions the Secretary will take to resolve findings. This section also describes \nthe process when the Grant Officer agrees that the recipient's actions are sufficient to resolve a finding and when \nthey are not satisfactory. This proposed section implements the requirements of sec. 184(a)(7) of WIOA. Proposed \n\u00a7 683.430(b) states that audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be resolved through the Grant Officer resolution process \ndescribed in proposed \u00a7 683.440.\n\nSection 683.440What is the Grant Officer resolution process?\n\nThis proposed section describes the Grant Officer's resolution process when dissatisfied with the actions taken by \nthe grant recipient to resolve findings. This process involves the issuance of an Initial Determination followed by a \nperiod for informal resolution which allows the recipient to work with the Department to provide the necessary \ndocumentation or take certain action to reach a resolution. At the end of that period, the Grant Officer issues a Final \n\n\n\nDetermination with findings listing any unresolved issues, establishing any debts, and listing required corrective \nactions, as well as offering the opportunity for a hearing. This process is unchanged from the process under WIA.\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Pay-for-Performance Contract Strategies\n\nIntroduction\n\nWIOA's Pay-for-Performance provisions were designed to provide flexibility at the local level in an effort to infuse \nthe system with more innovation, improve results for participants, and reward providers who deliver outstanding \nresults. This regulatory proposal builds on the Department's experience with innovations and evidence-based work \nfunded under the Workforce Innovation Fund and other Federally authorized activities. Moreover, the statute \nauthorizes States to use non-Federal funds to establish incentives for Local Boards to implement WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contract strategies. We encourage States to adopt evidence-based approaches and innovate in the \nway they deliver services to participants in order to improve outcomes, and recognize that WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contracting strategies, while still experimental, are one promising method to do so.\n\nA performance-based contract is a contracting strategy that establishes specific benchmarks that must be \nachieved in order for the contractor to receive payment. The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts are a specific \nform of contracting that, as authorized by WIOA, have six distinct characteristics: (1) They must provide adult \ntraining services described in sec. 134(c)(3) of WIOA or youth activities described in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA; (2) \nthey must specify a fixed amount that will be paid to the service provider based on the achievement of specified \nlevels of performance on the performance outcomes in sec. 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA within a defined timetable; (3) the \nperformance outcomes achieved must be independently validated using high-quality, reliable, and verified data; (4) \noutcomes must be reported in accordance with sec. 116(d)(2)(K) of WIOA; (5) pursuant to sec. 3(47)(A) of WIOA, \nbonuses may be built into WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts so long as such bonuses are used to expand the \ncontractor's capacity to provide effective training; and (6) there may be an extended period of availability to expend \nfunds under Pay-for-Performance contract strategies. Additionally, the funds obligated for WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contract strategies are limited to 10 percent of the total of the local adult and dislocated worker \nallotments provided under sec. 133(b) of WIOA, and 10 percent of the local youth allotment provided under sec. \n128(b) of WIOA.\n\nThe WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is one of several innovative strategies WIOA adopts to place a \nhigher emphasis on performance outcomes and provider accountability, drive better results, and incorporate \nrigorous evaluation and evidence-based practice into the delivery of workforceservices. The Department intends to \nsupport this contracting approach by incorporating WIOA Pay-for-Performance into its WIOA performance \nreporting requirements for States in which local areas are adopting such a contracting approach.\n\nThe WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy can benefit local areas, job seekers, and business customers \nwhen used to support interventions that have a high probability of success based on prior evidence; have \nmeasurable outcomes supported with authoritative data and strong evaluation methodologies; and are overseen by \nexperienced managers that have flexibility to adjust their approach.\n\nGiven the heavy emphasis that WIOA Pay-For-Performance authorities place on outcome-based payment and \nindependent validation, the quality of local area data and data systems should be of high enough quality to be able \nto (1) reliably and validly establish appropriate performance benchmarks for the target population, and (2) support \nindependent validation of actual performance outcomes.\n\nIn particular, in order for these contracting mechanisms to work effectively and efficiently, they must incorporate \nmeasures to prevent or account for potential \u201ccreaming\u201d by service providers, and strong data systems are essential \nto this function. The use of outcome data from comparison groups\u2014substantially similar populations who are not \nreceiving services through the provider\u2014is one potential method to minimize creaming. Another potential method \nadopted by WIOA to address creaming is the use of a statistical adjustment model for (1) the establishment of \nperformance targets, and (2) the adjustment of actual performance based on economic conditions and the \ncharacteristics of the participants. In either case, the use of valid and reliable baseline data will help to inform \nappropriate performance targets and that strong data systems are necessary to support this approach.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it is important to engage in a feasibility analysis before engaging in a WIOA Pay-for-Performance \ncontract, and that these analysis should be built into a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy. Such a \nfeasibility analysis could include items like assessing the availability and quality of necessary data, including the \nsource and cost of such data; determining the target population to be served; determining the availability of \ncompetent providers; whether any other additional professional services are required to support the execution of \nthe contract; and reviewing other operational factors that would affect the feasibility of the contract.\n\nThe Department is soliciting comments on the appropriate strategies to implement different varieties of Pay for \nPerformance contracts, including issues involving what components should be included in a Pay-for-Performance \ncontracting strategy; what factors should be considered in a feasibility analysis; which entities should be eligible to \nenter into these contracts; how different varieties of contracts should be structured; how to best establish baseline \nperformance information for target populations served; how best to prevent or account for creaming; the best \nmethods to account for the relative and absolute risk to government, the contractor, and other stakeholders when \nsetting payment terms; how best to balance the total cost to government against bonus and incentive payments \nincluded in the contract and potential outcome improvements for participants; how comprehensive services can be \nprovided in a Pay-for-Performance contract context; and how to facilitate the participation of small service \nproviders.\n\nBecause of the requirements contained in statute, the Department is considering how best to incorporate reporting \ninto performance and fiscal information collection requests, which will be included in the performance and fiscal \nPRA packages, or whether a separate information collection is needed. We welcome comments regarding the \nburden of additional reporting requirements, such as specifics about local areas utilizing pay-for-performance \ncontract strategies; the service providers, the amount of contracts, duration, and monitoring and evaluation \nfindings. The Department expects to put performance and implementation requirements in place in the future.\n\nSection 683.500What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategy?\n\nThis proposed section describes the components of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy and describes \nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract as a specific type of performance-based contract. It draws a distinction \nbetween the WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract itself and the broader goals and strategies surrounding it, which \nare the contracting strategy.\n\nLocal area WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies must include: (1) Identification of the problem space and \ntarget populations for which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract; (2) the outcomes the \nlocal area would hope to achieve through a Pay-for-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; (3) the \nacceptable cost associated with implementing such a strategy; (4) a feasibility study to determine whether the \nservice delivery strategy to be funded is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracting strategy; (5) \nindependent validation of the performance outcomes achieved under each contract within the strategy prior to \npayment occurring; and (6) a description of how the local area will reallocate funds to other activities under the \ncontract strategy in the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA Pay-\nfor-Performance contract.\n\nThe Department will issue additional guidance to both State and local areas on the development of the broader \nPay-for-Performance contract strategy, including the scope and minimum requirements of the required feasibility \nstudy.\n\nSection 683.510What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract?\n\nThis proposed section defines the requirements associated with a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, which \nwould be awarded under a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy.\n\nParagraph (a) identifies a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy as a type of performance-based contract. \nA performance-based contract is a contracting mechanism that establishes specific benchmarks that must be \nachieved in order for the contractor to receive payment. Performance-based contracting in general is defined and \ndiscussed in subpart 37.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n\n\n\nParagraph (b) articulates that WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts can only be used when they are part of a \nbroader WIOA Pay-for-Performance Contract Strategy described in \u00a7 683.500.\n\nTo be consistent with past practice and with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, proposed paragraph (c) \nprohibits the use of cost-plus percentage contracts in WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts.\n\nThe specifications in proposed paragraphs (d) through (f) regarding eligible service providers, structure of \npayments, target populations, and program elements are derived directly from the statute, at WIOA secs. 3(47), \n129(c)(1)(D), 129(c)(2), 134(c)(3), and 134(d)(1)(iii). Proposed paragraph (e) specifically requires that the \nperformance elements that must be included in any WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract are the primary indicators \nof performance described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA and further defined in proposed \u00a7 677.155. These include:\n\ni. The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit \nfrom the program;\n\nii. the percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit \nfrom the program;\n\niii. the median earnings of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter \nafter exit from the program;\n\niv. the percentage of program participants who obtain a recognized post-secondary credential, or a secondary \nschool diploma or its recognized equivalent (subject to sec. 116(b)(iii) of WIOA), during participation in or within 1 \nyear after exit from the program;\n\nv. the percentage of program participants who, during a program year, are in an education or training program that \nleads to a recognized post-secondary credential or employment and who are achieving measurable skill gains \ntoward such a credential or employment; and\n\nvi. the indicators of effectiveness in serving employers established pursuant to sec. 116(b)(iv) of WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (h) states that under WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts, bonus payments and/or incentive \npayments are authorized to be paid to the service providers who enter into the WIOA Pay-for-Performance \ncontracts. Such bonus payments must be used to expand the contractor's capacity to provide effective training. \nThese payments are authorized by sec. 3(47)(A) of WIOA. Incentive payments must be consistent with incentive \npayments for performance-based contracting as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. WIOA Pay-For-\nPerformance contracts may also utilize positive and negative incentives to other forms of performance-based \ncontracts. To be consistent with performance-based contracting and in alignment with WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contract characteristics, such as recognizing high performers and providing boards with flexibility to \nmake adjustments, incentive payments should be based on the total and relative amount of risk incurred by the \nservice provider or contractor versus that incurred by the local area or other stakeholders.\n\nBecause the Department is responsible for reporting on local outcomes annually to Congress, as well as providing \nrecommendations for improvements in and adjustments to WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies, \nproposed paragraph (i) requires specific reporting by the local areas to the State regarding the performance \noutcomes achieved by the service providers that enter into WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts. Additionally, \nproposed paragraph (j) requires independent validation of a contractor's achievement of performance \nbenchmarks under a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, as required by sec. 3(47)(B) of WIOA, and requires \nthat this validation be based on high-quality, reliable, and verified data. The Secretary will issue guidance related to \nstandards for independent evaluation as part of its Pay-for-Performance guidance to States and local areas.\n\nParagraph (k) indicates that the Secretary may issue additional guidance related to use of WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contracts.\n\nUnder WIA, many Workforce Development Boards utilized elements of performance-based contracts with training \nproviders. These contracts incorporated performance outcomes that contractors were required to meet to obtain \n\n\n\npayment. However, these contracts did not contain required elements of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \narticulated in this section. The Department encourages local areas to refocus these traditional performance-based \ncontracts to place an emphasis on the contractor achieving outcomes like participants obtaining and retaining \ngood jobs, rather than outputs like the number of people served. Also, the provision for the inclusion of bonus \npayments is limited to WIOA Pay-For-Performance contracts. Contracts that are not executed under the WIOA \nPay-For-Performance contracting authority may continue to include performance incentives, either positive or \nnegative or both, in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Workforce Development Boards may \ncontinue to use performance-based contracts that are not WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts. The 10 percent \nlimitation provisions in secs. 129(c)(1)(D) and 134(d)(1)(A)(iii) of WIOA only apply to WIOA Pay-for-Performance \ncontract strategies, including WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts.\n\nSection 683.520What funds can be used for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance \ncontract strategies?\n\nThis proposed section restates the WIOA requirements that funds allocated under secs. 133(b)(2) and (3) of WIOA \ncan be used for WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies providing adults and dislocated worker training, \nand funds allocated under sec. 128(b) of WIOA can be used for WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies \nproviding youth activities. No more than 10 percent of the total local adult and dislocated worker allotments can be \nexpended on the implementation of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for adult training services \ndescribed in sec. 134(c)(3) of WIOA. No more than 10 percent of the local youth allotment can be expended on the \nimplementation of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for youth training services and other activities \ndescribed in secs. 129(c)(1) and (c)(2) of WIOA. There is no limit on the use of funds for typical performance-based \ncontracts, as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The 10 percent limits apply only to those performance-\nbased contracts that are WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies as defined above.\n\nSection 683.530How long are funds used for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance \ncontract strategies available?\n\nSection 189(g)(2)(D) of WIOA specifies that funds used for WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies are \navailable until expended. This allows local areas to structure contracts that include time-intensive service delivery \nstrategies and/or that structure payments based on outcomes that may take longer to achieve, measure, and \nvalidate than the typical 2-year funding availability of local area funds. Funds that are obligated but not expended \ndue to contractor not achieving the levels of performance specified in a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract may \nbe reallocated for further activities related to WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies only. This also allows \nthe local area to realize one of the benefits of performance-based contracting strategies\u2014the local area does not \npay a financial penalty for contracted services that do not achieve the stated outcomes. This provision gives the \nlocal area the discretion to choose whether to use the funds for these strategies, and if the local area so chooses, \nthe funds will remain available until expended. This will require new grant management practices for local areas \nthat choose to carry out WIOA Pay-for-Performance strategies. The Department will issue guidance to explain \nthese new practices and we welcome comments with suggestions on how to maximize the use of these contract \nstrategies and the expanded availability of the funds.\n\nSection 683.540What is the State's role in assisting local areas in using Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nPay-for-Performance contract strategies?\n\nThis proposed section describes both allowable and required State activities related to WIOA Pay-for-Performance \ncontract strategies. The section indicates that States may provide technical assistance to local areas, including \nassistance with structuring WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracting strategies, performance data collection, \nmeeting performance data entry requirements, and identifying levels of performance. This technical assistance can \nhelp local areas move forward in using this contracting strategy. Additionally, the State may either conduct \nevaluations of such strategies and/or provide technical assistance to locals regarding the importance of evaluation \nof Pay-for-Performance contract strategies. The State and local areas may conduct their own evaluations of the \nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts, or procure an independent evaluator. The Department welcomes comments \nregarding use of independent evaluators and whether the cost of such evaluations is feasible within the amount of \n\n\n\nfunds available to local areas for pay-for-performance contracts. The Department also seeks comments on how \nthe Department might facilitate local areas' ability to conduct evaluations. Further, sec. 116(h) of WIOA authorizes \nStates to use non-Federal funds to incentivize use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for the \ndelivery of training services or youth activities by Local Boards.\n\nThis section also identifies required activities States must undertake if a local area implements at WIOA Pay-for-\nPerformance contract strategy. Because of the unique reporting requirements in sec. 116(d)(2)(K) for WIOA Pay-\nfor-Performance contracts, the performance section of this proposed rule, as well as the forthcoming Information \nCollection Request package, will clearly articulate the State's responsibility to track and report data on the primary \nindicators of performance as well as the State and local evaluations of the design of the programs and performance \nof WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies and, where possible, the level of satisfaction with the strategies \namong employers and participants benefitting from the strategies.\n\nThe State must also monitor local areas' use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts to ensure compliance with \nthe following: The required elements listed in \u00a7 683.500, the contract specifications in \u00a7 683.510, State \nprocurement policies, the 10 percent limitations, and achievement of performance benchmarks.\n\n7. Subpart F\u2014Grievance Procedures, Complaints, and State Appeals Processes\n\nThis subpart provides regulations governing the grievance, complaint, and appeals procedures that apply at the \nState and local level and to discretionary grantees under WIOA, as well as appeals to the Secretary. Providing \nclear rules for resolving complaints and filing appeals promotes transparency and fairness, which are fundamental \nrequirements of the workforce investment system grant process. Included are rules governing the appeals of local \narea non-designation, denial or termination of training provider eligibility, and appeals of formula program \nparticipants who are tested or sanctioned for the use of controlled substances. Appeals of the Governor's imposition \nof sanctions for substantial violations of fiscal or other substantive requirements or performance failures under \nWIOA title I are also addressed. Finally, this subpart explains the process of reporting information and complaints \ninvolving criminal fraud, waste, abuse, or other criminal activity under WIOA.\n\nSection 683.600What local area, State and direct recipient grievance procedures must be established?\n\nThis proposed section requires local areas, States, outlying areas, and direct grant recipients of WIOA title I funds \nto establish and maintain a procedure for grievances and complaints, including appeals as appropriate, and \ndescribes what the procedure much include, as required by WIOA sec. 181(c)(1). While this section of WIOA does \nnot require outlying areas or direct grant recipients to establish such procedures, the Department has included \nthem in this section to ensure that all participants receiving services under title I of WIOA have the same opportunity \nto report and receive relief from the negative actions of the WIOA funded grantees.\n\nThis proposed section also clarifies that allegations of violations of the non-discrimination provisions of WIOA are \nsubject to the policies and procedures described in 29 CFR part 37, which is administered by the Department's Civil \nRights Center, and that complaint and grievance procedures related to Job Corps are in part 686 of this title. This \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 667.600.\n\nSection 683.610What processes does the Secretary use to review grievances and complaints of title I recipients?\n\nThis proposed section describes the situations in which the Department will review allegations, and the procedures \nthat the Secretary will use, that arise through local, State, and other direct recipient grievance procedures in \naccordance with WIOA sec. 184(c)(2). This section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 667.610.\n\nSection 683.620How are complaints and reports of criminal fraud and abuse addressed under the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section provides the requirements for reporting information and complaints involving non-criminal \ncomplaints and criminal fraud, waste, abuse or other criminal activity through the Department's Incident Reporting \nSystem to the Department's Office of the Inspector General. This section retains the same requirements found at 20 \nCFR 667.630.\n\n\n\nSection 683.630What additional appeal processes or systems must a State have for the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act program?\n\nThis proposed section describes the processes and systems that a State must establish to hear appeals of: Entities \nthat are denied initial or subsequent designation as a local area; training service providers that are denied eligibility \nas providers of training services; and WIOA title I subtitle B participants who are subject to testing or sanctions for \nthe use of controlled substances. The section restates the WIOA appeal requirements in secs. 106(b)(5) (local area \nnon-designation), 122 (training provider eligibility denial or termination); 181(f) (participant testing and sanctioning \nfor use of controlled substances).\n\nSection 683.640What procedures apply to the appeals of non-designation of local areas?\n\nThis proposed section describes the procedures that apply when a State Board denies an appeal for initial or \nsubsequent designation of a local area made by a unit of local government or grant recipient under \u00a7 683.630(a). \nThis section restates and implements the appeal requirements required by WIOA sec. 106(b)(5).\n\nSection 683.650What procedures apply to the appeals of the Governor's imposition of sanctions for substantial \nviolations or performance failures by a local area?\n\nThis proposed section describes the procedures that apply to appeals of the Governor's imposition of sanctions for \nsubstantial violations of fiscal or other substantive requirements of title I of WIOA or of performance failures by local \nareas.\n\n8. Subpart G\u2014Sanctions, Corrective Actions, and Waiver of Liability\n\nWhile technical assistance, oversight, and monitoring are tools to ensure compliance with program and funding \nrequirements, sanctions and corrective action plans are necessary where those tools fail. This subpart addresses \nsanctions and corrective actions, waiver of liability, advance approval of contemplated corrective actions, as well as \nthe offset and State deduction provision. Of particular note in this subpart are the procedures for allowing a waiver \nof liability or an offset from other funds owed to the recipient. The statutory provisions are largely unchanged from \nthose under WIA, though the Uniform Guidance has resulted in some changes to this subpart.\n\nSection 683.700When can the Secretary impose sanctions and corrective actions on recipients and subrecipients of \ntitle I Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds?\n\nThis proposed section describes the procedures and circumstances under which the Department will impose \nsanctions or take corrective actions, as described in sec. 184(b) and (e), against States, local areas, and grant \nrecipients and subrecipients. For actions other than those under WIOA sec. 188(a), the process outlined in \u00a7 \n683.440 will be used before corrective actions or sanctions are taken against direct recipients. This section also \ngives the Grant Officer the authority to take direct action against local areas or other subrecipients, which will also \nbe done using the process in \u00a7 683.440. This section also clarifies that the procedures described at 20 CFR part \n677 will be used to impose a sanction or corrective action for a violation of sec. 116 of WIOA. This section generally \nimplements sec. 184 of WIOA and retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 667.700. The Department seeks \ncomments on appropriate sanctions and corrective actions in a variety of circumstances.\n\nSection 683.710Who is responsible for funds provided under title I and Wagner-Peyser?\n\nThis proposed section identifies the recipient as the responsible party for title I and Wagner-Peyser funds. For local \nareas receiving funds, this section explains how to identify the responsible party. Where a planning region includes \ntwo separate units of local government, the CEO of each unit of local government would be the responsible party. \nThe general rule of recipient responsibility arises from the Uniform Guidance, while the rules pertaining to local \nareas come from WIOA sec. 184.\n\nSection 683.720What actions are required to address the failure of a local area to comply with the applicable \nuniform administrative provisions?\n\nThis proposed section requires the Governor to take corrective action and impose sanctions on a local area if it \nfails to comply with the requirements described in the section. This section also describes the local area's appeal \n\n\n\nrights and actions the Secretary may take if the Governor fails to monitor and certify local areas' compliance or \npromptly take corrective action to bring the local area into compliance. The requirements in this section are taken \nfrom WIOA sec. 184.\n\nSection 683.730When can the Secretary waive the imposition of sanctions?\n\nThis proposed section permits a recipient to request a waiver of liability, and describes the factors the Grant Officer \nwill consider when determining whether to grant the request. This provision implements sec. 184(d) of WIOA and \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 667.720.\n\nSection 683.740What is the procedure to handle a recipient of title I Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nfunds' request for advance approval of contemplated corrective actions?\n\nThis proposed section describes the procedures which a recipient must use to request advance approval of \ncorrective action from the Department. It describes the factors the Grant Officer will consider and when advance \napproval may be appropriate. This provision implements sec. 184(d) of WIOA and retains the same requirements \nfound at 20 CFR 667.730.\n\nSection 683.750What procedure must be used for administering the offset/deduction provisions of the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThis proposed section outlines the steps that must be taken in order for the Department to consider and allow an \noffset or deduction of a debt, including the offset rules for direct recipients and the rule for a State making a \ndeduction from a subrecipient's PY allocation. This section implements the requirements of WIOA sec. 184(c)(2).\n\n9. Subpart H\u2014Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review\n\nThis subpart specifies those actions which may be appealed to the Department's Office of Administrative Law \nJudges (OALJ), and the rules of procedure and timing of decisions for OALJ hearings as well as the process for \njudicial review by a United States Circuit Court of Appeals. This subpart is similar to that currently in effect under \nWIA because the WIOA statute itself had only minor changes to the requirements in this subpart.\n\nSection 683.800What actions of the Department may be appealed to the Office of Administrative Law Judges?\n\nThis proposed section outlines the actions that can be appealed through an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) under \nWIOA sec. 186(a), including a determination to not award financial assistance or a corrective action or sanction \nagainst a recipient or subrecipient. This section describes the appeal deadlines and the contents that an applicant is \nrequired to include in its appeal request. Paragraph (e) states that these procedures also apply when parties fail to \nreach resolution through the process described in \u00a7 683.840.\n\n\u00a7 683.810What rules of procedure apply to hearings conducted under this subpart?\n\nThis proposed section adopts the rules of procedure for hearings conducted before the OALJ found at 29 CFR part \n18, with some clarifications. This section also describes the Secretary's subpoena authority under WIOA. Finally, \nthis section sets forth the burdens of production and persuasion in hearings conducted under this subpart. Per \nparagraph (c), the grant officer has the initial burden of production, which is satisfied by the submission of an \nadministrative file. After the grant officer submits the administrative file, the party seeking to overturn the Grant \nOfficer's determination has the burden of persuasion. This section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n667.810.\n\nSection 683.820What authority does the Administrative Law Judge have in ordering relief as an outcome of an \nadministrative hearing?\n\nThis section, which applies to all discretionary grants issued under subpart D of title I of WIOA, specifies the \nremedies that an ALJ may award. Paragraph (a) applies to cases other than grant selection cases and is \nunchanged from the WIA regulation.\n\nParagraph (b) specifies the remedies for grant selection cases, and is largely drawn from the Senior Community \nService Employment Program remedies provision found at 20 CFR 641.470. This section gives the Grant Officer \n\n\n\ndiscretion to ensure that project beneficiaries (i.e., an entity awarded financial assistance) will not be unduly \nnegatively impacted by the implementation of remedies resulting from a grant selection appeal.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) state that upon receipt of an ALJ finding the application review process must \nbe corrected or that an appealing entity should have been awarded funding, the Grant Officer will be required to \ntake certain steps to determine whether the funding must be awarded to that entity. In determining whether the \nfunds will be awarded to the appealing entity, the Grant Officer must take into account whether such a move would \nbe in the interest of project beneficiaries and whether it would cause undue disruption to the participants and the \nprogram. In the event the Grant Officer determines that the appealing entity will not receive the funds, entities \nwithout an approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) will receive reasonable application \npreparation costs (under 2 CFR 200.460, for entities with an approved NICRA, application preparation costs may be \nincluded in their indirect cost pool and therefore are recouped from their indirect costs to other Federal grant \nawards). In the event that the Grant Officer determines that the appealing entity will receive the funds, that entity will \nonly receive funds that have not yet been obligated by the current grantee.\n\nFinally, the Grant Officer will provide notification to the current grantee within 10 days of its decision, and that the \ncurrent grantee may appeal the Grant Officer's determination using the appeal procedures described in 20 CFR \n683.800.\n\nSection 683.830When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a decision?\n\nThis section describes the timeframe in which an ALJ must make a decision to avoid any unnecessary delays. It \nalso describes the parties' appeal rights, as stated in WIOA sec. 186(b).\n\nSection 683.840Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an Office of \nAdministrative Law Judges hearing?\n\nThis section describes the available alternative an entity may use to seek resolution other than a hearing process. \nThe outcome of this process is considered the equivalent of the final decision of an ALJ. The purpose of this \nprovision is to offer entities a less formal, less burdensome, and more interactive appeal process.\n\nSection 683.850Is there judicial review of a final order of the Secretary issued under the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nThis section outlines the steps a party to a final order must take to obtain judicial review in a United States Circuit \nCourt of Appeals of any decision made by the Secretary under WIOA sec. 184 or 186, as well as the deadlines for \nseeking review. This provision summarizes the requirements of WIOA sec. 187.\n\nH. Part 684\u2014Indian and Native American Programs Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBecause sec. 166 of WIOA retains many of the requirements of sec. 166 of WIA, the Department has drawn on the \nWIA regulations, found at 20 CFR part 668, in drafting the regulations for sec. 166 of WIOA. Consequently, many of \nthe sections in this part retain the requirements found in their parallel sections of the WIA regulations. This \npreamble details the Department's reasons for changing any of the previous requirements under the WIA \nregulations on a paragraph by paragraph basis. However, some changes to the requirements under the WIA \nregulations affect so many paragraphs that they are noted in the introduction to the preamble instead of noting them \nevery time that they occur.\n\nFirst, proposed part 684 seeks to streamline the competitive process for awarding the Indian and Native American \n(INA) program grants. Section 166 of WIOA is unusual in that it requires both that grants be awarded through a \ncompetitive process and that grantees submit a 4-year plan (WIOA secs. 166(c) and 166(e)). Under the WIA \nregulations, the competition was separate from the plan. These WIOA regulations propose to streamline the grant \naward process to ease the administrative redundancy inherent in the WIA regulations. The Department will no \nlonger designate grantees or require a notice of intent. Moreover, the proposed WIOA regulations have \nincorporated the 4-year plan into the competitive grant award process. The Department anticipates that these \n\n\n\nchanges will help streamline the process for awarding grants. These proposed changes should result in less of an \nadministrative burden on both applicants and the Department.\n\nAdditionally, although WIA had a 2-year grant cycle for grantees under sec. 166, WIOA has established a 4-year \ngrant cycle (WIOA secs. 166(c) and 166(e)). Consequently, all references to the grant cycle or plan in the proposed \nWIOA regulations refer to a 4-year cycle or 4-year plan.\n\nFinally, to ensure that the terms used to discuss the populations and entities that will be served, as described in \nsec. 166(d) of WIOA, are consistent throughout the proposed regulation, the Department proposes to define the \nterm \u201cINA\u201d to mean American Indian, Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian in proposed \u00a7 684.130. \nThis term provides an efficient way to ensure inclusivity and consistency in this part.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Purposes and Policies\n\nSection 684.100What is the purpose of the programs established to serve Indians and Native Americans under the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.100 describes the purpose of WIOA for the INA programs authorized by WIOA sec. 166.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.100(a) retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 684.100(a) except \nthat \u00a7 684.100(a)(2) includes entrepreneurial skills as part of the purpose of the program in order to implement and \ncarry out the entrepreneurial skills requirement in sec. 166(a)(1)(B) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.100(b) describes the principle means of accomplishing the purpose described in \u00a7 684.100. \nBecause the Department has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to implement WIOA, the \nproposed regulation retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.100(b) with the \nexception that it references the principles of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). \nThis reference to the principles of the ISDEAA directly aligns with sec. 166(a)(2) of WIOA.\n\nSection 684.110How must Indian and Native American programs be administered?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.110(a) describes how the Department will administer the INA program. Because no changes were \nnecessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements as the WIA \nregulations at 20 CFR 668.120.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.110(b) states that the Department will follow the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), at 25 U.S.C. 450a, as well as the Department of \nLabor's American Indian and Alaska Native policies in administering these programs. These policies include DOL's \n\u201cAmerican Indian and Alaska Native Policy,\u201d dated July 29, 1998 and the \u201cTribal Consultation Policy\u201d published in \ntheFederal Registeron December 4, 2012 (77 FR 71833). This is consistent with WIOA because WIOA sec. \n166(a)(2) incorporates the principles of the ISDEAA and the other two policies are important works of guidance on \nconsultation and coordination with INA parties.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.110(c) and (d) describe the trust responsibilities of the Federal government and the designation of \nthe Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within ETA. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to these regulations to implement WIOA, these proposed regulations \nretain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.120(c) and (d).\n\nProposed \u00a7 668.120(e) describes the establishment of administrative procedures of the INA programs. 20 CFR \n668.120(e) required that the Department utilize staff with a particular competence in this field for administration of \nthe program. Although the Department is still committed to the utilization of competent staff, the proposed regulation \ndoes not retain this requirement as this language was not included in WIOA. The rest of the proposed regulation \nretains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.120(e) because the Department has determined that no changes \nwere necessary to implement WIOA.\n\nSection 684.120What obligation does the Department have to consult with the Indian and Native American grantee \ncommunity in developing rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for Indian and Native American \nprograms?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.120 describes the obligation the Department has in consulting with the INA grantee community in \ndeveloping rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for INA programs. This proposed section retains the \nsame requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.130, except that it adds new language referencing \nthe Department's tribal consultation policy, which was published in theFederal Registeron December 4, 2012, and \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13175 of November 6, 2000, which requires Federal agencies to engage in regular and \nmeaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have tribal \nimplications and are responsible for strengthening the government-to-government relationship between the \nUnited States and Indian tribes. Section 166(i)(2) of WIOA states that the Secretary must consult with Indian tribes, \ntribal organizations, Alaska Native entities, Indian-controlled organizations serving Indians, and Native Hawaiian \norganizations in establishing regulations to carry out WIOA sec. 166 and develop a funding distribution plan for the \nINA program. In addition, sec. 166(i)(4)(A) of WIOA states that the Secretary must establish a Native American \nEmployment and Training Council to facilitate consultation and provide advice on the operation and administration \nof the WIOA INA programs, including the selection of the individual appointed as the head of DINAP. While it is not \nspecified in WIOA, by referencing the tribal consultation policy in this proposed section, the Department proposes \nthat the consultation requirements referenced in WIOA must be coordinated with the Department's tribal \nconsultation policy published in theFederal Registeron December 4, 2012 and E.O. 13175 of November 6, 2000. \nHowever, the Department notes that although these consultation policies must be coordinated, they are also \nseparate. The Native American Employment and Training Council represents all of the INA grantee community but \nit does not necessarily serve as the primary vehicle through which the Federal government fulfills its obligation to \nconsult with tribes.\n\nSection 684.130What definitions apply to terms used in the regulations in this part?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.130 provides definitions to terms used in proposed part 684 that have not been defined in secs. 3 \nor 166 of WIOA or \u00a7 675.300 of these proposed regulations. Because the Department has determined that no \nchanges were necessary to the definitions used in 20 CFR 668.150, we have retained those definitions as included \nin the WIA regulations without change. These include the definitions for the terms \u201cDINAP,\u201d \u201cGoverning body,\u201d \n\u201cGrant Officer,\u201d and \u201cUnderemployed.\u201d The Department has not retained the term \u201cNEW\u201d because it is not used in \nthis proposed subpart. However, to provide additional clarity in these proposed regulations, the Department has \nincluded definitions for nine additional terms.\n\nAlaska Native-Controlled Organization\u2014This definition clarifies that an entity applying for WIOA sec. 166 funds as \nan Alaska Native-Controlled Organization must have a governing board in which 51 percent of the members are \nAlaska Natives, to ensure that entities that receive WIOA sec. 166 funds as an Alaska Native-Controlled \nOrganization are comprised of representatives from the communities they serve.\n\nCarry-In\u2014The Department is providing a definition of carry-in to clarify our process at \u00a7 684.254(d) for reallocating \nfunds unspent at the end of a PY. This definition is consistent with current practice and the process for reallocating \nfunds is explained in more detail in the preamble for \u00a7 684.270(d).\n\nHigh-Poverty Area\u2014A definition of \u201chigh-poverty area\u201d has been included to reflect the inclusion of the phrase in \nWIOA. Section 129(a)(2) of WIOA provides a special rule for the youth program that includes the term \u201chigh-poverty \narea\u201d but does not define that term. This proposed part references sec. 129 of WIOA in implementing the youth INA \nprogram. Therefore the Department proposes to provide a definition for high-poverty area in these regulations. The \nDepartment has chosen to employ the American Community Survey 5-Year Data because it is the only source data \nthat uniformly collects the income level of individuals across all geographic service areas in the United States.\n\nIncumbent Grantee\u2014This term is used in several places in the regulations including the regulations that define \nwhich entities are eligible to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant. Therefore the Department is providing a definition \ntomake clear which entities are considered incumbent grantees as referred to in the regulations.\n\nINA\u2014Throughout proposed part 684, the Department refers to American Indians, Native Americans, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians. To ensure consistency and inclusiveness the Department decided to use a single \nterm, INA, when referencing all four groups.\n\n\n\nIndian-Controlled Organization\u2014This definition clarifies the qualifications for an organization to be an Indian-\nControlled Organization and is intended to ensure that entities that receive WIOA sec. 166 funds as Indian-\ncontrolled entities are comprised of representatives from the communities they serve.\n\nNative Hawaiian-Controlled Organization\u2014This definition clarifies that an entity applying for WIOA sec. 166 funds \nas a Native Hawaiian-controlled organization must have a governing board in which 51 percent of the members are \nNative Hawaiians. The purpose is to ensure that entities that receive WIOA sec. 166 funds as a Native Hawaiian \nentity are comprised of representatives from the communities they serve.\n\nTotal Funds Available\u2014This term is used in the definition of carry-in. The Department is providing a definition to \nclarify what is meant by total funds available as it affects the amount of carry-in a grantee may have and whether \nsuch carry-in is considered excessive. Available funds do not include carry-in funds. This definition is consistent \nwith current practice and the process for reallocating funds is explained in more detail in the preamble for \u00a7 \n684.270(d).\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Service Delivery Systems Applicable to Section 166 Programs\n\nSection 684.200What are the requirements to apply for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.200(a)(1) establishes the eligibility requirements to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.200(a)(1), except that we have \nrequired that all members of a consortium must be one of the listed entities to insure the input, authority, and \nautonomy of the INA entities listed in sec. 166(c) of WIOA. To be eligible, entities must also meet the requirements \nof \u00a7 684.200(c); \u00a7 684.200(a) just provides further detail about the legal shape eligible entities might take. For \nexample, the application for a tribe might be submitted by the tribal government. Additionally, a non-profit might be \nan Indian-controlled organization.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.200(a)(2) describes a $100,000 minimum funding award amount that is required in order to \nreceive a WIOA sec. 166 grant. There is an exception for INA grantees participating in the demonstration program \nunder Public Law 102-477; under this exception, if all resources to be consolidated under Public Law 102-477 total \n$100,000, only $20,000 must be derived from sec. 166 funds. Under proposed \u00a7 684.200(a)(2), there is no \nexception to the requirement that at least $20,000 of all resources to be consolidated under Public Law 102-477 \nmust be derived from WIOA sec. 166 funds. Awards for less than $20,000 do not provide sufficient funds to \neffectively operate an employment and training grant. Therefore, under WIOA, all sec. 166 funding awards must be \nequal to or greater than $20,000 in order to apply for a grant under Public Law 102-477 except for incumbent Public \nLaw 102-477 grantees that are receiving WIA funding as of the date of implementation of WIOA. These grantees \nwill be grandfathered into the program because the advantage of requiring these grantees to meet the $20,000 \nminimum does not outweigh the advantages of allowing these grantees to continue with programs that have already \nbeen approved.\n\nProposed \u00a7 668.200(b) describes the types of entities that may make up a consortium. The proposed section \nrequires that each member of a consortium meets the requirements. To ensure that all INA grantees sufficiently \nrepresent the interests of the INA community, the Department has decided to require that every member of a \nconsortium must meet the requirements at proposed \u00a7 668.200(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.200(b)(1) through (3) describe the requirements for entities to apply for WIOA sec. 166 funds as a \nconsortium. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.200(b)(1) through (3).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.200(c) describes the entities that are potentially eligible to receive WIOA sec. 166 funds. Because \nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.200(c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.200(d) explains that State-recognized tribal organizations will be considered to be \u201cIndian-\ncontrolled\u201d organizations for WIOA sec. 166 purposes, assuming they meet the definition of an Indian-controlled \n\n\n\norganization as defined at \u00a7 684.130. The proposed section also states that State-recognized tribes that do not \nmeet this definition but are grantees under WIA will be grandfathered into WIOA as Indian-controlled organizations. \nState-recognized tribal organizations that meet the definition of an Indian-controlled organization can apply for a \nWIOA sec. 166 grant because they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for an Indian-controlled organization, \nwhich ensures that they are comprised of representatives of the community they serve. State-recognized tribes that \nare grantees under WIA may be grandfathered in because allowing grantees that have successfully provided \nservices to continue providing those services is consistent with the objectives of WIOA sec. 166.\n\nSection 684.210What priority for awarding grants is given to eligible organizations?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.210(a) states that Federally-recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or a consortium of \nsuch entities will have the highest priority to receive grants for those geographic service areas in which the Indian \nTribe, Alaska Native entity, or a consortium of such entities has legal jurisdiction, such as an Indian reservation, \nOklahoma Tribal Service Area (OTSA) or Alaska Native Village Service Area (ANVSA). The Department recognizes \nthat Federally-recognized tribes are sovereign governments that often have reservation areas over which they \nhave legal jurisdiction. Accordingly, consistent with current practice, it is the Department's position that when a tribe \nhas legal jurisdiction over a geographic service area such as an Indian reservation or OTSA, the Department will \naward sec. 166 grants to serve such areas to that tribe if it meets the requirements for receiving a grant.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.210(b) states that if the Department decides not to make an award to an Indian tribe or Alaska \nNative entity that has legal jurisdiction over a service area\u2014for example if a Federally-recognized tribe is not \neligible to apply for a WIOA grant or does not have the ability to administer Federal funds\u2014the Department will \nconsult with that tribe or Alaska Native entity before selecting an entity to serve the tribe's legal jurisdictional area. \nAs described in the preamble to \u00a7 684.120,consultation with tribes and Alaska Native entities about the service \nareas over which they have legal jurisdiction is integral to the principles of Indian self-determination. However, to \nensure that the INA individuals residing in this service area receive services, \u00a7 684.210(b) does not require prior \napproval of the entity with legal jurisdiction.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.210(c) clarifies that the priority described in paragraphs (a) and (b) does not apply to service areas \noutside the legal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity. The Department does not believe that the \nsame priority is warranted outside the legal jurisdiction of Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities.\n\nSection 684.220What is the process for applying for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.220(a) describes when the competitive grant application process takes place. The process \ndescribed aligns this proposed section with the requirements at secs. 166(c) and (e) of WIOA and with the \nstreamlining of the application process, which is discussed in further detail in the introduction to this proposed part.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.220(b) provides clarification on which applicants are required to submit a 4-year plan, as \ndescribed at proposed \u00a7 684.710. The Department has decided to exclude entities that have been granted approval \nto transfer their WIOA funds pursuant to Public Law 102-477 from this requirement because the intent of Public \nLaw 102-477 is to allow Federally-recognized tribes and Alaska Native entities to combine formula-funded Federal \ngrant funds, which are employment and training-related, into a single plan with a single budget and a single \nreporting system.\n\nSection 684.230What appeal rights are available to entities that are denied a grant award?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.230 describes the appeal rights for entities that are denied a grant award in whole or in part. There \nis no appeal process specifically for sec. 166 grants; however, the Department proposes to follow the appeal \nprocess described at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 683.800 and 683.840, which allow entities that are denied a grant award an \nopportunity to appeal the denial to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the \nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 668.270.\n\nSection 684.240Are there any other ways in which an entity may be awarded a Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act grant?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.240 describes other ways in which an entity may be granted an award under this proposed subpart \nif areas would otherwise go unserved.\n\nSection 684.250Can an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award be terminated?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.250(a) states that a grant award can be terminated for cause, or due to emergency circumstances \nunder the Secretary's authority at sec. 184(e) of WIOA. This proposed section retains substantively the same \nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.290(a). The Department notes that if a grant is \nterminated under sec. 184(e) of WIOA, the grantee must be given prompt notice and opportunity for a hearing \nwithin 30 days after the termination.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.250(b) describes the circumstances under which an award may be terminated for cause. Because \nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.290(b).\n\nSection 684.260Does the Department have to award a grant for every part of the country?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.260 states that the Department is not required to provide grant funds to every part of the country. \nThis proposed section retains similar requirements in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.294, with the exception \nthat the Department clarified that funds not allocated to a service area will be distributed to existing INA grantees \nconsistent with current practice.\n\nSection 684.270How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds allocated to Indian and Native American \nprogram grantees?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684. 270(a) through (c) describe how funds will be allocated to INA grantees. Because the Department \nhas determined that no substantial changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.296.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684. 270(d) states that the Department may reallocate funds under certain circumstances. This \nlanguage clarifies that excess carry-in will result in the funding formula being adjusted in future years to reflect the \nexcess. Additionally, there is no exception for carry-in amounts in excess of 20 percent because these funds must \nbe fully expended.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.270(e) describes the funding resources the Department may draw on for TAT purposes. The \nproposed paragraph clarifies that the 1 percent of funding reserved under this section is not the only source funding \nfor providing TAT for the INA program grantees. This language is consistent with current practice and is intended to \nmake clear that INA program grantees may also access resources available to other Department programs as \nneeded.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Services to Customers\n\nSection684.300Who is eligible to receive services under the Indian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.300(a) describes who is eligible to receive services under an INA program. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.300(a), with the exception that the language in \u00a7 \n684.300(a)(2) references the definition of Alaska Native in sec. 166(b)(1) of WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (a)(1) leaves the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d to the tribes and local American Indian organizations that \nreceive grant funds to determine, since WIOA does not define who is eligible to receive services under sec. 166, \nand there are different opinions on who is considered an Indian when determining eligibility for employment and \ntraining services. For instance some grantees consider members of State-recognized tribes as eligible individuals \nwhile other grantees do not. Therefore, the Department has left the decision of defining who is an Indian to tribes \nand organizations at the local level. However, the Department requires that a grantee's definition must at least \ninclude anyone who is a member of a Federally-recognized tribe.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.300(b) and (c) describe additional eligibility requirements for participants to receive services from \nthe INA program. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to \n\n\n\nimplement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements in the WIA regulations found at 20 CFR \n668.300(b).\n\nSection 684.310What are Indian and Native American program grantee allowable activities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(a) describes what types of opportunities INA program grantees must attempt to develop and \nprovide. This section incorporates thebroad objectives referenced in sec. 194(1) of WIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(b) further defines the employment and training services that are allowable under sec. 166 of \nWIOA. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.340(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(c) references a non-exhaustive list of career services listed in WIOA. This language reflects \nWIOA's unified approach to the provision of services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(d) defines follow-up services. The Department chose to define follow-up services as including \ncounseling and supportive services for up to 12 months after the date of exit for consistency with current practice. \nUnlike the follow-up services available under sec. 134 of WIOA, the follow-up services available under \u00a7 684.310 \nare available for up to 12 months because of the limited employment opportunities available to participants in the \nsec. 166 program.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(e) references the non-exhaustive list of training services available at WIOA sec. 134(c)(3). The \nDepartment has referenced sec. 134(c)(3) because this section includes good examples of services that are \nallowable activities for INA program grantees.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(f) lists examples of allowable activities specifically designed for youth. The Department \nreferences the program requirements for the WIOA youth program because these activities serve as good \nexamples of allowable activities for INA programs targeting INA youth.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(g) provides examples of allowable activities for job development and employment outreach. \nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this \nproposed section retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.340(f).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(h) describes whether services can be overlapping and/or sequential. Because the Department \nhas determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains \nthe same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.340(g).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.310(i) states that services may be provided to a participant in any sequence based on the \nparticular needs of the participant. This clarification is consistent with the description of career services in proposed \n\u00a7 678.425(b), which states that services are provided to individuals based on individual needs, including the \nseamless delivery of multiple services to individual customers. There is no required sequence of services. Section \n134(c)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA similarly clarifies that an individual is not required to receive career services prior to \nreceiving training services.\n\nSection 684.320Are there any restrictions on allowable activities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.320(a) and (b) describe geographical restrictions on training activities and restrictions on OJT \nservices. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to implement \nWIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.350(a) and (b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.320(c) prohibits OJT where an employer has exhibited a pattern of certain conduct. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to these section to implement WIOA, this \nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.350(c). However, to align \u00a7 684.320(c) with \nthe language found at sec. 194(4) of WIOA, the phrase \u201cincluding health benefits\u201d has been included in \u00a7 \n684.320(c)(1), and \u00a7 684.320(c)(2) targets patterns of violation instead of single violations.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.320(d) through (g) describe restrictions on the use of INA grant funds. Because the Department \nhas determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections \nretain the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.350(d) through (g), with citations and references updated to be \nconsistent with WIOA.\n\nSection 684.330What is the role of Indian and Native American grantees in the one-stop system?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.330(a) describes the required collaboration between INA grantees and the one-stop system. The \nDepartment recognizes that there are areas in the U.S. where the Native American population is so sparse that it is \nnot practical for WIOA grantees to be actively involved in the local one-stop system. Accordingly, WIOA only \nrequires grantees to be involved in those local workforce investment areas where an INA grantee conducts field \noperations or provides substantial services. In these areas, the INA grantee must execute an MOU with the Local \nBoard or, at a minimum, be able to demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to enter into such agreement. \nRegardless of how sparse the Native American community is in an area, and regardless of an executed MOU, it is \nexpected that, at a minimum, both the INA grantee and the local one-stop operator are familiar with each other's \nservices and that information is available at each other's location, and referrals, coordination, and co-enrollment are \nencouraged. INA grantees will be required to provide details of their relationship with the local one-stop operators \nas part of the 4-year plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.330(b) describes the minimum provisions necessary in an MOU between the INA grantee and a \nlocal one-stop delivery system. Proposed paragraph (b) lists information required under WIOA sec. 121(c) and \nincludes additional requirements that implement current policy.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.330(c) describes when an INA grantee is required to describe its efforts to negotiate a MOU. This \ninformation is necessary for determining why the INA grantee has not been able to negotiate an MOU and for \nalerting the Department about what steps might be taken to facilitate the negotiation of an MOU.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.330(d) describes the application of the one-stop infrastructure in the context of INA programs. \nProposed paragraph (d) implements the statutory requirements found at WIOA sec. 121(h)(2)(D)(iv).\n\nSection 684.340What policies govern payments to participants, including wages, training allowances or stipends, or \ndirect payments for supportive services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.340(a) through (e) describe the policies that govern payments to participants. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no changes are necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed \nsections retain the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.370.\n\nSection 684.350What will the Department do to strengthen the capacity of Indnian and Native American grantees to \ndeliver effective services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.350 describes what the Department will do to strengthen the capacity of INA program grantees to \ndeliver effective services. This proposed section retains the same commitment to provide necessary technical \nassistance and training to INA program grantees as found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.380.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Supplemental Youth Services\n\nSection 684.400What is the purpose of the supplemental youth services program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.400 describes the purpose of the supplemental youth services program.\n\nBecause the Department has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to this section to implement \nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.400.\n\nSection 684.410What entities are eligible to receive supplemental youth services funding?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.410 describes the entities that are eligible to receive supplemental youth services funding. The \namount of funding reserved for the supplemental program makes it impractical to fund all service areas in the \nUnited States. Therefore the Department proposes to limit funding awards to eligible entities that serve low-income \n\n\n\nyouth residing on or near their respective reservations, OTSAs or ANVSAs or other legal jurisdictional areas, or to \neligible organizations that are providing services on behalf of entities with legal jurisdiction.\n\nSection 684.420What are the planning requirements for receiving supplemental youth services funding?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.420 describes the planning requirements for receiving supplemental youth services funding. \nBecause youth funding is considered a supplement to the adult funding, the Department envisions that the strategy \nfor youth will not be extensive. This proposed section also aligns the planning requirements for the youth \nsupplemental services with the streamlined application process, which is described in more detail in the introduction \nto this part.\n\nFinally, the Department also recognizes that awareness of one's culture and history is important to having a healthy \nself-identity and self-esteem. Therefore, the Department supports youth activities that teach INA to incorporate \nculture and traditional values since it is not fully explored in the public school system and because it plays a role in \ntransitioning INA youth to become successful adults.\n\nSection 684.430What individuals are eligible to receive supplemental youth services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.430(a)(1) through (3) provide the eligibility requirements for individuals to receive supplemental \nyouth services. Individuals must be low-income, except that 5 percent of individuals enrolled in a grantee's youth \nprogram during a PY need not meet the definition of low-income. Individuals included under this 5 percent \nexception do not need to meet any requirements other than those listed under proposed \u00a7 684.430(a)(1) and (2) \nbecause the Department recognizes that the funding amounts for the majority of INA program grantees are so small \n(and therefore the number of youth served are also so small) that the number of youth served under the 5 percent \nexception is numerically insignificant and that the effort and cost of collecting information on the additional barriers \nis not justified. Furthermore, the poverty level on or near Indian reservations (which are the areas to be served with \nyouth funds) is so high that the vast majority of youth served under WIA met the low-income requirement and those \nthat do not are only slightly over the poverty level.\n\nAdditionally, the INA youth program differs significantly from the State youth formula program in that it does not \ndistinguish between \u201cin-school\u201d youth and \u201cout-of-school\u201d youth and there are no percentage requirements for ISY \nand OSY as required by the State youth formula program. The Department recognizes that given the small funding \namount for the INA youth program, most INA grantees are primarily limited to operating summer employment \nprograms for ISY. However, the Department encourages the few grantees that receive significant amounts of youth \nfunding to provide year-round youth programs and incorporate educational and training components in their youth \nprogram.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.430(b) provides additional information about the definition of \u201clow-income.\u201d This proposed section \nhelps implement and carry out the definition of low-income provided in WIOA sec. 129(a)(2).\n\nSection 684.440How is funding for supplemental youth services determined?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.440(a) specifies how funding will be allocated. Because the Department has determined that WIOA \ndid not require any substantive changes to 20 CFR 668.440(a), we have retained the same essential requirements. \nAlthough this proposed section specifies that the Department will allocate youth funding based on the number of \nyouth in poverty, the inclusion of the term \u201cin poverty\u201d merely implements current practices and does not change our \nrequirements.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.440(b) through (e) describe what data the Department will use in calculating the youth funding \nallocation, how the hold harmless factor described in \u00a7 684.270(c) will apply, how the reallocation provisions apply, \nand how supplemental youth services funds not allotted may be used. Because the Department has determined \nthat no substantial changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retains \nthe same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.350(b) through (e).\n\nSection 684.450How will supplemental youth services be provided?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.450(a) through (c) describe how supplemental youth services will be provided. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, \nthese proposed sections retain the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.450(a) through (c).\n\nSection 684.460What performance measures are applicable to the supplemental youth services program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.460(a) describes the performance measures and standards applicable to the supplemental youth \nservices program. These measures and standards of performance are the same as the primary indicators \ndiscussed in proposed \u00a7 677.155. Though the indicators of performance are identified in various places throughout \nthe WIOA proposed regulations, the indicators are the same and do not vary across the regulations. Section \n166(e)(5) of WIOA specifies that performance indicators for the Native American program \u201cshall\u201d include the primary \nindicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). Consequently, the Department has listed the youth \nperformance indicators at WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) to implement and carry out statutory requirements.\n\nThe Department acknowledges that some of the performance indicators for youth programs are targeted to capture \ndata related to participants who are either in their senior year of high school or are no longer a high school student \n(\u00a7 684.460(a)(1) and (2)). Because of limited funding, many of the INA youth programs are summer employment \nprograms serving younger high school students, these performance indicators might not accurately capture the \nsuccess of such programs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.460(b) describes the Secretary's role in the creation of additional performance measures to the \nones listed in \u00a7 684.460(a). Section684.460 implements the statutory language in WIOA sec. 166(h)(2).\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Services to Communities\n\nSection 684.500 What services may Indian and Native American program grantees provide to or for employers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.500(a) and (b) describe other services that INA program grantees may provide to or for employers \nunder sec. 166. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to \nimplement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements as 20 CFR 668.500.\n\nSection 684.510 What services may Indian and Native American program grantees provide to the community at \nlarge?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.510(a) and (b) describe services that INA program grantees may provide to INA communities. \nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, \nthese proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.510(a) and (b).\n\nSection 684.520 Must Indian and Native American program grantees give preference to Indian and Native \nAmerican entities in the selection of contractors or service providers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.520 discusses the requirement to give preference to Indian/Native American entities in the \nselection of contractors or service providers. Because the Department has determined that no changes were \nnecessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR \n668.520.\n\nSection 684.530What rules govern the issuance of contracts and/or subgrants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.530 describes the rules that govern the issuance of contracts and/or subgrants. In general, INA \nprogram grantees must follow the uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for \nFederal awards at 2 CFR part 200 subpart E published in theFederal Registeron December 26, 2013, except that \nthese rules do not apply to OJT contract awards. This section essentially retains the same language as provided \nunder WIA at 20 CFR 668.530, except that the references to OMB Circulars A-102, A-110 have been replaced with \nreferences to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E.\n\n7. Subpart F\u2014Accountability for Services and Expenditures\n\nSection 684.600To whom is the Indian and Native American program grantee accountable for the provision of \nservices and the expenditure of INA funds?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.600(a) and (b) describe who INA program grantees are accountable to for the provision of services \nand the expenditure of INA funds. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements as 20 CFR 668.600.\n\nSection 684.610How is this accountability documented and fulfilled?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.610(a) and (b) require INA program grantees to establish internal policies and procedures to \nensure accountability to its governing body and describe how accountability to the Department is accomplished. \nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, \nthese proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.610(a) and (b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.610(c) describes how accountability to the Department is documented and fulfilled. The \nDepartment proposes to require compliance with the reporting items listed in \u00a7 684.610(c) because these are the \nbest ways to ensure accountability and they comply with our current practices.\n\nSection 684.620What performance measures are in place for the Indian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.620(a) describes the performance measures that are required under WIOA for the INA program. \nThese measures of performance are the same as the primary indicators discussed in proposed \u00a7 677.155. Though \nthe indicators of performance are identified in various places throughout the WIOA proposed regulations, the \nindicators are the same and do not vary across the regulations. Section 166(e)(5) of WIOA specifies that \nperformance indicators for the Native American program \u201cshall\u201d include the primary indicators of performance \ndescribed in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). Proposed \u00a7 684.620(a) lists the applicable performance indicators described \nin WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), thus implementing and carrying out the statutory requirements of sec. 166(e)(5) of \nWIOA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.620(b) describes the Secretary's role in the creation of additional performance measures to the \nones listed in \u00a7 684.620(a). Section 684.620 implements the statutory language in WIOA sec. 166(h)(2).\n\nSection 684.630What are the requirements for preventing fraud and abuse?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.630(a) requires INA program grantees to establish fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. \nThis section implements the language in WIOA sec. 184 to the INA program.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.630(b) and (c) include requirements related to conflicts of interest gifts. Because the Department \nhas determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections \nretain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.630(b) and (c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.630(d) describes certain restrictions on selecting family members as participants. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this \nproposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.610(d), except that it clarifies our current practice \nof counting all INA individuals in a community to determine if the exception is met.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.630(e) through (h) describe kickback, political activities, lobbying, and embezzlement restrictions \nthat apply to this section. Because the Department has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to \nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.630(e) \nthrough (h) with changes to update citations.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.630(i) prohibits discriminatory practices by recipients of WIOA funds. This section clarifies for the \nbenefit of potential applicants the effect of WIOA sec. 188 on the INA programs. The language in this section also \naddresses a long-standing misconception among INA grantees that individuals outside of a grantee's geographic \nservice area cannot be served without the consent of the grantee whose service area the individual resides. The \nDepartment recognizes that INA program grantees receive funding based on specified geographic boundaries such \nas a county, reservation, Alaska Native village etc., and therefore we agree that grantees are not required to serve \nindividuals outside their geographic areas since another grantee is receiving funding to serve such individuals. \nHowever, thisdoes not mean that grantees cannot serve individuals outside their specified boundaries if they \nchoose to do so.\n\n\n\nSection 684.640What grievance systems must an Indian and Native American program grantee provide?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.640 requires INA program grantees establish grievance procedure. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the \nsame requirements at 20 CFR 668.640.\n\nSection 684.650Can Indian and Native American program grantees exclude segments of the eligible population?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.650(a) and (b) inform INA program grantees whether they can exclude segments of the eligible \npopulation. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to \nimplement WIOA, this proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.650.\n\n8. Subpart G\u2014Section 166 Planning/Funding Process\n\nSection 684.700What is the process for submitting a 4-year plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.700 describes the process for submitting a 4-year plan, as required by sec. 166(e) of WIOA. \nSpecific requirements for the submission of a 4-year plan will be provided in a Funding Opportunity Announcement \n(FOA). This section facilitates the streamlining of the application process as is described in detail in the introduction \nof this part.\n\nSection 684.710What information must be included in the 4-year plans as part of the competitive application?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.710 describes the information that must be included in the 4-year plan. The Department intends to \nseek economic and workforce responsive 4-year plans under WIOA. Under WIOA, the Department proposes that a \nplan contains only the four information requirements set out in WIOA sec. 166(e), which will leave the Department \nflexibility to ask for different kinds of information in a request for additional information during the FOA process. The \nDepartment recognizes that the workforce system must be able to change and adapt to the changes required by \nemployers who are, in turn, changing and adapting to forces in the economy and advancements in technology \nwhich require different skill sets for American workers. This new approach to planning will provide the flexibility \nnecessary to address the current workforce needs at the time plans are written.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.710(a) describes the information that must be included in the 4-year plan, required by WIOA secs. \n166(e)(2) through (5).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.710(b) states that the 4-year plan must include a projection of participants to be served and \nexpenditures during a PY and any additional information requested in a FOA. Again, this section has been added \nunder WIOA to convey that additional information will be required in the 4-year plan, as determined by current \nlabor market trends and skills requirements, and what information must be in plans will be requested in a FOA as \npart of the competitive process.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.710(c) requires INA program grantees receiving supplemental youth funds to provide additional \ninformation in the 4-year plan that describes a strategy for serving low-income, INA youth. The Department \nsupports youth activities that preserve Native American culture and values. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the \nsame requirements at 20 CFR 668.720(b), with the exception that it is framed to reflect the streamlined application \nprocess described in more detail in the introduction to this part.\n\nSection 684.720When must the 4-year plan be submitted?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.720 describes when the 4-year plan must be submitted. The due date for the submission of the 4-\nyear plan will be specified in the FOA. This approach implements and carries out the requirements of WIOA secs. \n166(c) and 166(e) in the context of the streamlined application process that is described in more detail in the \nintroduction to this part. The Department envisions that the first 4-year plan will be for PY 2016-2020 which will \ncover the period from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2020.\n\nSection 684.730How will the Department review and approve such plans?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.730 describes how the Department will review and approve 4-year plans. The Department will \nmake every effort to approve plans that are fully complete prior to the beginning of the first PY of the 4-year plan \nand funds will be obligated to grantees for that year through a grant award. After the first year of a 4 -year plan, \nfunds will automatically be added each year for the following 3 years through a grant modification, assuming the \ngrantee continues to be in good standing with the Department.\n\nIncomplete plans that do not fully meet the requirements provided in the FOA will not be approved. It is possible for \nentities to be selected through the competitive process and also have an incomplete plan. Therefore, after \ncompetitive grant selections have been made, the DINAP office may assist INA program grantees with incomplete \nplans on tasks such as submitting required documents and other unresolved issues that render the 4-year plan \nincomplete. However, the Department may delay funding to grantees until all issues with the 4-year plan have been \nresolved.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that a grantee will fail to submit an acceptable 4-year plan, the Department will reallocate funds \nfrom an INA program grantee that fails to submit a 4-year plan to other incumbent INA program grantees that have \nan approved 4-year plan. The Grant Officer may also delay executing a grant agreement and obligating funds to an \nentity selected through the competitive process until all the required documents\u2014including the 4-year plan\u2014are in \nplace.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.730(a) states that it is the Department's intent to approve a grantee's 4-year strategic plan before \nthe date on which funds for the program become available. Because the Department has determined that no \nchanges were necessary under WIOA, this section retains the same language as provided under WIA at 20 CFR \n668.740(a), save for the addition of language specifically addressing the streamlined, 4-year grant application \nprocess as described in more detail in the introduction to this part.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.730(b) describes the extent to which the DINAP office will assist INA program grantees in resolving \nany outstanding issues that may exist with the 4-year plan. Again, while the Department expects that it is unlikely \nthat a grantee will fail to submit an acceptable 4-year plan, we need a mechanism to reallocate funds when such an \nevent occurs in order to ensure that funds are spent providing services to eligible program participants.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.730(c) notes that the Department may approve portions of a plan while disapproving others. \nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to implement WIOA, the proposed \nregulation retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.740(b).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.730(d) references appeal rights in nonselection cases or in the case of a decision by the \nDepartment to deny or reallocate funds based on unresolved issues with the applicant'sapplication or 4-year plan. \nThere are no appeal rights in addition to the ones listed in the cited regulations because the Department has \ndetermined that consistency of appeal rights amongst WIOA programs is desirable.\n\nSection 684.740Under what circumstances can the Department or the Indian and Native American program grantee \nmodify the terms of the grantee's plan(s)?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.740(a) describes when the Department may unilaterally modify an INA program grantee's plan to \nadd or reduce funds to the grant. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \nimplement WIOA, the proposed regulation retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n668.750(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.740(b) describes when an INA program grantee may request approval to modify their plan to add, \nexpand, delete, or diminish any service allowable under the regulations in this part. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to implement WIOA, the proposed regulation retains the same \nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.750(b). Generally, it is the Department's intent to pursue \ngrant modifications only when there are significant increases or decreases in the grantee's funding that results in \nsignificant changes in the employment and training services stated in the 4-year plan or when the grantee wishes \nto make a significant change in its service strategy. As a general rule, a significant change is when the number of \nparticipants to be served in the original plan changes by 25 percent or by 25 actual participants, whichever is larger.\n\n\n\n9. Subpart H\u2014Administrative Requirements\n\nSection 684.800What systems must an Indian and Native American program grantee have in place to administer an \nIndian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.800(a) and (b) describe the systems that must be in place in order for INA grantees to administer a \nWIOA sec. 166 grant INA program. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.800.\n\nSection 684.810What types of costs are allowable expenditures under the Indian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.810 describes where the rules relating to allowable costs under WIOA are located. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.810.\n\nSection 684.820What rules apply to administrative costs under the Indian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.820 describes where the definition and treatment of administrative costs can be found. Because \nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.820.\n\nSection 684.830Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act administrative cost limit for States and local \nareas apply to grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.830 informs INA program grantees about whether the WIOA administrative cost limit for States and \nlocal areas applies to INA grants. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this \nsection to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.825.\n\nSection 684.840How should Indian and Native American program grantees classify costs?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.840 describes how INA program grantees must classify costs. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the \nsame requirements at 20 CFR 668.830.\n\nSection 684.850What cost principles apply to Indian and Native American funds?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.850 requires INA program grantee to follow the cost principles at 2 CFR part 200 subpart E of the \nUniform Administrative Requirements published in theFederal Registeron December 26, 2013. This section retains \nthe same language as provided under WIA at 20 CFR 668.840, except that the references to OMB Circulars A-87, \nA-122, A-21 have been updated with references to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E, Cost Principles, & Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards.\n\nSection 684.860What audit requirements apply to Indian and Native American grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.860 requires INA program grantee to follow the audit requirements at 2 CFR 200 subpart F of the \nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, & Audit Requirements for Federal Awards published in \ntheFederal Registeron December 26, 2013. This section retains the same language as provided under WIA at 20 \nCFR 668.850, except that the references to OMB Circular A-133 and 29 CFR part 99 have been updated with \nreferences to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E, Cost Principles, & Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n\nAdditionally, \u00a7 684.860(b) implements the language at WIOA sec. 166(j) relating to single audit requirements.\n\nSection 684.870What is \u201cprogram income\u201d and how is it regulated in the Indian and Native American program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.870(a) through (c) provide descriptions of what qualifies as program income for work experience \nparticipants and OJT participants. Because the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.870(a) \nthrough (c).\n\n10. Subpart I\u2014Miscellaneous Program Provisions\n\n\n\nSection 684.900Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provide regulatory and/or statutory waiver \nauthority?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.900 describes the regulatory and/or statutory waiver authority for the INA program. Because the \nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.900, except that we have clarified, in accordance with WIOA \nsec. 166(i)(3), that only requirements related to title I of WIOA may be waived.\n\nSection 684.910What information is required in a waiver request?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.910(a) describes what information an INA program grantee must include when it requests a waiver. \nThis section implements the requirements in WIOA sec. 166(i)(3)(B) and saves INA grantees from having to \nreference additional departmental guidance on how to request a waiver.\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.910(b) states that a waiver may be requested at the beginning of a 4-year grant award cycle or \nanytime during a 4-year award cycle. However, all waivers expire at the end of the 4-year award cycle. The \nDepartment envisions that waivers will be requested for unique situations that were not expected in the normal \ncourse of operating an INA grant. Therefore, Department proposes that waivers cannot be provided indefinitely \nandmust be renewed at the beginning of a new 4-year grant cycle.\n\nSection 684.920What provisions of law or regulations may not be waived?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.920 describes the laws and regulations that may not be waived. Because the Department has \ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the \nsame requirements at 20 CFR 668.920.\n\nSection 684.930May Indian and Native American grantees combine or consolidate their employment and training \nfunds?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.930 provides a description of when INA program grantees can consolidate their funds under Public \nLaw 102-477 (477). In addition to generally allowing the consolidation of funds as required under Public Law 102-\n477, \u00a7 684.930 describes the extent to which the Department will review 477 plans. The Department will not review \nthe renewal of 477 plans after the initial plan has been approved by DOL, accepted by the Department of the \nInterior, and all other applicable Departmental programmatic and financial obligations have been met prior to \ntransfer. This policy aligns with the requirements of Public Law 102-477 which allows Federally-recognized tribes \nand Alaska Native entities to combine formula-funded Federal grant funds, which are employment and training-\nrelated, into a single plan with a single budget and a single reporting system. The Department recognizes that when \nFederal funds from various agencies are combined under one unified plan, there must be one lead agency that \nadministers and manages the unified plan. According to Public Law 102-477 the lead agency is the DOI.\n\nSection 684.940What is the role of the Native American Employment and Training Council?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.940 describes the role of the Native American Employment and Training Council. The language in \nproposed \u00a7 684.940 repeats the requirements at WIOA sec. 166(i)(4)(C) and explains that WIOA sec. 166(4) has \nnot made any major changes to the council.\n\nSection 684.950Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provide any additional assistance to unique \npopulations in Alaska and Hawaii?\n\nProposed \u00a7 684.950 address the additional assistance that WIOA provides for unique populations in Alaska and \nHawaii. This proposed section implements and carries out the requirements in WIOA sec. 166(k).\n\nI. Part 685\u2014National Farmworker Jobs Program Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe purpose of part 685 is to implement WIOA sec. 167, which authorizes MSFW programs. In drafting these \nregulations, the Department consulted with States and MSFW groups during stakeholder consultation sessions \nconducted in August and September 2014, as required by WIOA sec. 167(f). MSFW programs include career \n\n\n\nservices and training, housing assistance, youth services, and related assistance. In drafting the proposed \nregulations for this part the Department seeks to encourage strategic alignment across other workforce \ndevelopment programs such as Wagner-Peyser and WIOA title I adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs; \nencourage the delivery of training for in-demand occupations; provide comprehensive youth workforce activities; \nand provide a detailed description of housing services available to eligible MSFWs. As required by WIOA sec. \n167(e), when making grants and entering into contracts under this section, the Department will consult with the \nGovernors and Local Boards of the States in which grantees will carry out the activities described in WIOA sec. \n167(d) during the FOA process described in \u00a7 685.210.\n\nThe regulations in this section support strategic alignment across workforce development programs by: Aligning the \ndefinition of \u201cfarmwork\u201d found in this section with that used in the Wagner-Peyser program; adjusting the upper and \nlower age ranges of eligible MSFW youth to conform to those established in WIOA sec. 129 for OSY and ISY; and \nrequiring that grantees coordinate services, particularly outreach to MSFWs, with the State Workforce Agency \n(SWA) in their service area and the State's monitor advocate. These changes are intended to support coordination \nbetween MSFW programs and other workforce programs such as the Wagner-Peyser program, and facilitate \nMSFW youth co-enrollments with other WIOA title I programs.\n\nThe Department proposes language in \u00a7 685.350 regarding training services that reinforces that training must be \ndirectly linked to an in-demand industry or occupation that leads to economic self-sufficiency and encourages the \nattainment of recognized post-secondary credentials when appropriate.\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 685.330 and 685.510 establish that grantees funded under WIOA sec. 167 can serve eligible MSFW \nyouth participants. The Department also has proposed that a percentage of the total funds appropriated each year \nfor WIOA sec. 167 activities will be used for housing grants, and described specific housing assistance activities in \n\u00a7 685.360, to better articulate the types of services that can be delivered to eligible MSFWs.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Purpose and Definitions\n\nThis subpart describes the general purpose and definitions relevant to MSFW programs authorized under WIOA \nsec. 167, the role of the Department in providing technical assistance and training to grantees, and the regulations \napplicable to grantees.\n\nSection 685.100What is the purpose of the National Farmworker Jobs Program and the other services and activities \nestablished under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.100 identifies achieving economic self-sufficiency as the goal of the services and activities that are \nauthorized in WIOA sec. 167 for eligible MSFWs which includes their dependents. This section emphasizes the \nimportance of obtaining, retaining, and stabilizing the unsubsidized employment of MSFWs, including obtaining \nupgraded agricultural employment, in achieving the goal of the program.\n\nSection 685.110What definitions apply to this program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.110 provides definitions of terms relevant to the implementation and operation of workforce \ninvestment activities authorized for MSFWs and their dependents under WIOA sec. 167.\n\nA definition of allowances has been provided that means direct payments made to participants to support \nparticipation specific career services and training.\n\nDependents of eligible MSFWs may receive services under WIOA secs. 167(i)(2)(B) and 167(i)(3)(B), and the \nDepartment has provided a definition of the family member relationships of an eligible MSFW who qualify for MSFW \nprogram services.\n\nEligibility determination period is defined as \u201cany consecutive 12-month period within the 24-month period \nimmediately preceding the date of application for the MSFW program by the applicant MSFW.\u201d The definition was \nadopted from the first clause ofWIOA sec. 167(i)(3)(A)(i), which defines \u201celigible seasonal farmworker.\u201d\n\nThe definition of eligible migrant farmworker is taken from WIOA sec. 167(i)(2).\n\n\n\nThe definition of eligible seasonal farmworker is taken from WIOA sec. 167(i)(3).\n\nA definition of eligible migrant and seasonal farmworker has been provided, meaning an eligible migrant farmworker \nor an eligible seasonal farmworker as defined in WIOA sec. 167(i).\n\nA definition of eligible MSFW youth has been provided, and it is defined as eligible MSFWs aged 14-24 who are \nindividually eligible or are dependents of eligible MSFWs. The upper age range (age 24) and lower age range (age \n14) for eligible MSFW youth have been put in alignment with the upper and lower age ranges provided in WIOA \nsecs. 129 ((a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C). Eligible MSFW youth is a subset of eligible MSFWs as defined in this section. \nThis alignment will facilitate co-enrollment with other WIOA youth programs that serve 14-24 year old youth \nparticipants, where appropriate.\n\nA definition of emergency assistance had been provided that establishes that emergency assistance is a form of \nrelated assistance, and means assistance that addresses immediate needs of eligible MSFWs and their \ndependents, provided by grantees. To facilitate the delivery of emergency services in a timely manner the \napplicant's self-certification is accepted as sufficient documentation of eligibility for emergency assistance.\n\nA definition of family, is provided that means an eligible MSFW and all the individuals identified under the definition \nof dependent in this section who are living together in one physical residence. The definition has been proposed for \nthe purpose of reporting housing assistance grantee indicators of performance as described in \u00a7 685.400.\n\nA definition of farmwork is provided that means work while employed in the occupations described in 20 CFR \n651.10. The specific occupations and industries within agricultural production and agricultural services will be \nprovided through Departmental guidance, and will be updated when government-wide standard industry and \noccupation codes undergo periodic review and revision. Providing a definition of farmwork that is aligned with the \nWagner-Peyser ES system will facilitate the provision of services to MSFWs under both programs.\n\nA definition of grantee has been provided, meaning an entity to which the Department directly awards a WIOA grant \nto carry out programs to serve eligible MSFWs in a service area, with funds made available under WIOA sec. 167 \nor 127(a)(1).\n\nA definition of housing assistance is provided and means housing-related services provided to eligible MSFWs. \nExamples of specific authorized housing activities are provided in proposed \u00a7 685.360.\n\nThe definition of lower living standard income level from WIOA sec. 3(36)(B) has been referenced without change.\n\nThe definition of low-income individual from WIOA sec. 3(36)(A) has been referenced without change.\n\nA definition of MOU has been provided, meaning \u201cMemorandum of Understanding.\u201d\n\nA definition of National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) has been provided and is the Department-administered \nworkforce investment program for MSFWs established by WIOA sec. 167 as a required partner of the one-stop \nsystem and includes career services, training grants, and housing grants. The term NFJP was initially developed in \n1999 by the Secretary's MSFW Advisory Committee to distinguish the NFJP from the other workforce investment \ngrants and activities funded under WIA sec. 167, such as the farmworker housing assistance grants; however, \nsince that time the NFJP has come to be the accepted term for both employment and training grants and housing \ngrants, and this definition reflects that understanding.\n\nThe definition of recognized post-secondary credential from WIOA sec. 3(52) has been referenced without change.\n\nA definition of related assistance, which is authorized under WIOA sec. 167(d), has been provided meaning short-\nterm forms of direct assistance designed to assist eligible MSFWs retain or stabilize their agricultural employment.\n\nA definition of self-certification has been provided meaning an eligible MSFW's signed attestation that the \ninformation he/she submits to demonstrate eligibility for the NFJP is true and accurate.\n\n\n\nA definition of service area has been provided meaning the geographical jurisdiction, which may be comprised of \none or more designated States or sub-State areas, in which a WIOA sec. 167 grantee is designated to operate.\n\nA definition of technical assistance has been provided meaning the guidance provided to grantees and grantee staff \nby the Department to improve the quality of the program and the delivery of program services to eligible MSFWs. \nThis definition was adapted from and replaces the 20 CFR part 685 definition of capacity enhancement under WIA \nto reflect the term more commonly used by the Department.\n\nSection 685.120How does the Department administer the National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.120 clarifies that the Department's ETA administers NFJP activities authorized under WIOA sec. \n167 for eligible MSFWs, and as described in \u00a7 685.210, the Department designates grantees in a manner \nconsistent with standard Federal government competitive procedures.\n\nSection 685.130How does the Department assist grantees to serve eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.130 establishes that the Department will provide guidance, administrative support, technical \nassistance, and training to support MSFW programs and promote employment outcomes for eligible MSFWs.\n\nSection 685.140What regulations apply to the programs authorized under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.140 specifies the regulations that are applicable to MSFW programs authorized under WIOA sec. \n167, including proposed part 685. Applicable regulations include the general administrative requirements found in \n20 CFR part 683, including the regulations regarding the Complaints, Investigations and Hearings found at 20 CFR \npart 683, subpart D through subpart H; Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200 and the Department's exceptions at 2 \nCFR part 2900 pursuant to the effective dates in 2 CFR part 200 and 2 CFR part 2900; the regulations on \npartnership responsibilities contained in 20 CFR parts 679 (Statewide and Local Governance) and 678 (the one-\nstop system); the Department's regulations at 29 CFR part 37, which implement the nondiscrimination provisions of \nWIOA sec. 188.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014The Service Delivery System for the National Farmworker Program\n\nThis subpart describes the service delivery system for the MSFW programs authorized by WIOA sec. 167 including \nwho is eligible to receive grants and the role of the NFJP in the one-stop delivery system. Termination of grantee \ndesignation is explained. This subpart also discusses the appropriation of WIOA sec. 167 funds and establishesthat \na percentage of the total funds appropriated each year for WIOA sec. 167 activities will be used for housing \nassistance grants.\n\nSection 685.200Who is eligible to receive a National Farmworker Jobs Program grant?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.200 describes the entities that are eligible to receive NFJP grants. The entity must have an \nunderstanding of the problems of eligible MSFWs, a familiarity with the agricultural industries and the labor market \nneeds of the proposed service area, and the ability to demonstrate a capacity to administer and deliver effectively a \ndiversified program of workforce investment activities, including youth workforce investment activities, and related \nassistance for eligible MSFWs.\n\nSection 685.210How does an eligible entity become a grantee?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.210 establishes that grantees will be selected through a FOA using standard Federal government \ncompetitive procedures. The entity's proposal must describe a 4-year strategy for meeting the needs of eligible \nMSFWs in the proposed service area and a description of the entity's experience working with the broader \nworkforce delivery system. This is in alignment with the requirement in WIOA sec. 167(a) that the Department make \ngrants or enter into contracts on a competitive basis every 4 years. Unless specified otherwise in the FOA, \ngrantees may serve eligible MSFWs, including eligible MSFW youth, under the grant. An applicant whose \napplication for funding as a grantee under part 685 is denied in whole or in part may request an administrative \nreview under 20 CFR 683.800.\n\nSection 685.220What is the role of the grantee in the one-stop delivery system?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.220 describes that in those local workforce development areas where the grantee operates its \nNFJP, as described in its grant agreement, the grantee is a required one-stop partner, and is subject to the \nprovisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR part 678. Consistent with those provisions, the grantee \nand Local Workforce Development Board must develop and enter into an MOU which meets the requirements of 20 \nCFR 678.500 and sets forth their respective responsibilities for providing access to the full range of NFJP services \nthrough the one-stop system to eligible MSFWs.\n\nSection 685.230Can a grantee's designation be terminated?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.230 explains the circumstance in which a grantee may be terminated by the Department for cause, \nincluding emergency circumstances when such action is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or \nensure the proper operation of the program, or by the Department's Grant Officer, if the recipient materially fails to \ncomply with the terms and conditions of the award. The Department has changed the standard for Grant Officer \ntermination from \u201csubstantial or persistent violation\u201d as used in the WIA regulations in order to be consistent with the \nstandards used for all other Department WIOA grants under the common administrative requirements for grants.\n\nSection 685.240How does the Department use funds appropriated under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nfor the National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.240 establishes that in accordance with WIOA sec. 167(h), at least 99 percent of the funds \nappropriated each year for WIOA sec. 167 activities must be allocated to service areas, based on the distribution of \nthe eligible MSFW population determined under a formula which has been published in theFederal Register. The \ngrants will be awarded under \u00a7 685.210. The Department has added language that clarifies that of this amount, a \npercentage of funds will be set aside for housing grants and will be specified in an FOA issued by the Department. \nThe balance, up to 1 percent of the appropriated funds, will be used for discretionary purposes, such as providing \ntechnical assistance to eligible entities, and other activities prescribed by the Secretary to eligible entities. This \ndiffers from the up to 4 percent reserved in the prior regulations so as to comply with the funding requirements of \nWIOA sec. 167(h).\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014The National Farmworker Jobs Program Customers and Available Program Services\n\nThis subpart describes the responsibilities of grantees, and workforce investment activities available to eligible \nMSFWs, including career services and training, housing assistance, youth services, and related assistance.\n\nSection 685.300What are the general responsibilities of grantees?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.300 establishes the general responsibilities of grantees, including that: eligible entities receive \ngrants through the FOA process described in \u00a7 685.210; career services and training grantees are responsible for \nproviding appropriate career services, training, and related assistance to eligible MSFWs and eligible MSFW youth; \nand housing grantees are responsible for providing housing assistance to eligible MSFWs. Grantees will provide \nthese services in accordance with the service delivery strategy described in the approved program plan described \nin \u00a7 685.420. These services must reflect the needs of the MSFW population in the service area and include the \nservices that are necessary to achieve each participant's employment goals or housing needs. Grantees also are \nresponsible for coordinating services, particularly outreach to MSFWs, with the SWA, as defined in 20 CFR part \n651, and the State's monitor advocate and fulfilling the responsibilities of one-stop partners described in proposed \u00a7 \n678.420.\n\nSection 685.310What are the basic components of an National Farmworker Jobs Program service delivery \nstrategy?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.310 describes the basic components of the NFJP delivery strategy that must include: A customer-\nfocused case management approach; the provision of workforce investment activities, which include career \nservices and training, as described in WIOA secs. 167(d) and 134 and 20 CFR part 680, and youth workforce \ninvestment activities described in WIOA sec. 129 and 20 CFR part 681; the arrangements under the MOU's with the \napplicable Local Workforce Development Boards for the delivery of the services available through the one-stop \nsystem to MSFWs; and related assistance services.\n\nSection 685.320Who is eligible to receive services under the National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.320 establishes that MSFWs as defined in \u00a7 685.110 are eligible for services funded by the NFJP. \nAs provided in WIOA sec. 167(d)(1), NFJP grants are used to provide adult and youth services, thus the NFJP may \nuse funds available to serve youth even when the service area is not being served with supplemental youth funds \nauthorized in WIOA sec. 127(a)(1). In addition, NFJP services can be provided to eligible MSFW youth who \ndemonstrate a need for and ability to benefit from career services. For example, some older youth may benefit more \nfrom the array of career services available under NFJP than from the youth services offered under subpart E.\n\nSection 685.330How are services delivered to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.330 emphasizes that services to eligible MSFWs will be focused on the customer's needs and \nprovided through a case-management approach emphasizing customer choice, and may include appropriate career \nservices and training, and related assistance, which includes emergency assistance; and supportive services, which \nincludes allowance payments. The basic services and delivery of case-management activities are further described \nin \u00a7\u00a7 685.340 through 685.390.\n\nSection 685.340What career services must grantees provide to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.340 establishes that eligible MSFWs must be provided the career services described in WIOA \nsecs. 167(d) and 134(c)(2), and 20 CFR part 680. Other career services may be provided as identified in the \ngrantee's approved program plan. The Department also has included language to clarify that while career services \nmust be made available through the one-stop delivery system, grantees also may provide these types of services \nthrough other sources outside the one-stop system. Examples include non-profit organizations or educational \ninstitutions. The delivery of career services to eligible MSFWs by the grantee and through the one-stop system \nmust be discussed in the required MOU between the Local Workforce Development Board and the grantee.\n\nSection 685.350What training services must grantees provide to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.350 establishes that the training activities in WIOA secs. 167(d) and 134(c)(3)(D), and 20 CFR part \n680, must be provided to eligible MSFWs. These activities include, but are not limited to, occupational-skills training \nand OJT. The Department also emphasizes that eligible MSFWs are not required to receive career services prior \nto receiving training services, as described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(iii). This section also reinforces the intent of \nWIOA that training services be directly linked to an in-demand industry sector or occupation in the service area, or \nin another area to which an eligible MSFW receiving such services is willing to relocate, consistent with WIOA sec. \n134(c)(3)(G)(iii). The Department also establishes that training activities must encourage the attainment of \nrecognized post-secondary credentials as defined in \u00a7 685.110 (which refers to WIOA sec. 3(52)), when appropriate \nfor an eligible MSFW. This requirement is in alignment with WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(IV) and 116(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III), \nwhich include \u201cthe percentage of program participants who obtain a recognized post-secondary credential, or a \nsecondary school diploma,\u201d as a primary indicator of performance for both the adult and youth programs.\n\nSection 685.360What housing services must grantees provide to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.360 requires that housing grantees must provide housing services to eligible MSFWs and that \ncareer services and training grantees may provide housing services to eligible MSFWs as described in their \nprogram plan. The proposed section establishes the definitions of permanent housing and temporary housing \nservices that are available to eligible MSFWs. The Department establishes that permanent housing is owner-\noccupied, or occupied on a permanent, year-round basis (notwithstanding ownership) as the MSFW's primary \nresidence to which he/she typically returns at the end of the work or training day and temporary housing is non-\nowner-occupied housing used by MSFWs whose employment requires occasional travel outside their normal \ncommuting area. Permanent housing may include rental units, single family, duplexes, and other multi-family \nstructures, dormitory, group homes, and other housing types that provide short-term, seasonal, or year-round \nhousing opportunities in permanent structures. Modular structures, manufactured housing, or mobile units placed \non permanent foundations and supplied with appropriate utilities and other infrastructure are also considered \npermanent housing. Temporary housing may include: Units intended for temporary occupancy located in permanent \nstructures, such as rental units in an apartment complex or in mobile structures, tents, and yurts that provide short-\nterm, seasonal housing opportunities; temporary structures that may be moved from site to site, dismantled and re-\nerected when needed for farmworker occupancy; and off-farm housing operated independently of employer \ninterest in, or control of, the housing, or on-farm housing operated by a nonprofit, including faith-based or \n\n\n\ncommunity non-profit organizations, but located on property owned by an agricultural employer. Specific examples \nof permanent housing services and activities associated with the provision of permanent housing services, and \nspecific examples of temporary housing activities associated with the provision of temporary housing services, \nincluding emergency assistance such as emergency housing payments, vouchers, and cash payments for \nrent/lease and utilities are provided. The Department establishes that housing services are intended to meet the \nneeds of eligible MSFWs to occupy a unit of housing for reasons related to seeking employment, retaining \nemployment, or engaging in training. The definitions of permanent housing and temporary housing assistance and \nthe specific examples of permanent and temporary housing services described in the proposed \u00a7 685.360 are \nadapted from the 2011 Department Notice of Availability of Funds and Solicitation for Grant Applications for the \nNational Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) Housing Assistance Program (Funding Opportunity Number: SGA-\nDFA-PY-10-08) which provided specific requirements and guidelines for housing grant applicants.\n\nSection 685.370What services may grantees provide to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworker youth participants \naged 14-24?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.370 describes the services that grantees may provide to eligible MSFW youth participants aged 14-\n24 based on an evaluation and assessment of their needs. These services include the career and training services \ndescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 685.340 through 685.350; youth workforce investment activities described in WIOA sec. 129; life \nskills activities that encourage development of self and interpersonal skills development; community service \nprojects; and other activities that conform to the use of funds for youth activities described in 20 CFR part 681. \nGrantees may provide these services to any eligible MSFW youth, regardless of the participant's eligibility for WIOA \ntitle I youth activities as described in WIOA sec. 129(a).\n\nSection 685.380What related assistance services may be provided to eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.380 describes the types of services that may be provided to eligible MSFWs as \u201crelated \nassistance,\u201d and establishes that these services are short-term, direct services. Examples include emergency \nassistance, as defined in \u00a7 685.110, and those activities identified in WIOA sec. 167(d), such as English language \nand literacy instruction, pesticide and worker safety training, housing (including permanent housing), asdescribed \nin \u00a7 685.360, and school dropout prevention and recovery activities. Related assistance is distinct from \u201csupportive \nservices\u201d as defined in WIOA sec. 3, which \u201cmeans services such as transportation, child care, dependent care, \nhousing, and needs-related payments, that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in activities \nauthorized under this Act,\u201d because related assistance may be provided to eligible MSFWs who are not otherwise \nparticipating in activities authorized under this Act such as career services, youth services, or training services.\n\nSection 685.390When may eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers receive related assistance?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.390 establishes that eligible MSFWs may receive related assistance services when the need for \nthe related assistance is identified and documented by the grantee. A statement by the eligible MSFW may be \nincluded as documentation.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Performance Accountability, Planning, and Waiver Provisions\n\nThis subpart describes indicators of performance for grantees, required planning documents, and the information \nrequired in program plans required under WIOA sec. 167. The subpart also explains waiver provisions and \nclarifies how grant costs are classified under WIOA sec. 167.\n\nSection 685.400What are the indicators of performance that apply to the National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.400 describes the indicators of performance that apply to grantees. Grantees providing career \nservices and training will use the indicators of performance common to the adult and youth programs, described in \nWIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), as required by WIOA sec. 167(c)(2)(C). These measures of performance are the same as \nthe primary indicators discussed in proposed \u00a7 677.155. Though the indicators of performance are identified in \nvarious places throughout the WIOA proposed regulations, the indicators are the same and do not vary across the \nregulations.\n\nFor grantees providing career services and training, the Department will reach agreement on the levels of \nperformance for each of the primary indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), taking into \n\n\n\naccount economic conditions, characteristics of the individuals served, and other appropriate factors, and using, to \nthe extent practicable, the statistical adjustment model under WIOA sec. 116(b)(3)(A)(viii). The levels agreed to will \nbe the adjusted levels of performance and will be incorporated in the program plan, as required in WIOA sec. \n167(c)(3). For grantees providing housing services only, grantees will use the total number of eligible MSFWs \nserved and the total number of eligible MSFW families served as indicators of performance. Performance indicators \nfor NFJP housing grantees are not specified in WIA or WIOA statute, and the measures proposed here are adapted \nfrom the Department's TEGL, Number 15-13, Program Year 2014 Planning Guidance for National Farmworker Jobs \nProgram Housing Grantees, released March 25, 2014. As described in proposed \u00a7 685.400(d), the Department may \ndevelop additional performance indicators with appropriate levels of performance for evaluating programs that serve \neligible MSFWs and which reflect the State service area economy, local demographics of eligible MSFWs, and \nother appropriate factors. In accordance with \u00a7 685.400(d), the Department may develop additional indicators of \nperformance for housing grantees in addition to the indicators specified in proposed \u00a7 685.400(c). If additional \nperformance indicators are developed, the levels of performance for these additional indicators must be negotiated \nwith the grantee and included in the approved program plan. Grantees also may develop additional performance \nindicators and include them in the program plan or in periodic performance reports.\n\nSection 685.410What planning documents must a grantee submit?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.410 describes the planning documents that a grantee must submit, including a comprehensive \nprogram plan, further described in proposed \u00a7 685.420, and a projection of participant services and expenditures \ncovering the 4-year grant cycle.\n\nSection 685.420What information is required in the grantee program plan?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.420 describes the information required for inclusion in program plans. Paragraph (a) asks for a \ndescription of the service area that the applicant proposes to serve, in accordance with WIOA sec. 167(c). \nParagraphs (b) through (g) incorporate the elements described in WIOA sec. 167(c)(2). Paragraphs (h) and (i) \nspecify additional information required in program plans which include: The methods the grantee will use to target \nits services on specific segments of the eligible population, as appropriate, and the response to any other \nrequirements set forth in the FOA issued under \u00a7 685.210.\n\nSection 685.430Under what circumstances are the terms of the grantee's program plan modified by the grantee or \nthe Department?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.430 describes the circumstances when the terms of the grantee's program plan can be modified by \nthe grantee or the Department. Program plans must be modified to reflect the funding level for each year of the \ngrant, and the Department will provide instructions annually on when to submit modifications for each year of \nfunding, which will generally be no later than June 1, prior to the start of the subsequent year of the grant cycle. \nGrantees must submit a request to the Department for any proposed modifications to the plan to add, delete, \nexpand, or reduce any part of the program plan or allowable activities, and the Department will consider the cost \nprinciples, uniform administrative requirements, and terms and conditions of award when reviewing modifications to \nprogram plans. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Department has reviewed and approved any \nproposed programmatic changes as part of a grant award to ensure the changes are allowable, programmatically \nand fiscally sound, and do not negatively affect performance outcomes. If the grantee is approved for a regulatory \nwaiver under proposed \u00a7 685.560 and \u00a7 685.570, it must submit a modification of the grant plan to reflect the effect \nof the waiver.\n\nSection 685.440How are costs classified under the National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.440 describes how costs are classified under the NFJP. Costs are classified as administrative \ncosts, as defined in 20 CFR 683.215, and program costs are all other costs not defined as administrative. The \nDepartment further specifies that program costs must be classified and reported in the categories of related \nassistance (including emergency assistance), supportive services, and all other program services.\n\nSection 685.450What is the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act administrative cost limit for National \nFarmworker Jobs Program grants?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.450 describes the administrative cost limit for NFJP grants which, under 20 CFR 683.205(b), will \nbe identified in the grant or contract award document, and will not exceed 15 percent of total grantee funding. The \nadministrative cost limit established inthis section is consistent with the administrative cost limit under which the \nprogram is currently operating.\n\nSection 685.460Are there regulatory and/or statutory waiver provisions that apply to the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.460 describes the regulatory and/or statutory waiver provisions that apply to WIOA sec. 167. The \nstatutory waiver provision at WIOA sec. 189(i) and discussed in 20 CFR 679.600 does not apply to WIOA sec. 167. \nParagraph (b) establishes that grantees may request a waiver of any regulatory provisions only when such \nregulatory provisions are (1) not required by WIOA; (2) not related to wage and labor standards, non-displacement \nprotection, worker rights, participation and protection of workers and participants, and eligibility of participants, \ngrievance procedures, judicial review, nondiscrimination, allocation of funds, procedures for review and approval of \nplans; and (3) not related to the basic purposes of WIOA, described in 20 CFR 675.100.\n\nSection 685.470How can grantees request a waiver?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.570 describes the information that grantees must submit to the Department in a waiver plan to \ndocument a requested waiver. The waiver request must include: A description of the goals of the waiver; the \nexpected programmatic outcomes and how the waiver will improve the provision of program activities; how the \nwaiver is consistent with guidelines the Department establishes; the data that will be collected to track the impact of \nthe waiver; and the modified program plan reflecting the effect of the requested waiver.\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Supplemental Youth Workforce Investment Activity Funding Under Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act Sec. 127(a)(1)\n\nThis subpart describes the purpose of supplemental youth workforce investment activity funding that may become \navailable under WIOA sec. 127(a)(1). Included is a description of how the funds may become available, and what \nrequirements apply to grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1). Significantly, these funds may be used only for \nworkforce investment activities for eligible MSFW youth, as defined in \u00a7 685.110. The Department will issue a \nseparate FOA for grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1), and the selection will be made in accordance with the \nprocedures described in \u00a7 685.210, giving priority to applicants that are WIOA sec. 167 grantees. Planning \ndocuments required for grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) will be described in the FOA; and allocation of \nWIOA sec. 127(a)(1) funds will be based on the comparative merits of the applications in accordance with criteria \nset forth in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.500What is supplemental youth workforce investment activity funding?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.500 describes that if Congress appropriates more than $925 million for WIOA youth workforce \ninvestment activities in a fiscal year, 4 percent of the excess amount must be used to provide workforce investment \nactivities for eligible MSFW youth under WIOA sec. 167.\n\nSection 685.510What requirements apply to grants funded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.510 specifies that the requirements in subparts A through D of \u00a7 685 apply to grants funded by \nWIOA sec. 127(a)(1), except that grants described in this subpart must be used only for workforce investment \nactivities for eligible MSFW youth, as described in \u00a7 685.370 and WIOA sec. 167(d) (including related assistance \nand supportive services).\n\nSection 685.520What is the application process for obtaining a grant funded by the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.520 specifies that the Department will issue a separate FOA for grants funded by WIOA sec. \n127(a)(1). The selection will be made in accordance with the procedures described in \u00a7 685.210, except that the \nDepartment reserves the right to provide priority to applicants that are WIOA sec. 167 grantees.\n\nSection 685.530What planning documents are required for grants funded by the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.530 specifies that planning documents required for grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) will be \ndescribed in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.540How are funds allocated to grants funded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.540 describes that the allocation of WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) funds will be based on the comparative \nmerits of the applications, in accordance with criteria set forth in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.550Who is eligible to receive services through grants funded by the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 685.550 describes that eligible MSFW youth as defined in \u00a7 685.110 may receive services through \ngrants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1).\n\nJ. Part 686\u2014The Job Corps Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThis part provides proposed regulations for the Job Corps program, authorized in title I, subtitle C of WIOA. The \nregulations address the scope and purpose of the Job Corps program and provide requirements relating to site \nselection, protection, and maintenance of Job Corps facilities; funding and selection of center operators and service \nproviders; recruitment, eligibility, screening, selection and assignment, and enrollment of Job Corps students; Job \nCorps program activities and center operations; student support; career transition services and graduate services; \ncommunity connections; and administrative and management requirements. The Department's intent in the \nregulations is to incorporate the requirements of title I, subtitle C of the Act and to describe how the Job Corps \nprogram is operated in order to deliver relevant academic and career technical training (CTT) that leads to \nmeaningful employment or post-secondary education. The regulations also serve to explain clearly the \nrequirements necessitated by the unique residential environment of a Job Corps center. The major changes from \nthe existing regulations reflect WIOA's effort to enhance the Job Corps program, provide access to high quality \ntraining and education, create incentives for strong contractor performance, and promote accountability and \ntransparency.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Scope and Purpose\n\nThis proposed subpart contains regulatory provisions that describe the Job Corps program, its purpose, the role of \nits Director, and applicable definitions. In describing the role of the Job Corps Director, this subpart provides that the \nSecretary has delegated the authority to carry out his or her responsibilities under this part to the National Director \nof Job Corps; therefore, all references to the Secretary issuing guidelines, procedures or standards means that they \nwill be issued by the National Job Corps Director. This subpart also describes the Policy and Requirements \nHandbook (PRH), which provides the operating policies andprocedures governing day-to-day activities of the Job \nCorps program. The subpart describes the scope and purpose of the program, along with the responsibilities of its \nNational Director. It promotes accountability and transparency by making readers aware of exactly what the Job \nCorps program plans to achieve and the procedures for doing so, as well as the role its leadership plays in its \noperation.\n\nSection 686.100What is the scope of this part?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.100 contains the regulatory provisions governing the Job Corps program. It explains that \nprocedures guiding day-to-day operations are proposed to be provided in the PRH and clarifies that throughout this \npart, phrases that refer to instructions or procedures issued by the Secretary refer to the PRH and other Job Corps \nDirectives. Because this section of WIOA is so similar to the corresponding section in WIA, this proposed section \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 686.100.\n\nSection 686.110What is the Job Corps program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.110 describes the Job Corps program. Job Corps is a national program that operates in \npartnership with States, communities, local Workforce Development Boards, youth councils, one-stop centers and \npartners, and other youth programs to provide social, academic, career and technical education, and service-\nlearning opportunities, primarily in a residential setting, for low-income young people. Proposed \u00a7 686.110 reflects \nthe increased focus in sec. 141 of WIOA on connecting young people to the labor force by providing them with \n\n\n\nintensive social, academic, career and technical education in order to obtain secondary school diplomas or \nrecognized credentials leading to successful careers in in-demand industries or occupations, the Armed Forces, or \nenrollment in post-secondary education. The program's goals for students are economic self-sufficiency, \nopportunities for advancement, and responsible citizenship.\n\nSection 686.120What definitions apply to this part?\n\nThe definitions that are listed in this section are specific to this proposed part, which governs the Job Corps \nprogram. Other definitions that apply to the Job Corps program are defined under secs. 3 and 142 of WIOA. \nProposed \u00a7 686.120 describes definitions in four categories.\n\nThe first category is made up of proposed definitions that are the same as those included in the regulations at 20 \nCFR 686.120 that governed the Job Corps program under WIA. These are \u201cAbsent Without Official Leave (AWOL),\u201d \n\u201cCapital improvement,\u201d \u201cContract center,\u201d \u201cEnrollee,\u201d \u201cEnrollment,\u201d \u201cIndividual with a disability,\u201d \u201cInteragency \nagreement,\u201d \u201cJob Corps Director,\u201d \u201cNational Office,\u201d \u201cPlacement,\u201d \u201cRegional appeal board,\u201d \u201cRegional Director,\u201d \n\u201cRegional Office,\u201d \u201cRegional Solicitor,\u201d \u201cSeparation,\u201d \u201cStudent,\u201d and \u201cUnauthorized goods.\u201d Because these \ndefinitions are the same as those in the WIA regulations, the Department has not included further explanation of \nthem below.\n\nThe second category is made up of proposed definitions that are similar to definitions included in the WIA \nregulations at 20 CFR 670.120, but they have been modified slightly due to differences in the definitions contained \nin WIOA. These are \u201cApplicable Local Board,\u201d \u201cCivilian Conservation Center (CCC), \u201cContracting Officer,\u201d \n\u201cGraduate,\u201d \u201cJob Corps,\u201d \u201cJob Corps center,\u201d \u201cLow-income individual,\u201d \u201cNational training contractor,\u201d \u201cOperational \nsupport services,\u201d \u201cOperator,\u201d and \u201cOutreach and admissions provider.\u201d\n\nThe third category is made up of proposed definitions that were not included in the WIA regulations, but they are \ndefined in sec. 142 of WIOA. These are \u201cApplicable one-stop center,\u201d \u201cFormer Enrollee,\u201d and \u201cService Provider.\u201d\n\nThe fourth category is made up of proposed definitions that apply to the Job Corps program and are commonly \nused in these regulations, but do not appear in the WIA regulations or in WIOA. These are \u201cCareer Technical \nTraining,\u201d \u201cCareer Transition Service Provider,\u201d and \u201cParticipant.\u201d\n\nAside from the terms in the first category, the definitions are explained as the terms appear in this proposed section \nin alphabetical order, as follows:\n\nApplicable Local Board\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition of \u201capplicable Local Board\u201d \ncontained in sec. 142 of WIOA. It is similar to the definition of \u201cWorkforce Investment Board\u201d in the WIA regulations.\n\nApplicable one-stop center\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition contained in sec. 142 of \nWIOA.\n\nCareer Technical Training\u2014The proposed definition of this term means career and technical education and training, \nwhich is the term most often used by WIOA rather than \u201cvocational training,\u201d as used in WIA.\n\nCareer Transition Service Provider\u2014The proposed definition of this term means an organization acting under a \ncontract or other agreement with Job Corps to provide career transition services for graduates and, to the extent \npossible, for former students. WIOA uses both the term \u201cCareer Transition Service Provider\u201d and \u201cPlacement \nProvider\u201d interchangeably. Career transition services are further explained in subpart G of the proposed rule.\n\nContracting officer\u2014The proposed definition of this term is similar to the definition of \u201ccontracting officer\u201d in the \nWIA regulations, but it does not include \u201cRegional Director,\u201d because contracting officers are most often not \nRegional Directors.\n\nFormer Enrollee\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\nGraduate\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\n\n\nJob Corps\u2014The proposed definition of this term is similar to the definition of \u201cJob Corps\u201d in the WIA regulations, but \nit clarifies that the Job Corps is established within the Department and cites the applicable section of WIOA.\n\nJob Corps center\u2014The proposed definition of this term is the same as the definition in the WIA regulations, except \nthat this definition cites the applicable section of WIOA.\n\nLow-income individual\u2014The proposed definition of this term is the same as the definition in the WIA regulations, \nexcept that this definition cites the applicable section of WIOA.\n\nNational training contractor\u2014The proposed definition of this term is slightly different from the definition in the WIA \nregulations, because the term \u201ccareer and technical training\u201d is used rather than \u201cvocational training.\u201d However, the \nmeaning remains unchanged.\n\nOperational support services\u2014The proposed definition of this term is slightly different from the definition in the WIA \nregulations, because the term \u201ccareer and technical training\u201d is used instead of \u201cvocational training.\u201d However, the \nmeaning remains unchanged.\n\nOperator\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition of \u201coperator\u201d contained in sec. 142 of \nWIOA. It is similar to the definition of \u201ccenter operator\u201d in the WIA regulations.\n\nOutreach and admissions provider- The proposed definition of this term is similar to the definition of \u201coutreachand \nadmissions agency\u201d in the WIA regulations, but it clarifies that the entity performs recruitment in addition to outreach \nand enrollment activities, consistent with the definition in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\nParticipant\u2014The proposed definition of this term clarifies which individuals are considered participants for \nperformance reporting purposes under proposed \u00a7 686.1010. The definition of participant includes graduates and \nthose enrollees and former enrollees who have completed the career preparation period. It also includes enrollees \nand former enrollees who have remained in the program for 60 days or more, regardless of whether they have \ncompleted their career preparation period. During the career preparation period, the student learns, demonstrates, \nand practices personal responsibility and skills required in the workplace; learns, demonstrates, and practices job \nsearch skills; visits and learns about one-stop centers; and creates a personal career development plan with the \nhelp of staff. In most cases, the career preparation period culminates with the commitment to the Personal Career \nDevelopment Plan. The Department proposes this limitation because students are not assigned to trades and are \nnot generally receiving the services described subpart E of this part until the career preparation period is completed. \nThe career preparation period is described in Job Corps' Policy and Requirements Handbook.\n\nService Provider\u2014The proposed definition of this term implements the definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.130What is the role of the Job Corps Director?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.130 describes the role of the Job Corps Director, noting that he/she has been delegated authority \nto carry out the responsibility of the Secretary under title I, subtitle C of WIOA related to the operation of the Job \nCorps program. Proposed \u00a7 686.130 also clarifies that references in this part referring to \u201cguidelines\u201d or \u201cprocedures \nissued by the Secretary\u201d mean that the Job Corps Director issues such guidelines. This proposed section retains \nthe same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 686.130.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Site Selection and Protection and Maintenance of Facilities\n\nThis proposed subpart describes how sites for Job Corps centers are selected, the handling of capital \nimprovements and new construction on Job Corps centers, and responsibilities for facility protection and \nmaintenance. The requirements in this subpart are not significantly different from the corresponding requirements in \nthe WIA Job Corps regulations at 20 CFR part 686 subpart B. The Secretary, through delegation of authority to the \nNational Director of Job Corps, must approve the location and size of all Job Corps centers, and establish \nprocedures for requesting, approving, and initiating capital improvement and new construction on Job Corps \ncenters, which serves to strengthen and enhance the program as a whole.\n\nSection 686.200How are Job Corps center locations and sizes determined?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.200 explains that the Secretary must approve the location and size of all Job Corps centers, \nincluding both contract centers and CCCs. The Secretary also establishes procedures for making decisions \nconcerning the establishment, relocation, expansion, or closing of contract centers.\n\nSection 686.210How are center facilities improvements and new construction handled?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.210 states that the Secretary establishes procedures for requesting, approving, and initiating \ncapital improvements and new construction on Job Corps centers.\n\nSection 686.220Who is responsible for the protection and maintenance of center facilities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.220 states that the Secretary establishes procedures for the protection and maintenance of \ncontract center facilities owned or leased by the Department. The proposed section also states that when the \nDepartment of Agriculture operates CCCs on public land, it will be responsible for the protection and maintenance \nof CCC facilities. The Secretary issues procedures for conducting periodic facility surveys of centers to determine \ntheir condition and to identify additional physical needs. This proposed section retains the same requirements found \nat 20 CFR 670.220.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Funding and Selection of Center Operators and Service Providers\n\nIn this proposed subpart the Department implements new requirements of WIOA with regard to the operators of \nhigh-performing centers, the length of contractual agreements to operate Job Corps centers, and how entities are \nselected to receive funding to operate Job Corps centers and to provide outreach, admissions, and career transition \nsupport services. In addition to adding to the list of considerations currently used in selecting Job Corps center \noperators and service providers, WIOA emphasizes competition to increase the performance and quality of the Job \nCorps program. WIOA also provides that an entity, in its role as incumbent operator of a center deemed to be high \nperforming, may compete in any competitive selection process carried out for an award to operate that center, even \nin cases where the selection of the operator is set aside for small businesses as required by the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation. This serves to ensure continued access to high quality training and education for Job Corps \nstudents, since a high performing incumbent operator has an established and proven record of providing it. WIOA \nalso provides that a center operations contracts cannot exceed 2 years, with three 1-year options to renew. This \ncodifies current Job Corps practice. Furthermore, WIOA precludes the Secretary from exercising an option to renew \na center operations contract for an additional 1-year period if certain criteria are not met, with limited exceptions. \nAll of these new and expanded provisions follow WIOA's theme of enhancing the Job Corps program and providing \naccess to high quality training and education by ensuring Job Corps centers are staffed with high quality service \nproviders.\n\nSection 686.300What entities are eligible to receive funds to operate centers and provide training and operational \nsupport services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.300 implements secs. 147(a)(1), 147(e), and 145(a)(3) of WIOA, establishing the entities eligible to \nreceive funds to operate Job Corps centers, and to provide outreach and admissions, career transition, and other \noperational support services.\n\nProposed paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4) reflect the entities eligible to operate Job Corps centers listed in \nWIOA sec. 147(a)(1)(A). Proposed paragraph (a)(3) includes \u201cIndian tribes and organizations\u201d as eligible center \noperators, consistent with sec. 147(e) of WIOA. For purposes of this section, the Department interprets \u201cIndian \ntribes and organizations\u201d consistent with sec. 147(e)(2) of WIOA, which provides that the terms \u201cIndian\u201d and \u201cIndian \ntribe\u201d have the meanings given them in sec. 4 of the ISDEAA (codified at 25 U.S.C. 450b(d) and (e)), which says \nthat \u201cIndian tribe\u201d means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any \nAlaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act (codified at 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), which is recognized aseligible for the special programs \nand services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) lists the entities eligible to receive funds to provide necessary services to Job Corps \ncenters, including outreach and admissions, career transition, and other operational support services. Generally, as \nprovided in WIOA sec. 147(a)(1)(B), local or other entities with the necessary capacity to provide activities \n\n\n\ndescribed in this part are considered eligible entities. Paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) reflect the entities listed in \nsec. 145(a)(3) of WIOA. Currently Job Corps also allows private for-profit and non-profit corporations to act as \neligible service providers; paragraph (b)(2) clarifies that private for-profit and non-profit corporations continue to be \nincluded as business organizations eligible to receive funds as service providers.\n\nSection 686.310How are entities selected to receive funding to operate centers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.310 implements secs. 147(a)(2) and (a)(3) of WIOA, which contain new provisions to strengthen \nthe Job Corps contracting process by requiring specific criteria that emphasize quality, performance, and \naccountability to be addressed as part of the selection process for center operators. The proposed section adopts \nthese criteria to improve the effectiveness of the program in helping young people become responsible citizens by \nproviding them with the skills they need for successful careers in in-demand industry sectors, occupations, or the \nArmed Forces, or for enrollment in post-secondary education. The Department welcomes comments on how best to \nembed a focus on quality, performance, and accountability into the procurement process.\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.310(a) implements sec. 147(a)(2)(A) of WIOA, stating that the Secretary selects eligible entities to \noperate contract centers on a competitive basis in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. This \nparagraph also explains that in selecting an entity, ETA issues requests for proposals (RFPs) for the operation of all \ncontact centers according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 chapter 1) and the Department's Acquisition \nRegulation (48 chapter 29). ETA develops RFPs for center operators in consultation with the Governor, the center \nworkforce council (if established), and the Local Board for the workforce development area in which the center is \nlocated.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) requires that the RFPs for each contract center describe uniform specifications and \nstandards, as well as specifications and requirements that are unique to the operation of the specific center.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) implements the factors for selection of an entity to operate a Job Corps center established \nin sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, by specifying that the selection criteria will be established by the Secretary and set \nforth in the RFP. Proposed paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) set forth the specific criteria that must be included in the \nRFP, as listed in sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA. Paragraph (c)(1) retains the language found in the WIA regulations \nat 20 CFR 670.310(c)(1), requiring that the offeror demonstrate its ability to coordinate the activities carried out \nthrough the Job Corps center with activities carried out under the appropriate State and local workforce investment \nplans. This supports the overall goal of better connecting and aligning Job Corps with the workforce system.\n\nProposed paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) implement the criteria at WIOA secs. 147(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) through \n147(a)(2)(B)(i)(IV). These provisions support the goal of better alignment with the workforce system and the \nincreased focus on past performance and student outcomes against the primary indicators of performance for \neligible youth and the Job Corps program.\n\nProposed paragraph (c)(5) is a new element in the selection process established in sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i)(V) of WIOA, \nrequiring that the criteria include the offeror's ability to demonstrate a record of successfully assisting at-risk youth \nto connect to the workforce, including providing them with intensive academics and career and technical training. \nThis aligns with the increased focus on student outcomes and emphasizes the purpose of the program, which is to \nprovide students with the skills they need for successful careers in in-demand industries, occupations, or the Armed \nForces, or to continue on to post-secondary education. The Department welcomes comments on how to assess \npotential offerors' past records in assisting at-risk youth to connect to the workforce.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) implements the additional factors for selection of an entity to operate a Job Corps center \nthat are specified in sec. 147(a)(3) of WIOA. These provisions support the goals of better alignment with the \nworkforce system and increased focus on past performance and student outcomes against the primary indicators of \nperformance for eligible youth and the Job Corps program. In addition, paragraph (d) specifies that the information \ndescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (11) must be submitted at such time in the procurement process, and in \nsuch form, as the Secretary determines is appropriate.\n\nSection 686.320What if a current center operator is deemed to be an operator of a high-performing center?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.320(a) implements sec. 147(b)(1) of WIOA, allowing an entity that, in its role as the incumbent \noperator of a center, meets the requirements of this section to be considered an operator of a high-performing \ncenter. If the entity is considered an operator of a high-performing center, the entity must be allowed to compete in \nany competitive selection process carried out for an award to operate that center. This means that in cases where \nthe selection of the operator of a particular center is set aside for small businesses as required by the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation, the incumbent operator may participate in the subsequent competition for the center \noperations contract even if the operator would be otherwise ineligible to compete as a result of the set-aside.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) implements sec. 147(b)(2) of WIOA, which provides the criteria an operator must meet to \nbe considered an operator of a high-performing center for the purposes of paragraph (a). First, under paragraph \n(b)(1), the center must be ranked among the top 20 percent of Job Corps centers for the most recent preceding PY \naccording to the ranking described in proposed \u00a7 686.1070. Second, under paragraph (b)(2), the center must meet \nthe expected levels of performance established with respect to each of the primary indicators of performance for \neligible youth found in proposed \u00a7 686.1000. A center will be determined to have met the expected measures of \nperformance if, per proposed \u00a7 686.320(b)(2)(i) and (ii), it achieved an average of at least 100 percent of the \nexpected level of performance for the indicator over the most recent preceding 3 PYs, and, for the most recent \npreceding PY for which information is available at the time the determination is made, the center achieved at least \n100 percent of the expected level of performance established for the indicator. This provision emphasizes the \nimportance of meeting the expected levels of performance related to the primary indicators, by providing an \nopportunity for the most successful incumbent contractors to compete to operate a high-performing center even \nifthe competition for that center is a small business set-aside and the incumbent would not normally meet the \ncriteria to compete in a small business set-aside competition. The Department anticipates going through the market \nresearch phase of the competition before determining whether the competition will be set aside for small \nbusinesses; a determination as to whether the incumbent contractor meets the criteria in proposed paragraph (b) \nwill likely be made after the market research phase is completed and before the issuance of the solicitation.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) implements the transition procedures in sec. 147(b)(3) of WIOA, and describes the criteria \nthat must be met for an operator to be considered to be an operator of a high-performing center if any of the PYs \ndescribed in paragraph (b) precede the implementation of the establishment of the expected levels of performance \nand the application of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth.\n\nSection 686.330What is the length of an agreement entered into by the Secretary for operation of a Job Corps \ncenter and what are the conditions for renewal of such an agreement?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.330 implements secs. 147(f)-(g) of WIOA, which contain new provisions to strengthen the Job \nCorps contracting process by enacting new requirements for the length of center operations contracts and the \nconditions under which they may be renewed. These provisions emphasize quality and integrity in center operators \nand direct the Secretary not to exercise option years for contracts where minimum standards of performance \nrelated to the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth are not met. These provisions further support the \noverall vision of improved performance and accountability for the Job Corps program.\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.330(a) implements sec. 147(f) of WIOA, which provides that contracts to operate a Job Corps \ncenter cannot exceed 2 years, but that the Secretary can exercise any contractual option to renew the agreement in \n1-year increments for not more than 3 additional years. This proposed paragraph reflects current Job Corps \ncontracting practice.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) explains that the Secretary will establish procedures for evaluating the option to renew an \nagreement that include an assessment of the factors described in proposed paragraph (c), a review of contract \nperformance and financial reporting compliance, a review of the program management and performance data \ndescribed in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 686.975 and 686.980, and an evaluation of the factors described in proposed paragraph \n(d).\n\nProposed paragraph (c) implements sec. 147(g)(4) of WIOA, which establishes conditions that must be met for the \nSecretary to exercise a contractual option to renew an agreement for an entity to operate a Job Corps center.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (d) implements sec. 147(g)(1) of WIOA, which prohibits the Secretary from renewing an \nagreement for an entity to operate a Job Corps center for any 1-year additional period if, for both of the 2 most \nrecent preceding PYs for which information is available at the time the determination to exercise an option is made, \nthe center both has been ranked in the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers according to the ranking described \nin proposed \u00a7 686.1070 and has failed to achieve an average of 50 percent or higher of the expected level of \nperformance with respect to each of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth (as described in \nproposed \u00a7 686.1000). If a second year of program data is unavailable at the time the determination regarding the \ncontractual option is made, proposed paragraph (d) requires the use of data from the preceding year from which \nperformance information is available. This provision emphasizes the center operator's accountability for meeting the \nexpected levels of performance related to the primary indicators by establishing minimum performance standards \nthat must be met for the Secretary to exercise an option year.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) addresses the availability of information and data necessary to make the determination \nrequired by proposed paragraph (d). The availability of sufficient information to make this determination is a \nparticular concern in situations where there is a change of operators at the beginning of an agreement, and there is \na period of time during which student outcome data, and thus the primary indicators of performance, reflect the \nperformance of the previous operator rather than the operator upon whose contract the determination is being \nmade.\n\nIn order to prevent an entity from being penalized for the poor performance of the previous operator, proposed \nparagraph (e)(1) states that information will only be considered to be available for a PY for purposes of paragraph \n(d) if for each of the primary indicators of performance, all of the students included in the cohort being measured \neither began their participation under the current center operator or, if they began their participation under the \nprevious center operator, were on center for at least 6 months under the current operator. Six months represents a \nsufficient length of time for the efforts of the current operator to influence the outcomes achieved by a student. \nProposed paragraph (e)(2) further provides that if complete information for any of the indicators of performance \ndescribed in paragraph (d)(2) is not available for either of the 2 PYs described in paragraph (d), the Secretary will \nreview partial PY data from the most recent PY for those indicators, if at least 2 quarters of data are available, when \nmaking the determination required under paragraph (d)(2). The Department recognizes that data for some of the \nprimary indicators of performance do not become mature for an extended period of time. For example, employment \nin the fourth quarter after exit and credential attainment are measured more than a year after the student exits the \nprogram and then are reported in a subsequent quarter. Because the Secretary's decision on whether to exercise \nthe first option year is normally made about 18 months after the contract begins, in many cases complete \ninformation on employment in the fourth quarter after exit and credential attainment will not be available at the time \nthe first option year decision is made. The Department invites comments on the issue of information availability, \nincluding the threshold for the point at which the performance of the center reflects the performance of the current \noperator.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) provides a transition provision for establishing the criteria that must be met for an operator \nto meet the requirements of proposed paragraph (d). The transition provisions apply if any of the PYs described in \nparagraph (d) precede the implementation of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth and \nestablishment of the expected levels of performance. While the WIOA statute does not include a transition \nprovision, it is necessary to add such a provision because although the WIOA contracting provisions, including this \nsection, go into effect on July 1, 2015, the WIOA performance reporting requirements do not go into effect until July \n1, 2016. In addition, there will be a gap in time during which initial data on the primary indicators of performance is \nbeing collected and baselines are being established when the expected levels of performance will not have been \nestablished and therefore, the data described in paragraph (d)(2) will not yet be available. ETA has modeled the \ntransition language in proposedparagraph (f) on the transition provision in WIOA sec. 147(b)(3), which is used to \ndetermine whether a center is a high performing center, and based on criteria similar to the criteria in proposed \nparagraph (d). The transition bases the determination on similar data points using the performance of the Job Corps \ncenter regarding the national goals or targets established by the Office of the Job Corps under the previous \nperformance accountability system, which is the available data that most closely aligns with the requirement in \n\n\n\nparagraph (d). Therefore, the Department chose this as the best proxy data available. The Department invites \ncomments on the approach to transitioning from the WIA to WIOA performance management systems.\n\nProposed paragraph (g), implements sec. 147(g)(2) of WIOA, which provides an exception to the prohibition against \nexercising an option year for an operator of a low-performing center as determined under proposed paragraph (d).\n\nAs required in sec. 147(g)(3) of WIOA, if the Secretary exercises a contractual option by applying the exception \ndescribed in proposed paragraph (g), proposed paragraph (h) requires the Secretary to provide a detailed \nexplanation of the rationale for exercising the option to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the \nHouse of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate.\n\nSection 686.340How are entities selected to receive funding to provide outreach and admission, career transition \nand other operational support services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.340(a) implements sec. 147(a)(2)(A) of WIOA, generally describing the process by which eligible \nentities are selected to provide outreach and admissions, career transition, and other operational support services \nto the Job Corps program.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) requires that the RFP for each support service contract describes uniform specifications \nand standards, as well as specifications and requirements that are unique to the operation of the specific center.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) implements the factors for selection of an entity to provide operational support services, as \nestablished in sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, by specifying that the selection criteria will be established by the \nSecretary and set forth in the RFP. The criteria listed in proposed paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) are the same as \nthose in proposed \u00a7 686.310(c)(1) through (5). Proposed paragraph (c)(6) provides that the Secretary may require \nadditional information or selection factors in the RFP.\n\nSection 686.350What conditions apply to the operation of a Civilian Conservation Center?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.350 is a new section that implements sec. 147(d) of WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a) implements \nsec. 147(d)(1) of WIOA, establishing that the Secretary of Labor may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of \nAgriculture to operate Job Corps centers called CCCs. Paragraph (a) also contains the description of the \ncharacteristics of CCCs.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) retains the language in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.310(e) that when the Secretary \nof Labor enters into an agreement with the Secretary of Agriculture for the funding, establishment, and operation of \nCCCs, provisions are included to ensure that the Department of Agriculture complies with the regulations under this \npart.\n\nProposed paragraph (c), implementing sec. 147(d)(2) of WIOA, permits enrollees in CCCs to provide assistance in \naddressing national, State, and local disasters, consistent with relevant child labor laws. This proposed paragraph \nfurther requires that the Secretary of Agriculture ensure that enrollees are properly trained, equipped, supervised, \nand dispatched consistent with the standards for the conservation and rehabilitation of wildlife established under the \nFish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.).\n\nProposed paragraph (d) requires the Secretary of Agriculture to designate a Job Corps National Liaison to support \nthe agreement between the Departments of Labor and Agriculture to operate CCCs, as required by sec. 147(d)(3) \nof WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) permits the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to select a private \nentity to operate a CCC using the process and requirements described at \u00a7 686.310.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) permits the Secretary to close a CCC as part of the Department's administration of the Job \nCorps program if it determines that such action would be appropriate.\n\nSection 686.360What are the requirements for award of contracts and payments to Federal agencies?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.360 states the requirements and authorities that apply to the award of contracts and payments to \nFederal agencies. This section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.320.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Recruitment, Eligibility, Screening, Selection and Assignment, Enrollment\n\nThis proposed subpart describes who is eligible for Job Corps under WIOA and provides additional factors that are \nconsidered in selecting eligible applicants for enrollment. Also described is how applicants who meet eligibility and \nselection requirements are assigned to centers, which implements WIOA's new requirements that the assignment \nplan consider the size and enrollment level of a center, including the education, training, and supportive services \nprovided, and the performance of the Job Corps center related to the newly established expected levels of \nperformance. WIOA also amends the assignment plan to provide for assignments at the center closest to home that \noffers the type of career and technical training selected by the individual rather than just the center closest to home, \nwhich improves access to high quality training for Job Corps students. These proposed regulations serve to \nenhance the Job Corps program overall by ensuring that the individual training and education needs of applicants \nand enrollees are met in accordance with the requirements of WIOA. They also ensure that applicants and \nenrollees are provided accurate information about the standards and expectations of the Job Corps program and \nare fully prepared to be successful.\n\nSection 686.400Who is eligible to participate in the Job Corps program?\n\nProposed paragraph (a) implements the eligibility requirements in sec. 144(a) of WIOA. According to WIOA, to be \neligible to participate in the Job Corps, an individual must be at least 16 and not more than 24 years old at the time \nof enrollment, except that: Under proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i), the Job Corps Director may waive the maximum age \nlimitation described in paragraph (a)(1) and the requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) for an individual with a disability \nwho is otherwise eligible according to the requirements listed in \u00a7\u00a7 686.400 and 686.410. Proposed paragraph \n(a)(1)(ii) states that not more than 20 percent of individuals enrolled nationwide can be aged 22 to 24 at the time of \nenrollment. The regulatory language in paragraph (a)(1)(i) differs from the language in the WIA regulations at 20 \nCFR 670.400(a)(1). The proposed language is intended to enable the Job Corps Director to admit individuals with \ndisabilities even if they exceed the age limitations in paragraph(a) as long as the Director determines that the \nindividual meets all the other eligibility requirements listed in proposed \u00a7 686.410.\n\nIn addition to satisfying the age requirements above, proposed \u00a7 686.410 lists the additional requirements for a \nperson to be eligible to participate in Job Corps. An individual must also be a low-income individual and be facing \none or more of the following barriers to education and employment: Be basic skills deficient, as defined in WIOA \nsec. 144(a)(3)(A); be a high school dropout; be homeless, as defined in sec. 41043(6) of the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e-2(6)); be a homeless child or youth, as defined in sec. 725(2) of the \nMcKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 1143a(2)); a runaway, an individual in foster care, or an \nindividual who was in foster care and has aged out of the system; be a parent; or require additional education, \ncareer, and technical training, or workforce preparation skills in order to obtain and retain employment that leads to \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) implements the special eligibility rule for veterans in sec. 144(b) of WIOA. That rule states \nthat an otherwise eligible veteran may still enroll in Job Corps if they do not meet the income requirement at \u00a7 \n686.400(a)(2) as a result of military income earned within the 6-month period prior to the individual's application for \nJob Corps, per 38 U.S.C. 4213.\n\nSection 686.410Are there additional factors which are considered in selecting an eligible applicant for enrollment?\n\nIn addition to the basic eligibility requirements identified above, proposed \u00a7 686.410 lists several additional criteria \nthat must be met before an otherwise eligible applicant may be enrolled in Job Corps.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) provides, pursuant to sec. 145(a)(2)(C) of WIOA, that an otherwise eligible applicant can \nbe selected for enrollment in Job Corps only if a determination is made, based on information relating to the \nbackground, needs and interests of the applicant, that the applicant's education and career and technical needs can \nbest be met through the Job Corps program.\n\n\n\nAn additional determination, as described in proposed paragraph (b), implementing sec. 145(b)(1)(A) of WIOA, \nmust also be made that there is a reasonable expectation that the applicant can participate successfully in group \nsituations and activities, and is not likely to: Engage in actions that would potentially prevent other students from \nreceiving the benefit of the program; be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline; or impede \nsatisfactory relationships between the center to which the student is assigned and the surrounding local \ncommunities. These requirements support the vision of Job Corps centers as safe environments with a culture that \nis conducive to student learning and achievement of the academic, technical, and social skills needed to obtain \nemployment or enter post-secondary education.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) requires that an applicant must also be made aware of and understand the center's rules, \nthe consequences for failing to observe the rules, and agree to comply with the rules.\n\nProposed paragraph (d) provides that no one will be denied enrollment in Job Corps solely on the basis of contact \nwith the criminal justice system, except if the individual has been convicted of a felony consisting of murder, child \nabuse, or a crime involving rape or sexual assault, in accordance with secs. 145(b)(2) and (3) of WIOA. All \napplicants must also submit to a background check conducted according to procedures established by the \nSecretary and with applicable State and local laws. If the background check finds that the applicant is on probation, \nparole, under a suspended sentence, or under the supervision of any agency as a result of court action or \ninstitutionalization, the court or appropriate supervising agency may certify in writing that it will approve of the \napplicant's participation in Job Corps, and provide full release from its supervision, and that the applicant's \nparticipation and release does not violate applicable laws and regulations. However, the Department notes that \nalthough these individuals are eligible, the final admission decision remains with the Job Corps.\n\nFinally, proposed paragraph (e) requires that suitable arrangements be made for the care of any dependent \nchildren for the proposed period of enrollment.\n\nSection 686.420Are there any special requirements for enrollment related to the Military Selective Service Act?\n\nAs required by WIOA sec. 146(a), this proposed section requires each male applicant 18 years of age or older, or \na male student who turns 18 years of age, to present evidence that he has complied with sec. 3 of the Military \nSelective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.). These requirements are the same as those found at 20 CFR \n670.420.\n\nSection 686.430What entities conduct outreach and admissions activities for the Job Corps program?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.430 states that the Secretary makes arrangements with outreach and admission agencies to \nperform Job Corps recruitment, screening and admissions functions according to standards and procedures issued \nby the Secretary. Entities eligible to receive funds to provide outreach and admissions service are identified in \u00a7 \n686.300(b).\n\nSection 686.440What are the responsibilities of outreach and admissions providers?\n\nProposed paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section require outreach and admission providers to perform a number of \ntasks to recruit and enroll students, including completing all Job Corps application forms and determining whether \nthe applicants meet the eligibility and selection criteria outlined for participation in the program as provided in \nproposed \u00a7\u00a7 686.400 and 686.410.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) clarifies that the Secretary may require that the National Director or his or her designee \nmake determinations with regard to one or more of the eligibility criteria.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.450.\n\nSection 686.450How are applicants who meet eligibility and selection criteria assigned to centers?\n\nIn accordance with WIOA secs. 145(c) and (d), proposed \u00a7 686.450 describes the process for assigning applicants \nto Job Corps centers.\n\n\n\nApplicants who meet the eligibility and selection requirements of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 686.400 and 686.410 are assigned to \na center based on an assignment plan developed by the Secretary based on an analysis of the factors described in \nproposed paragraph (a). These factors are specified in secs. 145(c) and (d) of WIOA. They are similar to the factors \nfor the assignment plan required to be developed under WIA, except that sec. 145(c)(2)(D) of WIOA also requires \nthe Secretary to consider the performance of the center, as described in proposed \u00a7 686.450(a).\n\nProposed paragraph (b) describes the general rules for assignment of individual enrollees, consistent with sec. \n145(d) of WIOA.\n\nIn accordance with sec. 145(d)(2) of WIOA, and similar to the same requirement in WIA, proposed paragraph (c) \nmandates that if a parent or guardian objects to the assignment ofa student under the age of 18 to a center other \nthan the center closest to home that offers the desired career and technical training, the Secretary must not make \nsuch an assignment.\n\nSection 686.460What restrictions are there on the assignment of eligible applicants for nonresidential enrollment in \nJob Corps?\n\nIn accordance with WIOA sec. 147(c), this proposed section requires that no more than 20 percent of students \nenrolled in Job Corps nationwide may be nonresidential students.\n\nSection 686.470May an individual who is determined to be ineligible or an individual who is denied enrollment \nappeal that decision?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.470(a) describes the process for an applicant to appeal a denial of their application.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that if an applicant believes that he or she has been determined ineligible or not \nselected for enrollment in violation of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions contained in sec. 188 \nof WIOA and at 29 CFR part 37, the individual may file a complaint as described by the nondiscrimination \nregulations at 29 CFR part 37. Finally, proposed paragraph (c) requires that an applicant denied enrollment be \nreferred to the appropriate one-stop center or other service provider as appropriate.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.470.\n\nSection 686.480At what point is an applicant considered to be enrolled in Job Corps?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.480 delineates when an applicant is considered to be enrolled in Job Corps and requires that, \nbased on procedures issued by the Secretary, center operators must document the enrollment of new students.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.480.\n\nSection 686.490How long may a student be enrolled in Job Corps?\n\nThis proposed section implements the requirements in sec. 146(b) of WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a) states the \ngeneral rule that a student may remain enrolled in Job Corps for no more than 2 years.\n\nHowever, proposed paragraph (b) implements four exceptions to this rule, consistent with sec. 146(b) of WIOA, \nwhich permit the 2 years to be extended in specific cases. Paragraph (b)(1) permits the Secretary to extend the 2 \nyear enrollment period in special cases, according to procedures issued by the Secretary. Paragraph (b)(2) permits \nup to a 1 year extension of a student's enrollment in an advanced career training program in order to complete the \nprogram. Paragraph (b)(3) permits an extension for a student with a disability who would reasonably be expected to \nmeet the standards for a Job Corps graduate if allowed to participate in the Job Corps for up to an additional year. \nFinally, proposed paragraph (b)(4) permits a student who participates in national service authorized by a CCC to \nhave his or her enrollment extended for the amount of time equal to the period of national service. This paragraph \n(b)(4) implements sec. 146(a)(3) of WIOA. WIOA also states that students enrolled in CCCs may provide \nassistance in addressing national, State, and local disasters (sec. 147(d)(2) of WIOA; see proposed \u00a7 686.610(a)). \nBoth of these provisions are new in WIOA. Taken together, these provisions show WIOA's added attention to \nensuring that Job Corps students in CCCs have the flexibility to provide assistance, such as fire-fighting, for \nexample, when needed in a disaster. The Department notes that similar to the provision in proposed \u00a7 \n\n\n\n686.490(b)(4) that addresses national service, the Secretary is authorized to extend the enrollment period for \nstudents who perform service to address State and local disasters or other needs under proposed \u00a7 686.490(b)(1).\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Program Activities and Center Operations\n\nThis proposed subpart describes the services and training that a Job Corps center must provide. Job Corps \ndistinguishes itself from other training programs by providing students with residential services in combination with \nhands-on training and experience aligned with industry standards. While education, training, and job placement are \ncore components of what the program offers, this section of the regulations describes how Job Corps provides a \ncomprehensive service model that also includes life skills, emotional development, personal management, and \nresponsibility. New regulations addressing advanced career training programs are included; such programs provide \nbroader opportunities for higher wages and career advancement.\n\nThis proposed subpart also establishes the requirements for a student accountability system and behavior \nmanagement system. Job Corps' policy for violence, drugs, and unauthorized goods is described. Requirements to \nensure students are provided due process in disciplinary actions, to include center fact-finding and review board \nand appeal procedures are outlined. These systems and requirements serve to enhance the Job Corps program by \nensuring that Job Corps centers are safe and secure environments that promote the education and training of \nstudents. Approved experimental, research and demonstration projects related to the Job Corps program are \nauthorized in this proposed subpart, which also serves to enhance the program.\n\nSection 686.500What services must Job Corps centers provide?\n\nProposed paragraph (a) specifies that Job Corps centers must provide an intensive, well-organized and fully \nsupervised program, including training activities, work-based learning and experience, residential support services, \nand other services as required by the Secretary.\n\nProposed paragraph (a)(1) describes training activities to include career and technical training, academic education, \nand employability and independent learning and living skills development. Job Corps is first and foremost a career \ntraining program, and an essential part of preparing enrollees for success upon exit necessitates providing \nemployability, social, and independent-living skills.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) provides that students must be provided with access to career services as described in \nWIOA secs. 134(c)(2)(A)(i) through (xi).\n\nSection 686.505What types of training must Job Corps centers provide?\n\nIn order to provide enrollees with the intensive program of activities required by WIOA, several types of training \nmust be provided by Job Corps centers.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) requires that centers provide students with a CTT program that is aligned with industry-\nrecognized standards and credentials. Ensuring that training programs are aligned with industry standards and \ncredentials better prepares students to attain in-demand, long-term employment; further career enhancement along \na career pathway; or advanced education, including apprenticeships.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) requires that centers provide an education program, including English language \nacquisition programs, as required by sec. 148(a)(1) of WIOA, as well as high school diploma (HSD) or high school \nequivalency certification programs, and academic skills training. These skills are necessary for students to \nmastertechnical skills in their chosen CTT programs.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) states that centers must provide programs for students to learn and practice employability \nand independent learning and living skills. These skills include: Job search and career development, interpersonal \nrelations, driver's education (as required by sec. 148(a)(1) of WIOA), study and critical thinking skills, financial \nliteracy and other skills specified in program guidance issued by the Secretary. Learning these skills will enable \nlong-term labor market attachment and are critical to the continuing success of enrollees after leaving the Job \nCorps program.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (d) requires all Job Corps training programs to be based on industry and academic skills \nstandards leading to recognized industry and academic credentials, applying evidence-based instructional \napproaches, with the goal of placing students in unsubsidized employment in in-demand jobs with career \nadvancement opportunities; enrollment in advanced education and training programs or apprenticeships; or \nenlistment in the Armed Forces. Responsiveness to employers' and industries' needs for employees who are \nprepared with the academic, technical, and employability skills necessary for career success is required in order to \neffectively place students and to sustain Job Corps' relationships with employers.\n\nProposed paragraph (e) requires that specific career and technical training programs offered by individual centers \nmust be approved by the Regional Director. Approval is necessary to ensure that the training provided by Job \nCorps meets industry workforce needs.\n\nProposed paragraph (f) states the responsibilities of the center workforce council in shaping a center's career and \ntechnical training program, as described in \u00a7 686.800.\n\nProposed paragraph (g) retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.505(c), \nrequiring that each center must implement a system to evaluate and track the progress and achievement of each \nstudent at regular intervals.\n\nProposed paragraph (h) states that each center must develop a training plan that must be available for review and \napproval by the appropriate Regional Director. It retains the same requirements as those in 20 CFR 670.505(d).\n\nSection 686.510Are entities other than Job Corps center operators permitted to provide academic and career and \ntechnical training?\n\nProposed paragraph (a) implements sec. 148(b) of WIOA, which lists the entities that the Secretary may use to \nprovide career technical and academic education of Job Corps students, as long as the entity can provide \neducation and training substantially equivalent in cost and quality to that which the Secretary could provide through \nother means.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that these entities will be selected in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 \n686.310.\n\nSection 686.515What are advanced career training programs?\n\nAdvanced career training provides students an opportunity to receive advanced education or training while still \nreceiving the benefits and services provided by Job Corps. In order to be eligible, students must have a HSD or its \nequivalent and have completed a Job Corps CTT program. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) restate the \nrequirements for advanced career training programs in secs. 148(c)(1)-(2) of WIOA.\n\nAdvanced career training programs are authorized by the Secretary based on the relationship between on board \nstrength and training slot availability. Proposed paragraph (c), which restates the requirements found in WIOA sec. \n148(c)(3), permits a center operator to enroll more students than otherwise authorized by the Secretary in an \nadvanced career training program if, in accordance with standards developed by the Secretary, the operator \ndemonstrates that participants in the program have achieved a satisfactory rate of training and placement in \ntraining-related jobs, and for the most recently preceding 2 PYs, the operator has, on average, met or exceeded the \nprimary indicators for eligible youth described in \u00a7 686.980.\n\nSection 686.520What responsibilities do the center operators have in managing work-based learning?\n\nThis section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.515. Proposed \u00a7 \n686.520(a) requires that center operators emphasize and implement work-based learning programs for students \nthrough center program activities, including career and technical skills training, and through arrangements with \nemployers. This paragraph further requires that work-based learning must be under actual working conditions and \nbe designed to enhance the employability, responsibility, and confidence of the students. Work-based learning \nusually occurs in tandem with students' career and technical training, and is intended to develop a further \nunderstanding of career opportunities, employer expectations, and the impact of post-secondary education in the \n\n\n\nworkplace. Work-based learning can include structured, hands-on experiences, as well as workplace tours, \nemployer presentations, and job shadowing to help students refine their career objectives.\n\nProposed paragraph (b), in accordance with sec. 159(g)(2) of WIOA, states that the center operator must ensure \nthat the students are assigned only to workplaces that meet the safety standards described in \u00a7 686.920.\n\nSection 686.525Are students permitted to hold jobs other than work-based learning opportunities?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.525 states that a center operator may authorize a student to participate in gainful leisure time \nemployment, as long as the employment does not interfere with required scheduled academic and CTT activities. \nThis section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.520.\n\nSection 686.530What residential support services must Job Corps center operators provide?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.530 states that Job Corps center operators must provide residential support services according to \nprocedures issued by the Secretary. Residential support services are critical for the success of the Job Corps \nprograms because they are central to creating and maintaining environments that allow enrollees to learn, practice \nindependent and community living skills, promote personal responsibility, and reinforce social and employability \nskills, such as a positive attitude, dependability, and teamwork. This proposed section retains largely the same \nrequirements as those contained in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.525.\n\nThe Department notes that one of the requirements is that a student leadership program and an elected student \ngovernment is supported by the center operator. The goals of student leadership programs are to provide \nopportunities for interested students to develop leadership skills through participation in student governance, \nrepresenting Job Corps in the community at large, planning and leading Job Corps events, and providing input and \nfeedback for centermanagement decisions that impact student services and/or residential living.\n\nSection 686.535Are Job Corps centers required to maintain a student accountability system?\n\nJob Corps centers are required to maintain a student accountability system, as described at proposed \u00a7 686.535. \nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those contained in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n670.530. An accountability system is important to ensure the safety and security of Job Corps students and to track \nparticipation in various activities in order to evaluate program delivery.\n\nSection 686.540Are Job Corps centers required to establish behavior management systems?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.540 states that each Job Corps center must establish and maintain a behavior management \nsystem, based on a behavior management plan, consistent with the standards of conduct and procedures \nestablished by the Secretary. The behavior management plan must be approved by the Job Corps regional office \nand reviewed annually. The system must include Job Corps' zero tolerance policy for violence and drugs as \ndescribed in \u00a7 686.545.\n\nSection 686.545What is Job Corps' zero tolerance policy?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.545(a) requires all center operators to comply with Job Corps' zero tolerance policy as established \nby the Secretary. Infractions addressed in the zero tolerance policy must include, but are not limited to: Actions of \nviolence, as defined by the Secretary; use, sale, or possession of a controlled substance, as defined at 21 U.S.C. \n802; abuse of alcohol; possession of unauthorized goods; or other illegal or disruptive activity.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) implements secs. 145(a)(2)(A) and 152(b)(2) of WIOA, providing that all students must be \ntested for drugs as a condition of enrollment.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) provides that the zero tolerance policy established by the Secretary specifies the offenses \nthat will result in the separation of students from the Job Corps. This paragraph further provides that the center \ndirector is expressly responsible for determining when such an offense has occurred.\n\nSection 686.550How does Job Corps ensure that students receive due process in disciplinary actions?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.550 provides that a center operator must ensure that all students receive due process in \ndisciplinary proceedings according to procedures developed by the Secretary. This proposed section retains the \nsame requirements as those contained in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.545.\n\nSection 686.555What responsibilities do Job Corps centers have in assisting students with child care needs?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.555 implements the requirement in sec. 148(e) of WIOA that the Secretary provide for child care to \nthe extent practicable. Proposed paragraph (a) encourages Job Corps centers to coordinate with outreach and \nadmissions agencies to assist applicants, whenever feasible, with making arrangements for child care. This \nparagraph also requires that, prior to enrollment, a program applicant with dependent children who provides \nprimary or custodial care must certify that suitable arrangements for child care have been established for the \nproposed period of enrollment. This is necessary to ensure full program participation once a student is enrolled.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that a child development program may be located at a Job Corps center with the \napproval of the Secretary.\n\nSection 686.560What are the center's responsibilities in ensuring that students' religious rights are respected?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.560 retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.555.\n\nSection 686.565Is Job Corps authorized to conduct pilot and demonstration projects?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.565(a) establishes that the Secretary may undertake experimental, research and demonstration \nprojects related to the Job Corps program as long as the projects are developed, approved, and conducted in \naccordance with the policies and procedures developed by the Secretary, in accordance with sec. 156(a) of WIOA.\n\n7. Subpart F\u2014Student Support\n\nProposed subpart F discusses the support services provided to Job Corps enrollees, including transportation to and \nfrom Job Corps centers, authorized student leave, allowances and performance bonuses, and student clothing. In \naddition to being eligible to receive transportation to and from Job Corps centers, students are eligible for other \nbenefits, including basic living allowances to cover personal expenses, in accordance with guidance issued by the \nSecretary. Students are also provided with a modest clothing allowance to enable them to purchase clothes that are \nappropriate for the classroom and the workplace. These proposed regulations again work to strengthen the Job \nCorps program and provide access to high quality training by ensuring that Job Corps students are placed in the \nbest possible position to prepare them for learning, and that they are rewarded for their success in the program.\n\nSection 686.600Are students provided with government-paid transportation to and from Job Corps centers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.600 states that Job Corps provides students with transportation to and from Job Corps centers, \naccording to policies and procedures established by the Secretary. This section retains the same requirements as \nthose in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.600.\n\nSection 686.610When are students authorized to take leaves of absence from their Job Corps centers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.610 provides that Job Corps students are eligible for annual leave, emergency leave, and other \ntypes of leaves of absence from their assigned centers. Procedures for requesting, approving, and recording \nstudent leave will be based on criteria and requirements issued by the Secretary. This section retains the same \nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.610. Additionally, proposed \u00a7 686.600(a) states that in \naccordance with sec. 147(d)(2) of WIOA, enrollees in CCCs may take leave to provide assistance in addressing \nnational, State, and local disasters.\n\nSection 686.620Are Job Corps students eligible to receive cash allowances and performance bonuses?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.620(a) allows, based on criteria and rates established by the Secretary, Job Corps students to \nreceive cash living allowances, performance bonuses, and allotments for care of dependents. Also, graduates \nreceive post-separation transition allowances according to proposed \u00a7 686.750. This paragraph largely retains the \nsame requirements in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.620(a), but revises the description of the payments to \nalign with sec. 150(b) of WIOA.\n\n\n\nUnder proposed paragraph (b), in the case of a student's death, any amount due is to be paid according to 5 U.S.C. \n5582, governing issues including designation of a beneficiary, order of precedent, and related matters. This \nparagraph retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.620(b).\n\nSection 686.630Are student allowances subject to Federal payroll taxes?\n\nAs required by sec. 157(a)(2) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 686.630 requires that Job Corps student allowances be \nsubject to Federal payroll tax withholding and Social Security taxes. For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 and title II of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), enrollees are deemed to be employees of the United States.\n\nSection 686.640Are students provided with clothing?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.640 provides that, according to rates, criteria, and procedures issued by the Secretary, center \noperators and other service providers must provide Job Corps students with a clothing allowance and/or articles of \nclothing as needed to facilitate their participation in Job Corps and successful entry into the workforce. This \nproposed section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.640.\n\n8. Subpart G\u2014Career Transition and Graduate Services\n\nThis proposed subpart discusses career transition and graduate services for Job Corps enrollees. Job Corps \nfocuses on placing program graduates in full time jobs, post-secondary education, advanced training programs, \nincluding apprenticeship programs, or the Armed Forces. In an effort to further integrate the Job Corps program \nwith the greater workforce system and align it with the core programs, proposed \u00a7 686.820 specifically focuses on \nhow Job Corps will coordinate with other agencies, where emphasis is placed on utilizing the one-stop delivery \nsystem to the maximum extent practicable. This proposed subpart also outlines a center's responsibilities in \npreparing students for career transition services; the career transition services that are provided for enrollees; who \nm6ay provide career transition and graduate services, in addition to one-stop centers; and services provided for \ngraduates and former enrollees.\n\nSection 686.700What are a Job Corps center's responsibilities in preparing students for career transition services?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.700 implements sec. 149(a) of WIOA, providing that Job Corps centers assess and counsel \nenrollees to determine their competencies and capabilities and readiness for career transition services prior to their \nscheduled graduation. The purpose of counseling and assessment is to determine students' capabilities to allow \nthem to either be placed into employment leading to self-sufficiency based on their training, or to assist the student \nin participating in further activities leading to the capabilities necessary for placement.\n\nSection 686.710What career transition services are provided for Job Corps enrollees?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.710 implements sec. 149(b) of WIOA, requiring that career transition services focus on placing \nprogram graduates in full time jobs that are related to their career and technical training and that lead to economic \nself-sufficiency; higher education; advanced training programs, including apprenticeship programs; or the Armed \nForces.\n\nSection 686.720Who provides career transition services?\n\nAs required by sec. 149(b) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 686.720 states that the one-stop delivery system must be used to \nthe maximum extent practicable in placing graduates and former enrollees in jobs. Multiple other resources can also \nprovide post-program services, including, but not limited to, Job Corps career transition service providers and State \nVR agencies for individuals with disabilities.\n\nSection 686.730What are the responsibilities of career transition service providers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.730 contains the responsibilities of career transition service providers. The section largely retains \nthe same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.730.\n\nSection 686.740What services are provided for program graduates?\n\nAs required by sec. 148(d) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 686.740 states that career transition and support services must \nbe provided to program graduates for up to 12 months after graduation, according to procedures issued by the \nSecretary.\n\n\n\nSection 686.750Are graduates provided with transition allowances?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.750 states that Job Corps graduates receive post-separation transition allowances. As required \nby sec. 150(b) of WIOA, the transition allowance must be incentive-based to reflect a graduate's completion of \nacademic, career, and technical education or training, and attainment of recognized post-secondary credentials.\n\nSection 686.760What services are provided to former enrollees?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.760(a) implements sec. 150(c) of WIOA, allowing for the provision of 3 months of ESs to former \nenrollees.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that Job Corps centers may provide other assessment, counseling, or career \ntransition services to help former enrollees find and retain employment, if determined appropriate, according to \nprocedures issued by the Secretary.\n\n9. Subpart H\u2014Community Connections\n\nThis proposed subpart highlights WIOA's focus on community relationships and further integration with the \nworkforce system. In both the new contracting provisions in proposed subpart C and in this subpart, there is more \nemphasis on connections with one-stops, Local Boards, and State and local plans. While WIA's requirement for a \nBusiness and Community Liaison has been eliminated, the responsibility for establishing beneficial business and \ncommunity relationships and networks now lies with the director of each Job Corps center. Moreover, WIOA \ncontains a new requirement that in a single-State local area, a representative of the State Board must be included \non the workforce council. Proposed \u00a7 686.810 also states, consistent with sec. 154(b)(2) of WIOA, that the \nworkforce council may include employers from outside the local area that are likely to hire center graduates. The \nnew requirements for the workforce council seek to provide greater access to high quality training for Job Corps \nstudents, in part by ensuring that Job Corps is providing training in in-demand industry sectors and occupations.\n\nSection 686.800How do Job Corps centers and service providers become involved in their local communities?\n\nWhile WIA's requirement for a Business and Community Liaison designated by the director of each center has been \neliminated, the director of each Job Corps center must still ensure that mutually beneficial business and community \nrelationships and networks are established and developed. As required by sec. 153 of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 \n686.800(a) states that each Job Corps center director must establish relationships with local and distant \nemployers; applicable one-stop centers and Local Boards; entities carrying out relevant apprenticeship programs \nand youth programs; labor-management organizations and local labor organizations; employers and contractors \nthat support national training programs and initiatives; and CBOs, non-profit organizations, and intermediaries \nproviding workforce development and support services. Through these relationships, Job Corpshopes to improve \nthe quality of the training programs that it offers and create meaningful associations with other entities with which it \ninteracts and shares similar goals.\n\nUnder proposed paragraph (b), each Job Corps center must also establish and develop relationships with members \nof the community in which it is located. This paragraph further proposes that members of the community be \ninformed of projects of the center and changes in the rules, procedures, or activities of the center that may affect \nthe community. Through these efforts, Job Corps aims to garner the support and endorsement of the local \ncommunity.\n\nSection 686.810What is the makeup of a workforce council and what are its responsibilities?\n\nSection 154 of WIOA requires each center to establish a workforce council according to procedures established by \nthe Secretary. Proposed \u00a7 686.810 implements this provision. It specifies that the council must include: non-\ngovernmental and private sector employers; representatives of labor organizations and employees; Job Corps \nenrollees and graduates; and, in the case of a single State local area, a representative of the State Board.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) describes the composition of the workforce council, consistent with the requirements of \nsec. 154(b) of WIOA.\n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (c) states that the workforce council may also include, or otherwise provide for consultation \nwith, employers from outside the local area who are likely to hire a significant number of enrollees from the Job \nCorps center.\n\nProposed paragraph (d)(1) implements sec. 154(c)(1) of WIOA by identifying that the first responsibility of the \nworkforce council is to work with all applicable Local Boards and review labor market information to determine and \nprovide recommendations to the Secretary regarding the center's career and technical training offerings, including \nidentifying the emerging occupations suitable for training. In doing so, Job Corps hopes to remain current in its CTT \nofferings, adjusting and supplementing its training offerings based on the needs of industry in the surrounding \ncommunities.\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.810(d)(2) and (3) state the remaining duties of the workforce council, in accordance with secs. \n154(c)(2)-(3) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.820How will Job Corps coordinate with other agencies?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.820 describes how Job Corps coordinates with other agencies. This section retains the same \nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.760 and 20 CFR 670.800(g). Paragraph (b) of this \nsection describes the linkages required between Job Corps and the one-stop service system and paragraph (c) \nindicates that Job Corps is identified as a required one-stop partner. The Department notes that in addition to these \nlinkages, similar to the requirement in WIA, proposed \u00a7 678.400 identifies Job Corps as a required one-stop \npartner, as required by sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) of WIOA. Additionally, similar to the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n670.800(g), proposed \u00a7 678.415 specifies that the Job Corps center is the Job Corps \u201centity\u201d that is required to \nserve as the one-stop partner in any local area where a center exists. Job Corps centers are encouraged to review \nthe requirements of one-stop partners described in subpart B of part 678 of these proposed regulations.\n\n10. Subpart I\u2014Administrative and Management Provisions\n\nThe proposed subpart provides requirements relating to tort claims, Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) \nbenefits for students, safety and health, and law enforcement jurisdiction on Job Corps center property. It also \naddresses whether Job Corp operators and service providers are authorized to pay State or local taxes on gross \nreceipts, and details the financial management responsibilities of center operators and other service providers. The \nmanagement of student records, as well as procedures applicable to the disclosure of information about Job Corps \nstudents and program activities are outlined. Finally, procedures available to resolve complaints and disputes, and \nhow Job Corps ensures that complaints or disputes are resolved in a timely fashion, are addressed. The entirety of \nthis proposed subpart addressing administrative and management principles that apply to the operation of the Job \nCorps program serves to promote its accountability and transparency.\n\nSection 686.900Are damages caused by the acts or omissions of students eligible for payment under the Federal \nTort Claims Act?\n\nIn accordance with sec. 157(a)(4) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 686.900 states that students are considered Federal \nemployees for purposes of the FTCA (28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq.) and that claims for such damage must be filed \npursuant to the procedures found in 29 CFR part 15, subpart D. This proposed section retains the same \nrequirements as those found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.900.\n\nSection 686.905Are loss and damages that occur to persons or personal property of students at Job Corps centers \neligible for reimbursement?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.905 states that the Job Corps program may pay students for valid claims under the procedures \nfound in 29 CFR part 15, subpart D. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n670.905.\n\nSection 686.910If a student is injured in the performance of duty as a Job Corps student, what benefits may the \nstudent receive?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.910 implements sec. 157(a)(3) of WIOA. Paragraph (a) states that Job Corps students are \nconsidered Federal employees for purposes of the FECA, as specified in sec. 157(a)(3) of WIOA (29 U.S.C. 2897). \n\n\n\nProposed paragraphs (b) through (d) outline the requirements for Job Corps students' eligibility for FECA benefits \nand the procedures by which the benefits are paid. These paragraphs contain the same requirements as those in \u00a7 \n670.910 of the WIA regulations.\n\nSection 686.915When is a Job Corps student considered to be in the performance of duty?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.915 outlines when a Job Corps student is considered to be in the performance of duty. This \nproposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.915.\n\nSection 686.920How are students protected from unsafe or unhealthy situations?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.920(a) states that the Secretary will establish procedures to ensure that students are not required \nor permitted to work, be trained, reside in, or receive services in buildings or surroundings or under conditions that \nare unsanitary or hazardous. This section further states, consistent with sec. 159(g)(2) of WIOA, that whenever \nstudents are employed or in training for jobs, they must be assigned only to jobs or training which observe \napplicable Federal, State, and local health and safety standards. This proposed paragraph retains the same \nrequirements found at 20 CFR 670.935.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that the Secretary will develop procedures to ensure compliance with applicable \nDOL Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and Wage and Hour Division (WHD) \nregulations.\n\nSection 686.925What are the requirements for criminal law enforcement jurisdiction on center property?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.925 provides information about criminal law enforcement jurisdiction on Job Corps center property. \nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.940.\n\nSection 686.930Are Job Corps operators and service providers authorized to pay State or local taxes on gross \nreceipts?\n\nConsistent with sec. 158(d) of WIOA, proposed \u00a7 686.930 explains some of the tax liabilities that apply to Job \nCorps center operators.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.945.\n\nSection 686.935What are the financial management responsibilities of Job Corps center operators and other \nservice providers?\n\nAs required by WIOA sec. 159(a), proposed \u00a7 686.935 states the financial management responsibilities that apply \nto Job Corps center operators and other service providers.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.950.\n\nSection 686.940Are center operators and service providers subject to Federal audits?\n\nAs required by WIOA sec. 159(b), proposed \u00a7 686.940 explains how Job Corps center operators and other service \nproviders are subject to Federal audits.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.955.\n\nSection 686.945What are the procedures for management of student records?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.945 states that the Secretary will issue guidelines for a system for maintaining records for each \nstudent during enrollment and for disposition of records after separation.

This proposed section retains the same \nrequirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.993.\n\nSection 686.980How does Job Corps resolve disputes between the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture regarding the operation of Civilian Conservation Centers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.980 states that disputes between the Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nregarding operating a center will be handled according to the interagency agreement between the two agencies. \nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.994.\n\nSection 686.985What Department of Labor equal opportunity and nondiscrimination regulations apply to Job \nCorps?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.985 states that nondiscrimination requirements, procedures, complaint processing, and \ncompliance reviews would be governed by provisions of the Department's regulations, as applicable. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.995.\n\n11. Subpart J\u2014Performance\n\nProposed subpart J incorporates WIOA-specific requirements related to performance assessment and \naccountability, as well as requirements for performance improvement plans for Job Corps center operators who fail \nto meet expected levels of performance. The Job Corps program is now required to report on the performance \nindicators common to all WIOA programs that provide key employment information on how many students entered \nand retained employment, their median wages, whether they attained credentials, their measurable skills gains, and \neffectiveness of services to employers. The entirety of this proposed subpart serves to promote the accountability, \nperformance, and transparency of the Job Corps program.\n\nSection 686.1000How is the performance of the Job Corps program assessed?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1000 describes the performance management system the Secretary will establish to meet the \nrequirements for management information in sec. 159 of WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) indicates that the performance of the Job Corps program as a whole, and the performance \nof individual centers, outreach and admission providers, and career transition service providers, will be assessed in \naccordance with required procedures and standards issued by the Secretary, through a nationalperformance \nmanagement system described in proposed paragraph (b) that includes the Outcome Measurement System (OMS). \nThe Department proposes to continue its use of a national performance management system that includes the \nOMS because such a system is needed to track and report all of the management information required in sec. 159 \nof WIOA. The management information requirements include establishing expected levels of performance and \ncollecting and reporting data on each center's performance relating to the primary indicators of performance for \neligible youth, the performance indicators for outreach and admission providers, and the performance indicators for \ncareer transition service providers required under WIOA sec. 159(c); collecting and reporting data on each center's \nperformance relating to the additional information required to be submitted in the annual report to Congress under \nsec. 159(d) of WIOA; collecting and reporting information regarding the state of Job Corps buildings and facilities \nunder sec. 159(h) of WIOA; and collecting and reporting information regarding national and community service \nactivities of enrollees under sec. 159(i) of WIOA.\n\nConsistent with current practice, proposed paragraph (b) states that the performance management system will \ninclude measures that reflect not only the primary indicators of performance described in proposed \u00a7 686.1010, but \nalso the information needed to complete the Annual Report described in proposed \u00a7 686.1040, as well as any other \ninformation the Secretary determines is necessary to manage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps \nprogram.\n\nJob Corps' performance management system, which includes the OMS, is a well-established measurement system \nwithin the Job Corps community that has been used to track performance of centers and service providers for many \nyears. It will be updated to reflect the new requirements of WIOA, including the new primary indicators of \nperformance. The performance management system is designed to provide the Secretary with the information \nnecessary to manage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps program. It currently includes data on the \nWIA common measures, each center's success in filling student slots or on-board strength (OBS), information on \nthe results of Regional Office Center Assessments, and the OMS.\n\nThe OMS currently includes the following 15 measures: HSD or General Educational Development (GED) \nAttainment Rate, CTT Completion Rate, Combination HSD or GED, and CTT Attainment Rate, Average Literacy \nGain, Average Numeracy Gain, CTT Industry-Recognized Credential Attainment Rate, CTT Completer Job-Training \nMatch/Post-secondary Credit Placement Rate, Former Enrollee Initial Placement Rate, Graduate Initial Placement \nRate, Graduate Average Hourly Wage at Placement, Graduate Full-Time Job Placement Rate, Graduate 6-Month \nFollow-up Placement Rate, Graduate 6-Month Average Weekly Earnings, Graduate 12-Month Follow-up Placement \nRate, and Graduate 12-Month Follow-up Weekly Earnings. These measures are based on the current performance \nrequirements under WIA, and in some cases break down an overarching measure to provide a more detailed look \nat elements that make up the overarching measures. For example, one of the WIA common measures is the \npercent of students who achieve literacy or numeracy gains. In the OMS, literacy gains and numeracy gains are \nbroken into two separate measures that provide program managers with an additional level of detail. A center may \nbe achieving a high level of literacy gains but lagging in numeracy gains. In the combined measure that distinction \nwould be hidden, but with the broken out measure, program managers can more specifically identify where to target \ninterventions to support achievement of the overall common measure. Similarly, the OMS will be updated to reflect \nthe primary indicators, but may also include breakouts of data that will help program managers target interventions \nin order to achieve the primary indicators.\n\nFour of the new primary indicators of performance under WIOA are long-term measures, meaning that the point of \nmeasurement is as much as a year after a student exits the Job Corps program. These measures are valuable in \nassessing the performance of the program, but additional shorter-term measures are needed to supplement the \nprimary indicators and provide program managers with information on a quicker cycle that can be used to make \nadjustments in the program on a faster timeframe. This includes measures such as the CTT completion rate, which \n\n\n\nprovides useful information about the quality of the training programs at a center without waiting for the student \noutcome data to become fully available. When updating the OMS, the Department will begin to incorporate the \nprimary indicators and other measures that will drive the system towards attainment of the WIOA primary indicators, \nwhile still maintaining other shorter-term measures that will provide additional information that the Secretary \nbelieves is necessary to manage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps program. The Department \nwelcomes comments on this approach, and specifically on which short-term measures should be maintained in the \nnew OMS system.\n\nOver the years as program reporting requirements have changed from the Government Performance and Results \nAct (GPRA), the Program Assessment and Rating Tool (PART), and Common Measures, the OMS has proven to \nbe flexible and through its mix of measures, goals, and weights, and successful in driving the system towards \nmeeting changing priorities. For example, when additional emphasis was placed on longer term attachment to the \nworkforce, Job Corps added 12-month placement and 12-month earnings to the existing line-up of measures \nincluded on the OMS as a clear indication to program operators of the new priority. Similarly, beginning in PY 2016, \nthe OMS will be updated to reflect the new primary indicators of performance under WIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) also indicates that the Secretary will issue annual guidance describing the performance \nmanagement system and OMS. This guidance will describe any changes or updates to the overall performance \nmanagement system or the OMS and also communicate the expected levels of performance for each indicator for \neach center, outreach and admission provider, and career transition service provider described in \u00a7 686.1030 to the \nsystem.\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1000(c), implementing sec. 159(f)(1) of WIOA, indicates that annual performance assessments \nbased on the measures referenced in proposed paragraph (b) will be done for each center operator and other \nservice providers, including outreach and admission providers and career transition providers. These annual \nassessments will include a review of the data in the OMS, a calculation of the annual performance ranking as \ndescribed in proposed \u00a7 686.1070, and an analysis of the operator or service provider's success at meeting the \nexpected levels of performance, including consideration of any factors influencing the performance outcomes such \nas disruption in the operations of the center, economic conditions, or other factors.\n\nSection 686.1010What are the primary indicators of performance for Job Corps centers and the Job Corps \nprogram?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1010 implements WIOA sec. 159(c)(1), which requires the use of the primary indicators of \nperformance for eligible youth as described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA for the Job Corps program and each \ncenter. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (f) are the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth as \ndescribed in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA. These measures of performance are the same as the primary indicators \ndiscussed in proposed \u00a7 677.155. Though the indicators of performance are identified in various places throughout \nthe WIOA proposed regulations, the indicators are the same and do not vary across the regulations.\n\nSection 686.1020What are the indicators of performance for Job Corps outreach and admissions providers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1020 implements sec. 159(c)(2) of WIOA, which requires that the Secretary establish performance \nindicators and expected levels of performance on those indicators for recruitment service providers serving the Job \nCorps program. The performance management system and OMS will be updated to reflect the new performance \nmeasures for Job Corps outreach and admissions providers. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (d) are the \nindicators of performance as provided in sec. 159(c)(2) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.1030What are the indicators of performance for Job Corps career transition service providers?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1030 implements sec. 159(c)(3) of WIOA, which requires that the Secretary establish performance \nindicators and expected levels of performance on those indicators for career transition service providers serving the \nJob Corps program. The performance management system and OMS will be updated to reflect the new \nperformance measures for Job Corps Career Transition Service providers. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (g) are \nthe indicators of performance as provided in sec. 159(c)(3) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.1040What information will be collected for use in the Annual Report?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1040 implements sec. 159(c)(4) of WIOA, which requires the Secretary to collect information and \nsubmit an Annual Report on the performance of each Job Corps center and the Job Corps program. The \nDepartment is including this proposed section so that the Job Corps community is made aware of the information \nthat will be collected. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (p) specify the information required to be included by secs. \n159(c)(4)(A)-(B) and 159(d)(1)(A)-(N) of WIOA. Proposed paragraph (q) reflects the information required to be \nincluded by sec. 159(h) of WIOA, and proposed paragraph (r) reflects the information required by sec. 159(i) of \nWIOA.\n\nProposed paragraph (s) states that the Secretary may collect and include additional information in the Annual \nReport that the Secretary determines is necessary. Any such information would be collected as part of the \nperformance management system and identified in the annual guidance described in \u00a7 686.1000.\n\nSection 686.1050How are the expected levels of performance for Job Corps centers, outreach and admission \nproviders and career transition service providers established?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1050(a) implements secs. 159(c)(1)-(3) of WIOA, which require that the Secretary establish \nexpected levels of performance for Job Corps centers, outreach and admission providers, and career transition \nservice providers, and the Job Corps program relating to each of the primary indicators of performance described in \n\u00a7\u00a7 686.1010, 686.1020 and 686.1030. In order to develop expected levels of performance for the primary \nindicators, the Department will first examine past performance specific to the new measures. Since several of the \nemployment-related indicators are intended to utilize State wage records, this will involve a process of developing \nquarterly earnings specifications as well as developing an infrastructure to align WRIS data with Job Corps survey \ndata at the center level. Expected levels of performance can more readily be developed for the credential \nattainment and skill gains indicators using past performance aligned to the timeframes required by WIOA. Job \nCorps will also continue to use a regression model to statistically adjust for local economic conditions and \nparticipant characteristics at the center level similar to regression models used for other programs under WIOA. The \nDepartment anticipates that after implementation of the new primary indicators, there will be a period of at least 1 \nPY where baseline data are collected on each of the primary indicators and there is no expected level of \nperformance in place. Once baseline data has been collected, the Department will begin to establish expected \nlevels of performance.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) states that as provided in \u00a7 686.1000, the Secretary will issue annual guidance describing \nthe national performance management system. This guidance will also communicate the expected levels of \nperformance for each center and each indicator of performance for each outreach and admissions provider and \neach career transition service provider. This guidance will also describe how the expected levels of performance \nwere calculated.\n\nSection 686.1070How are center rankings established?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1070(a) states that the Secretary will calculate the annual rankings of center performance based \non the performance management system described in proposed \u00a7 686.1000. As described above in the explanation \nof proposed \u00a7 686.1000, Job Corps' OMS is a well-established measurement system within the Job Corps \ncommunity that has been used to track performance of centers and service providers for many years, and it will be \nupdated to reflect the new requirements of WIOA, including the new primary indicators of performance. It is \ndesigned to drive the system to meet programmatic goals, which under WIOA will be established through the \nprimary indicators of performance. As described above, the OMS will be updated to reflect the primary indicators of \nperformance and may also include other measures that will drive the system towards attainment of the primary \nindicators or that provide more detailed information about elements that make up the primary indictors that the \nSecretary believes are necessary to manage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps program.\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1070(b) states that the Secretary will issue annual guidance that communicates the methodology \nfor calculating the performance rankings for the year. This guidance will include any changes in the weighting of \nindividual measures in the calculation. The Department expects to weigh measures reflecting the attainment of the \nprimary indicators most heavily. However, the Department anticipates that there could be changes in weighting from \nyear to year to address areas of concentration in the program. For example, if the Department's analysis of past \n\n\n\nyears' data regarding the system's results on the primary indicator related to measurable skills gains indicates that \nstudents are achieving high levels of literacy gains but lagging on numeracy gains, the Department may increase \nthe weighting of the OMS measure on numeracy gains to signal to operators that they need to put more emphasis \non improving numeracy. The expected result wouldbe that the increased focus on numeracy would lead to \nimproved numeracy gains and a commensurate increase in the primary indicator related to measurable skills gains. \nThe center rankings will reflect these efforts to push the system to continuous improvement of outcomes.\n\nSection 686.1070How and when will the Secretary use Performance Improvement Plans?\n\nProposed \u00a7 686.1070 implements sec. 159(f)(2) of WIOA, which sets out requirements for the circumstances under \nwhich the Secretary will use Performance Improvement Plans.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) provides that the Secretary will establish standards and procedures for developing and \nimplementing performance improvement plans. Paragraph (a)(1) implements the requirement in sec. 159(f)(2) of \nWIOA, that when a center fails to meet expected levels of performance, the Secretary must develop and implement \na performance improvement plan designed to help the center improve its performance outcomes. Paragraph \n(a)(1)(i) establishes standards for when the Secretary will consider a center to have failed to meet the expected \nlevels of performance on the primary indicators. The proposed paragraph states that a center will have failed to \nmeet the expected levels of performance if the center is ranked among the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers \nand the center fails to achieve an average of 90 percent of the expected level of performance for all of the primary \nindicators. This is consistent with the methodology used to determine whether States have failed to meet the \nexpected levels of performance on other programs under WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii) establishes \nstandards for when the Secretary will consider a center to have failed to meet the expected levels of performance \non the primary indicators for PYs that occur prior to the implementation of the expected levels of performance on \nthe primary indicators. The paragraph states that a center will have failed to meet the expected levels of \nperformance if it is ranked among the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers and the center's composite OMS \nscore for the PY is 88 percent or less of the year's OMS national average. This proposal is consistent with the Job \nCorps Performance Improvement Plan system planned for implementation in early 2015.\n\nProposed paragraph (a)(2) implements sec. 159(f)(3) of WIOA, which states that the Secretary may also develop \nand implement additional performance improvement plans that will require improvements for a Job Corps center \nthat fails to meet criteria established by the Secretary other than the expected levels of performance. The \nDepartment expects to outline requirements for any such plans through subsequent guidance.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) implements the requirement in sec. 159(f)(2) of WIOA that the performance improvement \nplan require that action under the plan must be taken within 1 year of its implementation to address the issues that \nled to the center's failure to meet its expected levels of performance. The paragraph states that the plan will identify \ncriteria that must be met for the center to complete the performance improvement plan. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) \nprovides that the center operator must implement the actions outlined in the performance improvement plan. \nProposed paragraph (b)(2) provides that if the center fails to take the steps outlined in the performance \nimprovement plan or fails to meet the criteria established to complete the performance improvement plan after 1 \nyear, the center will be considered to have failed to improve performance under a performance improvement plan \ndetailed in paragraph (a). In that case, the center will remain on a performance improvement plan and the Secretary \nwill take action as described in proposed paragraph (c). Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) implements sec. 159(f)(4) of WIOA, \nwhich provides that if a CCC fails to meet expected levels of performance relating to the primary indicators of \nperformance specified in proposed \u00a7 686.1010, or fails to improve performance under a performance improvement \nplan detailed in paragraph (a) after 3 PYs, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must \nselect an entity to operate the CCC on a competitive basis. Such competition will be held in accordance with the \nrequirements at proposed \u00a7 686.310.\n\nProposed paragraph (c) implements secs. 159(f)(2)(A) through 159(f)(2)(G) of WIOA, which permit the Secretary to \ntake specific actions to improve the performance of a center, as necessary. These requirements are taken directly \nfrom the statute and this proposed paragraph retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 \nCFR 670.985. The Department notes that nothing in the statute or in these proposed regulations requires that the \nperformance improvement actions be taken in any particular order or on a progressive basis. The Secretary will \n\n\n\ntake any of the measures listed in sec. 159(f)(2) of WIOA that will lead to improving performance of a center. \nAmong these measures, the Secretary also reserves the right to close low-performing centers, pursuant to WIOA \nsec. 159(f)(2)(G).\n\nK. Part 687\u2014National Dislocated Worker Grants\n\nProposed part 687 implements provisions in sec. 170 of WIOA that authorize the Secretary to award discretionary \nfunds to serve dislocated workers and other eligible individuals affected by major economic dislocations, \nemergencies, or disasters. The proposed regulations set forth the key elements and requirements for the statute's \nNDWGs. Additional guidance on NDWGs and the application requirements for these grants will be published \nseparately.\n\nThe proposed regulations establish a framework that will enable eligible applicants to apply quickly for grants to \nrelieve the impact of layoffs, emergencies, and disasters on employment in the impacted area and to meet the \ntraining and reemployment needs of affected workers and to enable them to obtain new jobs as quickly as \npossible. The proposed regulations call for early assessment of the needs and interests of the affected workers, \nthrough either rapid response activities, or other means, as well as an indication of the other resources available to \nmeet these needs, to aid in the creation of a customer-centered service proposal. The early collection of information \nabout affected workers will allow applicants to have an understanding of the needs and interests of the impacted \nworkers to enable a prompt application for the appropriate level of NDWG funds. Early collection of information \nalso will facilitate the receipt of NDWG funds when the Secretary determines that there are insufficient State and \nlocal formula funds available. Early intervention to assist workers being dislocated is critical to enable them to \naccess work-based learning opportunities and other types of training that lead to industry-recognized credentials, as \nappropriate, to help them find new employment in in-demand industries and occupations as soon as possible after \ntheir dislocation occurs.\n\nSection 687.100What are the types and purposes of national disclosed worker grants the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.100 describes the purpose of NDWGs, expanding upon the description provided in the WIA \nregulations at 20 CFR 671.100. Regular NDWGs provide career services for dislocated workers and other \neligiblepopulations where demand is unable to be met with formula funds or other sources. Disaster NDWGs, which \nwere originally authorized under WIA to conduct clean-up and humanitarian assistance, are still authorized under \nWIOA; however, WIOA expands their availability by adding new qualifying events for Disaster NDWGs, such as \nserving workers who have relocated from an area in which a disaster has been declared, as discussed in \u00a7\u00a7 \n687.110(b) and 687.180(b).\n\nSection 687.110What are major economic dislocations or other events which may qualify for a national dislocated \nworker grant?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.110 describes the events that qualify for NDWG funding. Proposed \u00a7 687.110(a)(1) through (3) \ninclude substantially similar provisions to those that were contained in the WIA regulations; however, the terms \n\u201csingle site of employment\u201d and \u201cin a single local community,\u201d which had been used to qualify the types of eligible \nlayoff events, are not included in the proposed section. Experience under WIA has shown that a company's total \nnumber of layoffs affects the local and regional economy in the same way without regard to whether the layoffs \noccur at a single facility or at multiple locations. Proposed \u00a7 687.110(a)(4) describes a qualifying event added by \nsec. 170(b)(1)(D)(i) of WIOA, permitting the award of a NDWG when a higher than average demand for \nemployment and training activities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces, dislocated spouses of members of \nthe Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(d)(1)), or members of the Armed Forces described in \nproposed \u00a7 687.170(a)(1)(iii), exceeds State and local resources. Section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) of WIOA specifically limits \nthe military spouses included in this analysis to \u201cspouses described in sec. 3(15)(E) [of WIOA].\u201d Under sec. 3(15)(E) \nof WIOA, these are spouses of members of the Armed Forces on active duty who are dislocated specifically \nbecause they have experienced a loss of employment as a direct result of relocation to accommodate a permanent \nchange in duty station of the member of the military, or are unemployed or underemployed and experiencing \n\n\n\ndifficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment. Implementing this exactly as stated in the statute would require \napplicants for these NDWGs to determine whether a specific subset of dislocated military spouses is driving the \nhigher than average demand for services in an area. This would cause an unnecessary burden on the NDWG \napplicants, and instead proposed \u00a7 687.110(a)(4) would only require applicants for these NDWGs to assess \nwhether military spouses who are dislocated under any of the factors in sec. 3(15) of WIOA are contributing to the \nhigher than average demand for services. The proposed provision also specifies that these spouses must be \nspouses of members of the Armed Forces on active duty, which implements the intent of this provision of WIOA \nwhile avoiding the unnecessary administrative hardship. The Department intends to provide additional guidance \nabout how higher than average demand will be defined for purposes of this section. The Department is exploring \ndefinitions that may include veterans' unemployment in excess of the State's unemployment rate, Unemployment \nCompensation for Ex-service members (UCX) data, and other similar administrative data sources. The Department \ninvites comments about the usefulness of relying on these and other data sources in determining how higher than \naverage demand should be defined. Proposed \u00a7 687.110(a)(5) maintains the prerogative of the Secretary of Labor \nto provide NDWG funding for other events.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.110(b) describes qualifying events for Disaster NDWGs. Proposed \u00a7 687.110(b)(1) provides, \nsimilar to the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 671.110(e), that disasters declared eligible for public assistance under the \nStafford Act are qualifying events for Disaster NDWGs. The proposed paragraph also makes clear that outlying \nareas and tribal areas that receive a public assistance declaration also are eligible to apply for a Disaster NDWG. \nThis is consistent with the intent and purpose of sec. 170 of WIOA, because these entities are both eligible for \ndislocated worker grants under WIOA and are eligible for public assistance under the Stafford Act. Therefore, it is \nlogical that they would be eligible for Disaster NDWGs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.110(b)(2) and (3) describe the new events that WIOA establishes are qualifying events for Disaster \nNDWGs. As stated in sec. 170(a)(1)(B) of WIOA, eligible events for Disaster NDWGs now include an emergency or \ndisaster situation of national significance that could result in a potentially large loss of employment, as recognized \nby the chief official of a Federal agency that has authority or jurisdiction over the Federal response for the \nemergency or disaster situation. Although such an event might not meet the requirements to receive a public \nassistance declaration from the FEMA, it still may be an event where NDWG funding may be needed. NDWGs may \nbe provided in this instance for activities that are determined to be appropriate by the Secretary. Proposed \nparagraph (b)(3) addresses situations where a substantial number of workers from a State, tribal area, or outlying \narea in which an emergency or disaster has occurred relocate to another State, tribal area, or outlying area. This \nwould also be a qualifying event for a Disaster NDWG, according to secs. 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (d)(4) of WIOA. The \naddition of this type of event was informed by the mass evacuations that took place as a result of Hurricane Katrina, \nwhich caused massive flooding and damage along the Gulf Coast in 2005, resulting in evacuees settling in high \nconcentrations in some other communities.\n\nSection 687.120Who is eligible to apply for national dislocated worker grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.120 identifies which entities are eligible to apply for NDWGs. Proposed \u00a7 687.120(a) and (b) retain \nessentially the same requirements as in \u00a7 671.120 of the WIA regulations, but these proposed regulations clearly \nidentify which entities may apply for Regular NDWGs and which may apply for Disaster NDWGs. Unlike \u00a7 \n671.120(b), proposed \u00a7 687.120 does not include a statement concerning the ability of private entities to apply for \nNDWGs for interstate projects, because sec. 170(c)(1)(B) of WIOA and proposed \u00a7 687.120(a)(5) provide for such \napplications. The proposed language, in contrast to its WIA counterpart, does not distinguish between interstate \nand intrastate projects, because from the Department's perspective the grantee/grantor relationship is between the \nDepartment and a single entity. In proposed \u00a7 687.120(a), the Department has specified that outlying areas, in \naddition to States, may apply for Regular NDWGs. In proposed \u00a7 687.120(b), the Department has specified that \noutlying areas and Indian tribal governments as defined by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act, in addition to States, may apply for Disaster NDWGs.\n\nSection 687.130When should applications for national dislocated worker grants be submitted to the Department?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.130 describes when applications for NDWGs may be submitted and retains many of the \nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.130. However, there are some key differences in the \nproposed regulations. Proposed \u00a7 687.130(a) identifies the conditionsapplicable to Regular NDWGs and \nunderscores the importance that applications for Regular NDWGs must be submitted as soon as possible after the \neligibility criteria are met and the necessary information to apply is available to the applicant. Timely submissions \nthat comply with the requirements will help ensure that the needed resources are provided expediently.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.130(b) identifies the conditions applicable to Disaster NDWGs and underscores the importance \nthat applications for Disaster NDWGs must be submitted as soon as possible. Proposed \u00a7 687.130(b)(1) through \n(3) identify the events that trigger applications for Disaster NDWGs, and also emphasize the importance of \nsubmitting applications as soon as possible after the appropriate declarations or determinations have been made.\n\nSection 687.140What activities are applicants expected to conduct before a national dislocated worker grant \napplication is submitted?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.140 describes the activities to be conducted before an application for a NDWG is submitted. \nProposed \u00a7 687.140(a) expands on the requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.160. The \nproposed language, based in part on the Department's experience under WIA, requires applicants to identify the \nneeds of the affected workers, and their interest in receiving services, either through Rapid Response activities or \nother means. Under WIA, the Department learned that some individuals who could have benefited from receiving \nESs under a National Emergency Grant (NEG) ended up not being interested in receiving them. For example, some \nindividuals chose to opt out of receiving services because they believed their previous employer was going to call \nthem back to work, while others chose to forgo receiving employment and training services in order to find new \nemployment on their own. The Department has found that the lack of information on needs and interest of affected \nworkers have significantly impacted participant enrollment rates in the past, and in some cases, resulted in the \nreturn of funds outside the timeframe allowed for the funds to be obligated for other grants. Further, the proposed \nlanguage expands the allowable data gathering methods that may be used, so that applicants are no longer limited \nto using only data obtained via Rapid Response interventions. This change allows for greater flexibility in obtaining \nthis critical data.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.140(b)(1) makes it clear that applicants for Disaster NDWGs must conduct a preliminary \nassessment of the clean-up and humanitarian needs in the affected areas. Proposed \u00a7 687.140(b)(2) requires \napplicants to have a mechanism in place to ascertain reasonably that there is a sufficient population of eligible \nindividuals in the area and, if needed, eligible individuals outside the area to conduct the planned clean-up and \nhumanitarian work. Under WIA, there were a few instances where after NEGs were issued, a State was unable to \nconduct the work it had planned because it was unable to find eligible individuals to do the work. The Department \nrecognizes that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster it is difficult to conduct a thorough assessment of the \nnumber of individuals that could be eligible to conduct the planned work. While the Department's proposed \napproach allows flexibility, it also ensures there is a process in place so that reasonable estimates of potential \nparticipant availability are made prior to submitting the application, so that the proper amount of funding may be \nprovided.\n\nSection 687.150What are the requirements for submitting applications for national dislocated worker grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.150 explains that the Department will publish additional guidance on the requirements for \nsubmitting NDWG applications. A similar approach was taken in the WIA regulations. Unlike the WIA regulations, \nhowever, the proposed section requires that a project implementation plan, which is currently required for all \nNEGs, be submitted post NDWG award. Under WIA, this requirement is included only in guidance. The project \nimplementation plan includes more detailed information about project operations than is required for the initial \napplication. This information allows the Department to provide grantees with targeted technical assistance, and to \nexercise appropriate oversight and monitoring over the NDWG award. Additional information on what must be \nincluded in the project implementation plan, and the process for submitting it, will be included in future guidance.\n\n\n\nSection 687.160What is the timeframe for the Department to issue decisions on national dislocated worker grant \napplications?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.160 implements sec. 170(b)(2) of WIOA, which establishes a 45-day timeframe for issuing \ndeterminations on NDWG applications. The proposed paragraph makes it clear that final decisions on NDWG \napplications will be issued within 45 calendar days of receiving an application that meets the requirements. \nApplicants are encouraged to engage the appropriate Regional Office so that timely technical assistance can be \nprovided when developing NDWG applications to help ensure that the information provided in the application is \nsufficient.\n\n\u00a7 687.170\n\nWho is eligible to be served under national dislocated worker grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.170 provides information on participant eligibility for NDWGs, distinguishing between individuals \nwho may be served under Regular NDWGs and those who may be served under Disaster NDWGs. In the WIA \nregulations at \u00a7 671.140, participant eligibility and allowable activities were included in the same section; these two \ntopics are being addressed separately in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 687.170 and 687.180 for clarity. Proposed \u00a7 687.170(a) lists \nthe specific populations that are eligible to be served under Regular NDWGs. This paragraph retains the provision \nfrom the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.140(a) that dislocated workers may be served. However, as discussed \nbelow, the definition of a dislocated worker was expanded under WIOA, thereby expanding the population that can \nbe served with NDWGs.\n\nSection 3(15)(E)(i)-(ii) of WIOA includes certain spouses of members of the Armed Forces on active duty in the \ndefinition of \u201cdislocated worker.\u201d These spouses are considered dislocated workers, and therefore eligible for \nservices under NDWGs, if they: (1) Have experienced a loss of employment as a direct result of relocation to \naccommodate a permanent change in duty station of the member of the Armed Forces; or, (2) are unemployed or \nunderemployed and experiencing difficulty obtaining or upgrading employment.\n\nWIOA also expanded upon the definition of a \u201cdisplaced homemaker,\u201d recognized under both WIA and WIOA as a \ntype of dislocated worker. Under sec. 3(16)(A)(ii) of WIOA, the definition of a displaced homemaker now explicitly \nincludes a person who is a dependent spouse of a member of theArmed Forces on active duty whose family \nincome is significantly reduced because of a deployment, a call or order to active duty, a permanent change of \nstation, or the service-connected death or disability of the member, and who is unemployed or underemployed and \nis experiencing difficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment. In addition to the expanded dislocated worker \ndefinition covering additional military spouses, dislocated members of the Armed Forces and other dislocated \nmilitary spouses continue to be included in the definition of \u201cdislocated workers\u201d and therefore continue to be \neligible for services under NDWGs, just as they were under WIA NEGs. Finally, sec. 170(c)(2)(A)(iv) of WIOA \nretains the eligibility provision found at sec. 173(c)(2)(iv) of WIA that members of the Armed Forces who were on \nactive duty or full-time National Guard duty who meet other specific requirements are an eligible population. These \nmembers of the Armed Forces and the requirements are specifically described in proposed \u00a7 687.170(a)(1)(iii).\n\nAs discussed earlier in this preamble, WIOA states that dislocated members of the Armed Forces, members of the \nArmed Forces described in proposed \u00a7 687.170(a)(1)(iii), and dislocated spouses of members of the Armed Forces \non active duty may be served with NDWGs when there is a higher than average demand for employment and \ntraining activities from this population that exceeds State and local resources to provide them.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.170(b)(1) retains many of the participant eligibility requirements for Disaster NEGs found in the \nWIA regulations at \u00a7 671.140(d), and also includes a new population authorized under sec. 170(d)(2)(D) of WIOA\u2014\nindividuals who were self-employed, but become unemployed or significantly underemployed as a result of the \nemergency or disaster. Proposed \u00a7 687.170(b)(2) implements sec. 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) of WIOA, discussed in proposed \n\u00a7 687.110(b)(3), which authorizes NDWG assistance for individuals who have relocated to another State, tribal \narea, or outlying area as a result of the disaster. This paragraph lists the relocated individuals who are eligible for \nassistance under these type of NDWGs, and also notes that in rare instances, humanitarian-related temporary \nemployment will be available in the relocation areas. This is further discussed in proposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(2) and the \n\n\n\ncorresponding preamble language. In those cases, the relocated individuals listed in proposed \u00a7 687.170(b)(2) \nwould be eligible for that work.\n\nSection 687.180What are the allowable activities under national dislocated worker grants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180 provides information on allowable activities; first, those allowable under Regular NDWGs; \nsecond, those allowable under Disaster NDWGs. Proposed \u00a7 687.180(a) lists the allowable activities for Regular \nNDWGs. These activities are essentially the same as those reflected in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.140; \nhowever, consistent with WIOA, references to core, intensive, and training services have been changed to refer to \ncareer services. Additionally, the reference to trade-impacted workers under the NAFTA-TAA program contained in \n20 CFR 671.140(c)(2) is not included in the proposed paragraph, since the NAFTA-TAA program no longer exists.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b) lists the allowable activities for Disaster NDWGs. Proposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(1) uses the same \nlanguage as in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.140(e), which authorizes temporary employment for \nhumanitarian assistance and clean-up and repair of facilities and lands within the disaster area for which a Disaster \nNDWG is issued. This proposed paragraph also implements sec. 170(d)(1)(A) of WIOA, which requires \ncoordination with FEMA and permits these activities to be performed in offshore areas related to the emergency or \ndisaster. The addition of the language on offshore areas was informed by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill; the \nproposed paragraph allows clean-up and humanitarian assistance activities to take place beyond the land surface \nof the disaster area.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(1) implements sec. 170(d)(3) of WIOA; this paragraph allows employment of up to 12 \nmonths in the temporary jobs created under Disaster NDWGs, with the potential for an additional 12 months with \nSecretarial approval. Under sec. 173(d)(3) of WIA, only 6 months of disaster relief employment was allowed. \nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(1) identifies employment and training activities as allowable under Disaster NDWGs. While \nthe WIA regulations contained a comparable provision, individuals were only allowed to participate in employment \nand training services after they had completed the disaster relief employment component of the project. The \nproposed paragraph allows individuals enrolled in disaster relief employment under Disaster NDWGs to receive \nconcurrent career and training services, as well as upon completion. Feedback received from grantees over the \nyears demonstrates that individuals involved in clean-up and humanitarian assistance benefit from the opportunity \nto receive employment and training services. These services will help to improve the skills of these individuals and \nenhance their chances of obtaining employment once the temporary disaster relief employment is completed. \nHowever, because the primary purpose of Disaster NDWGs is to perform clean-up and humanitarian assistance, \nthe Department will issue further guidance about the specific requirements regarding concurrent participation in \ncareer services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(2) implements sec. 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) of WIOA, discussed in proposed \u00a7 687.110(b)(3), which \nmakes individuals who have relocated to another State, tribal area, or outlying area as a result of a disaster eligible \nto receive services. Proposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(2) recognizes that although these individuals are eligible for temporary \ndisaster relief employment, their employment, by virtue of their relocation, will most likely be limited to humanitarian \nwork (if those services are warranted). If individuals relocate outside of the disaster area, they will most likely not be \nin the impacted geographic area to conduct clean-up work. It is the Department's expectation that, except in rare \ncircumstances, the services provided to relocated individuals will be limited to career services.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(3), consistent with secs. 170(a)(1)(A)-(B) of WIOA, authorizes career services and/or \ndisaster relief employment both where recognized by FEMA, or by another Federal agency. Under sec. 173(a)(2) of \nWIA and the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.110(e) and 671.130(c), NEGs were only available where FEMA \ndeclared an area eligible for disaster-related public assistance.\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.180(b)(4) implements sec. 170(d)(1)(B) of WIOA, which states that disaster NDWG funds may be \nexpended through public and private agencies and organizations that are engaged in disaster relief and \nhumanitarian assistance projects.\n\nSection 687.190How do statutory and regulatory waivers apply to national dislocated worker grants?\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.190 describes how statutory and regulatory waivers apply to NDWGs. To improve a grantee's \nability to serve participants, or increase the effectiveness of NDWG projects, the Department may grant waivers to \nmany statutory and regulatory requirements. See WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A), which identifies some limitations on the \nSecretary's waiver authority. Proposed\u00a7 687.190(a) and (b) retain essentially the same requirements found in the \nWIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.150. A grantee requesting a waiver of the statutory or regulatory requirements in \nconnection with an NDWG must submit its request either in the initial application for an NDWG, or in a subsequent \nmodification request. A waiver issued under other WIOA provisions does not supplant this requirement.\n\nSection 687.200What are the program and administrative requirements that apply to national dislocated worker \ngrants?\n\nProposed \u00a7 687.200 describes program and administrative requirements for NDWGs. It retains essentially the same \nlanguage included in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.170. Proposed \u00a7 687.200(b) authorizes the use of funds \nfor temporary job creation in areas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA or in areas impacted by a \nsituation of national significance as designated by a Federal agency other than FEMA, subject to the limitations of \nsec. 170(d) of WIOA, and any additional guidance issued by the Department. Proposed \u00a7 687.200(b)(2) authorizes \nany remaining Disaster NDWG funds awarded under this part to be used by a grantee in the same PY the funds \nwere awarded, in limited instances as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, for additional \ndisasters or situations of national significance subject to the limitations of sec. 170(d) of WIOA. This flexibility will \nallow States, tribal areas, and outlying areas that experience a quick succession of disasters (such as those \nexperienced by several Gulf States in 2005 that were devastated by the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and \napproximately 1 month later, were devastated by Hurricane Rita) to be able to modify their existing grant and \nquickly access existing funding.\n\nL. Part 688\u2014Provisions Governing the YouthBuild Program\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Department wants to emphasize the connections across all of our youth-serving programs under WIOA \nincluding the WIOA youth formula program including boards and youth committees, connections to pre-\napprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs, and Job Corps centers across the country. WIOA is an \nopportunity to align and coordinate service strategies for these ETA youth training programs as well as align with \nour Federal partners that serve these same customers. WIOA also ensures that these programs are using common \nperformance measures and standard definitions, which includes aligning the definitions for homeless youth, basic \nskills deficient, occupational skills training and supportive services. Additionally, the YouthBuild regulation aligns six \nnew performance measures with the WIOA youth formula program.\n\nWIOA affirms the Department's commitment to providing high quality education, training, and ESs for youth and \nyoung adults through YouthBuild grants by expanding the occupational skills training offered at local YouthBuild \nprograms. YouthBuild programs can offer occupational skills training in in-demand occupations, such as health \ncare, advanced manufacturing, and IT, as approved by the Secretary and based on local labor market information.\n\nIn addition to the changes to the program required by WIOA, the Department proposes several additional changes \nto the program, including proposed revisions to the duration of the restrictive covenant clause (as detailed in the \npreamble at \u00a7 688.730), clarifying eligibility criteria for participation, and describing qualifying work sites and \nminimum criteria for successful exit from the YouthBuild program. Beyond these regulations, the Department will \ndevelop guidance and technical assistance to help grantees and the workforce development community operate \nhighly effective YouthBuild programs.\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Purpose and Definitions\n\nSection 688.100What is YouthBuild?\n\nThis proposed section describes the YouthBuild program. YouthBuild is a workforce development program that \nprovides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged youth. The \nprogram also benefits the larger community by providing new and rehabilitated affordable housing, thereby \ndecreasing the incidence of homelessness in those communities. The program recruits youth between the ages of \n\n\n\n16 and 24 who are school dropouts and are either: A member of a low-income family, a youth in foster care, a youth \nwho is homeless, a youth offender, a youth who is an individual with a disability, a child of an incarcerated parent, \nor a migrant youth.\n\nSection 688.110What are the purposes of the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section describes the purposes of the YouthBuild program. The overarching goal of the YouthBuild \nprogram is to offer disadvantaged youth the opportunity to obtain education and useful employment skills to enter \nthe labor market successfully. Construction training provides skills training and hands-on application of those skills. \nYouth also receive educational services that lead to a HSD or its State-recognized equivalent.\n\nIn addition to describing the Department's vision for the YouthBuild program, this proposed section describes the \npurposes of the YouthBuild program as found at WIOA sec. 171(a).\n\nSection 688.120What definitions apply to this part?\n\nThis proposed section provides definitions that are specific to the YouthBuild program in sec. 171(b) of WIOA. \nOther definitions that apply to the YouthBuild program are defined under sec. 3 of WIOA and \u00a7 675.300. Where \nappropriate and applicable the Department has aligned our definitions with the definitions within the regulations of \nWIOA youth, Job Corps, and WIOA adult and dislocated workers programs.\n\nThese proposed definitions fall into several categories, which are described below: (1) Definitions that remain \nunchanged from the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 672.110; (2) terms that were included in the WIA regulation but \nwhich have been amended; and (3) new definitions added to implement WIOA.\n\nDefinitions included in 20 CFR 672.110 which have been carried over to this part unchanged are: \u201cCommunity or \nOther Public Facility,\u201d \u201cCore Construction,\u201d \u201cEligible Entity,\u201d \u201cHousing Development Agency,\u201d \u201cIncome,\u201d \u201cIndian; \nIndian Tribe,\u201d \u201cLow-Income Family,\u201d \u201cMigrant Youth,\u201d and \u201cYouth in Foster Care.\u201d\n\nDefinitions published in the WIA regulations at \u00a7 672.110 that the Department proposes changing include existing \ndefinitions for: \u201cHomeless Individual\u201d to include individuals considered homeless as defined in sec. 41403(6) of the \nViolence Against Women Act of 1994 and the inclusion of \u201cHomeless Child or Youth\u201d as defined under the \nMcKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act; \u201cNeeds-Based Stipends\u201d to \u201cNeeds-Based Payments\u201d in order to be \nconsistent with the term as used in \u00a7 688.320 below and to differentiate the term from the allowable program \nstipends described in \u00a7 688.320; \u201cOccupational Skills Traning\u201d to align with in-demand industries and an emphasis \non post-secondary credentials; \u201cRegistered Apprenticeship\u201d to align with the WIOA definition; and \n\u201cTransitionalHousing\u201d to reflect the amended definition under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act as \namended by S. 896 The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009.\n\nProposed changes to this section also include the addition of new definitions that were not in WIA but are included \nin either sec. 3 or sec. 171(b) of WIOA. These are \u201cAdjusted Income,\u201d \u201cApplicant,\u201d \u201cBasic Skills Deficient,\u201d \u201cIn-\nDemand Industry Sector or Occupation,\u201d \u201cIndividual with a Disability,\u201d \u201cOffender,\u201d \u201cQualified National Nonprofit \nAgency,\u201d \u201cRecognized Post-secondary Credential,\u201d \u201cSchool Dropout,\u201d \u201cSecondary School,\u201d \u201cSupportive Services,\u201d \nand \u201cYouthBuild Program.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Department proposes to include several new definitions not defined under WIA YouthBuild regulations \u00a7 \n673.110: \u201cConstruction Plus,\u201d \u201cExit,\u201d \u201cFollow-Up Services,\u201d \u201cParticipant,\u201d and \u201cPre-apprenticeship.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Department has removed several definitions that were included in the WIA regulations: \u201cAlternative \nSchool,\u201d \u201cIndividuals of Limited English Proficiency (LEP),\u201d \u201cPartnership,\u201d \u201cPublic Housing Agency,\u201d and \u201cYouth who \nis an Individual with a Disability.\u201d\n\nThe Department proposes to include the following definitions at \u00a7 688.120:\n\nAdjusted Income: The Department proposes that the term \u201cadjusted income\u201d means that with respect to a family, \nthe amount of the income of the members of the family residing in a dwelling unit or the persons on a lease, after \n\n\n\nany allowable income exclusions. Per WIOA sec. 171(b)(1), this definition comes from sec. 3(b) of the United \nStates Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b).\n\nApplicant: The Department proposes defining this as an entity applying for YouthBuild funding as described at \nWIOA sec. 171(b)(2).\n\nBasic Skills Deficient: This proposed definition comes from WIOA sec. 3(5) and the Department is adding it for ease \nof use. In assessing basic skills, YouthBuild programs must use assessment instruments that are valid and \nappropriate for the target population, and must provide reasonable accommodation in the assessment process, if \nnecessary, for participants with disabilities.\n\nConstruction Plus: The Department proposes defining this as the inclusion of occupational skills training for \nYouthBuild participants in in-demand occupations other than construction. This definition is from TEGL 7-14 \nGuidance for Implementing the \u201cConstruction Plus\u201d Component of the YouthBuild Program. The Department is \nadding this definition to the regulations to stress the importance of correctly implementing a high quality \nConstruction Plus program and to refer grantees to TEGL 7-14.\n\nCommunity Or Other Public Facility: The Department proposes defining this as those facilities which are either \nprivately owned by non-profit organizations or publicly owned and publicly used for the benefit of the community. \nFor publically owned buildings, examples include public use buildings such as recreation centers, libraries, public \npark shelters, or public schools.\n\nCore Construction: The Department proposes defining this term to mean those activities that are directly related to \nthe construction or rehabilitation of residential, community, or other public facilities. These activities include, but are \nnot limited to, job skills that can be found under the Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) major \ngroup 47, and Construction and Extraction Occupations, in codes 47-1011 through 47-4099. A full list of the SOC's \ncan be found at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Web site, http://www.bls.gov/soc.\n\nEligible Entity: This proposed term describes the entities eligible to apply for funding under this part. This definition \ncomes from WIOA sec. 171(b)(3).\n\nEnglish Language Learner: The Department proposes defining this term as a participant who has limited ability in \nreading, writing, speaking, or comprehending the English language, and whose native language is one other than \nEnglish; or who lives in a family or community environment where a language other than English is the dominant \nlanguage. This definition comes from WIOA sec. 3(21), which adopts the definition found at WIOA sec. 203(7).\n\nExit: For purposes of measuring performance under the performance measures described in \u00a7 688.400, the \nDepartment proposes to adopt the general definition of exit that is used in \u00a7 677.150 in order to align with the core \nprograms generally and the youth formula program specifically. For purposes of this definition, an exit from a \nYouthBuild program is either a successful exit under \u00a7 688.370 or an unsuccessful exit, which occurs when a \nparticipant leaves the program before completing the program. However, a participant is not considered to have \nunsuccessfully exited if they leave the program because of a documented death, health or medical reason, family \ncare, being called to active duty in the military, or any other circumstance described by the Secretary.\n\nFollow-Up Services: This proposed term describes the services provided to youth participants after program exit to \nensure success in established outcomes, such as placement into post-secondary education and training or \nemployment. The definition is based on the Department's experience in administering the YouthBuild program, and \naligns with the WIOA youth formula program definition. By adding this definition, the Department intends to \nstrengthen the emphasis on career pathways for YouthBuild participants. Follow-up services are critical services \nprovided following a youth's exit from the program that help ensure the youth is successful in employment and/or \npost-secondary education and training as they progress along their career pathway. The Department will issue \nguidance and provide technical assistance regarding the services necessary to ensure the success of youth \nparticipants.\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/soc\n\n\nHomeless Individual: This proposed term comes from WIOA sec. 171(b)(4), which adopted the definition from sec. \n41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e-2(6)).\n\nHomeless Child or Youth: This proposed term comes from WIOA sec. 171(b)(4) of WIOA and comes from sec. \n725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 1134a(2)).\n\nHousing Development Agency: The Department proposes adopting the statutory definition of this term at WIOA sec. \n171(b)(5).\n\nIncome: This proposed definition has been adopted from WIOA sec. 171(b)(6), which adopted the definition from \nthe United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)).\n\nIn-Demand Industry Sector or Occupation: The Department proposes to define this term as described at WIOA sec. \n3(23).\n\nIndian; Indian Tribe: These proposed terms are found in WIOA sec. 171(b)(7), which incorporated the definitions \nfrom sec. 4 of the ISDEAA.\n\nIndividual With a Disability: This proposed definition was taken from sec. 3(25) of WIOA, which adopted the \ndefinition from sec. 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102).\n\nLow-Income Family: This proposed definition implements the definition at WIOA sec. 171(b)(8), which adopted the \ndefinition of \u201clow-income family\u201d from sec. 3(b)(2) of the Housing Act of 1937. This definition applies not only to the \neligibility of participants but also to therequirement that any residential units constructed or rehabilitated using \nYouthBuild funds must house homeless individuals and families or low-income families.\n\nMigrant Youth: The Department proposes using the definition we used under the WIA YouthBuild regulation. The \ndefinition was adapted from Farmworker Bulletin 00-02, which relates to eligibility in the Migrant Seasonal \nFarmworker Youth program, and expands on the definition of \u201cmigrant seasonal farmworker\u201d found in WIA.\n\nNeeds-Based Payments: This proposed term describes additional payments to participants beyond stipends which \nare necessary for an eligible youth to participate in the program.\n\nOccupational Skills Training: The Department proposes to define this term as a course of study that provides \nspecific vocational skills.\n\nOffender: The Department proposes to define this term based on the definition found at WIOA sec. 3(38) and it \nincludes both youth and adults who have been subject to any stage of the criminal justice process. The Department \nis proposing this definition in order to align YouthBuild's definition of offender with WIOA's formula for adult and \nyouth programs.\n\nParticipant: The Department is proposing to define this term as an individual who, after an affirmative eligibility \ndetermination has been made, enrolls and actively participates in the program. Participants must be reported in the \nperformance outcome measures. The term \u201cparticipant\u201d is necessary to define because \u00a7 688.400 requires \ngrantees to report on the performance of participants in the program. This definition is designed to be consistent \nwith the definition of participant in \u00a7 677.150, and it captures the same type of individuals that are considered \nparticipants in the core programs.\n\nPre-Apprenticeship: This proposed term describes a program or set of strategies designed to prepare individuals to \nenter and succeed in a registered apprenticeship program. This definition is adopted from TEN 13-12 \n(http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEN/TEN_13-12_Acc.pdf), and is being used to ensure consistency with the \ndefinition used by the Department's Office of Apprenticeship. Per TEN 13-12, YouthBuild programs that receive \nfunding from DOL are considered pre-apprenticeship programs.\n\nRecognized Post-secondary Credential: This proposed definition explains that a recognized post-secondary \ncredential includes an industry-recognized certificate or completion of an apprenticeship program, a license \n\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEN/TEN_13-12_Acc.pdf\n\n\nrecognized by the State involved or Federal government, or an associate or baccalaureate degree. This definition \nhas been adopted from WIOA sec. 3(52). the Department is using this to term to align with WIOA's formula adult \nand youth programs.\n\nRegistered Apprenticeship Program: The Department proposes to adopt the definition found at WIOA sec. \n171(b)(10).\n\nSchool Dropout: This proposed definition, adopted from WIOA sec. 3(54), describes a school dropout as an \nindividual who is no longer attending any school and who has not received a secondary school diploma or its \nrecognized equivalent.\n\nSecondary School: The Department proposes to define this term as a nonprofit institutional day or residential \nschool, including a public secondary charter school, that provides secondary education, as determined under State \nlaw, except that the term does not include any education beyond grade 12. This proposed definition adopts the \ndefinition at WIOA sec. 3(55), which cites to sec. 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 7801).\n\nSection 3: The Department proposes to define this term as Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of \n1968, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The Department proposes adding \nthis definition because YouthBuild is specifically identified in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD's) Section 3 regulations. In Section 3, contractors are encouraged to work with YouthBuild \nprograms and participants when working on Federally-funded HUD projects. Contractors and registered \napprenticeship sponsors that hire YouthBuild graduates will increase the competitiveness of their proposals when \nbidding on HUD-funding construction projects.\n\nSupportive Services: This proposed definition adopts the definition from WIOA sec. 3(59). In this definition, linkages \nto community services include but are not limited to services such as linkages to free legal aid to help with the \nexpungement of criminal records, securing government identification, and linkages to organizations that provide \nyouth the opportunity to develop their leadership skills through service to their respective community. This proposed \ndefinition identifies additional services that are necessary for youth to participant in this program. Guidance \nregarding the provision of supportive services will be issued by the Department.\n\nTransitional Housing: The Department proposes to define this term as housing provided to ease the movement of \nindividuals and families experiencing homelessness to permanent housing within 24 months. This definition, per \nWIOA sec. 171(b)(11), is adopted from sec. 401(29) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n11360(29)).\n\nYouth in Foster Care: This term means \u201cyouth currently in foster care or youth who have ever been in foster care.\u201d \nThe Department is including it here as it was in WIA YouthBuild regulations.\n\nYouthbuild Program: The Department proposes to define this term as any program that receives assistance under \nthis section and provides disadvantaged youth with opportunities for employment, education, leadership \ndevelopment, and training through the rehabilitation (which for purposes of this section, must include energy \nefficiency enhancements) or construction of housing for homeless individuals and low-income families, and public \nfacilities. This proposed term adopts the definition from WIOA sec. 171(b)(12).\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Funding and Grant Applications\n\nSection 688.200How are YouthBuild grants funded and administered?\n\nThis proposed section describes how the Secretary uses funds authorized for appropriation under WIOA sec. 171(i) \nto administer YouthBuild as a national program under title I, subtitle D of WIOA. This section also notes that grants \nto operate YouthBuild programs are awarded to eligible entities through a competitive selection process, as \nrequired by WIOA sec. 171(c)(3). This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.200.\n\nSection 688.210How does an eligible entity apply for grant funds to operate a YouthBuild program?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(c)(1), generally describes the application process for the \nYouthBuild program.\n\nSection 688.220How are eligible entities selected to receive grant funds?\n\nThis proposed section, which implements WIOA sec. 171(c)(4), describes the selection criteria that will be \nconsidered by the Secretary when reviewing an application for funding. In addition to the criteria described in the \nlaw, the Department has added additional criteria in paragraphs (d), (e),and (g) and added a new criteria in \nparagraph (i).\n\nIn paragraph (d), the Department has added \u201ccounseling and case management\u201d to the criteria described in sec. \n171(c)(4)(D) because these are essential to the success of YouthBuild participants.\n\nIn paragraph (e), in addition to the criteria at WIOA sec. 171(c)(4)(E), the Department has clarified that applicants \nshould train participants in sectors or occupations that are in demand locally to help them achieve a positive \nemployment outcome after their exit from the program. Paragraph (g) adds to the criteria at WIOA sec. 171(c)(4)(I) \nby clarifying that the Department will also consider the extent to which the proposal provides for previously \nhomeless families as well as individuals.\n\nThe Department has added a new criterion at paragraph (i) which looks at the applicant's ability to enter into \npartnerships with a variety of organizations and providers. Inclusion of this criterion is beneficial to the grantee and \nthe participant. No single grantee is able to provide all of the services that a participant will need to succeed along \nher or his chosen career pathway. However, programs that enter into various types of partnerships are able to \nprovide participants with needed supportive services, increasing the likelihood that they will succeed both during \nand after their participation in the program.\n\nFinally, paragraph (l) clarifies that the Department will apply varying weights to these factors as described in the \nFOA.\n\nSection 688.230What are the minimum requirements and elements to apply for YouthBuild funds?\n\nThis proposed section implements WIOA section 171(c)(3)(B) and describes the minimum requirements and \nelements that must be included in an application for YouthBuild funds.\n\nIn addition to the requirement at sec. 171(c)(3)(B)(iii), proposed \u00a7 688.230(c) requires applicants to describe their \nexperience operating a program under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. This \nrequirement was added because the Department wants grantees to be aware that YouthBuild is specifically \nidentified in HUD's Section 3 regulations. In Section 3, contractors are encouraged to work with YouthBuild \nprograms and participants when working on Federally-funded HUD projects. The criteria described in this proposed \nsection will be included in the FOA.\n\nThe criteria described in this section emphasize strong connections to registered apprenticeship programs as a key \ncomponent of the YouthBuild model, as well as connections to the one-stop system as a support for employer \nengagement, connecting with the Local Workforce Development Board youth services, and connecting to the \nnetwork of standing youth committees at the local level. These connections will not only strengthen YouthBuild \nprograms, but better enable them to provide a comprehensive spectrum of employment and training services to \ntheir participants.\n\nAdditionally, \u00a7 688.230(l) proposes, consistent with current practice, that the Department will consider an applicant's \npast performance under an award made by the Secretary of Labor to operate a YouthBuild program. This \nconsideration will be based on the applicant's past Quarterly Performance Reports (ETA-9136) and Quarterly \nFinancial Reports (ETA-9130). Our past experience in administering the YouthBuild program has demonstrated that \nevaluating past performance allows the Department to conduct comprehensive analysis of the program's ability to \nmeet the complicated requirements of YouthBuild. Additional details about this requirement will be included in the \nFOA.\n\n\n\nFinally, proposed paragraph (v) authorizes the Secretary to include additional requirements in the FOA. This \nprovision has been included to ensure that the requirements upon which the Secretary is making its determination \nare based on adequately and accurately judging the ability of the applicant in order to ensure the effective, efficient \nuse of Federal funds and maximum benefit to program participants and the communities in which the proposed \nprogram will operate.\n\nSection 688.240How are eligible entities notified of approval for grant funds?\n\nConsistent with sec. 171(c)(5) of WIOA, this proposed section describes how eligible entities are notified of the \nstatus of their respective grant application submitted for funding and the time frame for notification. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.215.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Program Requirements\n\nSection 688.300Who is an eligible participant?\n\nThis proposed section sets out the participant eligibility requirements for enrollment in the YouthBuild program. It \ncovers the required ages, education, income level, and other factors as well as exceptions. This proposed section \nimplements the statutory eligibility requirement at WIOA sec. 171(e)(1).\n\nWhile the language \u201cits recognized State equivalent\u201d in \u00a7 688.300(b)(1) is commonly understood to mean a GED, \nStates can choose from several different equivalency tests that result in the attainment of a credential similar to the \nGED. Accordingly, the phrase \u201crecognized State equivalent\u201d as used in this section refers to the credential attained \nby passing any of the recognized equivalency tests.\n\nWhile WIOA sec. 171(e)(1)(A)(ii) includes \u201ca youth offender\u201d as an eligible participant, proposed \u00a7 688.300(a)(3)(iii) \npermits both adult and youth offenders to participate in the YouthBuild program. The reason for the inclusion of \nadult offenders is twofold. First, some States categorize anyone who was convicted of a crime over the age of 16 \nan adult. Because individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 are eligible to participate in YouthBuild programs, not \nincluding adult offenders as eligible participants would exclude those 16 and 17 year olds who have been convicted \nof a crime from participating in the program. Including adult offenders in this list of eligible participants ensures that \nthese youth with a substantial barrier to employment will be able to participate in and benefit from the YouthBuild \nprogram.\n\nSection 688.310Are there special rules that apply to veterans?\n\nThis section identifies the relevant rules for determining income for veterans and priority of service for qualified \nveterans. These rules can be found in 20 CFR 683.230 and 20 CFR part 1010, respectively. This proposed section \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.305.\n\nSection 688.320What eligible activities may be funded under the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section, which implements WIOA sec. 171(c)(2), outlines the activities that YouthBuild programs \nfunded under this section may provide to program participants, including the allowable education and workforce \ntraining activities. Of note, sec. 171(c)(2)(a)(i) of WIOA codified the Department's decision to allow training in in-\ndemand industries with the approval of the Secretary.\n\nIn addition to the activities allowed by the statute, the Department, in \u00a7 688.320, proposes to allow grantees to \nprovide referrals to mental healthservices and victim services, such as referrals to domestic violence services or \nservices to victims of gang violence. The Department has decided to add this because it is not uncommon for our \nparticipants to enroll in our programs while at the same time dealing with the adverse effects of violence.\n\nFinally, \u00a7 688.320(a)(7)(ii) specifies that in order to provide needs-based payments, a grantee must have a written \npolicy which includes the information described to sure that such payments are proper and fairly distributed.\n\nSection 688.330What level of training qualifies a construction project as a qualifying work site under the YouthBuild \nprogram?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section provides requirements for YouthBuild grant programs on what is considered a qualifying \nwork site for purposes of allowable construction activities under the YouthBuild program.\n\nWhile the YouthBuild program model requires hands-on construction training that supports the outcome of \nincreasing the supply of affordable housing within the communities that YouthBuild serves, some grant programs \nstruggle to secure work sites that will offer the youth the hands-on construction skills training obtained from either \nbuilding housing from scratch or through extensive rehabilitation of existing housing stock.\n\nDetermining whether a work site meets the criteria for providing substantial hands-on experience is complex. As \nreferenced in TEGL 35-12, \u201cDefinition and Guidance on Allowable Construction Credentials for YouthBuild \nPrograms,\u201d participants must study and pass testing in a number of modules, or skill areas, before one of the \nindustry-recognized construction certification programs will accredit them. These modules include, for example, \nbrick masonry, carpentry, painting, plumbing, and weatherization.\n\nPer paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, several criteria must be met in order for a work site to qualify as \nappropriate for construction skills training for YouthBuild participants. The first is whether the worksite will provide \nthe opportunity for hands-on training in at least two modules in a construction skills training program offering an \nindustry-recognized credential. The second is whether the completed work site will be used by a family or individual \nthat meets the low-income threshold, as defined by the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)). \nThe third is whether the site provides substantial hands-on experience for youth. This means that the work site must \ninclude from-the-ground-up building experience (e.g., foundation, framing, roofing, dry wall installation, finishing, \netc.) or a substantial level of rehabilitation (i.e.,\u201ca gut job\u201d). Fourth, per \u00a7 688.730, all YouthBuild work sites must be \nbuilt or renovated for low-income individuals or families and are required to have a restrictive covenant in place that \nonly allows for rental or resale to low-income participants for a particular period of time. Last, all work sites must \nadhere to the allowable construction and other capital asset costs, as defined in TEGL 05-10, \u201cMatch and Allowable \nConstruction and Other Capital Asset Costs for the YouthBuild Program,\u201d or subsequent or similar guidance issued \nby the Department related to allowable costs.\n\nAll grantees must use the required Work Site Description form (ETA-9143) in submitting proposed work sites for \nreview and approval to and by the Department at the time of applying for grant funds. If after approval the grantee \ncan no longer work at the approved construction site, the grantee must submit another ETA-9143 for the proposed \nnew work site. The Work Site Description form requests specific information on the property for building or \nrehabilitation, the participants' construction activities, the funding source for the construction, and demonstration of \nownership or access to the site.\n\nBy tying approved work sites with hands on training, the Department can ensure youth have the necessary hands-\non training and experience in two or more of these modules or skill areas in order to qualify for industry-recognized \ncredentials. The Department will issue guidance on the types of work sites that are acceptable for construction \ntraining for YouthBuild participants, and describe the minimum construction activities that define work site training.\n\nSection 688.340What timeframes apply to participation?\n\nThis proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(e)(2), provides that the period of participation for YouthBuild \nparticipants while enrolled in the program is not less than 6 months and not more than 24 months. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.315.\n\nSection 688.350What timeframes must be devoted to education and workforce investment or other activities?\n\nImplementing WIOA sec. 171(e)(3), this proposed section outlines the requirements for the minimum amount of \ntime that participants must engage in workforce and educational training activities. This section also permits \nprogram participants to spend up to 10 percent of their time engaged in leadership development and community \nservice activities, such as youth serving as crew leaders, participating on policy councils, organizing community \nclean-up projects, leading youth voter registration drives and organizing and hosting community anti-violence \nconferences.\n\nSection 688.360What timeframes apply to follow-up services?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to provide follow-up services for a period of 12 months after \nexit. These services are provided to program participants that have successfully exited the program to help them \ntransition successfully into a post-secondary education program or employment.\n\nThe Department proposes to require 12 months of follow-up services to align the length of services with the youth \nformula program and the new performance measure requiring grantees to measure outcomes up to four quarters \nafter exit. The types of services provided and the duration of services must be determined based on the needs of \nthe individual and therefore, the type and intensity of follow-up services may differ for each participant.\n\nConsistent with the youth formula program, a participant that is receiving follow-up services is considered to have \nexited the program, and therefore would be counted as having exited the program for the purpose of the \nperformance measures described in \u00a7 688.400.\n\nSection 688.370What are the requirements for exit from the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section outlines the minimum criteria for successful exit from the YouthBuild program. One purpose \nof the YouthBuild program is for participants to receive practical skills and training that will allow them to \nsuccessfully transition to employment or further education. As used in this section, a successful exit occurs when a \nparticipant has completed his/her training and is ready to transition out of the program.\n\nProposed paragraph (a) requires hands-on training because, based on our experience, participants that do not \nreceive this training are less likely to transition out of the program successfully, thereby undermining one of the \nprimary purposes of the program.\n\nProposed paragraph (b) requires each YouthBuild program to create exitpolicies that establish any additional \nminimum requirements that youth must meet in order to be considered to have successfully completed the program.\n\nIn the past, grantees have deemed participants to have exited the program, simultaneously upon graduation, before \nall program services have been completed or delivered. This can result in lower performance outcome measures for \nthe grantee and a lower post program success rate for participants. Participants do not have to exit at the moment \nof graduation. Exits can and should be based on the individual ongoing needs of the participant. Transition services \ncan be provided until the participant is ready for exit and may include college experience, subsidized summer jobs, \ninternships, or other activities that will help the youth focus on post-program goals (for further details, please see \u00a7 \n688.320). It may also be best to have the youth already connected to a post-program placement before exit to \nensure successful outcomes for the youth and successful performance outcome measures for the program. In \naddition, because follow-up services are only available to participants that have successfully completed the \nprogram, adding this section clarifies which participants are eligible to receive follow-up services\n\nSection 688.380What is the role of the YouthBuild grantee in the one-stop system?\n\nWIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) includes all of the programs authorized under title I of WIOA as a required partner in the \nlocal one-stop system. This proposed section implements that provision by requiring YouthBuild grantees to take \nall actions required of required partners described in sec. 121 of WIOA and 20 CFR part 678. The Department \nencourages its YouthBuild grantees to actively participate as a partner with the one-stop system. Because of the \npositive role that a local one-stop center can have on the operation of a local YouthBuild program and on the \noutcomes for YouthBuild participants, the local YouthBuild grantee should serve as the required partner of the one-\nstop system as required by sec. 121 of WIOA.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Performance Indicators\n\nSection 688.400What are the performance indicators for YouthBuild grants?\n\nThis proposed section describes performance indicators for the YouthBuild program, as required by WIOA sec. \n171(f). Proposed \u00a7 688.400(a) through (f) are the six primary indicators as required by sec. 116 (b)(2)(A)(ii) of \nWIOA. These measures of performance are the same as the primary indicators discussed in proposed \u00a7 677.155. \nThough the indicators of performance are identified in various places throughout the WIOA proposed regulations, \nthe indicators are the same and do not vary across the regulations. In addition to the six primary indicators, the \nSecretary may require YouthBuild programs to collect additional information on performance. If additional \n\n\n\nperformance information becomes a requirement for YouthBuild grantees, they will be informed through a formal \nmemorandum from the Department.\n\nIn calculating a program's performance, grantees must consider all of the participants that have exited the program, \nas that term is defined in \u00a7 688.120, not just those that have successfully exited the program under the policy \ndescribed in \u00a7 688.370.\n\nSection 688.410What are the required levels of performance for the performance indicators?\n\nThis proposed section, implementing sec. 171(f) of the statute, provides a description of how levels of performance \nare developed for YouthBuild programs.\n\nSection 688.420What are the reporting requirements for YouthBuild grantees?\n\nThis section outlines the performance, narrative, and financial reporting requirements for YouthBuild grantees and \nexplains that any additional information on the reporting requirements will be included in guidance issued by the \nSecretary. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.410.\n\nSection 688.430What are the due dates for quarterly reporting?\n\nThis section provides due dates for quarterly performance reporting under the YouthBuild program. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.415.\n\n6. Subpart E\u2014Administrative Rules, Costs, and Limitations\n\nSection 688.500What administrative regulations apply to the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section applies the relevant administrative requirements and regulations applicable to all WIOA ETA \nprograms to the YouthBuild program. This section requires each YouthBuild grantee to comply with the general \nadministrative requirements found in 20 CFR part 683, except those that apply only to the WIOA title I-B program, \nthe Uniform Administrative Requirements at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, 29 CFR parts 93, 94, and 98, and the \nnondiscrimination regulations at 29 CFR part 37.\n\nThe nondiscrimination regulations incorporated by this section at \u00a7 688.500(c)(2), 29 CFR part 37, broadly prohibit \nall forms of discrimination for WIOA title I programs, which include YouthBuild. In particular, 29 CFR 37.5 states \nthat \u201c[n]o individual in the United States may, on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, \ndisability, political affiliation or belief, and for beneficiaries only, citizenship or participation in any WIOA title I-\nfinancially assisted program or activity, be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to \ndiscrimination under, or denied employment in the administration of or in connection with any WIOA title I-funded \nprogram or activity.\u201d\n\nThe regulations also require that grantees provide reasonable accommodations to youth who are individuals with \ndisabilities, as found in 29 CFR 37.8. For grantees unsure of how to best accommodate youth who are individuals \nwith disabilities in their program, the Department recommends that the grantees consult with the Job \nAccommodation Network [https://askjan.org/] or call (800) 526-7234 (Voice) (877) 781-9403 (TTY], a free service of \nthe Department's Office of Disability Employment Policy that provides employers with technical assistance on \naccommodating different disabilities.\n\nIn addition to prohibiting discrimination, YouthBuild grantees have positive requirements to ensure equal opportunity \nand prevent discrimination in their programs. YouthBuild grantees are required by 29 CFR 37.29 through 37.32 to \ndisseminate an equal opportunity policy. YouthBuild grantees also must ensure that they provide universal access \nto their programs, including advertising the program in a manner that targets various populations, sending notices \nabout openings in programs to community service groups that serve various populations, and consulting with \ncommunity service groups on ways to improve outreach and service to various populations, as required by 29 CFR \n39.42.\n\nYouthBuild grantees also are required to comply with all generally applicable laws and implementing regulations \nthat apply to the grantees or their participants. For example, for participants who are youth with disabilities and \n\n\nparticipate in secondaryeducation programs, grantees must adhere to the administrative provisions of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Improvement Act at 34 CFR 300.320 through 300.324, which require that grantees \nprovide youth who are individuals with disabilities who enter the program with an appropriate transition plan \ncorresponding to their individual needs.\n\nFinally, proposed \u00a7 688.500(d), implementing sec. 171(e)(5) of WIOA, requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with \nrelevant State and local education standards for their programs and activities that award academic credit or certify \neducational attainment.\n\nSection 688.510How may grantees provide services under the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(h), authorizes grantees to provide services directly or to enter \ninto subgrants, contracts, or other arrangements with various public and private entities. This proposed section \nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.505.\n\nSection 688.520What cost limits apply to the use of YouthBuild program funds?\n\nThis proposed section implements WIOA secs. 171(c)(2)(C)(i) and (c)(2)(D), describing the limitations on the \npercentage of grant funds that a YouthBuild grantee can spend on administrative costs and the rehabilitation or \nconstruction of a community or public facility. The definition of administrative costs can be found in 20 CFR \n683.215.\n\nSection 688.530What are the cost-sharing or matching requirements of the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section provides that the cost-sharing or matching requirements applicable to a YouthBuild grant \ngenerally will be addressed in the grant agreement, and also describes the requirements for several specific costs.\n\nRegarding the use of Federal funds, this section explains that grantees must follow the requirements of 2 CFR parts \n200 and 2900 in the accounting, valuation, and reporting of the required non-Federal share. Additionally, because \ninquiries about the allowability of using Federal funds as part of the cost-sharing or match amount is frequently \nasked by applicants, the regulations restate the prohibition on the use of such funds.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.515.\n\nSection 688.540What are considered to be leveraged funds?\n\nThis proposed section addresses the use of additional money, known as leveraged funds, to support grant \nactivities. It explains that leveraged funds include costs that could be an allowable match but are in excess of the \nmatch requirement or costs that do not meet the cost-sharing and match requirements set forth in the Uniform \nAdministrative Requirements. To be considered leveraged funds, they must be otherwise allowable costs under the \ncost principles which have been used by the grantee to support grant activity. For example, the Department would \nnot allow a grantee to count toward the match requirement another Federal grant used by the grantee or \nsubgrantee to support otherwise allowable activities under the YouthBuild program. However, the Department \nwould consider such a grant a leveraged fund.\n\nThe amount, commitment, nature and quality of the leveraged funds described in the grant application will be \nconsidered as factors in evaluating grants in the FOA. The Department also will require grantees to report the use \nof such funds through their financial report and quarterly narrative report.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.520.\n\nSection 688.550How are the costs associated with real property treated in the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section specifies which costs associated with real property are allowable and unallowable under the \nYouthBuild program. It explains that the costs associated with the acquisition of buildings to be rehabilitated for \ntraining purposes are allowable under the same proportionate share conditions that apply under the match provision \nat \u00a7 688.530, but only with prior grant officer approval. Costs related to construction and/or rehabilitation associated \nwith the training of participants are allowed; however, costs associated with the acquisition of land are not.\n\nSection 688.560What participant costs are allowable under the YouthBuild program?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section permits payments to participants for work-related and non-work-related YouthBuild activities, \nsupportive services, needs-based payments, and additional benefits as allowable participant costs.\n\nSection 688.570Does the Department allow incentive payments in the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section allows incentive payments to youth participants for recognition and achievement directly tied \nto training activities and work experiences. Grantees must outline in writing how they will use incentive payments. \nProposed paragraphs (a) and (b) require that incentive payments be provided in accordance with the organization's \ngeneral policies governing incentives and be related to the goals of the specific YouthBuild program. All incentive \npayments must be provided in accordance with the requirements in 2 CFR 200.\n\nSection 688.580What effect do payments to YouthBuild participants have on eligibility for other Federal needs-\nbased benefits?\n\nThis proposed section explains the effect that payments to YouthBuild participants have on eligibility for other \nFederal needs based benefits. Under WIOA regulations at 20 CFR 683.275(c), allowances, earnings, and payments \nto individuals participating in programs under title I of WIOA are not considered as income for purposes of \ndetermining eligibility for and the amount of income transfer and in-kind aid furnished under any Federal or \nFederally-assisted program based on need other than as provided under the SSA (42 U.S.C. 301).\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.535.\n\nSection 688.590What program income requirements apply to the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section provides that the program income provisions of the Uniform Administrative Requirements at \n2 CFR parts 200 and 2900 apply to the YouthBuild program. This section specifies that the revenue from the sale or \nrental of buildings rehabilitated or constructed under the YouthBuild program to homeless individuals and families or \nlow-income families, as specified in \u00a7 688.730, is not considered program income. The Department encourages \ngrantees to use such revenue for the long-term sustainability of the YouthBuild effort.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.540.\n\nSection 688.600Are YouthBuild programs subject to the Davis-Bacon Act labor standards?\n\nThis proposed section requires that when a YouthBuild participant workson a project subject to Davis-Bacon labor \nstandards, the Davis-Bacon labor standards, including prevailing wage requirements, apply to the hours worked on \nthe site of the work.\n\nThe regulations implementing the Davis-Bacon Act contain a provision that allows for Department-certified training \nprograms to pay less than the applicable prevailing wage rate to trainees when work is being performed on \nFederally-funded projects. As stipulated by 29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)(ii), \u201ctrainees\u201d are not permitted to be paid less than the \npredetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed under an individual registered in a program \nwhich has received prior approval, evidenced by a formal certification by DOL. However, YouthBuild program \nparticipants are not considered \u201ctrainees\u201d and therefore must be paid the prevailing wage rate when they are \nperforming work on Federally-funded projects.\n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.545.\n\nSection 688.610What are the recordkeeping requirements for YouthBuild programs?\n\nThis section sets forth that grantees must follow the recordkeeping requirements specified in the Uniform \nAdministrative Requirements at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, and any additional requirements included in \nsubsequently issued guidance or the grantee's grant agreement. This proposed section retains the same \nrequirements found at 20 CFR 672.550.\n\n7. Subpart F\u2014Additional Requirements\n\nSection 688.700What are the safety requirements for the YouthBuild program?\n\n\n\nThis proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with 20 CFR 683.280, which applies Federal and \nState health and safety standards to the working conditions under WIOA-funded projects safety requirements for \nYouthBuild programs, and the relevant child labor laws at 29 CFR part 570, governing the employment of children \nin hazardous occupations under the Fair Labor Standards Act. This proposed section is meant to protect the health \nand safety of YouthBuild participants on YouthBuild work sites, and to ensure that YouthBuild grantees comply with \nrelevant child labor laws.\n\nSection 688.710What are the reporting requirements for youth safety?\n\nThis proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with the OSHA reporting requirements in 29 CFR \npart 1904 if a participant suffers a reportable injury while participating in the YouthBuild program. This proposed \nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.605.\n\nSection 688.720What environmental protection laws apply to the YouthBuild program?\n\nThis proposed section requires grantees to comply with all environmental protection statutes and regulations, if \napplicable. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.610.\n\nSection 688.730What requirements apply to YouthBuild housing?\n\nIn order to effectively ensure that one of the primary purposes of the YouthBuild program\u2014to increase the stock of \nhousing for homeless and low-income individuals and families\u2014is met, this proposed section provides additional \nrequirements, including a series of restrictions on the sale and use of units of housing built or renovated by a \nYouthBuild grantee.\n\nThis proposed section also requires a YouthBuild grantee to ensure that the owner of the property records a \nrestrictive covenant on the property. The covenant must include the use restrictions in this section and must be for a \nterm of 5 years. The Department requires the recordation of a restrictive covenant to ensure that YouthBuild funds \nare spent on projects that will benefit the intended beneficiaries of the program beyond the life of the grant.\n\nUnder the WIA regulations, grantees were required to ensure that the restrictive covenant was for a 10-year term. \nHowever, grantees have identified the 10-year restrictive covenant as a barrier to recruiting and maintaining \nconstruction partners. The current requirement of a 10-year covenant strictly binds partner organizations that may \nserve low-income populations but also desire flexibility regarding to whom they may sell the property in the future.\n\nThe term of the covenant was shortened in this proposed section in order to accommodate the difficulties faced by \ngrantees while also ensuring that the purpose of the program continues to be met. Reducing the covenant period \nsupports grantees in securing worksites where community-based housing partners and private property owners are \nreluctant to agree to a 10-year covenant requirement. At the same time, a 5-year term ensures that housing built or \nrenovated using YouthBuild funding remains available solely for the use of low-income and/or homeless individuals \nand families for a period beyond the grantee's 3-year period of performance. The Department specifically requests \ncomments on the restrictive covenant requirement and our proposal to shorten the length of the covenant.\n\nM. Part 651\u2014General Provisions Governing the Federal-State Employment Service System\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn this proposed rule, the Department proposes to revise the ES regulations that implement the Wagner-Peyser Act \nof 1933. These include the provision of ESs to all job seekers with a particular emphasis on MSFWs. The proposed \nrule will update the language and content of the regulations to, among other things, implement amendments made \nby title III of WIOA to the Wagner-Peyser Act. In some areas, these regulations establish entirely new \nresponsibilities and procedures; in other areas, the regulations clarify and update requirements already established. \nThe regulations make important changes to the following components of the ES system: definitions, data \nsubmission, and ETA standards for agricultural housing, among others.\n\n2. Background\n\n\n\nThe Wagner-Peyser Act (Wagner-Peyser) of 1933 provided the Department the authority to establish a national ES \nsystem. The ES system provides labor exchange services to its participants and has undergone numerous changes \nto align its activities with broader national workforce development policies and statutory requirements. WIOA \nexpands upon the previous workforce reforms in the WIA and, among other provisions, identifies the ES system as \na core program in the one-stop system, embeds ES State planning requirements into a combined planning \napproach, and increases requirements for the colocation of ES offices into the one-stop centers.\n\nIn 1974, the case National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Western Region, et al. v. \nBrennan et al, No. 2010-72, 1974 WL 229 (D.D.C. Aug. 13, 1974) resulted in a detailed court order mandating \nvarious Federal and State actions (referred to as the Judge Richey Court Order (Richey Order) in the remainder of \nthis preamble). The Richey Order required the Department to implement and maintain a Federal and State \nmonitoring and advocacy system and set forth requirements to ensure the delivery of ES services, benefits, and \nprotections to MSFWs on a non-discriminatory basis, and to provide such services in a manner that isqualitatively \nequivalent and quantitatively proportionate to those provided to non-farmworkers. In 1980, the Department \npublished regulations at 20 CFR parts 651, 653, and 658 to implement the requirements of the Richey Order. Part \n653 sets forth standards and procedures for providing services to MSFWs and provides regulations governing the \nAgricultural Recruitment System (ARS), a system for interstate and intrastate agricultural job recruitment. Part 658 \nsets forth standards and procedures for the administrative handling of complaints alleging violations of ES \nregulations and of employment-related laws, the discontinuation of services to employers by the ES system, the \nreview and assessment of State agency compliance with ES regulations, and the Federal application of remedial \naction to State agencies. Also in 1980, the Department separately published amended regulations at 20 CFR part \n654 providing agricultural housing standards for MSFWs.\n\nIn 1983, the Department published the regulations at 20 CFR part 652 that set forth standards and procedures \nregarding the establishment and functioning of State ES operations. Part 652 was amended in 1999 and 2000 to \nreflect provisions of WIA. The proposed rule aligns part 652 with the WIOA amendments to the ES program, and \nwith the WIOA reforms to the workforce system that affect the ES program.\n\n3. Discussion of Proposed 20 CFR Part 651\n\n20 CFR part 651 sets forth definitions for 20 CFR parts 652, 653, 654, and 658. The Department proposes to revise \nand update the definitions by eliminating outdated or obsolete definitions and by adding new definitions as needed. \nThroughout these parts it is generally proposed that the term \u201cState MSFW monitor advocate\u201d be replaced with the \nterm \u201cState monitor advocate\u201d (SMA) because MSFW-related responsibilities are inherent parts of the SMA position \nand \u201cState monitor advocate\u201d is the commonly used term for the position. It also is proposed that the term \u201clocal \noffice\u201d be replaced with \u201cemployment service office\u201d or \u201cone-stop center\u201d depending on the context. The Department \nalso proposes that the definitions for farmwork, farmworker, and agricultural worker be streamlined through \nreference to the same base line definition \u2014farmwork. Also, the definition of farmwork is proposed to be revised by \ndrawing language from definitions used in other Department regulations and eliminating references to the North \nAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS). Additionally, it is proposed that the definitions found at 20 CFR \n652.1 be moved to 20 CFR 651.10 because it is the intention of part 651 to include Wagner-Peyser ES program \ndefinitions. It is proposed that the following definitions be added as they are provided in sec. 2 of the Wagner-\nPeyser Act, as amended by sec. 302 of WIOA, and pertain to the scope of definitions covered by \u00a7 651.10: Local \nWorkforce Development Board, one-stop center, one-stop delivery system, one-stop partner, training services, and \nworkforce development activity. All of these adhere strictly to WIOA and Wagner-Peyser definitions. The \nDepartment notes that the WIOA amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act also add the definitions of CEO, \ninstitutions of higher education, and workplace learning advisor, but these definitions are not proposed to be added \nto the regulatory text of \u00a7 651.10 because the terms are not used in parts 652, 653, 654, or 658. Finally, sec. 134 of \nWIOA merges the categories of core services and intensive services under WIA into career services. Since WIOA \nincludes responsibilities for the Wagner-Peyser ES in the provision of career services, a definition for career \nservices has been proposed to be added.\n\nThe definition of act is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10, moved from 20 CFR 652.1.\n\n\n\nThe definition of agricultural worker is proposed to be eliminated because the term is synonymous with the \ndefinition of farmworker described in this section. The proposed regulatory text directs the reader to the definition of \nfarmworker.\n\nThe definition of applicant is proposed to be eliminated because the Department proposes to replace the term with \nparticipant as defined in this section. This change is proposed to align with the language in WIOA and conform to \nreporting requirements which include all MSFWs who apply for and/or receive Wagner-Peyser Act services.\n\nThe definitions for Applicant Holding Office, Applicant Holding State, and Order Holding Office are proposed to be \nadded because the terms are used throughout 20 CFR part 658 and adding the definitions clarifies the process for \nstakeholders. The proposed language in each definition derives from the purpose and scope defined in \u00a7 653.500. \nThe inclusion of \u201cU.S. workers\u201d in these definitions helps to clarify that ARS is intended for the recruitment of U.S.-\nbased workers only.\n\nThe definition of application card is proposed to be deleted as the document is generally no longer used as part of \nWagner-Peyser Act services. ES offices have moved from a paper-based system to an online system and \nparticipants register for services in a variety of ways electronically.\n\nThe definition of career services is proposed to be added, as discussed above.\n\nA definition of clearance order is proposed to be added to distinguish it from a job order.\n\nThe definition of clearance is proposed to be revised to clearance system and reflect secs. 3 and 7 of the Wagner-\nPeyser Act, as well as 20 CFR 652.3, which describes the basic labor exchange system as \u201ca system for clearing \nlabor between States.\u201d The updated language clarifies that this clearance system moves job seekers through an \nES office or more than one such office, depending on the needs of the individual and the available job or jobs.\n\nA revised definition of complaint is proposed to align with language in sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as \namended by WIOA sec. 302, to refer to \u201cemployment service\u201d offices rather than \u201cjob service\u201d (JS) offices. The \nrevised definition specifies that complaints are representations or referrals of alleged violations of ES regulations, \nFederal laws enforced by the Department's WHD or OSHA, or State or local employment-related laws. The \nDepartment proposes to add language in the definition clarifying that the complaints filed are alleging a violation \noccurred, rather than confirming that a complaint represents an actual violation\u2014which may be determined after the \ncomplaint is under investigation pursuant to 658 subpart F.\n\nThe definition of day haul is proposed to be deleted as the term is no longer relevant with the proposed deletion of \n20 CFR 653.105 and 653.106.\n\nA revised definition of Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is proposed to conform to the description of \nETA that is currently used.\n\nA definition of employment-related laws is proposed to be added to conform to the proposed complaint procedures \nin 20 CFR part 658.\n\nA definition of the term Employment Service (ES) is proposed to replace the definition for the term Job Service (JS) \nin order to conform to the terminology used in the Wagner-Peyser Act as amended by WIOA. For this reason, \nthroughout these proposed regulations, the term Employment Service (ES) replaces the term JS.\n\nA definition of Employment Service regulations (ES regulations) is proposed to replace the definition of JS \nregulations. The purpose of this changeis to conform to language in the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA, \nand to include only relevant regulations. The proposed definition now includes Federal regulations at 20 CFR parts \n651, 652, 653, 654, and 658 and at 29 CFR part 75, and removes references to 20 CFR parts 620 and 621 \nbecause they are reserved, the reference to 29 CFR part 8 because Employment Service is not referenced in that \npart, and 29 CFR part 26 because it does not exist.\n\n\n\nThe proposed definition of farmwork will eliminate references to NAICS codes and include language aligning it with \npertinent definitions in other Department regulations at 29 CFR 500.20 and 20 CFR 655.103(c). Drawing language \nfrom those definitions clarifies what is covered by the term farmwork and slightly expands the term to include certain \noccupations and activities covered by the Department's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) and/or WHD. It \nis also proposed that the revised definition of farmwork fold in food \u201cprocessing\u201d work to align \u00a7 651.10 with OFLC \nregulations at 20 CFR 655.103(c)(1) which include food processing worker in the definition for agricultural labor or \nservices. Including food processing work in the revised definition expands the scope of those who would be \nconsidered farmworkers. It also allows the Department to streamline the regulations by eliminating the separate \ndefinition of migrant food processing worker without reducing ES coverage or protections of such workers. The \naddition of food processing work to the revised definition of farmwork also expands the capability of Wagner-Peyser \nstaff to provide services to more MSFWs. The Department will provide guidance to clarify what is considered food \n\u201cprocessing.\u201d Fish farming is added to conform to sec. 167 of WIOA.\n\nThe reference to \u201c. . . the cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and \nharvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities\u201d and \u201c[t]his includes the raising of livestock, bees, fur-\nbearing animals, or poultry, the farming of fish, and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) \nperformed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including \npreparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market \u201d is adapted from \n20 CFR 655.103(c)(2) which references 29 U.S.C. 203(f), as amended (sec. 3(f) of the FLSA, as codified). The \nlanguage \u201cthe handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, or grading prior to delivery for \nstorage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state,\u201d is adapted from 20 CFR 655.103 \nwhich references sec. 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 3121(g)). The language \n\u201cagricultural commodities means all commodities produced on a farm including, but not limited to, crude gum \n(oleoresin) from a living tree, and the following products as processed by the original producer of the crude gum \n(oleoresin) from which derived: gum spirits of turpentine and gum rosin\u201d is taken from OFLC 20 CFR 655.103 and \naligns with WHD 29 CFR 500.20. Under the proposed definition, the activities and services currently included by \nreference to NAICS codes 111, 112, 115 will still be included whether explicit in the definition or through \nDepartment guidance, and those activities and services currently excluded by reference to NAICS codes 1152 and \n1153 will still be excluded, excepting the proposed addition of fish farming. The NAICS reference to code 1125 will \nbe covered through Department guidance as it relates to fish farming.\n\nThe Department anticipates the following impact of expanding the definition of farmworker and aligning it with the \nWHD and OFLC definitions: (1) State agency employees will more easily distinguish MSFWs for reporting \npurposes; (2) the proposed definition will also align with that of the proposed updated definition under 20 CFR part \n685 for the NFJP; (3) more farmworkers will be served as such under Wagner-Peyser because fewer people would \nbe excluded under the expanded definition; (4) the Department will maintain consistency with the intent of the \nRichey Order to update data gathering systems to accurately reflect services delivered; and (5) the Department's \ndata reporting will improve because under the different regulations, the Department's agencies will utilize basically \nthe same definition for farmworker and therefore will accurately reflect the number of MSFWs identified across all \nprograms. At the end of the proposed definition, the Department proposes to add a sentence to include any service \nor activity covered under 20 CFR 655.103(c) (definition of agricultural labor or services) and/or under 29 CFR \n500.20(e) (agricultural employment) and/or through official published Department guidance, such as a TEGL, to \nallow for other current or future types of farmwork to be included.\n\nA revised definition of farmworker is proposed to conform to the proposed definition of farmwork in this section.\n\nA definition of field checks is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10 because the term is referenced in 20 CFR 653.503 \nbut was previously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the meaning for those who conduct or receive field \nchecks.\n\nA definition of field visits is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10 because the term is referenced in 20 CFR 653.108 \nbut was previously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the meaning for those who conduct or receive field \nvisits.\n\n\n\nThe definition of full application is proposed to be deleted because State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) generally do \nnot utilize the full or partial application process. Instead, participants submit resumes or other information to register \nin the SWA network.\n\nThe definition of Governor is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10, moved from 20 CFR 652.1. Additionally, the \nDepartment proposes to add reference to the outlying areas in the definition to be clear that their chief executives \nare included when this part references a Governor.\n\nThe definition of identification card is proposed to be deleted as the document is no longer utilized as part of \nWagner-Peyser services. SWAs have moved from paper-based to electronic-based systems and participants often \nlog in using whatever information is required for that particular system.\n\nA definition of interstate job order is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10 because it is referenced in the ES \nregulations but was previously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the difference between interstate and \nintrastate job orders.\n\nA revised definition of intrastate clearance order is proposed to conform to the \u201cemployment service\u201d terminology \nused in the Wagner-Peyser Act as amended by WIOA. Interstate or intrastate clearance order means an \nagricultural job order for temporary employment describing one or more hard-to-fill job openings, which an ES office \nuses to request recruitment assistance from other ES offices.\n\nThe definition of job bank is proposed to be deleted because the system, as it was previously defined, no longer \nexists. Now, most job openings are posted on internet-based systems.\n\nThe definition of job development is proposed to be slightly revised to refer to an \u201cemployment service office\u201d rather \nthan a \u201clocal office.\u201d\n\nThe definition of Job Information Service (JIS) is proposed to be deleted as resource centers replace JIS areas \ninside one-stop centers.\n\nIn the definition of job opening, it is proposed that the term applicants be replaced with the term participants to be \nconsistent with the replacement term applicant in this section.\n\nA definition of job order is proposed to be added to clarify the difference between a job order and a clearance order. \nThe language for this definition is derived from 20 CFR 655.5.\n\nThe definition of job referral is proposed to be revised to include \u201cor for a potential job\u201d because the current \ndefinition is limited to the availability of a specific job and this revision opens job referrals to include situations that \nare responding to the possibility of employment.\n\nA revised definition of labor market area is proposed to be revised to conform to the definition in sec. 3 of WIOA.\n\nThe definition of Local Office Manager is proposed to be revised to conform to the \u201cemployment service\u201d \nterminology used in the Wagner-Peyser Act as amended by WIOA.\n\nThe definition of Local Workforce Development Board is proposed to be added to conform with sec. 2 of the \nWagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA.\n\nThe definition of migrant farmworker is proposed to be revised to conform to the updated definition of farmworker.\n\nThe definition of migrant food processing worker is proposed to be synonymous with the proposed definition of \nmigrant farmworker.\n\nWithin the definition of MSFW it is proposed that \u201cmigrant food processing worker\u201d be deleted to conform to the \nabove proposed definition of migrant food processing worker. No reduction in coverage is intended by this change.\n\n\n\nThe definitions of one-stop center, one-stop delivery system, and one-stop partner are proposed to be added to \u00a7 \n651.10 to conform with sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA.\n\nThe definition of O*NET-SOC is proposed to be revised to clarify that O*NET SOC codes are based on, but more \ndetailed than, Standard Occupation Codes used across Federal statistical agencies.\n\nThe definition of Order Holding Office is proposed to be added for reasons explained above.\n\nThe definition of onsite review is proposed to be added because these reviews are mandated under the Richey \nOrder and are found throughout the regulations at 20 CFR parts 653 and 658. The language for the proposed \ndefinition is taken from 20 CFR 653.108(g).\n\nIt is proposed that the definition of outreach contact be added to \u00a7 651.10 for clarification. The language for the \ndefinition is taken from \u00a7 653.107.\n\nThe definition of partial application is proposed to be deleted because it is generally no longer used by ES offices or \nSWAs. Instead, participants submit resumes or other information to register in the SWA network.\n\nThe definition of participant is proposed to be added to replace the definition of applicant, as discussed above. This \ndefinition only applies to the Wagner-Peyser regulations at parts 651, 652, 653, and 658. Proposed \u00a7 677.150(a) \nincludes a separate, narrower definition of \u201cparticipant\u201d for purposes of performance accountability under sec. 116 \nof WIOA and 20 CFR part 677. Therefore, an individual who is considered a participant for the purpose of these \nWagner-Peryser regulations would not necessarily be considered a participant for performance accountability \npurposes.\n\nThe definition of Program Budget Plan (PBP) is proposed to be deleted because the PBP is obsolete and the \namendment to sec. 8 of Wagner-Peyser now calls for States to submit Unified or Combined State Plans.\n\nThe definition of RA is proposed to be deleted because the definition for Regional Administrator with the appropriate \nacronym is already described in this section.\n\nThe definition for rural area is proposed to be eliminated because the term is not used at 20 CFR parts 652, 653, \n654, or 658 and is therefore not necessary to define in this section.\n\nThe definition of seasonal farmworker is proposed to be revised to mean an individual who, over the past 12 \nmonths, has been employed in farmwork of a seasonal or other temporary nature. This proposed definition seeks to \nsimplify and clarify the meaning of seasonal farmworker, and conform to the definitions used by the Department's \nWHD for seasonal agricultural workers under 29 CFR part 500, and the OFLC under 20 CFR part 655. Additionally, \nthe Department proposes to retain the 12-month period originally used in the definition of seasonal farmworker at \n20 CFR 651.10 to minimize the time period that an individual could assert that he/she is a seasonal farmworker. \nThe Department anticipates that this updated definition will more accurately reflect the total number of seasonal \nfarmworkers that participate in the ES system. The Department also anticipates that ES staff will more easily be \nable to identify seasonal farmworkers for reporting purposes.\n\nIn the definitions of Significant MSFW Local Offices and Significant Bilingual MSFW Local Offices, the references to \n\u201clocal offices\u201d are proposed to be replaced with \u201cone-stop centers\u201d because the WIOA amendment to the Wagner-\nPeyser Act requires colocation of Wagner-Peyser ESs in a one-stop center. Additionally, expanding the scope of \nthe term will help States determine not only at which one-stop centers ESs must be sufficiently staffed to meet the \nneeds of MSFWs, but also will identify one-stop centers that need to consider the needs of a significant number of \nMSFWs who do not speak English, in order to meet the requirements for making services accessible, as described \nin \u00a7 678.800. This also helps the Department conform to the intent of the Richey Order to serve MSFWs on a \nqualitatively equivalent and quantitatively proportionate basis. The term bilingual is proposed to be replaced with \nmultilingual in the latter title to conform to the current trend of MSFWs speaking additional languages other than \nEnglish and/or Spanish. Also, the references to \u201capplicants\u201d are proposed to be replaced with \u201cparticipants,\u201d to \nconform to the proposed changes in these definitions.\n\n\n\nThe definition of Significant MSFW States remains unchanged; however, the reference to the Department \norganizational unit ETA has been replaced with the Department to be consistent with other references throughout \nthe section.\n\nThe definition of State Administrator is proposed to be revised to change \u201cState Employment Security Agency\u201d to \n\u201cState Workforce Agency\u201d to reflect language used in WIOA title I.\n\nThe definition of State Workforce Agency (SWA) is proposed to be revised to conform to sec. 2 of the Wagner-\nPeyser Act, as amended by title III of WIOA. The language \u201cformerly State Employment Security Agency or SESA\u201d \nis proposed to be deleted because the SESA terminology is outdated and no longer needs reference.\n\nThe definition of State Workforce Development Board (State Board) is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10, moved \nfrom 20 CFR 652.1 and updated from the former text, which defined State Workforce Investment Board.\n\nThe definition of Supply State(s) is proposed to be added to clarify its meaning under the ARS.\n\nThe definition of supportive services is proposed to be revised to conform to the definition for \u201csupportive services\u201d \nin sec. 3 of WIOA and to make clear that supportive services are also available toindividuals participating in \nactivities funded by the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\nThe definition of tests is proposed to be deleted because the Department does not offer tests to ES participants.\n\nThe definition of training services is proposed to replace the definition of training, and the proposed definition \nreferences the services provided under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3).\n\nThe definition of transaction is proposed to be deleted because the term is not used in the relevant sections under \nthis chapter.\n\nA definition of unemployment insurance claimant is proposed to be added in this section to conform to the emphasis \non serving this population in the WIOA amendments to secs. 7(a)(1) and (3) of the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\nThe definition of vocational plan is proposed to be deleted because the Wagner-Peyser Act does not require the \nestablishment of such plans for job seekers in the ES system.\n\nThe definition of WIOA is proposed to be added to \u00a7 651.10, moved from 20 CFR 652.1 and updated. Section 652.1 \ndefines WIA.\n\nThe definitions of Workforce and Labor Market Information (WLMI) and Workforce Labor Market Information \nSystem (WLMIS) are proposed to conform to the provisions in sec. 308 of the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\nThe definition for working days is proposed to be added to 20 CFR 651 because it is originally located in 20 CFR \n653.501 and fits more appropriately under part 651.\n\nA definition of work test is proposed to be added in this section to ensure that individuals who are eligible for UI \nbenefits meet continued eligibility requirements with respect to work search. The Wagner-Peyser Act's \nrequirements for administering the work test are further discussed in 20 CFR 652.210.\n\nN. Part 652\u2014Establishment and Functioning of State Employment Services\n\nSection 1. Introduction\n\nThe Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 established the one Act ES, which is a nationwide system of public employment \noffices amended in 1998 to make ES part of the one-stop delivery system established under WIA. ES seeks to \nimprove the functioning of the nation's labor markets by bringing together individuals seeking employment with \nemployers seeking workers.\n\n\n\nThe amended Wagner-Peyser Act furthers longstanding goals of closer collaboration with other employment and \ntraining programs by mandating colocation of ES offices with one-stop centers; aligning service delivery in the one-\nstop delivery system; and ensuring alignment of State planning and performance measures in the one-stop delivery \nsystem. Other new provisions are consistent with long-term Departmental policies, including increased emphasis \non reemployment services for UI claimants (sec. 7(a)); promoting robust WLMI; the development of national \nelectronic tools for jobseekers and businesses (sec. 3(e)); dissemination of information on best practices (sec. \n3(c)(2)); and professional development for ES staff (secs. 3(c)(4) and 7(b)(3)).\n\n2. Subpart A\u2014Employment Service Operations\n\nThis subpart includes an explanation of the scope and purpose of the ES system, the rules governing allotments \nand grant agreements, authorized services, administrative provisions, and rules governing labor disputes. The \nproposed rule makes few changes in subpart A.\n\nSection 652.1Introduction\n\nThis section introduces the Wagner-Peyser Act regulations, as amended by WIOA. Therefore, the Department \nproposes to delete paragraph (b) of \u00a7 652.1 and change the title of the section from \u201cIntroduction and definitions\u201d to \n\u201cIntroduction.\u201d\n\nSection 652.2Scope and Purpose of the Employment Service System\n\nThe Department proposes no changes in this section, which briefly describes the public labor exchange system.\n\nSection 652.3Public Labor Exchange Services System\n\nThis section explains the minimum services that must be offered by the public labor exchange system. The \nDepartment proposes adding paragraph (f) to align the title to the changes in WIOA and cite to sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(iv) \nof WIOA.\n\nThe Department proposes to align the Wagner-Peyser definitions of labor exchange services with those described \nunder WIOA. The Department is seeking public comments on any issues or challenges in aligning labor exchange \nservices described under WIOA with the labor exchange services provided by the ES.\n\nFinally, the Department proposes to add to \u00a7 652.3(a) a clause to implement the emphasis the Act, as amended, \nplaces on national electronic tools (WIOA sec. 303(c), amending sec. 3(e) of Wagner-Peyser). The proposed \nclause, which would clarify that each State's obligation to assist jobseekers includes promoting their familiarity with \nthe Department's electronic tools, is designed to improve customer access to labor exchange and workforce \ninformation.\n\nThe statutory provision recognizes the Department's longstanding efforts in this area. Since the 1990s, the \nDepartment has greatly expanded its national electronic tools to enhance short-term labor exchanges and support \nlonger-term career aspirations for multiple audiences: Jobseekers; employers; students; employment and training \nstaff; educators and guidance counselors; Federal, State and local policy-makers and planners; CBOs; librarians; \nand other individuals and entities that assist with the job search and career needs of Americans. The Department \noffers electronic tools through such Web portals as CareerOneStop (www.careeronestop.org); O*NET OnLine (           \nwww.onetonline.org) and O*NET's My Next Move (           www.mynextmove.org); and the WLMI provided through \nthe BLS (           www.bls.gov) and the U.S. ETA's Labor Market Information Community of Practice (           \nSection 652.4Allotment of Funds and Grant Agreement\n\nThe Department proposes no changes in this section, which ensures that allotment information is publicly available \nwith sufficient notice to allow public comment and to resolve complaints, and that grant agreements with the States \nmeet all applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nSection 652.5Services Authorized\n\nhttp://www.careeronestop.org/\nhttp://www.onetonline.org/\nhttp://www.mynextmove.org/\nhttp://www.bls.gov/\n\nThe Department proposes only minor changes conforming to WIOA in this section, State expenditures. Specifically, \nthe proposed regulations substitutes \u201cfunds\u201d with \u201csums\u201d and substitutes \u201cbasic labor exchange elements\u201d with \n\u201cminimum labor exchange elements.\u201d Both changes were made to align with the Act as amended.\n\nSection 652.8Administrative Provisions\n\nThis section covers administrative matters, including financial and program management information systems, \nrecordkeeping and retention of records, required reports, monitoring and audits, costs, disclosure of information, \nand sanctions. The Department proposes to eliminate paragraph (d)(6) of this section which addressed amortization \npayments toStates which had independent retirement plans in their State ES agencies prior to 1980. This \nparagraph is no longer applicable to any State and no State may revert back to a retirement system where these \nprovisions apply. The Department is also proposing to change the record retention requirements for work \napplications and job orders from 1 year to 3 years in order to align with other Wagner-Peyser record retention \nrequirements. Finally, the Department proposes to amend paragraph (f) to require that financial audits be \nconducted under the same requirements that apply to audits under WIOA at 20 CFR 683.210.\n\nSection 652.9 Labor Disputes.\n\nThis section is designed to preserve the neutrality of the ES in the event of a labor dispute, such as a strike. The \nDepartment proposes no changes in this section, as WIOA made no amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act \nrelevant to this section.\n\n3. Subpart B\u2014Services for Veterans\n\nThis subpart merely refers the reader to the relevant regulatory section governing services to veterans.\n\nSection 652.100Services for Veterans\n\nThe Department proposes to amend this section to clarify that veterans receive priority of service for all \nDepartment-funded employment and training programs, as described in 20 CFR part 1010. The proposed \namendment also clarifies that the Department's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) administers \nthe Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program and other activities and training programs which provide \nservices to specific populations of eligible veterans.\n\n4. Subpart C\u2014Wagner-Peyser Act Services in a One-Stop Delivery System Environment\n\nThis subpart discusses State agency roles and responsibilities, rules governing ES offices, the relationship between \nthe ES and the one-stop system, required and allowable Wagner-Peyser services, universal service access \nrequirements, provision of services and work test requirements for UI claimants, State planning, and State merit \nstaffing requirements.\n\nWIOA ensures the ES's key role in the one-stop delivery system by making it one of the core workforce programs. \nThe ES must be a part of the State planning process, collocated with the one-stop delivery system, and must align \nits service delivery and performance measures with the rest of the one-stop system. This subpart addresses how \nthe ES is to fulfill its mission of providing labor exchange services to job seekers and businesses in the one-stop \ndelivery system.\n\nSection 652.200What is the Purpose of This Subpart?\n\nThe general purpose of this subpart is to provide guidance for implementing Wagner-Peyser services within the \none-stop delivery system.\n\nSection 652.201What is the role of the State agency in the one-stop delivery system?\n\nThis section emphasizes the leadership role played by the State in the one-stop system, including the delivery of \nWagner-Peyser services. The Department proposes changing \u201cWorkforce Investment Board\u201d to \u201cWorkforce \nDevelopment Board,\u201d to be consistent with WIOA's terminology.\n\nSection 652.202May local Employment Service Offices exist outside of the one-stop service delivery system?\n\n\n\nThe Department is proposing to delete paragraph (b) of this section to align with WIOA's approach to colocation of \nservices and prohibition against stand-alone employment service offices. Additionally, the Department proposes to \nchange the text of what was paragraph (a) to provide a clear statement that ES offices must be collocated in one-\nstop centers, as required by WIOA. WIA strongly encouraged the colocation of ES and one-stop offices, but \nallowed some stand-alone ES offices under limited circumstances. Section 303(d) of WIOA modified sec. 3(d) of \nWagner-Peyser to eliminate these exceptions and made colocation mandatory. Therefore, stand-alone ES offices \nare no longer permissible, as explained in \u00a7\u00a7 678.310-678.315.\n\nColocation is intended to achieve several purposes: improved service delivery and coordination, less duplication of \nservices, and greater access to services in underserved areas.\n\nSection 652.203Who is responsible for funds authorized under the Act in the workforce investment system?\n\nThe Department proposes no changes in this regulation, which stipulates that the State agency is responsible for all \nWagner-Peyser funds.\n\nSection 652.204Must funds authorized under the Act (the Governor's reserve) flow through the one-stop delivery \nsystem?\n\nThis section clarifies that the Governor's reserve funds may or may not be delivered through the one-stop system. \nThe Department proposes to identify the services in sec. 7(b) of the Act that these funds must be used to provide. \nWIOA does not change these services; however, it is helpful to list the services in this section. As required by sec. \n7(b) of the Act, the services are: performance incentives, supporting exemplary models of service delivery, and \nservices for groups with special needs.\n\nSection 652.205May funds authorized under the Act be used to supplement funding for labor exchange programs \nauthorized under separate legislation?\n\nThe Department proposes only minor nomenclature changes in this section, which explains under what conditions \nfunds under secs. 7(a) or 7(b) of Wagner-Peyser may be used to provide additional funds to other programs.\n\nSection 652.206May a State use funds authorized under the Act to provide applicable \u201ccareer services,\u201d as defined \nin the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nThe Department is proposing in this section to align Wagner-Peyser service delivery with the service delivery \nchanges in WIOA. Under WIA, non-training services were generally identified as either \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cintensive\u201d \nservices. WIOA has removed the terms \u201ccore\u201d and \u201cintensive\u201d and these services are now called \u201ccareer services.\u201d \nThe primary goal of the change to \u201ccareer services\u201d was to eliminate any sequencing of service requirements and to \nensure participants had a broad array of services available to them based on a participant's employment needs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 678.430 organizes the WIOA career services into three categories: (1) Career services that must be \nmade available to all participants; (2) career services that must be made available if deemed appropriate and \nneeded for an individual to obtain or retain employment; and (3) follow-up activities. The proposed regulation \nrespectively designates these categories as basic career services (\u00a7 678.430(a)), individualized career services (\u00a7 \n678.430(b)), and follow-up services (\u00a7 678.430(c)).\n\nLabor exchange services, which are the primary services provided by the ES, fall under the \u201cbasic career \nservices\u201didentified in proposed \u00a7 678.430(a) and listed in sec. 134(c)(2)(A) of WIOA. This section is designed to \nprovide that Wagner-Peyser staff must use funds authorized by sec. 7(a) of the Act to provide the basic career \nservices.\n\nIndividualized career services are identified in proposed \u00a7 678.430(b) and listed in sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) of WIOA. \nThese services involve more dedicated staff time to provide. These services are similar to intensive services and \nthey may be provided as appropriate. The primary services the ES provides are labor exchange services, which are \nidentified by the Department as basic career services. The Department proposes that the ES staff may also provide \nindividualized career services, paid for from funds authorized under sec. 7(a) of the Act, in a manner consistent with \nthe requirements of the Wagner-Peyser Act. Additionally, the Department wishes to clarify that the funds can be \n\n\n\nused to provide any of the individualized services defined in proposed \u00a7 678.430(b) and sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) of \nWIOA; there is no limit that the funds can only be used for particular individualized services. However, these \nWagner-Peyser funds may not be used to provide training services.\n\nThe Department is seeking comments on how services provided by the ES can be more aligned with other services \nin the one-stop delivery system and ensure participants can receive seamless services from the ES to other \nprograms under WIOA.\n\nSection 652.207How does a State meet the requirement for universal access to services provided under the Act?\n\nThis section provides States discretion in meeting universal access to service requirements, and explains the \nrequirements, including how those services must be delivered. The section specifies that labor exchange services \nmay be provided through self-service, facilitated self-help service, and staff-assisted services. The Department is \nproposing to include \u201cvirtual services\u201d as a type of self-service. The Department recognizes the valuable virtual and \nonline services that States provide through the ES, and seeks to include these services as self-services.\n\nThe Department also proposes changes in this section to tie it to the mandatory services described in \u00a7 652.206. \nThe revised provision would replace the reference to core and intensive services with reference to career services \nmade mandatory by an amended \u00a7 652.206.\n\nSection 652.208How are applicable career services related to the methods of service delivery described in this \npart?\n\nThis section explains how career services may be delivered to meet the requirements for access described in \nproposed \u00a7 652.207(b)(2). The Department proposes to include \u201cvirtual services\u201d as a type of self-service provided \nby the ES, recognizing these important services provided by States. The Department is also proposing to replace \nthe reference to \u201ccore services and intensive services\u201d with a reference to \u201ccareer services\u201d per WIOA.\n\nSection 652.209What are the requirements under the Act for providing reemployment services and other activities \nto referred unemployment insurance claimants?\n\nThe Wagner-Peyser Act authorizes funding for States to deliver a wide array of labor exchange services to \njobseekers. This regulation clarifies the required and allowable Wagner-Peyser services to UI claimants, as a \nsubset of the broader ES beneficiary population.\n\nWIOA added language to sec. 7(a) of the Wagner-Peyser Act reemphasizing the use of funds to support \nreemployment and related services to UI claimants. These changes strengthen the connectivity between the ES \nand the UI systems, and broaden opportunities for these systems to help UI claimants return to employment as \nquickly as possible. Coordination of labor exchange services and UI claimant services is essential to ensure an \nintegrated approach to reemployment strategies. Wagner-Peyser funds may also be used to administer the work \ntest for the State unemployment system for UI eligibility assessments. Additionally, the ES may provide UI \nclaimants with referrals to, and application assistance for, education and training resources and programs as \nappropriate. Such resources include those provided through the Higher Education Act and State-specific \neducational assistance programs, veterans' educational assistance programs, WIOA education and training \nprograms, and VR services.\n\nThe Department proposes two types of changes in \u00a7 652.209: one to clearly require services to UI claimants, and \nthe other to implement new statutory provisions. The proposed text deletes the existing \u00a7 652.209(a) language that \nservices must be provided \u201cto the extent funding is available,\u201d because it is implied and the Department encourages \nreemployment assistance to UI claimants.\n\nThe proposed text includes in \u00a7 652.209(b)(2) a reference to \u201cconducting eligibility assessments\u201d to conform with \nsec. 7(a)(3)(F) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA, and includes a requirement that where applicable, \nUI claimants must be registered for ESs in accordance with the UC law of the State with which they file their claim. \nThe States may use Wagner-Peyser funds to pay for eligibility assessments, which is a required activity that must \nbe made available when appropriate.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in \u00a7 652.209(b)(3) the Department proposes to require that States provide referrals and application \nassistance to UI claimants, consistent with the new statutory language in sec. 7(a)(3)(G) of the Wagner-Peyser Act \nand includes a reference to the Post-9/11 GI Bill which staff may also refer participants to as well as other veterans \neducational assistance.\n\nSection 652.210What are the Act's requirements for administration of the work test, including eligibility \nassessments, as appropriate, and assistance to unemployment insurance claimants?\n\nThis section clarifies the requirement for administration of the work test to UI claimants. The proposed changes \nprovide more specificity about required services.\n\nThe Department proposes to include a reference to \u201cconducting eligibility assessments\u201d to conform with sec. \n7(a)(3)(F) of the Wagner-Peyser Act. The States may use Wagner-Peyser funds to pay for eligibility assessments, \nwhich are a required reemployment activity that must be made available when appropriate. Proposed new \nlanguage was also added to \u00a7 652.210(b)(3) to ensure that ES staff provide information about UI claimants' ability \nor availability for work, or the suitability of work offered to them, to UI staff. Sharing such information with UI staff \nwill help accelerate claimants' return to employment.\n\nSection 652.211What are State planning requirements under the Act?\n\nThe Department is proposing to remove the planning provisions of this part of the regulation, including the text in \u00a7\u00a7 \n652.211 through 652.214, because the ES is a core program under WIOA and falls under both the unified and \ncombined planning requirements. This section has been amended to simply provide a citation to the State planning \nrequirements under WIOA.\n\nSection 652.215Do any provisions in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act change the requirement that \nState merit staff employees must deliver services provided under the Act?\n\nThis section stipulates that only State merit staff may provide Wagner-Peyser services. The only change proposed \nin this section is to change \u201cWIA\u201d to \u201cWIOA\u201d in the section question; the remainder of the text has not changed from \nthe existing regulation. The Department has followed this policy since the earliest years of the ES, in order to \nensure minimum standards for the quality of the services provided. A 1998 U.S. District Court decision, Michigan v. \nHerman, 81 F. Supp. 2nd 840 (http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/) upheld \nthis policy. State merit staff employees are directly accountable to State government entities, and the standards \nfor their performance and their determinations on the use of public funds require that decisions be made in the best \ninterest of the public and of the population to be served. State merit staff meet objective professional qualifications \nand provide impartial, transparent information and services to all customers while complying with established \ngovernment standards.\n\nSection 652.216May the one-stop operator provide guidance to State merit staff employees in accordance with the \nAct?\n\nThis section clarifies that ES staff may receive guidance from a one-stop operator about the provision of labor \nexchange services, but that all personnel matters remain under the authority of the State agency. The only change \nproposed in this section is to add a reference to proposed \u00a7 678.500, which provides the requirements for the local \nMOU. The Department seeks comment on whether any other changes are needed to allow the one-stop operator to \nensure the efficient and effective operation of the one-stop center.\n\n5. Subpart D\u2014Workforce and Labor Market Information\n\nSecretary of Labor's role concerning the Workforce and Labor Market Information System (WLMIS). The Wagner-\nPeyser Act, as amended by and integrated with WIOA, envisions a robust WLMIS that is a critical underpinning for \na wide array of workforce functions, including: (1) Supporting State and regional planning of workforce strategies \nthat provide a pipeline of workers with in-demand skills and drive economic growth and development; (2) delivery \nof quality labor market and career information that enables workforce professionals to provide quality career \ncounseling; and (3) enabling the workforce system's customers to make informed career and service delivery \n\nhttp://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/\n\n\nchoices. New provisions in Wagner-Peyser provide for a collaborative process, led by the Secretary of Labor in \npartnership with Federal agencies, the newly created Workforce Information Advisory Council (WIAC), and States, \nto develop and implement a strategic plan that continuously improves the labor market and workforce information \navailable through the workforce system. The Act describes certain key components of the WLMIS and commits the \nSecretary of Labor to oversee and ensure the competent management of the system.\n\nWage records are a critical data source for WLMIS. When combined with data from other sources, wage records \nproduce a wide array of labor market information used to inform economic development, support career counseling, \nidentify training needs, inform industry sector workforce strategies, and assist with other facets of a job-driven \nworkforce system.\n\nFor example, through agreements with States, wage records are used to produce the following aggregate reports \nand data that support the objectives listed above:\n\n    The United States Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program including the:\n\n\u25cb Quarterly Workforce Explorer, that provides worker residence and work place location data and critical \nemployment and business related data including hiring, worker separations, and turnover rates, at State, county, \nmetro and Workforce Development Board areas;\n\n\u25cb OnTheMap, that provides geographic information system (GIS) capabilities to map worker origin and destination \ninformation on detail map overlays in customized geographic areas at a Census block level; and\n\n\u25cb OnTheMap for Emergency Management tools, that provides GIS capabilities to map natural disasters including \nfire, flood, and storm and the impact on workers and businesses in customized geographic areas at the Census \nblock level area.\n\n    The DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which provides a complete \ncount of employment and wages, classified by industry and based on quarterly reports filed by employers for over \n9 million establishments subject to unemployment insurance laws.\n\nContinuous improvement, in part through consultation. The Act requires the Secretary of Labor to oversee, and the \nStates to pursue actively, the \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d of the WLMIS. (3) The Act, throughout, describes \ncomponents of the system and ways in which the Secretary and the States must act to discharge their duties under \nthe Act, including their duties related to \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201d Proposed \u00a7 652.300(a) is a general statement \nimplementing this requirement. It provides, as does the Act, that the Secretary must oversee the development, \nmaintenance, and continuous improvement of the WLMIS. The reference to Wagner-Peyser sec. 15 simply signals \nthe section where the WLMIS is defined; the provision does not mean to state that sec. 15 is the only section where \nthe duty of continuous improvement is created.\n\nProposed \u00a7 652.300(b) implements the Secretary's more specific duties with regard to the WLMIS, as they are \ndescribed in Wagner-Peyser sec. 15(b)(2). The proposed regulation closely tracks the statute with respect to duties \nrelated to collection, analysis, and dissemination of workforce and labor market information. These include, for \nexample, the duty to eliminate gaps and duplication in statistical undertakings. The Act also identifies certain \nactivities that should be considered to improve data sources. For example, sec. 15(b)(2) requires the Secretary, to \nensure that data collected is consistent with appropriate Bureau of Labor Statistics standards and definitions and \nunderstandable to users of such data; and to develop consistent procedures and definitions for use by States in the \ncollection of data. Earlier, in sec. 15(a)(1)(E), the Act requires that the WLMIS include \u201cprocedures to support \nstandardization and aggregation of data from administrative reporting systems.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the breadth of these and other requirements it imposes on the Secretary, the statute\u2014at sec. \n15(b)(2)\u2014establishes an expectation that the Secretary will discuss and fulfill the requirements in active \ncollaboration with the WIAC, Federal agencies, and States. Proposed \u00a7 652.302(b) incorporates this consultation \nrequirement, while reserving our authority to consult with other stakeholders. To the extent that the dataand tools \nused in the context of the WLMIS are owned by other Federal agencies, such as LEHD data which is owned by the \n\n\n\nCensus Bureau subject to the authority of title 13 of the U.S. Code, the Secretary of Labor will work collaboratively \nwith the owners of such data or data tools to coordinate the use of those tools with the WLMIS and to identify \npotential enhancements, but the Secretary of Labor has no direct authority with regard to those tools.\n\nProposed \u00a7 652.300 works in conjunction with certain amendments to 20 CFR part 651. In order to clarify the \nSecretary's jurisdiction with respect to the Employment Service and related workforce systems\u2014in particular, with \nrespect to responsibilities related to \u201ccontinuous improvement,\u201d performance assessment, and collection and \nmanagement of information\u2014the Department proposes new regulatory definitions for \u201cWorkforce and Labor Market \nInformation\u201d (WLMI) and \u201cWorkforce and Labor Market Information System\u201d (WLMIS). Those proposed definitions \nappear in part 651.\n\nDefinition of \u201cwage record.\u201d The proposed definition of WLMI that appears in part 651 lists numerous components, \nincluding \u201cwage records.\u201d The Wagner-Peyser Act does not define \u201cwage records.\u201d To clarify the Secretary's \nresponsibilities with respect to that component of WLMI, however, the Department proposes to define \u201cwage \nrecords\u201d in a new section under part 652, \u00a7 652.301.\n\nProposed \u00a7 652.301 defines \u201cwage records\u201d for purposes of the Wagner-Peyser Act, including amendments to \nWagner-Peyser relating to the WLMIS. The Department proposes to define \u201cwage record,\u201d for these purposes, as \nrecords that contain \u201cwage information\u201d as defined in the Department regulations at 20 CFR part 603. Part 603, \namong other things, implements the requirements of the Social Security Act governing the now-established Income \nand Eligibility Verification System (IEVS). Federal law requires each State participating in the Federal-State \nunemployment compensation (UC) program to have in place an IEVS through which it exchanges information with \ncertain Federal agencies to help determine applicants' eligibility and amount of benefits for UC and several Federal \nfinancial assistance programs. (Social Security Act (SSA) secs. 303(f), 1137; 20 CFR 603.20-603.23.)\n\nAs part of its IEVS, every State must collect certain information\u2014including \u201cwage information\u201d as defined in 20 CFR \n603.2(k) and referred to here as \u201cwage records\u201d\u2014from applicants for these programs, employers in the State, or \nrelevant State or Federal agencies. (SSA sec. 1137.) In the context of establishing confidentiality requirements for \nState UC data, the Federal regulation at 20 CFR 603.2(k) defines \u201cwage information\u201d to mean information in the \nrecords of a State UC agency, and information reported under provisions of State law that meets the requirements \nof an IEVS, that may fall into any one of three categories: (1) \u201cwages paid to an individual\u201d; (2) the individual's \nSSN(s); and (3) the name, address, State, and FEIN of the employer that paid the wages. (20 CFR 603(k)) \nNormally, a State collects this information through the quarterly \u201cwage reports\u201d employers file with the State \n(referred to in 20 CFR 603.2(j) and SSA sec. 1137(a)(3)). States may, based on their need, require employers to \nreport additional data\u2014beyond these three categories\u2014in their wage reports, whether for unemployment insurance \npurposes or for other purposes. It is the combination of these data collections that are referred to, broadly, as \u201cwage \nrecords.\u201d\n\nThe new, proposed definition of \u201cwage records\u201d in \u00a7 652.301 helps meet the legislative intent for consistency by \nstandardizing, the definition of \u201cwage records\u201d across regulations governing WIOA activities, Wagner-Peyser \nactivities, and disclosure of confidential UC information. Part 603\u2014which uses the term \u201cwage information\u201d is the \nbasis for the definition of \u201cwage records\u201d in proposed \u00a7 652.301\u2014in part serves to allow States to disclose specific \nconfidential wage information to help meet Federal reporting requirements for certain programs and activities \nfunded under WIOA and Wagner-Peyser. As proposed, the definition in \u00a7 652.301 is also consistent with the \ndefinition of \u201cquarterly wage record information\u201d under 20 CFR 677.175, (4) which requires States to use \nessentially the same data elements in \u201cwage records\u201d to formally assess their performance for purposes of \nperformance reporting. (For additional explanation of the relationship between these three sections, and the \ndistinction between the provisions authorizing State use of certain wage data and those authorizing States to \ndisclose essentially the data for purposes of Federally-required performance reporting, see the Department's \nproposal to amend its regulations at 20 CFR part 603, accompanying this proposal to amend the Wagner-Peyser \nregulations.)\n\nSecretary of Labor's role concerning wage records under WIOA. Proposed \u00a7 652.302 explains how the Secretary's \nresponsibilities concerning the WLMIS apply to the wage record component of WLMI. That is, the proposed \n\n\n\nregulation reflects how the Department would apply the broader Wagner-Peyser expectations for improvement of \nlabor market data sources, including those related to consistency and standardization, to one specific source\u2014\nwage records.\n\nProposed \u00a7 652.302(b) would clarify that pursuant to his/her responsibility to oversee the development, \nmaintenance, and continuous improvement of the WLMIS, including the numerous duties set forth in the Act and \nrestated throughout this preamble, the Secretary will seek to develop standardized definitions of the data elements \nin wage records, and improved processes and systems for the collection of and reporting of wage records. As \nproposed, this provision would authorize the Secretary to develop common data definitions and standardized \nreporting formats that are consistent across States.\n\nProposed \u00a7 652.302(a) would work in conjunction with the proposed definitions of WLMI and WLMIS in part 651 to \nclarify that wage records are, in fact, included in and source data for WLMI.\n\nConsistency of wage records. On the matter of wage records, a number of areas have, in recent years, required \npolicy discussions between the Department and States and other stakeholders. Of these discussions, the one on \nconsistency has gained momentum.\n\nState wage records today, while they are a critical component of the WLMIS, suffer from inconsistencies that \nimpede better management of WLMI, and of the ES more broadly. Wage records have always been a critical data \nsource for administration of the UI program as well as other Federal programs, providing information that supports \neligibility determinations and identification and reduction of improper payments. Wage records have increased \nimportance today because States are required to use them to evaluate State performance of the workforce system \nand education and training providers. Additionally, wage records play a key role in Federal evaluations of the \nworkforce system's programs. The expanded use of wage records for such a wide range of purposes requires \nconsistency and quality of the data in order to maximize its use.\n\nRegrettably, such consistency is lacking. The wage data employers must report on their quarterly wage reports to \ntheir State and the formats they must use to report it vary, State-by-State. While employers filing wage reports \ndescribed in Federal regulations at 20CFR 603.2(j) must, at a minimum, report the three data elements described in \n20 CFR 603.2(k), State law may require them to report additional elements. And because States differ in how they \ndefine certain data elements\u2014including the three elements listed in \u00a7 603.2(k)\u2014different States may prescribe \ndifferent reporting formats for the same data elements. This means that the same type of data (employee SSN, \nemployee name, employee address) may look different, from State to State, when placed on the form. For \nexample, some States only require the first several numbers of workers' SSN. Such differences in State reporting \nrequirements, and the variation they generate in the type of data and the format of data collected, set up a \nsignificant barrier to data quality and data consistency. They make it hard for data users to effectively match wage \nrecords across the States. This interferes with the effective and efficient measure of performance, program \nevaluation, income verification under sec. 1137 SSA, and detection of improper benefits payments in multiple \nFederal programs.\n\nConsultations with stakeholders over the years, as well as our own, longstanding program experience, lead the \nDepartment to believe that adoption of standardized definitions of data elements, and processes and systems for \ncollecting and reporting wage records across all States, could greatly enhance the usability of the wage records \nand the ability to easily merge the data they contain with other data sets. Standardized definitions, collection \nprocesses, and systems also could reduce employer burden, given that multi-State employers and their third-\nparty administrators now have to report wages to States in many different formats. With such enhancements, State \nwage records would contain data that have the potential to create more comprehensive and powerful workforce and \nlabor market information. Such an approach would also help implement the statute's requirement for consistency.\n\nOther Federal statutes support making significant improvements in wage records as a data source. A number of \nFederal statutes now place emphasis on wage records and data standardization. WIOA and the Middle Class Tax \nRelief and Job Creation Act of 2014, for example, require the Department to make the labor market data it \n\n\n\noversees or generates, even more consistent and meaningful. WIOA emphasizes the use of wage records for \nperformance and evaluations of the workforce system. The Job Creation Act focus on data standardization.\n\nSection 2104 of the Job Creation Act requires the Secretary to promote data exchange standardization through \nregulation in the delivery of the UI program, including as it relates to supporting the reemployment of unemployed \nworkers. Data exchange standards include use of interoperable standards; use of widely accepted, non-\nproprietary, searchable, and computer readable formats; and use of existing non-proprietary standards, such as the \neXtensible Markup Language. A key component of data exchange standardization is ensuring that the data the \nStates are sharing is consistent. As addressed above, it is impossible to accurately exchange and match data that \nhas different elements and different requirements for the common elements. The Secretary cannot achieve data \nexchange standardization in the UI program if the data elements cannot be accurately exchanged and matched. \nTherefore, the Department interprets the requirement in the Job Creation Act to standardize data exchange to \ninclude the requirement that the Secretary consult with the WIAC and develop a set of common data definitions.\n\nThe Wagner-Peyser Act, especially when read in the context of these two other statutes and the amendments \nmade to it by WIOA, exhibits the same focus and expectation. Proposed \u00a7\u00a7 652.300 through 652.303 enable all of \nthis work to proceed through a collaborative approach that brings in other Federal agencies, States, and the public \nthrough the newly constituted WIAC.\n\nConsultations with the WIC and WIAC to improve wage records and the WLMIS. Of course, consistency is not the \nonly concern or area of consultation with stakeholders. There is a long history of interest and discussions among \nFederal and State agencies and data users about the desirability of making a variety of improvements to wage \nrecords that would increase their value and usability. Among these was an effort in the 1990s referred to as the \nSimplified Tax and Wage Reporting System (STAWRS).\n\nMore recently, a subgroup of the Workforce Information Council (5) established under WIA has been researching \nand developing reports on how to enhance the content of wage records to support improvements in labor market \nand workforce information. The working group is currently considering possible enhancements, such as adding data \nelements to the information States collect from employers through the wage reports under 20 CFR 603.2(j), and \nthe potential impact of those enhancements, on State workforce agencies and businesses. This work will result in \nrecommendations to the WIC in the coming year and will provide strong foundational information to support the \nSecretary's work with the WIAC when it is established. (See discussion on WIAC elsewhere in this proposed rule.)\n\nAs discussed elsewhere, sec. 15(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act requires the WIAC to evaluate the WLMIS System \nand make recommendations to the Secretary on how to improve the WLMIS. Section 15(b) requires the Secretary \nto receive and evaluate the WIAC's recommendations and respond to these recommendations in writing. At the \nappropriate time, the WIAC will make recommendations for improving the WLMIS. These recommendations could \nrange from technical improvements to the system, such as improving the technology States use to gather and \nreport data, to more substantive changes to the system, such as standardizing data elements to facilitate \ncomparisons and provide job seekers easy to understand information about the labor market.\n\nTo the extent that the Secretary's consultations with the WIAC and, potentially, other stakeholder groups result in \nproposals to change, enhance, or expand wage record data elements, the Secretary will carefully consider the \npotential benefits and costs of these proposals on the workforce system, and work with the Congress, other Federal \nagencies, States, the WIAC, and other stakeholders to explore possible ways to implement the recommendations. \nIf appropriate, the Department will engage in further rulemaking or seek legislative authority.\n\nData elements associated with wage records. Potentially establishing new data elements to wage records that \nemployers in all States must report could have benefits similar to standardization. For example, knowing \nindividuals' occupations, along with the wages they earned, would be extremely valuable. Such additional \ninformation would greatly assist in performance reporting and program evaluation under WIOA, in the identification \nof skill shortages by detailed geographic area to inform labor market training programs, and in the analysis of the \nlong-term impact of education and training programs on labor market outcomes. It is likely that the WIAC will \nexplore the value and viability of adding this and, potentially, other data elements. As discussed above, the current \n\n\n\nWIC is researching this issue and developing reports that will provide additionalinformation that is likely to be \npassed on to the WIAC for consideration.\n\nOn January 31, 2014, the WIC released its \u201cPhase One Interim Report on Current Practices of Unemployment \nInsurance Wage Record Collection and Use.\u201d This report analyzed the results of a State survey on the benefits of \nand barriers to enhancing labor market information by adding data elements to the quarterly wage reports \nemployers submit to States as defined in 20 CFR 603.2(j). Among other things, the WIC's survey asked States \nwhat additional data elements, aside from Federally-required wage information, States require employers to \nreport. The Phase One Interim Report can be found at: \nhttp://www.workforceinfocouncil.org/Documents/Wage%20Report%20Final.pdf. While not all States responded, \nAlaska, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, the Virgin Islands, \nWashington, and Wyoming reported already collecting additional data elements in the quarterly wage reports. The \nadditional elements included the Code, total hours worked in a quarter, total number of weeks worked in a quarter, \npay type (salary or hourly), hourly pay rate, gender, job title, worksite address, zip code, and tips. Some of the \nresponding States reported that the additional data elements are extremely helpful for estimating hourly earnings, \nunderstanding career progression from occupation to occupation, assessing the effectiveness of workforce training, \nand making occupational projections. One State pointed out that knowing the employee worksite information helped \nwith UC claim filing.\n\nAsking employers to report and States to collect additional data or data categories through quarterly wage reports, \nwould expand the data collections for many States. The Department is committed to strong stakeholder \nconsultation as strategies are developed to improve and enhance wage records and to striking the appropriate \nbalance between the burden of any new data collection and the value of any additional data elements. In the event \nthe WIAC and/or other stakeholder consultations generate recommendations for such enhancements, the \nDepartment will consider additional rulemaking or seek legislative authority, if appropriate.\n\nRequest for comment. The Department is interested in receiving comments from States that responded to the \nsurvey, and any other States that require additional data elements in quarterly wage reports, on the challenges \nand benefits of requiring additional data elements in the quarterly wage reports. The Department is also interested \nin receiving comments from employers and payroll processors who provide occupational data for the quarterly \nwage records.\n\nApplying 20 CFR part 603 to wage records. Finally, the regulation proposed for new \u00a7 652.303 would clarify that \nwage records are subject to and protected by the Department's regulations at 20 CFR part 603, which govern \nconfidentiality and disclosure for confidential UC information, including the \u201cwage information\u201d that make up \u201cwage \nrecords.\u201d Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 652.300 through 652.302 changes the confidentiality requirements of 20 CFR part 603. \nInformation contained in \u201cwage records\u201d that is confidential under \u00a7\u00a7 603.2(b) and 603.4 remains confidential in \naccordance with those sections of the confidentiality and disclosure requirements of subparts A and B of part 603. \nThe Department proposes this provision to further ensure the confidentiality of the information in the State UC \nsystem.\n\nO. Part 653\u2014Services of the Employment Service System\n\nIn subparts B and F, the Department proposes to implement the WIOA title III amendments to the Wagner-Peyser \nAct and to streamline and update certain sections to eliminate duplicative and obsolete provisions. Despite these \nchanges, part 653 will remain consistent with the \u201cRichey Order\u201d, which allows revisions as long as they are \nconsistent with the Richey Order. NAACP v. Brennan, 9174 WL 229, at *7.\n\nSection 653.100Purpose and Scope of Subpart\n\nProposed \u00a7 653.100 explains that the regulations under part 653 seek to ensure that all services of the workforce \ndevelopment system be available to all job seekers in an equitable fashion. This section includes language currently \nat \u00a7 653.101 that explains the purpose and scope of part 653. This approach is consistent with the Department's \ncurrent policy and requiring equal access and treatment to all services available through the workforce \ndevelopment system is also consistent with the purpose and terms of the Richey Order.\n\nhttp://www.workforceinfocouncil.org/Documents/Wage%20Report%20Final.pdf\n\n\nSection 653.101Provision of Services to Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers\n\nThe Department proposes to delete \u00a7 653.101 because its provisions have been moved to \u00a7 653.100 or concern \nitinerant or satellite offices that have been replaced by one-stop centers that provide services to both MSFWs and \nnon-MSFWs.\n\nSection 653.102Job Information\n\nThe Department proposes to make several changes to \u00a7 653.102:\n\n(1) That State agencies make job order information conspicuous and available to MSFWs \u201c. . . by all reasonable \nmeans\u201d rather than \u201cin all local offices\u201d to reflect the obligation of State agencies to contact MSFWs who are not \nbeing reached by the normal intake activities including at their working, living or gathering areas to explain the \nservices available at the local one-stop center;\n\n(2) That the language in \u00a7 653.102 referring to \u201ccomputer terminal, microfiche, hard copy, or other equally effective \nmeans\u201d be replaced with \u201cinternet labor exchange systems and through the one-stop centers\u201d to conform to \ntechnological advances and current techniques of States' internet-based labor exchange systems;\n\n(3) That the reference to \u201ceach significant MSFW local office\u201d be replaced with \u201cemployment service offices\u201d to \nrequire each ES office to provide adequate staff assistance to MSFWs to more fully conform with the Richey Order, \nwhich requires the Department to ensure that MSFWs are serviced in a quantitatively proportionate and \nqualitatively equivalent way to non-MSFWs;\n\n(4) That offices designated as significant MSFW multilingual ES offices must provide services to MSFWs in their \nnative language, whenever requested or necessary and to acknowledge that Spanish is not the only native \nlanguage spoken by MSFWs whose first language is not English.\n\nSection 653.103Process for Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers To Participate in Workforce Development Activities\n\nThe Department proposes to revise the heading in \u00a7 653.103 to \u201cProcess for migrant and seasonal farmworkers to \nparticipate in workforce development activities\u201d to align it with language used in titles I and III of WIOA, which refer \nto \u201cworkforce development activities.\u201d\n\nProposed \u00a7 653.103(b) includes new language requiring that persons with LEP receive, free of charge, the \nlanguage assistance necessary to afford them meaningful access to the programs, services, and information \noffered by one-stop centers. The Department also proposes to remove the reference to \u00a7 653.105 because we \npropose to eliminate that section.\n\nIn proposed \u00a7 653.103(c), the Department proposes to add the words \u201cor in their native language\u201d to \nfurtheracknowledge that Spanish is not the only native language spoken by MSFWs whose first language is not \nEnglish, and to remove language regarding checking the accuracy and quality of applications because such actions \nare part of compliance reviews which are addressed in \u00a7 653.108.\n\nThe Department also proposes to remove paragraphs (d) through (h) from \u00a7 653.103, that refer to application cards \nand an application process that are generally no longer used, having been replaced by online resources. Instead, it \nis proposed in paragraph (d) that local ES offices \u201crefer and/or register the MSFW in accordance with the \nestablished procedures defined in the relevant regulations(s) or guidance.\u201d\n\nThe Department proposes to remove \u00a7 653.104(a) because MSFWs receive equitable ESs regardless of family \nstatus. The provision of services for all Wagner-Peyser participants is not dependent upon whether their family \nmembers are participating in the ES system. It is also proposed that paragraphs (b) and (c) regarding applications \nfrom an individual for employment as a farm labor contractor, and agricultural job orders submitted by a farm labor \ncontractor or farm labor contractor employee, be relocated to \u00a7 653.500 because that addresses the ARS.\n\nIt is proposed that \u00a7\u00a7 653.105 and 653.106 be deleted as they are generally obsolete and because State agencies \nno longer make referrals to or operate day-haul facilities. Additionally, it is not anticipated that State agencies will \n\n\n\nmake referrals to or operate day-haul facilities in the foreseeable future in part because WIOA title I, sec. 121(e)(3) \nrequires the colocation of Wagner-Peyser services. Should those activities resume in the future, however, the \nDepartment will ensure compliance with the requirements of the Richey Order concerning any day-haul referrals \nand day-haul locations operating under ES supervision. The Department also proposes to remove paragraph (c) of \n\u00a7 653.106 as it is unnecessary because it references \u00a7\u00a7 653.107(j) and 653.108(p) concerning outreach visits to, \nand monitoring of day-haul facilities. Those outreach obligations remain, as revised, in proposed \u00a7 653.107.\n\nSection 653.107Outreach and Agricultural Outreach Plan\n\nThe Department proposes to restructure and reorganize \u00a7 653.107 to facilitate a better understanding of State \nagency responsibilities, outreach worker responsibilities, and ES office responsibilities relating to outreach and the \nAgricultural Outreach Plan (AOP). The Department anticipates that the reorganization will allow the relevant entities \nto identify their responsibilities under this section.\n\nCurrently, the AOP is submitted annually as a modification to the WIA under title I and the Wagner-Peyser \nIntegrated or Unified Workforce Plan. As required by sec. 8 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, and as amended by sec. \n306 of WIOA, States must now submit their Wagner-Peyser plan as part of the Unified or Combined State Plan \ndescribed in WIOA secs. 102 and 103, respectively. In order to streamline the plan submission process for States, \nthe Department proposes to require that States include their AOP with their Unified or Combined State Plan. As \nthe State Plans are required every 4 years, the Department proposes to require that the AOP be submitted every \n4 years. The Department notes, however, that the Richey Order requires much of the information submitted \nthrough the AOP to be submitted annually. Therefore, in order to balance the goal of streamlining the State \nplanning process with the need to comply with the Richey Order, the Department proposes that the Annual \nSummary required at 20 CFR 653.108(s) include outreach data and an update on the State's progress toward \naccomplishing its goals set forth in the AOP. In proposed paragraph (d), the Department explains the basic \nrequirements of the AOP and the Annual Summaries and explain that official guidance will be forthcoming. \nAdditionally, terminology in proposed \u00a7 653.107 is revised, when appropriate, to better align its terms with \ncorresponding terms in WIOA which will be used in the Unified State Plan.\n\nThe Department also proposes the following changes to \u00a7 653.107:\n\n(1) The heading is proposed to be replaced with \u201cOutreach and Agricultural Outreach Plan (AOP)\u201d to make clear \nthat information regarding the AOP can be found in this section;\n\n(2) The term \u201cOutreach Program\u201d used in paragraph (a) is proposed to be replaced by \u201cOutreach\u201d to broaden the \nscope of the section to accurately reflect the various requirements regarding outreach and that the section is not a \nformulaic program;\n\n(3) References in paragraph (a) to the Outreach Plan have been relocated, in revised form, to paragraph (d) that \nconcerns the \u201cAgricultural Outreach Plan (AOP)\u201d or \u201cAnnual Summaries,\u201d or reserved for use in future official \nDepartment guidance (the Department will include AOP guidance as part of its Unified State Plan guidance);\n\n(4) A requirement has been added to paragraph (a) for each State agency to employ outreach workers to conduct \noutreach in their service areas (full or part time staff may be hired depending on whether the State has a significant \nMSFW population). This addition is proposed to help each State meet its requirement under the current 20 CFR \n653.107(a) to locate and contact MSFWs who are not being reached by the normal intake activities conducted by \nthe local ES offices. The Richey Order influenced the language for this proposed addition, as it states that \u201ceach \nState agency shall employ an adequate number of staff who shall be assigned to ES offices. . . . ;\u201d\n\n(5) Paragraph (a)(4) has been revised to clarify that the Department, through guidance, will identify the 20 States \nwith the highest estimated year-round MSFW activity;\n\n(6) Delete paragraph (b)(2) because all outreach efforts must be vigorous. This change does not signal a reduction \nin the required intensity of outreach activities;\n\n\n\n(7) The language in paragraph (h)(3)(i) be relocated to \u00a7 653.107(a)(4) and be revised to require the \u201ctop 20 \nStates,\u201d that is the 20 States with the highest estimated year-round MSFW activity, to hire year-round full-time \noutreach staff to help ensure that more farmworkers will be reached on a year-round basis in high activity areas \nthan are reached at present. The remaining States must hire part-time outreach staff year-round and must hire full-\ntime outreach staff during periods of peak MSFW activity. These provisions are proposed to balance the urgent \nneed for outreach with the reality of limited staff resources available to the States. Additionally, it is proposed that \nthe option for the Regional Administrator to grant a deviation from the requirements in this paragraph be deleted to \nensure that States have a means to contact MSFWs who are not being reached by the normal intake activities \nconducted by the local ES offices and to encourage them to strive for \u201cthe development of strategies for providing \neffective outreach to and improve access for individuals and employers who could benefit from services provided \nthrough the workforce development system,\u201d as stated at WIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(c);\n\n(8) The reference to local offices in \u00a7 653.107(b)(4)(vi) has been updated to \u201cone-stop center.\u201d In this section \u201cone-\nstop centers\u201d refers to both comprehensive and affiliate one-stop centers;\n\n(9) The language in current \u00a7 653.107(j)(1)(v) be relocated to proposed \u00a7 653.107(b)(2) and revised by inserting the \nwords \u201cemployer's property or work area\u201d and changing the words \u201cpermission of the employer\u201d to\u201cpermission of \nthe employer, owner or farm labor contractor\u201d because the employer may not always be the appropriate person \nto grant such permission;\n\n(10) The reference to unemployed and employed MSFWs in current paragraph (j)(2)(ii) be deleted because all \nMSFWs contacted through outreach activities must receive information on current and future employment \nopportunities;\n\n(11) A sentence was added to paragraph (b)(6) requiring outreach workers to document and refer apparent \nviolations that are non-employment related; and\n\n(12) Language was added to paragraph (b)(7) regarding training outreach workers on protecting farmworkers \nagainst sexual harassment in the fields. While such abuse is not often considered when contemplating the \nprotection of, and advocacy for, MSFWs, it is increasingly prevalent and the addition is intended to further a \nconcerted effort to deter such abuse. To that end, the Department wishes to ensure that outreach workers are \naware of the issue and able to appropriately refer MSFWs.\n\nSection 653.108State Workforce Agency and State Monitor Advocate Responsibilities\n\nThe Department proposes the following changes to \u00a7 653.108:\n\n(1) The heading is proposed to be revised to State Workforce Agency and State monitor advocate (SMA) \nresponsibilities to better describe the contents of this section;\n\n(2) The requirement in paragraph (c) for SMAs to work in the State central office was removed because there are \ninstances where it may be more productive and logical for them to work in an office that is more centrally located to \nthe State's MSFW population;\n\n(3) The language in paragraph (d) allowing an Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) Administrator to reallocate \nSMA positions and approve the use of less than full-time work be deleted because the OWI administrator does not \nhave authority over these determinations. It is also proposed that the last sentence in this paragraph be modified to \nclarify that a State agency that deems SMA functions appropriate on a part-time basis must demonstrate to the \nRegional Administrator that part-time staffing will be sufficient for carrying out his/her duties;\n\n(4) Language has been added to paragraph (g)(1) authorizing SMAs to request a corrective action plan from the ES \noffice to address any deficiencies found in their review and allowing the SMAs to advise the State agency on \nmeans to improve the delivery of services to MSFWs;\n\n(5) That the words \u201clocal office MSFW formal monitoring\u201d be deleted from paragraph (g)(2) because the Department \nhas proposed to include a definition for onsite reviews in 20 CFR 651.10;\n\n\n\n(6) In paragraph (g)(3) the words \u201csignificant MSFW local office\u201d are proposed to be replaced with \u201csignificant \nMSFW one-stop center\u201d to conform with the proposed definition in 20 CFR 651.10;\n\n(7) In paragraph (g)(4) it is proposed that the sentence referring to applications be deleted because such \ninformation can be more effectively provided and updated, as necessary, via Department-published guidance \nmaterials. It is also proposed this paragraph include language requiring the SMA to clear the State's AOP to \nensure that the SMA reviews, provides necessary input, and supports the final version of the State's AOP;\n\n(8) That paragraph (g)(6) be created to require SMAs to write and submit Annual Summaries to the State \nAdministrator with a copy to the Regional Administrator because it is a duty originally located in \u00a7 653.108(t) but \nappropriately falls under \u00a7 653.108(g) as one of the SMA duties;\n\n(9) In paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) the references to \u201creviews\u201d be replaced with \u201consite review(s)\u201d for clarity, and that \nthe reference to \u201cETA\u201d in paragraph (h)(3) be replaced with \u201cthe Department;\u201d\n\n(10) It is proposed that in paragraph (j) the SMAs must ensure that local ES office managers submit copies of the \nMSFW complaint logs to the State agency quarterly pursuant to 20 CFR 658 subpart E instead of the regional \noffice, as was originally required. This change is proposed because the regional office does not need to review \neach complaint log, rather it reviews the information in aggregate, as is the current practice. This helps to avoid \noverburdening the regional offices with more detail than is necessary. Additional details concerning the submission \nof complaint logs will be provided and updated, as necessary, via Department official guidance;\n\n(11) Current paragraph (k) has been broken into separate paragraphs (proposed paragraphs (j), (k), and (l)), to \nclarify the intent of the respective duties under this subpart. Paragraph (j) will require SMAs to serve as advocates \nto improve services to MSFWs; paragraph (k) will strengthen the requirement for SMAs to liaise with WIOA sec. 167 \ngrantees to encourage increased collaboration between SMAs and grantees that provide services to MSFWs; \nparagraph (l) proposes that SMAs meet at least quarterly and establish an MOU with WIOA sec. 167 grantees and \nother organizations serving farmworkers, the Department intends to foster a better working relationship between the \nSMAs, the grantees, and the other organizations while harmonizing the delivery of services to MSFWs and \nminimizing the duplication of services;\n\n(12) Language to include committees other than DOL Regional Farm Labor Coordinated Enforcement Committee \nhas been added to paragraph (l) to broaden the scope of appropriate regional meetings the SMA must attend.\n\n(13) Paragraph (o) has been deleted because affirmative action staffing plans are no longer required. In their \nplace, each State agency must provide an assurance that it is complying with its affirmative action requirements set \nforth in 20 CFR 653.111 through the AOP. Additionally, the requirement under proposed paragraph (g)(1) for SMAs \nto conduct an ongoing review of and advise the State agency on its affirmative action goals will meet the need for \nSMAs to ensure that their respective States are complying with the affirmative action staffing requirements outlined \nin the Richey Order;\n\n(14) Paragraph (p) concerning day-haul sites has been deleted for the same reasons provided for deleting \u00a7\u00a7 \n653.105 and 653.106; and\n\n(15) A new paragraph (s) has been added to outline the purpose and scope of required Annual Summaries, and a \nlist of what the summaries must include. The requirements for the Annual Summary have been expanded to include \ninformation that would be relevant for the Department's review of how the States are providing services to MSFW. \nMany of the added requirements are taken from other sections under this chapter. Specifically, the Annual \nSummary would include assurances or summaries of SMA duties taken from current \u00a7 653.108(c), (g)(1), (h)(2), (j), \n(k), (q), and (r). This section also requires that the Annual Summaries include a summary of the activities \nconducted over the course of the previous year that relate to meeting the goals of the AOP. At the end of the AOP, \nthis section would require that the SMA provide a synopsis of the State agency's achievements in meetings its \ngoals set forth in the AOP. This will help keep each State agency on track toward achieving its AOP goals and help \nthe Department track such progress.\n\n\n\nIn addition, related to proposed \u00a7 653.108(g)(4), the Department notes that the process by which the SMA will \nreceive, review, and approve the AOPwill be described in the joint planning guidance issued by the Departments of \nLabor and Education.\n\nSection 653.109Data Collection and Performance Accountability Measures\n\nFor \u00a7 653.109, Data collection, the Department proposes to include the equity indicators and minimum service level \nindicators currently at \u00a7 653.112 as they are data elements that appropriately fit under \u00a7 653.109, with the exception \nof the contents of current \u00a7 653.112(c)(3) that will be deleted because ETA does not publish a list of priorities that \nState agencies can use as a basis for the minimum service levels required of significant MSFW States. The \nDepartment also proposes to add \u201cand performance accountability measures\u201d to \u00a7 653.109 so the part may \nappropriately include the additional measures.\n\nThe Department proposes to make several other changes to \u00a7 653.109:\n\n(1) Paragraph (a) specifies that State agencies must collect career service indicator data for services described in \nWIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) because WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) includes several of the existing requirements \nunder \u00a7 653.109;\n\n(2) Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that data collection will include the number of non-MSFWs and \nMSFWs registered for Wagner-Peyser services and MSFW average earnings, and will remove the requirement to \ncollect data on the number of MSFWs referred to training, receiving job development, receiving testing, receiving \nemployment counseling, and referred for supportive services or other services, as those are already required data \nelements under WIOA; and\n\n(3) Paragraph (b) also replaces the terms \u201cwage rates\u201d and \u201cduration of employment\u201d with the terms \u201centered \nemployment rate\u201d and \u201cemployment retention rate,\u201d respectively to conform with the terminology by the \nDepartment's data collection mechanism (currently the Labor Exchange Agricultural Reporting System 9002a form).\n\nSection 653.110Disclosure of Data\n\nProposed \u00a7 653.110 contains minor changes to clarify the provisions and to update terminology.\n\nSection 653.111State Agency Staffing Requirements\n\nIn \u00a7 653.111 it is proposed that the requirement for each State agency with significant MSFW offices to submit an \naffirmative action plan be replaced with the requirement that each such State agency submit assurances, as part of \nits Unified State Plan and as part of its Annual Summaries, that it is implementing an affirmative action staffing \nprogram. This change is proposed because it will help each State agency with significant MSFW offices to \nstreamline implementation of its affirmative action program while ensuring that the Department remains in \ncompliance with the relevant requirements under the Richey Order. It is proposed that the regulation providing the \nformula for determining the racial and ethnic characteristics of the workforce be deleted from the regulation because \nthis will be provided in subsequently issued guidance.\n\nIt is proposed that \u00a7 653.112 be deleted because PBPs are obsolete as each State agency is required to submit a \nUnified or Combined State Plan pursuant to WIOA title I. The text in paragraphs (b) and (c) concerning equity \nindicators and minimum level service requirements is proposed to be relocated, with minor revisions, to \u00a7 653.109.\n\nIt is proposed that \u00a7 653.113 be deleted and its contents relocated to 20 CFR 658.419 because it relates to the ES \nand Employment-Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System).\n\nIn subpart F, the Department proposes the following changes to clarify the requirements of this subpart:\n\n(1) The paragraphs under the ARS have been reorganized into subcategories based on each stakeholder's \nrespective responsibilities (the subcategories are ES Office Responsibilities, State Agency Responsibilities, and \nProcessing Job Orders). The proposed restructuring of this subpart is intended to help stakeholders better \n\n\n\nunderstand how the system works and more easily identify and comprehend their respective responsibilities. The \nreorganizing is also proposed to help clarify the meaning of the regulations;\n\n(2) The paragraphs have been revised to state requirements in the positive and active voice, versus the negative \npassive voice from which they were originally drafted;\n\n(3) References to information that needs to be provided to MSFWs in Spanish be changed to \u201cnative language\u201d to \nconform to TEGL 26-02; and\n\n(4) The heading for subpart F has been revised and supplemented by adding the words \u201cfor US Workers\u201d to clarify \nthat ARS is meant for U.S. workers versus foreign workers. It is a common misconception that the ARS is for \nforeign workers who may be hired by U.S. employers through visa programs such as the H-2A or H-2B visa \nprograms, and the Department intends the proposed change to help eliminate this misconception. For the same \nreason, any references to the temporary employment of foreign workers in the United States (that would otherwise \nfall under 20 CFR 655) have been deleted.\n\nSection 653.501Requirements for Processing Clearance Orders\n\nThe Department proposes the following changes to \u00a7 653.501:\n\n(1) In paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(I), currently paragraph (d)(2)(x), it is proposed that the sentence regarding the \ncontingency of payments made beyond the period of employment specified in the job order be deleted because \nsuch terms are already specified in the job order and the language is duplicative;\n\n(2) In paragraph (c)(3)(iv), currently paragraph (d)(2)(xiii), it is proposed that the sentence referring to requests for \nforeign workers be deleted because this section should only cover information regarding ARS and the \nrequirements for foreign workers are covered under 20 CFR 655; and\n\n(3) In paragraph (j), it is proposed that the Regional Administrator notify the national monitor advocate instead of the \nOWI Administrator when a potential labor supply State agency rejects a clearance order and the Regional \nAdministrator does not concur with the reasons for rejection. In this case, the national monitor advocate, in \nconsultation with the OWI Administrator, is the appropriate person to make the final determination because it is the \ncommon practice for the national monitor advocate to provide the State agencies with guidance regarding ARS.\n\nSection 653.502Conditional Access to the Agricultural Recruitment System\n\nThe Department proposes to delete current \u00a7 653.502 concerning changes in crop and recruitment situations and \nfold its contents without change into proposed \u00a7 653.501.\n\nThe Department proposes to add a new \u00a7 653.502 which contains the relocated provisions of 20 CFR 654.403. \nWhile the housing standards at 20 CFR 654 subpart E, including current \u00a7 654.403, will expire 1 year after the \npublication of the final rule, the Department proposes moving current \u00a7 654.403 into this new section because \nthose requirements remain necessary and relevant, and because that section is related to the terms and \nrequirements of this subpart. Accordingly, the provisions of 20 CFR 654.403 have been relocated to proposed 20 \nCFR 653.502.\n\nSection 653.503Field Checks\n\nProposed \u00a7 653.503(b) has been revised to clarify that State agencies must conduct field checks on at least 25 \npercent of agricultural worksites to align with common practice. The Department also proposes to add language \nrequiring a State agency with fewer than 10 ES placements to conduct field checks on all agricultural worksites \nwhere the placements have been made. This change is proposed to ensure that all worksites are checked \nwhenever feasible. In paragraph (e), it is proposed that the word \u201cshall\u201d be changed to \u201cmay\u201d because it is not a \nrequirement, rather State agencies may choose to enter into an agreement with an enforcement agency if they \nbelieve it is necessary or helpful.\n\nP. Part 654\u2014Special Responsibilities of the Employment Service System\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\n\nThe Department proposes to revise the ETA regulations governing Housing for Agricultural Workers at 20 CFR \n654, subpart E, issued under the authority of the 1933 Wagner-Peyser Act by updating outdated terminology and by \nestablishing an expiration date for the ETA standards in order to transition housing currently governed by the ETA \nstandards to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) regulations governing temporary labor \ncamps for agricultural workers.\n\n2. Subpart E\u2014Housing for Agricultural Workers\n\nSection 654.401Applicability\n\nThe Department proposes to amend \u00a7 654.401 to require that housing covered by the regulations in this subpart be \nsubject to the relevant OSHA housing standards for agricultural workers beginning 1 year after the publication of \nthe final rule.\n\nIn 1951 the U.S. ES Bureau of Employment Security established the ETA housing standards for farmworkers. \nThese standards were updated in 1959 and again in 1968. However, despite the Department's intention to \u201cmake \nevery effort to ensure that `housing and facilities are hygienic and adequate to the climatic conditions of the area of \nemployment'\u201d and that such housing \u201cconformed to applicable State or local housing codes, and in the absence of \nsuch codes, that the housing would not endanger the health or safety of the workers,\u201d farmworkers continued to \nface inadequate, unsafe, and unsanitary housing. In 1970, Congress passed the Occupational Health and Safety \nAct (OSHA) which was intended to assure that every person working in the United States has safe and healthful \nworking conditions.\u201d In this light, OSHA adopted a set of national consensus standards for temporary labor camps \nwhich was published in August 1971. Therefore, since 1971 the Department has had in effect two sets of \nagricultural housing standards for farmworkers: Those under the ETA regulations (originally at 20 CFR part 620, \nlater at 20 CFR part 654) and those under the OSHA regulations (at 29 CFR 1910.142). The dual set of standards \nhas long resulted in confusion with respect to their applicability and enforcement. In view of these problems, the \nDepartment held hearings in 1976 with stakeholders, developed several proposals to arrive at a single set of \nstandards, and, on December 9, 1977, rescinded the ETA regulations and standards.\n\nWhile the rescission was effective immediately, employers whose housing met the ETA standards on the date of \ntheir rescission were given until January 1, 1979 to come into compliance with the OSHA housing regulations. \nLater, the Department received numerous complaints objecting to the rescission of the ETA housing regulations, \nincluding those from employers who had constructed housing to conform to the ETA standards and complained \nthat the shift from ETA to OSHA standards would require costly modifications to housing which the Department had \npreviously approved. In response to these comments, the Department proposed on September 1, 1978 to revise \nthe December 9, 1977 rescission action by adding an indefinite extension of time for employers already following \nthe ETA standards to bring their housing into compliance with the OSHA standards and a transitional provision for \nhousing built in reliance on the ETA regulations.\n\nOn March 4, 1980, the Department issued a final rule providing that the OSHA standards and regulations applied to \nall temporary housing for farmworkers except that \u201c[e]mployers whose housing was constructed in accordance with \nthe ETA housing standards may continue to follow the full set of ETA standards set forth in this subpart only where \nprior to April 3, 1980 the housing was completed or under construction, or where prior to March 4, 1980 a contract \nfor the construction of the specific housing was signed.\u201d 45 FR 14180, 14182 (Mar. 4, 1980).\n\nThe Department proposes that the remaining housing currently governed under the standards and provisions at 20 \nCFR part 654 subpart E (Housing for Agricultural Workers) be subject to the OSHA standards and provisions \nbeginning 1 year after the publication of the final rule, except that mobile range housing for sheepherders and \ngoatherders must continue to meet existing Departmental guidelines and/or applicable regulations. The proposed \nexpiration date will provide sufficient time for affected employers to transition into compliance with the OSHA \nstandards.\n\nPursuant to the January 19, 1981 agreement between OSHA, the WHD (replacing the abolished Employment \nStandards Administration (ESA)), and ETA for Inspections of Migrant Agricultural Worker Housing, the \nDepartment's WHD will continue to be responsible for enforcing the provisions under 29 CFR 1910.142. Beginning \n\n\n\n1 year after the publication of the final rule, the Department will not apply or enforce the standards of this subpart, \nother than in cases relating to events predating that expiration date.\n\nRequiring all housing to meet the relevant OSHA standards and eliminating the ETA standards will reduce \nadministrative and enforcement burdens on employers, workers, State agencies, and the Department because \nthey will need to reference and rely on only one set of applicable standards located in one place. Enforcement \nagency staff and State agency staff that conduct housing inspections will only need to understand one set of \nstandards which will ease the learning process. Additionally, the change will benefit MSFWs as the regulations \nunder 29 CFR 1910.142 conform to more modern housing standards than those under 20 CFR part 654 subpart E. \nThe Department acknowledges that the change will mean that some employers will need to upgrade their \nfarmworker housing to meet the OSHA standards. However, the benefit to farmworkers and the administrative \nbenefits to State agencies and the Department outweigh the adjustments employers will need to make to comply \nwith the OSHA standards. In order to assist employers, the Department will provide technical assistance to \nfacilitate the transition to the OSHA housing standards.\n\nHaving been in place for 34 years, it is the Department's opinion that it is appropriate to complete the transition to \nthe OSHA standards begun in 1980 and to phase out in full the ETA standards grandfathered for 34 years for \nfarmworker housing completed or under construction prior to March 3, 1980, or under contract for construction \nprior to April 3, 1980. As in 1980, the Department continues to believe that the OSHA regulations provide for \nsuperior standards of safety and habitability forMSFWs and do not overly burden employers.\n\nIn addition to the change described above, the Department proposes to amend the following sections:\n\nSection 654.400Scope and Purpose\n\nThe Department proposes to amend \u00a7 654.400 to update terminology and explain that housing covered under the \nstandards and provisions of subpart E will be subject to different regulations without grandfathering beginning 1 \nyear after the date that this final regulation is published.\n\nIn addition to the amendment described above, the Department proposes to revise \u00a7 654.401 for clarity, to add a \nnew paragraph (b), and to shorten the section heading by eliminating unnecessary language.\n\nSection 654.402Variances\n\nThe Department proposes to amend \u00a7 654.402 to update terminology and remove the term \u201cpermanent\u201d because, \nas proposed, variances will expire on the given expiration date for the standards and provisions of subpart E; \ntherefore, employers will no longer be entitled to a permanent variance. The deadline of June 2, 1980 is removed \nbecause the Department proposes to receive applications for temporary variances from the ETA standards until the \ndate on which the standards and provisions of subpart E will expire. Additionally, paragraph (f) has been added to \nstate that all variances and requests for variances will expire 1 year after the publication of the final rule requiring \nthis change, and that no applications will be accepted as of that date. After this change takes effect, the Department \nwill return any pending requests for variances to the appropriate applicant noting that all variances and variance \nrequests expired on that date and are therefore stale.\n\nSection 654.403[Reserved]\n\nFinally, the Department proposes that the provisions of \u00a7 654.403 be deleted and relocated to 20 CFR 653.502 \nbecause they more directly relate to the governance and operation of the ARS rather than the condition of worker \nhousing. Section 654.403 provides for conditional access to the clearance order system administered by the \nrelevant State workforce agency which is needed to effectively service employers whose housing has fallen \ntemporarily out of compliance with the applicable housing standards during a period of use in the previous year, and \nwhere the employer has not had an opportunity to bring the housing back into compliance.\n\nThe following sections of part 654 remain unchanged: \u00a7\u00a7 654.404, 654.405, 654.406, 654.407, 654.408, 654.409, \n654.410, 654.411, 654.412, 654.413, 654.414, 654.415, 654.416, and 654.417.\n\nQ. Part 658\u2014Administrative Provisions Governing the Employment Service System\n\n\n\n20 CFR part 658 sets forth systems and procedures for complaints, monitoring for compliance assessment, \nenforcement and sanctions for violations of the ES regulations and employment-related laws, including \ndiscontinuation of services to employers and decertification of State agencies.\n\nThe Department's proposed changes update terminology and responsibilities and reorganize various regulations to \nincrease the clarity and efficiency of the provisions involved. Additionally, headings have been revised, when \nnecessary, to reflect proposed changes to the regulations, and language has been added to permit, where relevant, \nthe use of electronic mail and electronic signatures. The complaint system under 20 CFR part 658 does not apply to \ncomplaints filed under WIOA title I.\n\nDuring the 1980 rulemaking, the Department received numerous comments about the proposed complaint system \nat 20 CFR part 658 subpart E (Complaint System) including comments that focused on the limited staff resources \navailable to provide all labor exchange services including the handling of complaints. The Department took those \ncomments into account and limited the complaint system to only take in writing those complaints that were \u201cJob \nService (JS) related or those non-JS related complaints that [were] filed by MSFWs alleging violations of laws \nenforced by ESA or OSHA.\u201d (Since the dissolution of ESA on Nov. 8, 2009, the WHD has taken on the relevant \nenforcement responsibilities (45 FR 39454, 39456 (June 10, 1980.)) The Department now believes it is appropriate \nand consistent with the Richey Order to allow most employment-related law complaints by MSFWs to be recorded, \nreferred, and tracked to resolution (except those that relate to WIOA title I complaints which follow a different \nprocess\u2014see WIOA title I sec. 181(c)). Technological advances in the workplace since 1980, such as the \nwidespread use of computer software and systems, have made performing such work feasible with limited staff \nresources. Additionally, recording, referring, and tracking to resolution the additional complaints will help, directly or \nindirectly, to deter the employment-related discrimination and abuses that MSFWs continue to suffer throughout the \nUnited States.\n\nThe Department proposes to revise the heading for 20 CFR part 658 subpart E from \u201cJob Service Complaint \nSystem\u201d to \u201cEmployment Service and Employment-Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System)\u201d to \naccurately reflect what the Complaint System covers. The Department proposes to eliminate \u00a7 658.401 and fold its \nrevised provisions that relate to the purpose and scope of the subpart into \u00a7 658.400.\n\nRegarding provisions concerning the complaint system at the State level, the Department proposes to restructure \nthe previous \u00a7\u00a7 658.410 through 658.418 by placing them in \u00a7 658.411 and breaking them down into subsections \nfor complaints alleging violation(s) of employment-related laws and subsections on complaints alleging violation(s) \nof the ES regulations. Those subsections are further broken down based on whether the complainant is an MSFW \nor not. Proposed new \u00a7\u00a7 658.410 and 658.411 provide an overview of the Complaint System as it pertains to all \npersons who submit a complaint and as it pertains specifically to MSFWs who submit a complaint.\n\nSection 658.410Establishment of Local and State Complaint Systems\n\nIn \u00a7 658.410(c)(2), it is proposed that quarterly complaint logs be submitted to the SMA and the State Administrator \nrather than to the Regional Administrator, unless requested. This change is proposed to increase the efficiency of \nthe Regional Administrator's position that does not require the routine review of the multitude of highly detailed \nlogs.\n\nSection 658.411Action on Complaints\n\nSection 658.411 is expanded to incorporate the majority of the provisions currently in \u00a7\u00a7 658.412 through 658.417 \nin the interest of streamlining and clarity. The Department proposes to eliminate \u00a7\u00a7 659.412 through 658.417 as \nseparate sections. Not included in \u00a7 658.411, however, is the reference currently in \u00a7 658.414(a) to 29 CFR part 42 \nbecause the proposed revisions to the complaint system call for coordination with all relevant enforcement agencies \nconcerning MSFW complaints, and provisions at 29 CFR part 42 discuss such coordination only between WHD, \nOSHA, and the ETA. This new approach ensures that State and local officials will consider forwarding employment-\nrelated law complaints to a broader group of enforcement agencies. Also excluded from proposed \u00a7 658.411 is \nthetext of current \u00a7 658.414(c) that has become redundant because proposed \u00a7 658.410 also states that all \ncomplaints filed by an MSFW must be recorded. The Department proposes to add new \u00a7 658.419 that will \n\n\n\nincorporate the relocated provisions of 20 CFR 653.113 (Apparent Violations) because those provisions set forth \nthe procedures for State agency employees to follow when they become aware of an apparent violation of \nemployment-related law or of the ES regulations which is more appropriately located in 20 CFR part 658 subpart E \nthan in 20 CFR part 653 subpart B that concerns services for MSFWs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 658.411(d)(6) indicates that complaints alleging violations of the ES regulations will be handled to \nresolution if the complaint was made within 2 years from the date of occurrence, versus the 1 year provided \ncurrently at \u00a7 658.401. A 2-year limitations period would be consistent with the limitations period for non-willful \nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a worker protective statute of general application that applies to \nemployment in agriculture and from which the definition of farmwork in 20 CFR 651.10 is largely drawn. Increasing \nthe limitations period to 2 years will provide greater protections to those participating in the ES system by \naccommodating those individuals that do not feel comfortable filing or are not able to file complaints within a year \nfrom the alleged occurrence. Increasing the limitations period by 1 year will not increase the burden on State \nagencies or employers because the Uniform Administrative Requirements for the Wagner-Peyser grant already \nrequires the retention of all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, and statistical records for 3 \nyears, and those records, in many cases, will contain information bearing on complaints filed within the 2-year \nlimitations period. Finally, as with complaints filed under the FLSA, there is little risk that a complaint will become \nstale if it is filed 2 years after an alleged occurrence. The 2-year limitations period would not apply to employment-\nrelated law complaints as each enforcement agency has its own respective limitations period for which it can \nprocess complaints.\n\nIt is proposed that \u00a7\u00a7 658.420 through 658.426 be restructured to conform to the restructured regulations for the \nComplaint System at the State level in which the system is broken down into employment law-related complaints \nand complaints relating to the ES regulations.\n\nSection 658.422Handling of Employment-Related Law Complaints by the Regional Administrator\n\nThe Department proposes to revise \u00a7 658.422 by replacing in \u00a7 658.422(a) the reference to \u201cESA or OSHA\u201d with \n\u201cthe appropriate enforcement agency\u201d to allow for complaints to be referred to the appropriate agency and not \nconfined to two agencies within the Department. Also proposed is the elimination of \u00a7 658.422(d) because its \nrequirement to log all complaints and related correspondence is already set forth in \u00a7 658.420(d). The Department \nalso proposes to eliminate \u00a7 658.423 as a separate section and incorporate its provisions in \u00a7 658.420 that \naddresses the handling and other treatment of complaints.\n\nSection 658.424Proceedings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges\n\nPer \u00a7 658.424(b), the Department proposes to clarify that the rules governing procedures before the Department's \nOALJ at subpart A of 29 CFR part 18 govern proceedings under \u00a7 658.424, except where the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 \n658.424 and 658.425 conflict with the provisions of that subpart. However, the rules of evidence at subpart B of 29 \nCFR part 18 do not apply to this section. This change is proposed to ensure consistency with other ETA programs.\n\nSection 658.501Basis for Discontinuation of Services\n\nIn 20 CFR part 658 subpart F, it is proposed that language be added to \u00a7 658.501(c) to clarify the procedures a \nState agency must follow when an employer participating in the ES system has allegedly not complied with the \nterms of the temporary labor certification.\n\nIn 20 CFR part 658 subpart G, it is proposed that the references to \u00a7\u00a7 658.620 and 658.621 be deleted from \u00a7 \n658.600 because those sections are reserved. It is also proposed that under \u00a7 658.601(a)(1)(ii), \u201cEmployment \nSecurity Automated Reporting System (ESARS) tables and Cost Accounting Reports\u201d be replaced with \u201cthe \nDepartment's ETA 9002A report, or any successor report required by the Department\u201d to conform to what is \ncurrently utilized.\n\nIn 20 CFR part 658 subpart H, the Department proposes to replace outdated or otherwise incorrect terminology. For \nexample, ETA is replaced by the Department, State agency is replaced by State Workforce Agency (SWA), and JS \nis replaced with ES.\n\n\n\nFinally, recognizing that almost all correspondence, formal filings and submissions, and other exchanges of \ndocuments and information between the public and the Department are conducted electronically, these regulations \nclarify that any required filing or submission of documents, etc. via mail or hard copy may also be accomplished \nelectronically.\n\nV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices\n\nA. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563: Regulatory Planning and Review\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 12866 directs agencies, in deciding whether and how to regulate, to assess all costs and \nbenefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating. E.O. 13563 is supplemental \nto and reaffirms E.O. 12866. It emphasizes the importance of quantifying present and future benefits and costs; \ndirects that regulations be adopted with public participation; and where relevant and feasible, directs that regulatory \napproaches be considered that reduce burdens, harmonize rules across agencies, and maintain flexibility and \nfreedom of choice for the public. Costs and benefits are to include both quantifiable measures and qualitative \nassessments of possible impacts that are difficult to quantify. If regulation is necessary, agencies should select \nregulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. OMB determines whether a regulatory action is significant and, \ntherefore, subject to review.\n\nSection 3(f) of E.O. 12866 defines a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d as any action that is likely to result in a rule that \nmay:\n\n(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the \neconomy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or \nState, local, or tribal governments or communities;\n\n(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;\n\n(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and \nobligations of recipients thereof; or\n\n(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising from legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set \nforth in E.O. 12866.\n\nSummary of the analysis. The Department provides the following summary of the regulatory impact analysis:\n\n(1) The proposed rule is a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d under WIOA sec. 3(f)(4) of E.O. 12866; therefore, OMB has \nreviewed the proposed rule.\n\n(2) The proposed rule would have no cost impact on small entities.\n\n(3) The proposed rule would not impose an unfunded mandate on Federal, State, local, or tribal governments as \ndefined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nIn total, the Department estimates that this NPRM would have an average annual cost of $38,437,779 and a total \n10-year cost of $305,556,353 (with 7-percent discounting). The largest contributor to the cost is the requirement \nrelated to the development and continuous improvement of the workforce development system, followed by the \ncareer pathways development and the colocation of Wagner-Peyser services.\n\nThe Department was unable to quantify several important benefits to society due to data limitations or lack of \nexisting data or evaluation findings on particular items. Based on a review of empirical studies (primarily studies \npublished in peer-reviewed academic publications and studies sponsored by the Department), we identified a \nvariety of societal benefits: (1) Training services increase job placement rates; (2) participants in occupational \ntraining experience higher reemployment rates; (3) training is associated with higher earnings; and (4) State \nperformance accountability measures, in combination with the board membership provision requiring \nemployer/business representation, can be expected to improve the quality of the training and, ultimately, the \nnumber and caliber of job placements. We identified several channels through which these benefits might be \n\n\n\nachieved: (1) Better information about training providers will enable workers to make better informed choices about \nprograms to pursue; (2) sanctions to under-performing States will serve as an incentive for both States and local \nentities to monitor performance more effectively and to intervene early; and (3) enhanced services for dislocated \nworkers, self-employed individuals, and workers with disabilities will lead to the benefits discussed above.\n\nThe Department requests comment on the costs and benefits of this NPRM with the goal of ensuring a thorough \nconsideration and discussion at the Final Rule stage.\n\n1. Need for Regulation\n\nPublic Law 113-128, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, enacted on July 22, 2014, statutorily requires \npublication of proposed implementation regulations not later than 180 days after the date of enactment. The \nDepartment has determined that implementing regulations are necessary in order for the WIOA program to be \nefficiently and effectively operated and that such regulations shall provide Congress and others with uniform \ninformation necessary to evaluate the outcomes of the new workforce law.\n\n2. Alternatives in Light of the Required Publication of Proposed Regulations\n\nOMB Circular A-4, which outlines best practices in regulatory analysis, directs agencies to analyze alternatives \noutside the scope of their current legal authority if such alternatives best satisfy the philosophy and principles of \nE.O. 12866. While the WIOA provides little regulatory discretion, the Department assessed, to the extent feasible, \nalternatives to the proposed regulations.\n\nIn this NPRM, the Department considered significant alternatives to accomplish the stated objectives of the WIOA \nwhile also attempting to minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities. This \nanalysis considered the extent to which WIOA's prescriptive language presented any regulatory options which \nwould also allow for achieving the Act's articulated program goals. The Department, in many instances, has \nreiterated the Act's language in the regulatory text and expansions are offered for clarification and guidance to the \nregulated community. The additional regulatory guidance should create more efficient administration of the program \nby reducing ambiguities and subsequent State and local revisions as a result of unclear statutory language.\n\nIn addition, the Department considered and, where feasible, proposed to issue sub-regulatory guidance in lieu of \nadditional regulatory requirements. This policy option has two primary benefits to small entities. First, guidance will \nbe issued following publication of the rules, thereby allowing States, local areas, and small entities additional time \nto prepare their compliance efforts. Second, this level of guidance is more flexible in nature, allowing for faster \nmodifications and any subsequent issuances, as necessary.\n\nThe Department considered three possible alternatives:\n\n(1) To implement the changes prescribed in WIOA, as noted in this NPRM, thereby satisfying the statutory \nmandate; or\n\n(2) To take no action, that is, to attempt to implement the WIOA utilizing existing Workforce Innovation Act (WIA) \nregulations; or\n\n(3) To not publish regulation and rescind existing WIA final regulations and, thereby ignoring the WIOA statutory \nrequirement to publish implementing regulations thus forcing the regulated community to follow statutory language \nfor implementation and compliance purposes.\n\nThe Department considered these three options in accordance with the provisions of E.O. 12866 and chose to \npublish the WIOA NPRM, that is, the first alternative. The Department considered the second alternative, that is, \nretaining existing WIA regulations as the guide for WIOA implementation, but believes that the requirements have \nchanged substantially enough that new implementing regulations are necessary for the workforce system to \nachieve program compliance. The Department considered the third alternative, that is, to not publish an \nimplementing regulation and rescind existing WIA final regulations, but rejected it because the WIOA legislative \n\n\n\nlanguage in and of itself does not provide sufficient detailed guidance to effectively implement WIOA; thus, \nregulations are necessary to achieve program compliance.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory alternatives noted above, the Department also considered whether certain aspects of \nthe WIOA could be phased in over a prescribed period of time (different compliance dates), thereby allowing States \nand localities additional time for planning and successful implementation. As a policy option, this alternative \nappears appealing in a broad theoretical sense and where feasible (e.g., Wagner-Peyser colocation of services), \nthe Department has recognized and made allowances for different schedules of implementation. However, upon \nfurther discussion and in order to begin to achieve the intended legislative benefits of the WIOA, additional \nimplementation delays beyond those noted in this NPRM may create potentially more issues than the benefit of \nalternative starting dates. Specifically, as many critical WIOA elements follow upon the implementation of other \nprovisions (e.g., technology and performance reporting are intrinsically related), discussions around delaying \nadditional aspects became quite complicated such that the interrelatedness of the WIOA's requirements suggested \nthat the alternative of delaying additional aspects was not operationally feasible.\n\nFurthermore, the data necessary to fully review this option does not yet exist, and will not until local workforce \ndevelopment boards (WDBs) conduct procurements and announce awards.Similarly, performance standards will be \nnegotiated at a future time and based upon a variety of factors including State and local economic conditions, \nresources, and priorities. Establishing proposed standards in advance of this statutorily-defined process may not be \nan efficient or effective action. The enforcement methods described in the proposed rule are a reflection of \nprescribed WIOA requirements and entity size should not in and of itself create alternative methods for compliance \nor different time periods for achieving compliance. Although the Department has not determined sufficiently valid \nreasons for altering compliance timeframes in addition to those described in the proposed rule for small entities, we \nseek comment on this issue.\n\nThe Department's initial impact analysis has concluded that by virtue of WIOA's prescriptive language, particularly \nthe requirement to publish implementing regulations within 180 days, there are no viable regulatory alternatives \navailable other than those discussed above.\n\nThe Department requests comment on these or other alternatives, including alternatives on the specific provisions \ncontained in this NPRM, with the goal of ensuring a thorough consideration and discussion at the Final Rule stage.\n\n3. Analysis Considerations\n\nThe Department derives its estimates by comparing the existing program baseline, i.e., the benefits and costs \nassociated with current practices, which at a minimum, must comply with the 2000 WIA Final Rule (65 FR 49294, \nAug. 11, 2000), against the additional benefits and costs associated with implementation of provisions contained in \nthis WIOA-required NPRM.\n\nFor a proper evaluation of the additional benefits and costs of this NPRM, the Department explains how the \nrequired actions of States, WDBs, employers and training entities, government agencies, and other related \nentities are linked to the expected benefits and estimated costs. We also considered, where appropriate, the \nunintended consequences of the proposed regulations introduced by this NPRM. The Department makes every \neffort, when feasible, to quantify and monetize the benefits and costs of this NPRM. The Department was unable to \nquantify the benefits associated with the proposed rule because of data limitations and a lack of operational data or \nevaluation findings on the provisions of the proposed rule or WIOA in general. Therefore, we describe the benefits \nqualitatively. We followed the same approach when we were unable to quantify the costs.\n\nThroughout the benefit-cost analysis, the Department made every effort to identify and quantify all potential \nincremental costs associated with the implementation of WIOA as distinct from what already exist under WIA, \nWIOA's predecessor statute. Despite our best estimation efforts, however, the Department might be double-\ncounting some activities that are already happening under WIA. Thus, the costs itemized below represent an upper \nbound of the potential cost of implementing the statute. The Department requests comment on its cost estimates, \nspecifically in terms of whether it has accurately captured the additional costs associated with the implementation of \nWIOA.\n\n\n\nIn addition to this NPRM, the Departments of Labor and Education have proposed a joint NPRM to implement \nspecific requirements of WIOA that fall under both Departments' purviews. While we acknowledge that these \nproposed rules and their associated impacts may not be wholly independent from one another, we are unaware of \nany reliable method of quantifying the effects of this interdependence. Therefore, our analysis does not capture the \ncorrelated impacts of the benefits and costs of this proposed rule and those associated with the other NPRMs. We \nrequest comments from the public about the appropriateness of this assumption.\n\nIn accordance with the regulatory analysis guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 and consistent with the \nDepartment's practices in previous rulemakings, this regulatory analysis focuses on the likely consequences \n(benefits and costs that accrue to citizens and residents of the United States) of this WIOA-required NPRM. The \nanalysis covers 10 years (2015 through 2024) to ensure it captures major additional benefits and costs that accrue \nover time. The Department expresses all quantifiable impacts in 2013 dollars and use 3-percent and 7-percent \ndiscounting following OMB Circular A-4.\n\nExhibit 1 presents the estimated number of entities expected to experience an increase in level of effort (workload) \ndue to the proposed requirements contained in this NPRM. These estimates are provided by the Department and \nare used extensively throughout this analysis to calculate the estimated cost of each proposed provision.\n\nExhibit 1\u2014Number of Affected Entities by Type Entity type Number of entities\n\nStates impacted by DOL program requirements 6 56\n\nStates without collocated Wagner-Peyser offices and one-stops 7 10\n\nStates without sector strategies 2 21\n\nStates that need to create Unified State Plans 2 14\n\nStates that must pay their share for proportionate use of one-stop delivery systems 2 54\n\nLocal areas without collocated Wagner-Peyser offices and one-stops 2 100\n\nWorkforce development boards 2 580\n\nWorkforce development boards selecting one-stop operators 2 250\n\nLocal Boards performing regional plan modifications 2 300\n\nTransfer Payments\n\nIn addition, the Department provides an assessment of transfer payments associated with transitioning the nation's \npublic workforce system from the requirements of WIA to new requirements imposed by WIOA. In accordance with \nOMB Circular A-4, we consider transfer payments as payments from one group to another that do not affect total \nresources available to society. For example, under WIOA, partners are required to pay their share for proportionate \nuse of one-stop delivery systems. Partners receive sufficient Federal funding to cover these payments, rendering \nthis payment a transfer rather than a new cost. Under-performing States will also receive sanctions under WIOA, \nwhich are similarly classified as transfers as they result in the de-obligation of funds from the State's set-aside. In \naccordance with the State allotment provisions noted in WIOA sec. 127, the interstate funding formula methodology \nis not significantly different than that utilized for the distribution of WIA funds. Final program year grant allocations \nwill reflect WIOA requirements and are under development.\n\nOne example of transfer payments is the expectation that available U.S. workers trained and hired who were \npreviously unemployed will no longer need to seek new or continued unemployment insurance benefits. Assuming \nother factors remain constant, the Department expects State unemployment insurance expenditures to decline \nbecause of the hiring of U.S.workers following WIOA implementation. The Department, however, cannot quantify \nthese transfer payments due to a lack of adequate data.\n\nIn the subject-by-subject analysis, the Department presents the additional labor and other costs associated with the \nimplementation of each of the proposed provisions in this NPRM. Exhibit 2 presents the compensation rates for the \noccupational categories expected to experience an increase in level of effort (workload) due to the proposed rule. \n\n\n\nWe used wage rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Mean Hourly Wage Rate for private and State employees. \n(8) For simplicity, we applied State-level wages to local employees. We also used wage rates from the Office of \nPersonnel Management's Salary Table for the 2013 General Schedule for Federal employees. (9) We adjusted the \nwage rates using a loaded wage factor to reflect total compensation, which includes health and retirement benefits. \nFor the State and local sectors, we used a loaded wage factor of 1.55, which represents the ratio of total \ncompensation (10) to wages. (11) For Federal employees, we used a loaded wage factor of 1.69 based on internal \ndata from DOL. We then multiplied the loaded wage factor by each occupational category's wage rate to calculate \nan hourly compensation rate.\n\nThe Department invites comments regarding the assumptions used to estimate the level of additional effort \nrequired for the various proposed new activities, as well as data sources for the wages and the loaded wage \nfactors that reflect employee benefits used in the analysis.\n\nThe Department uses the hourly compensation rates presented in Exhibit 2 throughout this analysis to estimate the \nadditional labor costs for each proposed provision.\n\nExhibit 2\u2014Calculation of Hourly Compensation Rates Position Grade level Averagehourly wage Loaded wagefactor \nHourlycompensation rate\n\n  a b c = a \u00d7 b\n\nState and Local Employees        \n\nAdministrative staff 12  N/A $17.96 1.55 $27.84\n\nLegal counsel staff 13   40.68  63.05\n\nIT reprogramming or database development staff 14   38.91  60.31\n\nManagers 15   45.32  70.25\n\nTechnical staff 16   43.38  67.24\n\nThe section-by-section analysis presents the total incremental cost of the proposed rule relative to the baseline, i.e., \nthe current practice. At a minimum, all affected entities are currently required to comply with the 2000 WIA Final \nRule (65 FR 49294, Aug. 11, 2000); however, some affected entities may already be in compliance with some \nprovisions of the proposed rule. This analysis estimates the incremental costs that would be incurred by affected \nentities which are not yet compliant with the proposed rule. The equation below shows the method by which the \nDepartment calculated the incremental total cost for each provision over the 10-year analysis period.\n\nImage #EP16AP15.002\n\nWhere,\n\nA l Number of affected entities that would incur labor costs,\n\nN i Number of staff of labor type i,\n\nH i Hours required per staff of labor type i,\n\nW i Mean hourly wage of staff of labor type i,\n\nL i Loaded wage factor of staff of labor type i,\n\nA j Number of affected entities incurring non-labor costs of type j,\n\nC j Non-labor cost of type j,\n\ni Staff type,\n\nn Number of staff types,\n\n\n\nj Non-labor cost type,\n\nm Number of non-labor cost types,\n\nT Year.\n\nThe total cost of each provision is calculated as the sum of the total labor cost and total non-labor cost incurred \neach year over the 10-year period (see Exhibit 3 for the 10-year cost of the proposed rule by provision). The total \nlabor cost is the sum of the labor costs for each labor type i (e.g., administrativestaff, legal counsel staff, and \nmanagers) multiplied by the number of affected entities that will incur labor costs, A l. The labor cost for each labor \ntype i is calculated by multiplying the number of staff required to perform the proposed activity, N i; the hours \nrequired per staff member to perform the proposed activity, H i; the mean hourly wage of staff of labor type i, W i; \nand the loaded wage factor of staff of labor type i, L i. The total non-labor cost is the sum of the non-labor costs for \neach non-labor cost type j (e.g., consulting costs) multiplied by the number of affected entities that will incur non-\nlabor costs, A j.\n\n4. Subject-by-Subject Analysis\n\nThe Department's analysis below covers the expected impacts of the following proposed provisions of the WIOA \nNPRM against the baseline of the current practice under WIA: (a) New State Workforce Development Board \nMembership Requirements; (b) Development and Continuous Improvement of the Workforce Development System; \n(c) Development of Statewide Policies Affecting the State's One-stop System; (d) Development of Strategies for \nTechnological Improvements; (e) State Plan Modification; (f) Identification of Regions; (g) Appoint New Local \nWorkforce Development Board and Appropriate Firewalls; (h) Career Pathways Development; (i) Development of \nProven and Promising Practices; (j) Technology; (k) Selection of the One-stop Operator; (l) Coordination with \nEducation Providers; (m) Regional Plans; (n) Local and Regional Plan Modification; (o) Improved Information about \nPotential Training Program Providers; (p) Sanctions on Under-performing States; (q) Colocation of Wagner-Peyser \nServices; (r) Partners Required to Pay their Share for Proportionate Use of One-stop Delivery System; (s) \nEstablishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including Adding Registered Apprenticeship; (t) Determining \nEligibility of New and Previously Eligible Providers; (u) Biennial Review of Eligibility; (v) Disseminating the Training \nProvider List with Accompanying Information; and (w) Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) Housing.\n\nThe Department emphasizes that many of the proposed provisions in this WIOA-required NPRM are also existing \nrequirements under WIA. For example, the requirement that States \u201cprepare annual reports\u201d is a current \nrequirement under WIA that States routinely undertake. Accordingly, our regulatory analysis focuses on \u201cnew\u201d \nbenefits, costs, and transfers that can be attributed exclusively to the enactment of WIOA, as addressed in this \nNPRM. Much of WIA's infrastructure and operations are carried forward under WIOA and, therefore, are not \nconsidered \u201cnew\u201d cost burdens under this NPRM.\n\na. New State Workforce Development Board Membership Requirements\n\nStates must establish State WDBs in accordance with the requirements of WIOA sec. 101. Under WIOA sec. \n101(b)(1)(C)(i), the majority of the State WDB representatives must be from businesses or organizations in the \nState. These representatives must be owners or chief executives or operating officers of the businesses or \nexecutives with optimum policy-making or hiring authority. WIOA sec. 101(b)(1)(C)(iii)(I) requires the Governor to \nappoint to the State WDB representatives of government that include the lead State officials with primary \nresponsibility for each core program and two or more Chief Elected Officials (CEOs) that represent both cities and \ncounties, where appropriate. In accordance with WIOA sec. 101(b)(2), State WDB membership must represent the \ndiverse geographic areas of the State.\nCosts\n\nTo estimate State WDB costs, the Department multiplied the estimated average number of managers per State (1) \nby the time required to adjust the State WDB membership (20 hours) and by the hourly compensation rate. We \nrepeated the calculation for the following occupational categories: Legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 15 \nhours), technical staff (2 staff for 20 hours each), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We \n\n\n\nsummed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($5,597) and multiplied the result by the number of States \n(56). This would result in a one-time cost of $313,435 in the first year of the proposed rule, which amounts to an \naverage annual cost of $31,343.\n\nb. Development and Continuous Improvement of the Workforce Development System\n\nWIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(A) through (G) require that the State WDB assist the Governor in the development and \ncontinuous improvement of the State's workforce development system, including identifying barriers and means for \nremoving barriers to aligning programs and activities; developing or expanding sector-based training and career \npathways proven to support individuals to seeking to enter and retain employment; developing customer outreach \nstrategies; identifying regions and designating local workforce development areas; developing and continuously \nimproving the one-stop system; and developing strategies to train and inform staff.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the State WDBs' annual labor costs for developing or expanding sector strategies by \nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) by the time required to review the workforce \ndevelopment system (300 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \ntechnical staff (2 staff for 1,260 hours each). We summed the labor cost for both categories ($190,516) and \nmultiplied the result by the number of States that do not have extensive and systematic sector strategies (21). Over \nthe 10-year period, this calculation yields an estimated recurring annual cost of $4,000,838.\n\nSimilarly, the State WDBs' annual labor cost for expanding career pathways strategies was estimated by \nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) by the time required to review the workforce \ndevelopment system (300 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. The Department repeated the calculation for \nthe technical staff (2 staff for 1,260 hours each). We summed the labor cost for the two occupational categories \n($190,516) and multiplied the result by the number of States that do not have policies for career pathways (27). \n(17) Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an estimated recurring annual cost of $5,143,934.\n\nThe Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur to identify regions by multiplying the \nestimated average number of managers per State (1) by the time required to review the workforce development \nsystem (40 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following \noccupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 80 \nhours), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel \ncategories ($11,268) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate this one-time cost of \n$631,001. Over the 10-year period, this calculationyields an average annual cost of $63,100.\n\nThe sum of these costs yields a total one-time cost of $631,001 and an annual cost of $9,144,772, which results in \na total average annual cost of $9,207,872 for individuals from the State level to review the workforce development \nsystem.\n\nc. Development of Statewide Policies Affecting the State's One-Stop System\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 101(d)(6), State WDBs must assist State Governors in developing and reviewing statewide \npolicies affecting the coordinated provision of services through the State's one-stop delivery system, including \npolicies concerning objective criteria for Local Boards to assess one-stop centers, guidance for the allocation of \none-stop center infrastructure funds, and policies relating to the roles and contributions of one-stop partners within \nthe one-stop delivery system.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur by multiplying the estimated average \nnumber of managers per State (1) by the time required to provide objective criteria and procedures (40 hours) and \nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 40 \nhours) and technical staff (2 staff for 120 hours). We summed the labor cost for all three personnel categories \n($21,469) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate this one-time cost at $1,202,284, which \nresults in an average annual cost of $120,228.\n\n\n\nd. Development of Strategies for Technological Improvements\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 101(d)(7), State WDBs must assist State Governors in the development of strategies for \ntechnological improvements to facilitate access and quality of services and activities provided through the one-stop \ndelivery system. These strategies include improvements to enhance digital literacy skills, accelerate acquisition of \nskills and recognized post-secondary credentials by participants, strengthen professional development of providers \nand workforce professionals, and ensure technology is accessible to individuals with disabilities and individuals \nresiding in remote areas.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur by multiplying the estimated average \nnumber of managers per State (1) by the time required to develop strategies (20 hours) and the hourly \ncompensation rate. We repeated the calculation for the technical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed \nthe labor cost for both categories ($4,094) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate a \nrecurring annual cost of $229,291.\n\ne. State Plan Modification\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 102(c)(3)(B), a Governor may submit a modification of its Unified State Plan at any time during \nthe 4-year period of the Plan. Under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3)(A), at a minimum, a State is required to submit \nmodifications to its Unified State Plan at the end of the first 2-year period of any 4-year plan and also under specific \ncircumstances.\n\nThe Department expects that the initial 4-year State Plans would be highly speculative. Therefore, we anticipate \nthat some States would make substantial modifications to the State Plans based on the experiences gained by \noperating under WIOA for the first two years. Based on past experience, we do not expect any subsequent \nmodifications to present a substantial burden.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the labor cost the State WDBs would incur by multiplying the estimated average number \nof managers per State (1) by the time required to review and modify a 4-year State Plan (10 hours) and the hourly \ncompensation rate. We repeated the calculation for the following labor categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff \nmember for 4 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 10 hours each), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 4 \nhours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($2,411) and multiplied the result by the number \nof States (56) to estimate this one-time cost as $135,005, which results in an average annual cost of $13,501.\n\nf. Identification of Regions\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(E), State WDBs must assist State Governors in the identification of regions, including \nplanning regions, for the purposes of WIOA sec. 106(a), and the designation of local areas under WIOA sec. 106, \nafter consultation with Local Boards and CEOs. According to WIOA sec. 106(a)(1), identification of regions is part of \nthe process for developing the State Plan, and is necessary to receive an allotment under other provisions of the \nstatute.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated this labor cost for State WDBs by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (2) by the time required to identify regions in the State (40 hours) and the hourly \ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal counsel \nstaff (1 staff member for 10 hours), technical staff (3 staff for 15 hours each), and administrative staff (2 staff for 10 \nhours each). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($9,833) and multiplied the result by the \nnumber of States (56) to estimate this cost as $550,633, occurring in 2016 and 2020 and resulting in an average \nannual cost of $110,127.\n\ng. Appoint New Local Workforce Development Board and Appropriate Firewalls\n\n\n\nThe Local WDB is appointed by the CEOs in each local area in accordance with State criteria established under \nWIOA sec. 107(b), and is certified by the Governor every two years, in accordance with WIOA sec. 107(c)(2). The \nprocedures for sole-source selection of one-stop operators include requirements about maintaining written \ndocumentation and developing appropriate firewalls and conflict-of-interest policies. A Local Board can be selected \nas a one-stop operator through a sole-source procurement only if the board establishes sufficient firewalls and \nconflict-of-interest policies and procedures that are approved by the Governor.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the labor costs incurred by WDBs by multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per WDB (1) by the time required to appoint a new Local Board (20 hours) and the hourly compensation \nrate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff \nmember for 15 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 20 hours each), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 20 \nhours). We summed the labor cost for the four occupational categories ($5,597) and multiplied the result by the \nnumber of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-time cost as $3,246,289, which results in an average annual cost of \n$324,629.\n\nAdditionally, the Department estimated the labor cost for WDBs to develop written agreements by multiplying the \nestimated average number of managers per WDB (1) by the time required to develop writtenagreements (8 hours) \nand the hourly compensation rate. We repeated the calculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 8 \nhours) and technical staff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for the three occupational \ncategories ($2,411) and multiplied the result by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-time cost as \n$1,398,484, which results in an average annual cost of $139,848.\n\nIn total, these calculations yield a one-time cost of $4,644,773 which results in an average annual cost of $464,477 \nfor individuals from the local level to appoint new boards and set administrative firewalls that avoid conflicts of \ninterest.\n\nh. Career Pathways Development\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 107(d)(5), Local Boards must, with representatives of secondary and post-secondary education \nprograms, lead efforts to develop and implement career pathways within the local area by aligning the employment, \ntraining, education, and supportive services that are needed by adults and youth, particularly individuals with \nbarriers to employment.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the labor cost for WDBs by first multiplying the estimated average number of managers \nper WDB (1) by the time required to develop and implement career pathways (80 hours) and the hourly \ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal counsel \nstaff (1 staff member for 10 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours), and administrative staff (1 staff \nmember for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($12,186) and multiplied the \nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this recurring annual cost of $7,067,938.\n\ni. Development of Proven and Promising Practices\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 107(d)(6), Local Boards must lead efforts in the local area to identify and promote proven and \npromising strategies and initiatives for meeting the needs of employers, workers, and jobseekers (including \nindividuals with barriers to employment), and identify and disseminate information on proven and promising \npractices carried out in other local areas for meeting such needs.\n\nCosts\n\nFor State WDBs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (1) by the time required to identify and promote proven strategies (20 hours) and the hourly \ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal counsel \nstaff (1 staff member for 10 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), and administrative staff (1 staff \n\n\n\nmember for 15 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($5,143) and multiplied the result \nby the number of States (56) to estimate this recurring annual cost of $287,985.\n\nj. Technology\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 107(d)(7), Local Boards must develop strategies for using technology to maximize the \naccessibility and effectiveness of the local workforce development system for employers, workers, and jobseekers \nby facilitating access to services provided through the one-stop delivery system, facilitating connections among the \nintake and case-management information systems of the one-stop partner programs, identifying strategies for better \nmeeting the needs of individuals with barriers to employment, and leveraging resources and capacity within the \nlocal workforce development system.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the cost for Local WDBs by first multiplying the estimated average number of managers \nper WDB (1) by the time required to develop technology strategies (20 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. \nWe performed the same calculation for the technical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the labor cost \nfor these two categories ($4,094) and multiplied the result by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this recurring \nannual cost of $2,374,798.\n\nk. Selection of One-Stop Operators\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(A), consistent with WIOA sec. 121(d), and with the agreement of the CEO for the local \narea, Local Boards must designate or certify one-stop operators and may terminate for cause the eligibility of such \noperators. WIOA sec. 121(d)(2)(A) allows for selection of a one-stop operator only through a competitive process.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Department estimated the cost for Local WDBs by first multiplying the estimated average number of managers \nper WDB (1) by the time required to designate one-stop operators (80 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. \nWe performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member \nfor 40 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 120 hours each), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We \nsummed the labor costs for these four personnel categories ($25,393) and multiplied the result by the number of \nWDBs (580) to estimate this quadrennial cost of $6,348,180. Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an \naverage annual cost of $1,904,454.\n\nl. Coordination With Education Providers\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 107(d)(11), Local Boards must coordinate activities with education and training providers in the \nlocal area, including providers of workforce investment activities, providers of adult education and literacy activities \nunder title II of WIOA, certain providers of career and technical education, and local agencies administering certain \nplans under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nCosts\n\nFor State WDBs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (1) by the time required to coordinate activities with local education and training providers (30 \nhours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational \ncategories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 10 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), and \nadministrative staff (1 staff member for 10 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories \n($5,706) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate this recurring annual cost of $319,528.\n\nm. Regional Plans\n\nWIOA sec. 106(c)(2) requires Local Boards and CEOs within a planning region to prepare, submit, and obtain \napproval of a single regional plan that includes a description of the activities described in the statute and that \nincorporates local plans for each of the local areas in the planning region.\n\nCosts\n\n\n\nFor Local WDBs, the Department estimated this cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of managers \nper WDB (2) by the time required to prepare, submit, and obtain approval of a single regional plan (20 hours) and \nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal \ncounsel staff (1 staffmember for 8 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 40 hours), and administrative staff (1 staff \nmember for 8 hours). We summed the labor cost for the four occupational categories ($8,916) and multiplied the \nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this cost as $5,171,336, which occurs in 2016 and 2020. This \nresults in an average annual cost of $1,034,267.\n\nn. Local and Regional Plan Modification\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 108(a), each Local Board, in partnership with the CEO, must review the local plan every 2 years \nand submit a modification as needed, based on significant changes in labor market and economic conditions and \nother factors. These factors include changes to local economic conditions, changes in the financing available to \nsupport WIOA title I and partner-provided WIOA services, changes to the Local Board structure, or a need to revise \nstrategies to meet performance goals. If the local area is part of a planning region, the Local Board must comply \nwith WIOA sec. 106(c) in the preparation and submission of a regional plan.\n\nCosts\n\nFor Local WDBs, the Department estimated the local plan modification cost by first multiplying the estimated \naverage number of managers per WDB (1) by the time required to review and modify the 4-year plan (10 hours) \nand the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: \nLegal counsel staff (1 staff member for 4 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 10 hours), and administrative staff (1 \nstaff member for 4 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($2,411) and multiplied the \nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-time cost of $1,398,269, occurring in 2018. Over the 10-\nyear period, this calculation yields an average annual cost of $139,827.\n\nSimilarly, the Department estimated the regional plan modification cost for Local WDBs by first multiplying the \nestimated average number of managers per regional board (2) by the time required to review and modify the 4-\nyear plan (10 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following \noccupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 4 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 20 hours each), \nand administrative staff (1 staff member for 5 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories \n($4,486) and multiplied the result by the number of regional boards (580) to estimate a cost of $1,345,766, \noccurring once every four years. Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an average annual cost of \n$269,153.\n\nThe sum of these costs yields a 10-year cost of $4,089,800, which results in an average annual cost of $408,980 \nfor individuals from the Local WDBs to review and modify the 4-year plan.\n\no. Improved Information About Potential Training Program Providers\n\nWIOA sec. 116 establishes performance accountability measures and performance reporting requirements to \nassess the effectiveness of States and local areas in achieving positive outcomes for individuals served by the core \nprograms. The performance accountability measures will provide workers with better information about potential \ntraining program providers and enable them to make more informed choices about programs to pursue. The \ninformation analyzed and published by the boards about local labor markets also will assist trainees and providers \nin targeting their efforts and developing reasonable expectations about outcomes.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated \naverage number of managers per State (1) by the time required to provide additional information about eligible \ntraining program providers (32 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \ntechnical staff (2 staff for 40 hours each) and administrative staff (1 staff member for 80 hours). We summed the \nlabor cost for all three personnel categories ($9,854) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to \nestimate this recurring annual cost of $551,826.\n\n\n\np. Sanctions on Under-Performing States\n\nSection 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA requires the Department to assess a sanction if \u201ca State fails to submit a report under \nsubsection (d) for any program year.\u201d Three reports are required under WIOA sec. 116(d): The State annual \nperformance reports, the local area performance reports, and the ETP performance reports. Of these, only the \nState annual performance reports must be submitted by the State to the Secretary of Labor. Section 116(f)(1) of \nWIOA requires that sanctions for performance failure be based on the primary indicators of performance.\n\nThe sanctions will alter Federal transfer payments. (18) Transfer payments, as defined by OMB Circular A-4, are \npayments from one group to another that do not affect total resources available to society. The Department \nrequests comment and data that would allow for estimation of the transfer that would result from the sanctions \nprovision.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated the costs resulting from labor requirements by first multiplying the \nestimated average number of managers per State (1), the time required to evaluate State performance (40 hours), \nand the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for technical staff (1 staff member for 80 \nhours) and administrative staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the labor cost for all three personnel \ncategories ($9,302) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate a recurring annual transfer of \n$520,939.\n\nThe Department estimates that 56 States will be impacted by this annual cost because we have determined that 56 \nStates will calculate, annually, the performance levels of each State's core programs. Each State will do this on an \nannual basis in order to determine if the State is subject to sanctions, as discussed in proposed \u00a7 677.190 of this \npart, by comparing those levels against the negotiated levels of performance that the State has provided for in the \nState Plan.\n\nq. Colocation of Wagner-Peyser Services\n\nWIOA sec. 121(e)(3) requires colocation of Wagner-Peyser Employment Service offices and one-stop centers \nestablished under title I of WIOA. Colocation is intended to improve service delivery, avoid duplication of services, \nand enhance coordination of services, including location of staff to ensure access to services in underserved areas.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated \naverage number of managers per State (10), the time required to collocate Wagner-Peyser Services (40 hours), \nand the hourly compensation rate. Weperformed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: \nlegal counsel staff (10 staff for 10 hours each), technical staff (20 staff at 25 hours each), and administrative staff \n(10 staff for 5 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($69,415) and multiplied the \nresult by the number of States without collocated Wagner-Peyser Services (10) to estimate a one-time cost of \n$694,152, which results in an annual cost of $69,415.\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated consultant costs by multiplying the estimated consultant costs \n($10,000) by the number of States without collocated Wagner-Peyser Services (10). This calculation yields an \nestimated one-time cost of $100,000, resulting in an average annual cost of $10,000.\n\nAt the local level, the Department estimated labor costs by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers for all local entities within a State (100), the time required to collocate Wagner-Peyser Services (40 \nhours), and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the technical staff (200 staff for \n25 hours each) and administrative staff (100 staff for 5 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all three \npersonnel categories ($631,098) and multiplied the result by the number of local areas without collocated Wagner-\nPeyser offices and one-stops (100) to estimate a one-time cost of $63,109,800, resulting in an annual cost of \n$6,310,980.\n\n\n\nThe sum of these costs yields a one-time cost of $63,903,952, which results in an average annual cost of \n$6,390,395 for individuals from the State and local levels to collocate Wagner-Peyser Services.\n\nr. Partners Required To Pay Their Share for Proportionate Use of One-stop Delivery System\n\nAn important goal under both the local and State funding mechanisms is to ensure that each one-stop partner \ncontributes its proportional share to the funding of one-stop infrastructure costs, consistent with Federal cost \nprinciples. Under WIOA sec. 121(h), in general, State Governors must ensure that costs are appropriately shared \nby one-stop partners. Contributions must be based on proportional share of use and all funds must be spent solely \nfor allowable purposes in a manner consistent with the applicable authorizing statute and all other applicable legal \nrequirements, including Federal cost principles.\n\nThis provision will alter Federal transfer payments, and the Department requests comment and data that would \nallow for estimation of this rule-induced transfer. (19)\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated costs related to this provision (e.g., the cost of developing memoranda \nof understanding) by first multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (50), the time required \nfor States to comply with payment requirements proportional to use of one-stop delivery systems (40 hours), and \nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: Legal \ncounsel staff (50 staff for 1 hour each), technical staff (100 staff for 40 hours each), and administrative staff (50 staff \nfor 5 hours each). We summed these products for all four personnel categories ($419,560) and multiplied the result \nby the number of States that need to pay their proportional share (54) to estimate transfer of $22,656,251 occurring \nonce every three years, resulting in an average annual transfer of $6,796,875.\n\ns. Establishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including Adding Registered Apprenticeship\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 122, the Governor, after consultation with the State WDB, must establish criteria, information \nrequirements, and procedures regarding the eligibility of providers of training services to receive funds under WIOA \nfor the provision of training services in local areas in the State. Training providers, including those operating under \nthe individual training account exceptions, must qualify as ETPs, except for those engaged in on-the-job and \ncustomized training (for which the Governor should establish qualifying procedures). Registered apprenticeship \nprograms are included in the ETPL, provided the program remains eligible. Only providers that the State \ndetermines to be eligible under WIOA sec. 122 may receive training funds under WIOA title I-B.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated this cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (1), the time needed to establish procedures for training provider eligibility (40 hours), and the \nhourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 20 \nhours) and technical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours). We summed the labor cost for all three personnel \ncategories ($9,450) and multiplied the result by the number of States that need to pay their proportional share (56) \nto estimate this one-time cost of $529,202, resulting in an annual cost of $52,920.\n\nt. Determining Eligibility of New and Previously Eligible Providers\n\nUnder the requirements of WIOA sec. 122, the procedures for determining eligibility of providers are established by \nthe Governor, after consultation with the State WDB and include application and renewal procedures, eligibility \ncriteria, and information requirements.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated \naverage number of managers per State (1), the time needed to determine provider eligibility (40 hours), and the \nhourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the technical staff (2 staff for 110 hours each) \nand administrative staff (2 staff for 50 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all three personnel categories \n\n\n\n($20,386) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate a one-time cost of $1,141,628, \nresulting in an annual cost of $114,163.\n\nu. Biennial Review of Eligibility\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 122(c)(2), training provider eligibility criteria established under this provision must include \nprocedures for biennial review and renewal of eligibility for providers of training services.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (1), the time needed to perform the eligibility review (30 hours), and the hourly compensation \nrate. We performed the same calculation for the technical staff (2 staff for 60 hours each) and administrative staff (2 \nstaff for 30 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all three personnel categories ($11,846) and multiplied the \nresult by the number of States (56) to estimate cost of $663,395 that occurs four times over the 10-year analysis \nperiod, that is, an annual cost of $265,358.\n\nv. Disseminating the Training Provider List With Accompanying Information\n\nUnder WIOA sec. 122(d), the Governor must ensure preparation of an appropriate list of providers determined to be \neligible under this section to offer a program in the State (and, as appropriate, in a local area), accompanied by \ninformation identifying the recognized post-secondary credential offered by the provider and other appropriate \ninformation. The list must be provided to the Local Boards in the State, and made available to such participants and \nto members of the public through the one-stop delivery system in the State.\n\nCosts\n\nAt the State level, the Department estimated this labor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \nmanagers per State (1), the time needed to disseminate the ETPL with accompanying information (30 hours), and \nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following occupational categories: \nTechnical staff (2 staff for 80 hours each), administrative staff (2 staff for 45 hours), and IT reprogramming \n(database development) staff (2 staff for 125 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel \ncategories ($30,449) and multiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate a one-time cost of \n$1,705,125, resulting in an annual cost of $170,513.\n\nw. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Housing\n\nWhile bringing the Department's housing standards at 20 CFR 654 (ETA Standards) under the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration (OSHA) provisions set forth in 29 CFR 1910.142 will not completely remedy many of the \ninadequate housing conditions common among agricultural housing facilities, the Department anticipates the \nchange will: (1) Update the housing standards as the OSHA provisions conform to slightly more modern standards; \n(2) streamline the compliance process for employers who will only need to look to one place to comply with \nhousing standards; and (3) ease the administrative burden on State and Federal employees who conduct housing \ninspections as they will only need to learn and rely upon one set of housing standards.\n\nIn estimating the impact of the proposed changes to 20 CFR 654, the Department consulted various agencies \nwithin DOL to uncover pertinent data. Such data includes the number of H-2A employers approved through the \nOffice of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The Department believes that reviewing H-2A employer data is useful \nas it represents a subset of population (and, therefore, a minimum) of the total number of employers that may be \noffering housing to agricultural workers and who may be affected by the proposed changes. The Department \nestimates that of the approximately 6,400 (20) employers nationally who hire foreign workers under the H-2A \nprogram and who provide housing, the majority will not be affected by the proposed changes because it estimates \nthat, nationally, OSHA housing standards apply more frequently than the ETA Standards in the context of housing \ninvestigations. Specifically, the Department estimates that every region, except the Northeast and Pacific \nNorthwest, has agricultural housing that predominantly falls under the OSHA standards. However, the situation will \nvary from State to State. For example, Colorado reported that approximately 84 percent of the agricultural housing \ninspected in the State from July 1, 2014 to January 29, 2015 falls under the ETA standards. Wyoming reported that \n64 percent of the housing inspections over the course of a year fell under ETA standards.\n\n\n\nHowever, the housing data currently available to DOL is limited. The Department collects agricultural housing \ninformation as it pertains to employers' compliance with the appropriate standards. The Department does not \ncollect or track the number of agricultural housing units nationally that fall under the ETA versus the OSHA \nstandards. To better understand the impact of the proposed regulations, the Department would like to know: (1) The \napproximate number of agricultural housing units in the United States provided by agricultural employers for \nfarmworkers; (2) the approximate percentage of the total farmworker housing units that currently fall under the ETA \nStandards set forth in 20 CFR 654; and (3) the estimated cost of bringing those housing units from the ETA \nStandards into compliance with the OSHA Standards. The Department would appreciate public feedback on the \naforementioned data elements.\n\nSpecifically, it would be helpful for DOL's analysis if: (1) There are State Workforce Agencies or States that would \nshare any data on the total number of employer-provided agricultural housing units in the State and the percentage \nof those that are subject to the ETA Standards; and (2) agricultural employers would furnish estimated costs for \nbringing their farmworker housing units from ETA to OSHA Standards. The Department appreciates any such \ninformation that could assist in the development of the overall impact analysis.\n\n5. Summary of Analysis\n\nExhibit 3 summarizes the annual and total costs of the proposed rule. It summarizes the total 10-year total costs \nand the average annualized costs for each provision of the proposed rule. The exhibit also presents high-level \nbenefits resulting from full WIOA implementation for each provision. These qualitative forecasts are predicated on \nprogram experience and are outcomes for which data will only become available after implementation. The \nDepartment estimates the average annual cost of the proposed rule over the 10-year period of analysis at $38.4 \nmillion. The largest contributor to this cost is the provision related to the development and improvement of the \nworkforce development system, which amounts to an estimated $9.2 million per year. The next largest cost results \nfrom career pathways development at $7.1 million per year, followed by the cost of partners required to pay their \nshare for proportionate use of one-stop delivery system at an estimated $6.8 million per year.\n\nExhibit 3\u2014Costs of the Proposed Rule by Provision Provision Total 10-year cost(undiscounted) Average annual \ncost(undiscounted) Percent oftotal cost Qualitative benefit highlights\n\n(a) New State Workforce Development Board Membership Requirements $313,435 $31,343 0.08 Policy \nimplementation efficiencies from reduced size and maneuverability.\n\n(b) Development and Continuous Improvement of the Workforce Development System 92,078,720 9,207,872 23.96 \nMission clarification and ongoing commitment should foster future envisioned benefits continuing to accrue.\n\n(c) Development of Statewide Policies Affecting the State's One-stop System 1,202,284 120,228 0.31 Mission \nclarification for State WDBs and overall system building capacity.\n\n(d) Development of Strategies for Technological Improvements 2,292,909 229,291 0.60 Recognition of the \nefficiencies generated by technology and enhanced management capabilities especially utilizing outcome data.\n\n(e) State Plan Modification 135,005 13,501 0.04 More efficient use of public resources; enhanced customer service; \nimproved program management based on actual client data.\n\n(f) Identification of Regions 1,101,266 110,127 0.29 Enhanced employer and employee services as a result of \nrecognition of real labor markets (without artificial jurisdictional boundaries).\n\n(g) Appoint New Local Workforce Development Board and Appropriate Firewalls 4,644,773 464,477 1.21 Efficient \nuse of board time; avoids conflicts of interest and negative publicity; administrative savings.\n\n(h) Career Pathways Development 70,679,380 7,067,938 18.39 Improved educational and employment outcomes; \npotential employees are better prepared for jobs.\n\n(i) Development of Proven and Promising Practices 2,879,850 287,985 0.75 Improved job placements and \ncustomer service.\n\n\n\n(j) Technology 23,747,984 2,374,798 6.18 Improved customer service; better decision-making from improved \nservice level data; reduced paper costs, improved collaboration across service partners; improved customer service \nplanning; reduced duplication of service intakes.\n\n(k) Selection of the One-stop Operator 19,044,540 1,904,454 4.95 Improved public confidence in the process; \navoided conflicts of interest.\n\n(l) Coordination with Education Providers 3,195,282 319,528 0.83 Improved preparation of workers and youth for \nfuture jobs; enhanced placements and outcomes.\n\n(m) Regional Plans 10,342,671 1,034,267 2.69 Savings from expanded collaboration; increased services to \ncustomers; reduced administrative overhead.\n\n(n) Local and Regional Plan Modification 4,089,800 408,980 1.06 Increased coordination of services leading to \nresource efficiencies; transparency.\n\n(o) Improved Information about Potential Training Program Providers 5,518,258 551,826 1.44 Improved customer \ndecision-making; linkage of resources to outcomes and accountability for training and improved placement \noutcomes.\n\n(p) Sanctions on Under-performing States 5,209,389 520,939 1.36 Improved services; better use of WIOA funds; \nenhanced recognition of performance imperatives by States and local areas; more accountability.\n\n(q) Co-location of Wagner-Peyser Services 63,903,952 6,390,395 16.63 Reduced administrative overhead; \nimproved service delivery and customer service; more efficient and effective public administration.\n\n(r) Partners Required to Pay their Share for Proportionate Use of One-stop Delivery System 67,968,752 6,796,875 \n17.68 Expanded system cohesion; improved service delivery; avoidance of fragmented or duplication of services.\n\n(s) Establishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including Adding Registered Apprenticeship 529,202 \n52,920 0.14 Increased training opportunities, especially for youth; effective administration linking to accountability \nand outcomes.\n\n(t) Determining Eligibility of New and Previously Eligible Providers 1,141,628 114,163 0.30 Increased transparency; \nuniform treatment of ETPs; reduced incidents of non-meritorious performance.\n\n(u) Biennial Review of Eligibility 2,653,580 265,358 0.69 Increased competition leading to more and better \nplacements.\n\n(v) Disseminating the Training Provider List with Accompanying Information 1,705,125 170,513 0.44 More informed \ncustomer choice; clearer link of training resources to desired outcomes; more transparency.\n\n(w) Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Housing Not quantified.

The Department estimates the total \nfirst-year cost of the proposed rule at $94.6 million. The largest contributor to the first-year cost is the provision \nrelated to the colocation of Wagner-Peyser services $63.9 million. The next largest first-year cost results from \ndevelopment and continuous improvement of the workforce development system, amounting to $9.8 million, \nfollowed by the cost of career pathways development at $7.1 million.\n\nExhibit 4\u2014First-Year Cost of the Proposed Rule by Provision  Total first-yearcost Percent of totalfirst-year cost\n\n(a) New State Workforce Development Board Membership Requirements $313,435 0.33\n\n(b) Development and Continuous Improvement of the Workforce Development System 9,775,773 10.34\n\n(c) Development of Statewide Policies Affecting the State's One-stop System 1,202,284 1.27\n\n(d) Development of Strategies for Technological Improvements 229,291 0.24\n\n\n\n(e) State Plan Modification 0 0.00\n\n(f) Identification of Regions 0 0.00\n\n(g) Appoint New Local Workforce Development Board and Appropriate Firewalls 4,644,773 4.91\n\n(h) Career Pathways Development 7,067,938 7.47\n\n(i) Development of Proven and Promising Practices 287,985 0.30\n\n(j) Technology 2,374,798 2.51\n\n(k) Selection of the One-stop Operator 0 0.00\n\n(l) Coordination with Education Providers 319,528 0.34\n\n(m) Regional Plans 0 0.00\n\n(n) Local and Regional Plan Modification 0 0.00\n\n(o) Improved Information about Potential Training Program Providers 551,826 0.58\n\n(p) Sanctions on Under-performing States 520,939 0.55\n\n(q) Co-location of Wagner-Peyser Services 63,903,952 67.57\n\n(r) Partners Required to Pay their Share for Proportionate Use of One-stop Delivery System 0 0.00\n\n(s) Establishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including Adding Registered Apprenticeship 529,202 0.56\n\n(t) Determining Eligibility of New and Previously Eligible Providers 1,141,628 1.21\n\n(u) Biennial Review of Eligibility 0 0.00\n\n(v) Disseminating the Training Provider List with Accompanying Information 1,705,125 1.80\n\n(w) Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) Housing Not quantified.  \n\nTotal 94,568,477 100.00\n\nExhibit 5 presents the per-year and total estimated costs of the proposed rule. The total undiscounted cost of the \nrule sums to $384.4 million over the 10-year analysis period, which is an average annual cost of $38.4 million per \nyear. In total, the 10-year discounted costs of the proposed rule range from $305.6 million to $345.9 million (with 7- \nand 3-percent discounting, respectively).\n\nTo contextualize the cost of the proposed rule, the Department of Labor's average annual budget for WIA over the \npast three fiscal years was $2.8 billion. Thus, the annual additional cost of implementing the proposed rule is \nbetween 1.1 percent and 1.2 percent of the average annual cost of implementing WIA over the last three fiscal \nyears (with 3 percent and 7 percent discounting, respectively).\n\nExhibit 5\u2014Monetized Costs of the Proposed DOL Rule Year Total costs\n\n2015 $94,568,478\n\n2016 32,567,226\n\n2017 43,153,328\n\n2018 24,039,512\n\n2019 20,497,077\n\n2020 55,886,872\n\n2021 20,497,077\n\n2022 22,506,238\n\n2023 43,153,328\n\n2024 27,508,652\n\nUndiscounted 10-year Total 384,377,787\n\n10-year Total with 3% Discounting 345,897,084\n\n\n\n10-year Total with 7% Discounting 305,556,353\n\n10-year Average 38,437,778\n\nAnnualized with 3% Discounting 40,549,690\n\nAnnualized with 7% Discounting 43,504,350\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Department was unable to quantify the benefits associated with the proposed rule because of data limitations \nand a lack of operational (WIOA) data or evaluation findings on the provisions of the proposed rule. Thus, the \nDepartment is unable to provide monetary estimates of several important benefits to society, including the \nincreased employment opportunities for unemployed or under-employed U.S. workers, benefits of colocation of \nWagner-Peyser Services, enhanced ETP process, regional planning, and evaluation of State programs. In support \nof a State's strategic plan and goals, State-conducted evaluation and research of programs would enable each \nState to test various interventions geared toward State conditions and opportunities. Results from such evaluation \nand research, if used by States, could improve service quality and effectiveness and, thus, potentially lead to higher \nemployment rates and earnings among participants. Implementing various innovations that have been tested and \nfound effective could also lead to lower unit costs and increased numbers of individuals served within a State. \nSharing the findings nationally could lead to new service or management practices that other States could adopt to \nimprove participant results, lower unit costs, or increase the number served.\n\nThe Department invites comments regarding possible data sources or methodologies for estimating these benefits. \nIn addition, the Department invites comments regarding other benefits that might arise from the proposed rule and \nhow these benefits could be estimated.\n\nThe Department provides a qualitative description of the anticipated WIOA benefits below. These qualitative \nforecasts are predicated on program experience and are outcomes for which data will only become available after \nimplementation. Although these studies are largely based on programs and their existing requirements under WIA, \nwe believe that they capture the essence of the societal benefits that can be expected from this proposed rule.\n\nTraining's impact on placement. A recent study found that flexible and innovative training which is closely related to \na real and in-demand occupation is associated with better labor market outcomes for training participants. Youth \ndisconnected from work and school can benefit from comprehensive and integrated models of training that combine \neducation, occupational skills, and support services. (21) However, the study noted that evidence for effective \nemployment and training-related programs for youth is less extensive than for adults, and that there are fewer \npositive findings from evaluations. (22) The WIA youth program remains largely untested. (23) One study found that \nWIA training services increase placement rates by 4.4 percent among adults and by 5.9 percent among dislocated \nworkers, (24) while another study concluded that placement rates are 3 to 5 percent higher among all training \nrecipients. (25)\n\nParticipants in occupational training had a \u201c5 percentage points higher reemployment rate than those who received \nno training, and reemployment rates were highest among recipients of on-the-job training, a difference of 10 to 11 \npercentage points.\u201d (26) However, the study found that training did not correspond to higher employment retention \nor earnings. (27) A Youth Opportunity Grant Initiative study found that Youth Opportunity was successful at \nimproving outcomes for high-poverty youth. Youth Opportunity also increased the labor-force participation rate \noverall and for subgroups, including 16- to 19-year-old adolescents, women, African Americans, and in-school \nyouth. (28) Department-sponsored research found that participants who received core services (often funded by \nEmployment Services) and other services in American Job Centers were more likely to enter and retain \nemployment. (29)\n\nTraining's impact on wages. Before enactment of WIA, Job Training Partnership Act services had a modest but \nstatistically significant impact on the earnings of adult participants. (30) WIA training increased participants' \nquarterly earnings by $660; these impacts persisted beyond two years and were largest among women. (31) WIA \nadult program participants who received core services (e.g. skill assessment, labor market information) or intensive \nservices (e.g. specialized assessments, counseling) earned up to $200 more per quarter than non-WIA participants. \n\n\n\nParticipants who received training services in addition to core and intensive services initially earned less but caught \nup within 10 quarters with the earnings of participants who only received core or intensive services; marginal \nbenefits of training could exceed $400 per quarter. Earnings progressions were similar for WIA adult program \nparticipants and users of thelabor exchange only. (32) WIA training services also improved participants' long-term \nwage rates, doubling earnings after 10 quarters over those not receiving training services. (33) However, WIA \nparticipants who did not receive training earned $550 to $700 more in the first quarter after placement. The study \nalso noted that individuals who did not receive training received effective short-term counseling that enabled them \nto gain an immediate advantage in the labor market. (34)\n\nAnother Department program, the Job Corps program for disadvantaged youth and young adults, produced \nsustained increases in earnings for participants in their early twenties. Students who completed Job Corps \nvocational training experienced average earnings increases by the fourth follow-up year over the comparison group, \nwhereas those who did not complete training experienced no increase. (35)\n\nAnother publication also noted that, on average, adults experienced a $743 quarterly post-exit earnings boost. (36)\n\nThose who completed training experienced a 15-percent increase in employment rates and an increase in hourly \nwages of $1.21 relative to participants without training. (37) Participation in WIA training also had a distinct positive, \nbut smaller, impact on employment and earnings, with employment 4.4 percentage points higher and quarterly \nearnings $660 higher than comparison group members.\n\nThe following are channels through which these benefits might be achieved:\n\nBetter information for workers. The accountability measures would provide workers with higher-quality information \nabout potential training program providers and enable them to make better informed choices about which programs \nto pursue. The information analyzed and published by the WDBs about local labor markets also would help trainees \nand providers target their efforts and develop reasonable expectations about outcomes.\n\nConsumers of educational services, including disadvantaged and displaced workers, require reliable information \non the value of different training options to make informed choices. Displaced workers tend to be farther removed \nfrom schooling and lack information about available courses and the fields with the highest financial return. (38) \nGiven these information gaps and financial pressures, it is important that displaced workers learn of the returns to \nvarious training plans. (39) Still, one study determined that the cost-effectiveness of WIA job training for \ndisadvantaged workers is \u201cmodestly positive\u201d due perhaps to the limited sample of States on which the research \nwas based. (40)\n\nSanctions to under-performing States. WIOA requires the Department to place sanctions on States that under-\nperform for two consecutive years. The sanction would be five percent of set-aside funding. Having a clear and \ncredible sanction will serve as an incentive for States and local entities to monitor performance more effectively and \nto intervene early in order to avoid the loss of funding.\n\nEvaluations of WIA indicate that sanctions have a larger influence on programs than incentives. Two-thirds of local \nworkforce investment areas have indicated that the possibility of sanctions influenced their programs, whereas only \nslightly more than half indicated that incentives had an influence. (41) Further, several Job Centers consider student \nplacement outcomes in staff performance evaluations and pay for vocational instructors. (42) This practice has \nsignificantly increased staff interest in successful student placement following program completion. (43)\n\nResearchers expressed concerns over current WIA metrics for workforce development program performance. For \nexample, in issuing high performance bonuses to States in recognition of high performance achievements, the \nmetric negotiation process does not appropriately adjust for variations in economic and demographic characteristics \nor service mix. (44) Additionally, the distribution of these bonuses does not directly correlate with program \nperformance, with some lower performing States receiving larger bonuses than higher performing States. (45)\n\nIt is possible that the proposed rule might result in unintended consequences. For example, the efficacy of \nincentives may be reduced with poor measures, as compensation or recognition may not be commensurate with \n\n\n\neffort and subsequent performance, which could dampen employee motivation. (46) Other unintended \nconsequences may include distortion involving behavior intended to insure against the loss of compensation; also, \nmisrepresentation of outcomes may occur. (47) Researchers have expressed concerns about the current measures \nused to evaluate performance. (48) High performance incentives may unintentionally impact performance \nnegatively if they encourage programs to focus on receiving the award rather than improving program design, \ndelivery, and outcomes. High performancebonuses, therefore, could represent an inefficient use of resources. (49)\n\nState performance accountability measures. This requirement would include significant data collection for Local \nBoards to address performance measures for the core programs in their jurisdictions. This data collection would \npermit the State WDBs to assess performance across each State. Training providers would be required to provide \ndata to Local Boards, which would represent a cost in the form of increased data collection and processing. \nEmployers and employees also would have to provide information to the training providers, which would take time. \nThis provision, in combination with the board membership provision requiring employer/business representation, \nis expected to improve the quality of local training and, ultimately, the number and caliber of job placements.\n\nImplementation of follow-up measures, rather than termination-based measures, might improve long-term labor \nmarket outcomes, although some could divert resources from training activities. (50)\n\nBefore-after earning metrics capture the contribution of training to earnings potential and minimize incentives to \nselect only training participants with high initial earnings. (51) The study found that value added net of social cost is \none objective that is too difficult to measure on a regular basis. With the exception of programs in a few States, \ncurrent incentives do not reward enrollment of the least advantaged. (52) In addition, the study noted evidence that \nthe performance-standards can be \u201cgamed\u201d in an attempt to maximize their centers' measured performance. (53)\n\nPressure to meet performance levels could lead providers to focus on offering services to participants most likely to \nsucceed. For example, current accountability measures might create incentives for training providers to screen \nparticipants for motivation, delay participation for those needing significant improvement, or discourage participation \nby those with high existing wages. (54)\n\nThe following subsections present additional channels by which economic benefits may be associated with various \naspects of the proposed rule.\n\nDislocated workers. A study found that for dislocated workers, receiving WIA services significantly increased \nemployment rates by 13.5 percent and boosted post-exit quarterly earnings by $951. (55) However, another study \nfound that training in the WIA dislocated worker program had a net benefit close to zero or even negative. (56)\n\nSelf-employed individuals. Job seekers who received self-employment services started businesses sooner and had \nlonger lasting businesses than nonparticipants. Self-employment assistance participants were 19 times more likely \nto be self-employed than nonparticipants and expressed high levels of satisfaction with self-employment. A study of \nMaine, New Jersey, and New York programs found that participants were four times more likely to obtain \nemployment of any kind than nonparticipants. (57)\n\nWorkers with disabilities. A study of individuals with disabilities enrolled in training for a broad array of occupations \n(including wastewater treatment, auto body repair, meat cutter/wrapper, clerical support staff, surgical tools \ntechnician, and veterinary assistant) found that the mean hourly wage and hours worked per quarter for program \ngraduates were higher than for individuals who did not complete the program.\n\nIn conclusion, after a review of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the impacts of this NPRM, the \nDepartment has determined that the societal benefits justify the anticipated costs.\n\nB. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\nThe purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., include minimizing the \npaperwork burden on affected entities. The PRA requires certain actions before an agency can adopt or revise a \ncollection of information, including publishing for public comment a summary of the collection of information and a \nbrief description of the need for and proposed use of the information.\n\n\n\nAs part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, the Department conducts a \npreclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to \ncomment on proposed and continuing collections of information in accordance with the PRA. See 44 U.S.C. \n3506(c)(2)(A). This activity helps to ensure that the public understands the Department's collection instructions, \nrespondents can provide the requested data in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) \nis minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the Department can properly assess the impact of \ncollection requirements on respondents. Furthermore, the PRA requires all Federal agencies to analyze proposed \nregulations for potential time burdens on the regulated community created by provisions in the proposed \nregulations, which require the submission of information. The information collection requirements must also be \nsubmitted to the OMB for approval.\n\nThe Department notes that a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless it is \napproved by the OMB under the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB control number. The public is also not \nrequired to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. In \naddition, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person will be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a \ncollection of information if the collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control number (44 \nU.S.C. 3512).\n\nThe information collections in this rule are summarized as follows. (Detailed information about the information \ncollections identified in this summary is available in the section-by-section discussion of this NPRM, Section IV.) \nThe table below captures the current and proposed burden hours associated with the information collections.\n\nCurrent and Proposed Information Collection Burdens OMB approval No. Burden hours currentlyapproved Burden \nhours proposed Change\n\n1205-0NEW 0 8,550 8,550\n\n1205-3NEW * 161,373 161,373 0\n\n1205-0001 416 416 0\n\n1205-0039 8,521 8,521 0\n\n1205-0219 38,610 38,610 0\n\n1205-0426 11,440 19,153 7,713\n\n1205-0439 1,006 1,066 60\n\n1205-0461 3,392 5,088 1,696\n\nTotal 224,758 242,777 18,019\n\nThe Department anticipates that the above collections may be phased out or modified, as appropriate, as WIOA \nrequirements are fully implemented.\n\nAgency: DOL-ETA.\n\nTitle of Collection: State Training Provider Eligibility Collection.\n\nOMB Control Number: 1205-0NEW.\n\nDescription: Under WIOA sec. 122, the Governor, after consultation with the State Board, must establish criteria, \ninformation requirements, and procedures regarding the eligibility of providers of training services to receive funds \nunder WIOA for the provision of training services in local areas in the State.

The proposed rule requires that a project implementation plan, which is already required for \nall NEGs under WIA, be submitted post-NDWG award. However, currently this requirement is included only in \nguidance; this NPRM proposes to add this requirement to the regulations. The project implementation plan includes \nmore detailed information about project operations than is required for the initial application. This information \nallows the Department to provide grantees with targeted technical assistance, and to exercise appropriate oversight \nand monitoring over the NDWG award.\n\nAffected Public: State, local, and tribal governments.\n\nObligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit (WIOA sec. 170).\n\nTotal Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 159 (9 additional respondents resulting from this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 1,574 (89 additional responses resulting from this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Annual Time Burden: 1,066 hours (60 additional hours resulting from this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden:$0 (no change as a result of this rulemaking).\n\nNPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under this Control Number: \u00a7 687.150.\n\nTitle of Collection: Employment and Training Administration Financial Report Form 9130.\n\nOMB Control Number: 1205-0461.\n\nDescription: Existing rules require grantees to submit quarterly financial reports. The proposed rule reflects OMB's \nUniform Guidance, which standardizes the administrative, cost, and audit provisions for all grants and cooperative \nagreements provided under part 683. The proposed rule would establish consistent and uniform guidance that \nincreases accountability and transparency, promotes fiscal integrity, and reduces duplication in the quarterly \nfinancial reports.\n\nAffected Public: State, local, and tribal governments, and private sector.\n\n\n\nObligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit (2 CFR 200.327).\n\nTotal Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 848 (no change as a result of this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 6,784 (no change as a result of this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Annual Time Burden: 5,088 hours (1,696 additional hours as a result of this rulemaking).\n\nTotal Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden:$0 (no change as a result of this rulemaking).\n\nNPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under this Control Number: \u00a7 681.430, \u00a7 683.150, \u00a7 \n683.200, \u00a7 683.300, \u00a7 683.730, \u00a7 683.740, \u00a7 683.750.\n\nInterested parties may obtain a copy free of charge of one or more of the information collection requests submitted \nto the OMB on the reginfo.gov Web site at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain.

In order to help ensure appropriate consideration, comments \nshould mention the applicable OMB Control Number(s). The Department and OMB are particularly interested in \ncomments that:\n\n    Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions \nof the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;\n\n    Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including \nthe validity of the methodology and assumptions used;\n\n    Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and\n\n    Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of \nappropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of \ninformation technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.\n\nThe Department notes that in order to meet WIOA requirements, several information collections mentioned in this \nNPRM need to be in place prior to the final rule taking effect. The Department will follow PRA requirements in \nclearing the collections (emergency procedures, as appropriate), including providing appropriate public engagement \nand taking into account the comments received as part of this rulemaking.\n\nC. Executive Order 13132: Federalism\n\nE.O. 13132 requires Federal agencies to ensure that the principles of Federalism established by the Framers of \nour Constitution guide the executive departments and agencies in the formulation and implementation of policies \nand to further the policies of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Further, agencies shall strictly adhere to \nconstitutional principles. Agencies shall closely examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any \naction that would limit the policy-making discretion of the States and they shall carefully assess the necessity for \nany such action. To the extent practicable, State and local officials shall be consulted before any such action is \nimplemented. Section 3(b) of the Executive Order further provides that Federal agencies must implement \nregulations that have a substantial direct effect only if statutory authority permits the regulation and it is of national \nsignificance. The Department has reviewed the WIOA NPRM in light of these requirements and have determined \nthat, with the enactment of WIOA and its clear requirement to publish national implementing regulations, that E.O. \nsec. 3(b) has been fully reviewed and its requirement satisfied.\n\nAccordingly, the Department has reviewed this WIOA-required NPRM and has determined that the proposed \nrulemaking has no Federalism implications. The proposed rule, as noted above, has no substantial direct effects on \n\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain\n\n\nStates, on the relationships between the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of Government as described by E.O. 13132. Therefore, the Department has determined that this \nproposed rule does not have a sufficient Federalism implication to warrant the preparation of a summary impact \nstatement.\n\nD. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\nThis Act directs agencies to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal \ngovernments, and the private sector. A Federal mandate is any provision in a regulation that imposes an \nenforceable duty upon State, local, or tribal governments, or imposes a duty on the private sector that is not \nvoluntary.\n\nThe WIOA contains specific language supporting employment and training activities for Indian, Alaska Natives, and \nNative Hawaiian individuals. These program requirements are supported, as is the WIOA workforce development \nsystem generally, by Federal formula grant funds and accordingly are not considered unfunded mandates. \nSimilarly, migrant and seasonal farmworker activities are authorized and funded under the WIOA program as is \ncurrently done under the WIA program. The States are mandated to perform certain activities for the Federal \nGovernment under the WIOA program and will be reimbursed (grant funding) for the resources required to \nperform those responsibilities. The same process and grant relationship exists between States and Local WDBs \nunder the WIA program and shall continue under the WIOA program and as identified in this NPRM.\n\nWIOA contains language establishing procedures regarding the eligibility of training providers to receive funds \nunder the WIOA program. It also contains clear State information collection requirements for training entities, for \nexample, submission of appropriate, accurate, and timely information. A decision by a private training entity to \nparticipate as a provider under the WIOA program is purely voluntary and therefore information collection burdens \ndo not impose a duty on the private sector that is not voluntarily assumed.\n\nThe Department's following consideration of these factors has determined that this proposed rule contains no \nunfunded Federal mandates, which are defined in 2 U.S.C. 658(6) to include either a \u201cFederal intergovernmental \nmandate\u201d or a \u201cFederal private sector mandate.\u201d\n\nE. Plain Language\n\nThe Department drafted this WIOA NPRM in plain language.\n\nF. Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families\n\nSection 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus \nConsolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681) requires \nthe assessment of the impact of this proposed rule on family well-being. A rule that is determined to have a \nnegative effect on families must be supported with an adequate rationale. The Department has assessed this \nproposed rule in light of this requirement and determined that the WIOA NPRM would not have a negative effect on \nfamilies.\n\nG. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 603, requires agencies to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis to \ndetermine whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nSection 605 of the RFA allows an agency to certify a rule in lieu of preparing an analysis if the regulation is not \nexpected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Further, under the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C 801 (SBREFA), an agency is required to produce \ncompliance guidance for small entities if the rule has a significant economic impact.\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as one that is \u201cindependently owned and \noperated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.\u201d The definition of small business varies from industry \ntoindustry to the extent necessary to reflect industry size differences properly. An agency must either use the SBA \ndefinition for a small entity or establish an alternative definition, in this instance, for the workforce industry. The \nDepartment has adopted the SBA definition for the purposes of this certification.\n\n\n\nThe Department has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, under the RFA at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), and \nproposes to certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities. This finding is supported, in large measure, by the fact that small entities are already receiving financial \nassistance under the WIA program and will likely continue to do so under the WIOA program as articulated in this \nNPRM.\n\nAffected Small Entities\n\nThe proposed rule can be expected to impact small one-stop center operators. One-stop operators can be a single \nentity (public, private, or nonprofit) or a consortium of entities. The types of entities that might be a one-stop \noperator include: (1) An institution of higher education; (2) an employment service State agency established under \nthe Wagner-Peyser Act; (3) a community-based organization, nonprofit organization, or workforce intermediary; (4) \na private for-profit entity; (5) a government agency; (6) a Local Board, with the approval of the local CEO and the \nGovernor; or (7) another interested organization or entity that can carry out the duties of the one-stop operator. \nExamples include a local chamber of commerce or other business organization, or a labor organization.\n\nImpact on Small Entities\n\nThe Department indicates that transfer payments are a significant aspect of this analysis in that the majority of \nWIOA program cost burdens on State and Local WDBs will be fully financed through Federal transfer payments to \nStates. We have highlighted costs that are new to WIOA implementation and this NPRM. Therefore, the \nDepartment expects that the WIOA NPRM will have no cost impact on small entities.\n\nH. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\nThe Department has determined that this proposed rulemaking does not impose a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities under the RFA; therefore, the Department is not required to produce any \nCompliance Guides for Small Entities as mandated by the SBREFA.\n\nI. Executive Order 13175 (Indian Tribal Governments)\n\nThe Department reviewed this proposed rule under the terms of E.O. 13175 and has determined it to have no tribal \nimplications in addition to those created through the reimbursement of WIA and future WIOA program expenses via \nFederally disbursed formula grant funds. The proposed rule would have substantial direct effects on one or more \nIndian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of \npower and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. As a result, a tribal summary \nimpact statement has been prepared.\n\nPrior to developing this proposed rule, the Department held three events to talk with the tribal institutions about their \nconcerns about the current state of Indian and Native American Programs (INAP) as well as what concerns they \nsee in the future. These three events consisted of a consultation webinar and two in-person town hall meetings. The \nconsultation webinar, entitled \u201cListening session on Indian and Native American Programs,\u201d occurred on September \n15, 2014. Two other consultations were held, including an October 21, 2014, town hall meeting with Indian and \nNative American leaders and membership organizations serving Indians and Native Americans, Hawaiians, and \nAlaskan Natives, and a formal consultation December 17, 2014, with members of the Native American Employment \nand Training Advisory Council to the Secretary of Labor.\n\nThe Department received feedback from the Indian and Native American (INA) community and the general public \nthat established several areas of interest concerning the Department of Labor's relationship with Indian and Native \nAmerican Tribes and Tribal Governments. These areas of interest are summarized below.\n\nServices Received in American Job Centers\n\nSpecifically, the INA community expressed interest in learning how American Job Centers will account for the use of \ntheir INA funding dollars and how to ensure that the funds intended for the INA population will be dedicated to that \npopulation. In addition, there were also several individuals that had concerns that INA individuals that enter an \nAmerican Job Center may not get the general assistance that is intended for all people that seek assistance. In \nother words, several commenters wanted to ensure that INA individuals should receive assistance intended for \n\n\n\nother populations that they may qualify for when seeking service. Finally, several commenters were interested in \nlearning more about how INA programs may be required to contribute to American Job Center infrastructure \nfunding and how American Job Centers will account for INA members served to ensure that the American Job \nCenter network is responding to the relevant INA population needs.\n\nFunding Per Participant Was Low for INA Programs Especially When Compared to Other Job Training Programs\n\nMany of the commenters expressed concern that the funds made available on a per participant basis for INA \nprograms were not sufficient to meet the needs of the populations being served. Specifically, many commenters \nstated that funds available for INA youth are inadequate to fully meet their needs. In addition, commenters felt that \nmore funds were needed for INA job training programs to ensure that career pathway training could be carried out. \nSeveral commenters compared the cost per participant funding for other programs, such as Job Corps, as evidence \nof the lack of funding for INA programs. The commenters went on to request a comparison of other WIA-funded \nprograms and the INA programs. Finally, one commenter felt that because of the lack of funds, INA youth were \nbeing served instead of INA adults.\n\nThe majority of comments focused on the use of new funding streams and the requirements attached to those \nfunds. Commenters expressed concern about the issue of using and transferring WIOA funding to support activities \nunder Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992, as amended (Pub. L. 102-\n477). Specifically, commenters talked about the importance of flexibility in adherence to the requirements because \nPublic Law 102-477 programs are tribal programs, may be located in rural areas, and have been effectively and \nefficiently reporting through existing processes, including a single reporting feature in the annual report. \nAdditionally, commenters suggested that vocational rehabilitation, adult education reentry, and other applicable \njob/education-related program funding also should be allowed to support Public Law 102-477 programs. Clarity \naround which funding streams are allowable also was suggested. Commenters also expressed hope that the \nDepartment of Educationwill integrate Carl D. Perkins funding under Public Law 102-477 which allows Federally-\nrecognized Tribes and Alaska Native entities to combine formula-funded Federal grant funds administered by the \nDepartment of Interior, which are employment and training-related into a single plan with a single budget and a \nsingle reporting system. Commenters noted that the Native American Career and Technical Education Program \n(NACTEP) is a required partner, and that NACTEP has limited the partner funds available to fund supportive \nservices and work experiences. One commenter asked if statutory language regarding key investments in \nvulnerable populations would result in an increase in funding for Division of Indian and Native American Programs \n(DINAP) programs. Lastly, it was suggested that the 166 Advisory Council continue, and DINAP programs continue \nto be staffed with Native Americans and Native American Chiefs.\n\nConcerns About the Effects of the New Performance Reporting Requirements Established in WIOA on the INA \nCommunity\n\nMany commenters expressed concern that INA programs would not be able to meet the performance reporting \nrequirements established by WIOA for several reasons, including limited funds to train individuals for the new \nperformance standards and the need to purchase new technology and equipment to meet the reporting \nrequirements. In addition, several commenters said that INA programs will have to be more selective in determining \neligibility for training programs because of insufficient of funding and the increased focus on performance outcomes.\n\nLack of Funding To Hire and Effectively Train Staff and Ensuring Policy Is Responsive to INA Community Needs\n\nCommenters stated concerns that INA programs will not be able to achieve expected performance levels because \nthey lacked funding to adequately staff programs. Several commenters stated concerns about the limited number \nof staff, increased training needs for staff, and the need to ensure that technical assistance is made available to \nstaff. Specifically, commenters are concerned that INA programs may transition slower than States to the new \nWIOA requirements because of funding and staff needs. In addition, they stated that INA programs need more \nfunds to implement new administrative tasks as well as provide services to the INA community.\n\nWorking With States and Other Programs\n\n\n\nCommenters expressed concerns about States' accountability to the INA community and how to make other \ntraining programs administered by the State work comprehensively with INA programs. Others encouraged \nflexibility and freedom in funding in working with these same entities and lauded this flexibility as a way to get more \nout of funds. Furthermore, the commenters emphasized how important it is for Indian and Native American Leaders \nto have a voice in the policy and guidance formulation process so that policy is directly responsive to the needs and \nfunding has to go hand in hand with the needs identified. Some commenters suggested an on-going dialogue \nbetween Indian and Native American leaders, Workforce Investment Boards, local and State agencies, and the \nAmerican Job Centers to discuss training and education that leads to jobs. Some commenters stated that State-run \nprograms need to be more accountable for how they interact with INA populations. Other commenters expressed \nfrustration that some State programs do not see a need to work with INA programs because the States think that \nthe INA programs get money from other sources, such as casinos. Many of the commenters said that they wanted \nbetter collaboration with State-run programs and increased networking among INA programs and State agencies. \nFinally, one commenter stated that collaboration between INA programs and the State-run training systems would \nmake services to individuals more efficient because it would prevent \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d in programs.\n\nThe Department invites public comment about what can be done to address the areas summarized above.\n\nJ. Executive Order 12630 (Government Actions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property Rights\n\nThe Department has determined that this WIOA NPRM is not subject to E.O. 12630, Governmental Actions and \nInterference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights, because it does not involve implementation of a policy \nwith takings implications.\n\nK. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)\n\nThis NPRM was drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12988, Civil Justice Reform, and the Department \nhas determined that the proposed rule will not burden the Federal court system. The proposed WIOA regulation \nwas written to minimize litigation and to the extent feasible, provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct, \nand has been reviewed carefully to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities.\n\nL. Executive Order 13211 (Energy Supply)\n\nThis NPRM was drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 13211, Energy Supply. The Department has \ndetermined the NPRM will not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy and is \nnot subject to E.O. 13211.\n\nList of Subjects\n\nGrant programs-labor, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Unemployment compensation, Wages.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nAgriculture, Employment, Equal employment opportunity, Grant programs-labor, Migrant labor, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n\nEmployment, Government procurement, Housing standards, Manpower, Migrant labor, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n\nAdministrative practice and procedure, Employment, Grant programs-labor, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Youth.\n\n\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Indians, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Migrant labor, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Job Corps.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor.\n\nEmployment, Grant programs-labor, Youth, YouthBuild.\n\nFor the reasons stated in the preamble, ETA proposes to amend title 20 CFR, chapter V, as follows:\n\nPart 603 Federal State Unemployment Compensation Uc Program Confidentiality and Disclosure of State Uc \nInformation\n\n1.

Through this \nsystem, adults and dislocated workers can access a continuum of services. The services are classified as career \nand training services.\n\n(b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local grant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated \nworker programs, is a required one-stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners \ndescribed in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with those provisions:\n\n(1) Career services for adults and dislocated workers must be made available in at least one comprehensive one-\nstop center in each local workforce investment area. Services may also be available elsewhere, either at affiliated \nsites or at specialized centers. For example, specialized centers may be established to serve workers being \ndislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve residents of public housing.\n\n(2) Through the one-stop system, adults and dislocated workers needing training are provided Individual Training \nAccounts (ITAs) and access to lists of eligible providers and programs of training. These lists contain quality \nconsumer information, including cost and performance information for each of the providers' programs, so that \nparticipants can make informed choices on where to use their ITAs. (ITAs are more fully discussed in subpart C of \nthis part.)\n\n\u00a7 680.110\n\nWhen must adults and dislocated workers be registered and considered a participant?\n\n(a) Registration is the process for collecting information to support a determination of eligibility. This information \nmay be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's \napplication. Participation occurs after the registration process of collecting information to support an eligibility \ndetermination and begins when the individual receives a staff-assisted WIOA service, which does not include self-\nservice or informational activities.\n\n(b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under title I other than self-service or informational \nactivities must be registered and must be a participant.\n\n(c) Employment Opportunity data must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for \nWIOA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest \nby submitting personal information in response to a request from the grant recipient or designated service provider.\n\n\u00a7 680.120\n\nWhat are the eligibility criteria for career services for adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?\n\nTo be eligible to receive career services as an adult in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual \nmust be 18 years of age or older. To be eligible for any dislocated worker programs, an eligible adult must meet the \ncriteria of \u00a7 680.130. Eligibility criteria for training services are found at \u00a7 680.210.\n\n\u00a7 680.130\n\nWhat are the eligibility criteria for career services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker \nprograms?\n\n\n\n(a) To be eligible to receive career services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, \nan individual must meet the definition of \u201cdislocated worker\u201d at WIOA sec. 3(15). Eligibility criteria for training \nservices are found at \u00a7 680.210.\n\n(b) Governors and Local Boards may establish policies and procedures for one-stop operators to use in determining \nan individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIOA sec. 3(15). These policies \nand procedures may address such conditions as:\n\n(1) What constitutes a \u201cgeneral announcement\u201d of plant closing under WIOA sec. 3(15)(B)(ii) or (iii); and\n\n(2) What constitutes \u201cunemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the \nindividual resides or because of natural disasters\u201d for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, \nincluding family members and farm workers or ranch hands, under WIOA sec. 3(15)(C).\n\n\u00a7 680.140\n\nWhat Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I adult and dislocated worker services are Local Boards \nrequired and permitted to provide?\n\n(a) WIOA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults and dislocated workers must be used to provide \ncareer and training services through the one-stop delivery system. Local Boards determine the most appropriate \nmix of these services, but both types must be available for eligible adults and dislocated workers. Different \neligibility criteria apply for each type of services. See \u00a7\u00a7 680.120, 680.130, and 680.210.\n\n(b) WIOA title I funds may also be used to provide the additional services described in WIOA sec. 134(d), including:\n\n(1) Job seeker services:\n\n(i) Customer support to enable individuals with barriers to employment (including individuals with disabilities) and \nveterans, to navigate among multiple services and activities (WIOA sec. 134(d)(1)(A)(iv));\n\n(ii) Training programs for displaced homemakers and for individuals training for nontraditional occupations (as \ndefined in WIOA sec. 3(37) as occupations or fields of work in which individuals of one gender comprise less than \n25 percent of the individuals so employed), in conjunction with programs operated in the local area (WIOA sec. \n134(d)(1)(A)(viii));\n\n(iii) Work support activities for low-wage workers, in coordination with one-stop partners, which will provide \nopportunities for these workers to retain or enhance employment. These activities may include any activities \navailable under the WIOA adult and dislocated worker programs in coordination with activities and resources \navailable through partner programs.

One-stop operators must \nconsider the availability of other sources of grants to pay for training costs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies (TANF), State-funded training funds, and Federal Pell Grants, so that WIOA funds supplement other \nsources of training grants.\n\n(c) A WIOA participant may enroll in WIOA-funded training while his/her application for a Pell Grant is pending as \nlong as the one-stop operator has made arrangements with the training provider and the WIOA participant \n\n\n\nregarding allocation of the Pell Grant, if it is subsequently awarded. In that case, the training provider must \nreimburse the one-stop operator the WIOA funds used to underwrite the training for the amount the Pell Grant \ncovers. Reimbursement is not required from the portion of Pell Grant assistance disbursed to the WIOA participant \nfor education-related expenses. (WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(B))\n\nSubpart C Individual Training Accounts\n\n\u00a7 680.300\n\nHow are training services provided?\n\nTraining service for eligible individuals are typically provided by training providers who receive payment for their \nservices through an Individual Training Account (ITA). The ITA is a payment agreement established on behalf of a \nparticipant with a training provider. WIOA title I adult and dislocated workers purchase training services from \neligible providers they select in consultation with the case manager, which includes discussion of quality and \nperformance information on the available training providers. Payments from ITAs may be made in a variety of ways, \nincluding the electronic transfer of funds through financial institutions, vouchers, or other appropriate methods. \nPayments may also be made incrementally, e.g., through payment of a portion of the costs at different points in the \ntraining course. (WIOA sec. 134(c)(4)(G)) Under limited conditions, as provided in \u00a7 680.320 and WIOA sec. \n134(d)(3)(G), a Local Board may contract for these services, rather than using an ITA for this purpose. In some \nlimited circumstances, the Local Board may itself provide the training services, but only if it obtains a waiver from \nthe Governor for this purpose, and the Local Board meets the other requirements of \u00a7 679.410 and WIOA sec. \n107(g)(1).\n\n\u00a7 680.310\n\nCan the duration and amount of Individual Training Accounts be limited?\n\n(a) Yes, the State or Local Board may impose limits on ITAs, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or \nduration.\n\n(b) Limits to ITAs may be established in different ways:\n\n(1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the individual \nemployment plan, such as the participant's occupational choice or goal and the level of training needed to succeed \nin that goal; or\n\n(2) There may be a policy decision by the State Board or Local Board to establish a range of amounts and/or a \nmaximum amount applicable to all ITAs.\n\n(c) Limitations established by State or Local Board policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, \nrespectively, but must not be implemented in a manner that undermines the Act's requirement that training services \nare provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an eligible training provider. ITA \nlimitations may provide for exceptions to the limitations in individual cases.\n\n(d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or \nlocal policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: \nPell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.\n\n\u00a7 680.320\n\nUnder what circumstances may mechanisms other than Individual Training Accounts be used to provide training \nservices?\n\n(a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITAs only when one or more of the following five exceptions \napply:\n\n(1) When the services provided are on-the-job training (OJT), customized training, incumbent worker training or \ntransitional jobs;\n\n\n\n(2) When the Local Board determines that there are an insufficient number of eligible providers in the local area to \naccomplish the purpose of a system of ITAs. The Local Plan must describe the process to be used in selecting the \nproviders under a contract for services. This process must include a public comment period for interested providers \nof at least 30 days;\n\n(3) When the Local Board determines that there is a training services program of demonstrated effectiveness \noffered in the area by a community-based organization (CBO) or another private organization to serve individuals \nwith barriers to employment, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. The Local Board must develop criteria to \nbe used in determining demonstrated effectiveness, particularly as it applies to the individuals with barriers to \nemployment to be served. The criteria may include:\n\n(i) Financial stability of the organization;\n\n(ii) Demonstrated performance in the delivery of services to hard to serve participant populations through such \nmeans as program completion rate; attainment of the skills, certificates or degrees the program is designed to \nprovide; placement after training in unsubsidized employment; and retention in employment; and\n\n(iii) How the specific program relates to the workforce investment needs identified in the local plan.\n\n(4) When the Local Board determines that it would be most appropriate to contract with an institution of higher \neducation or other eligible provider of training services will facilitate the training of multiple individuals in in-demand \nindustry sectors or occupations, provided that the contract does not limit consumer choice.\n\n(5) When the Local Board is considering entering into a pay-for-performance contract, the Local Board ensures \nthat the contract is consistent with \u00a7 683.510.\n\n(b) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, individuals with barriers to employment include those individuals in one \nor more of the following categories, as prescribed by WIOA sec. 3(24):\n\n(1) Displaced homemakers;\n\n(2) Low-income individuals;\n\n(3) Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians;\n\n(4) Individuals with disabilities;\n\n(5) Older individuals, i.e., those aged 55 or over;\n\n(6) Ex-offenders;\n\n(7) Homeless individuals;\n\n(8) Youth who are in or have aged out of the foster care system;\n\n(9) Individuals who are English language learners, individuals who have low levels of literacy, and individuals facing \nsubstantial cultural barriers;\n\n(10) Eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers, defined in WIOA sec. 167(i);\n\n(11) Individuals within 2 years of exhausting lifetime eligibility under TANF (part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct);\n\n(12) Single-parents (including single pregnant women);\n\n(13) Long-term unemployed individuals;\n\n(14) Other groups determined by the Governor to have barriers to employment.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 680.330\n\nHow can Individual Training Accounts, supportive services, and needs-related payments be used to support placing \nparticipating adults and dislocated workers into a registered apprenticeship program and support participants once \nthey are in a registered apprenticeship program?\n\nRegistered apprenticeships automatically qualify to be a on a State's eligible training provider list (ETPL) as \ndescribed in \u00a7 680.470. ITAs can be used to support participants in:\n\n(a) Pre-apprenticeship training, as defined in \u00a7 681.480;\n\n(b) Training tuition for a registered apprenticeship program to the training provider;\n\n(c) Supportive services may be provided as described in \u00a7\u00a7 680.900 and 680.910; and\n\n(d) Needs-related payments may be provided as described in \u00a7\u00a7 680.930, 680.940, 680.950, 680.960, and \n680.970;\n\n(e) Work-based training options may also be used to support participants in registered apprenticeship programs \n(see \u00a7\u00a7 680.740 and 680.750).\n\n\u00a7 680.340\n\nWhat are the requirements for consumer choice?\n\n(a) Training services, whether under ITA's or under contract, must be provided in a manner that maximizes \ninformed consumer choice in selecting an eligible provider.\n\n(b) Each Local Board, through the one-stop center, must make available to customers the State list of eligible \nproviders required in WIOA sec. 122(e). The list includes a description of the programs through which the providers \nmay offer the training services, the information identifying eligible providers of on-the-job training and customized \ntraining required under WIOA sec. 122(h) (where applicable), and the performance and cost information about \neligible providers of training services described in WIOA secs. 122(d) and 122(h).\n\n(c) An individual who has been determined eligible for training services under \u00a7 680.210 may select a provider \ndescribed in paragraph (b) of this section after consultation with a career planner. Unless the program has \nexhausted training funds for the program year, the operator must refer the individual to the selected provider, and \nestablish an ITA for the individual to pay for training. For purposes of this paragraph, a referral may be carried out \nby providing a voucher or certificate to the individual to obtain the training.\n\n(d) The cost of referral of an individual with an ITA to a training provider is paid by the applicable adult or dislocated \nworker program under title I of WIOA.\n\n(e) Each Local Board, through the one-stop center, may coordinate funding for ITAs with funding from other \nFederal, State, local, or private job training programs or sources to assist the individual in obtaining training \nservices.\n\n(f) Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, priority consideration must be given to programs that lead to \nrecognized post-secondary credentials that are aligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in the local \narea.\n\nSubpart D Eligible Training Providers\n\n\u00a7 680.400\n\nWhat is the purpose of this subpart?\n\n(a) This subpart describes the process for determining eligible training providers for WIOA title I-B adult and \ndislocated worker training participants and for publicly disseminating the list of these providers with relevant \ninformation about their programs. The workforce development system established under WIOA emphasizes \n\n\n\ninformed consumer choice, job-driven training, provider performance, and continuous improvement. The quality and \nselection of providers and programs of training services is vital to achieving these core principles.\n\n(b) The State eligible training provider list and the related eligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality \nand labor-market relevance of programs of training services that receive funds through WIOA title I-B.The State list \nis also a means for ensuring informed customer choice for individuals eligible for training. In administering the \neligible training provider process, States and local areas must work to ensure that qualified providers offering a \nwide variety of job-driven training programs are available. The State list is made publicly available online through \nWeb sites and searchable databases as well as any other means the State uses to disseminate information to \nconsumers. The list must be accompanied by relevant performance and cost information and must be presented in \na way that is easily understood, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population \ngroups, and must also be available in an electronic format. The State eligible training provider performance reports, \nas required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4), are addressed separately in \u00a7 677.230.\n\n\u00a7 680.410\n\nWhat entities are eligible providers of training services?\n\n(a) Eligible providers of training services are entities that are eligible to receive WIOA title I-B funds, according to \ncriteria and procedures established by the Governor in accordance with WIOA sec. 122(b) for adult and dislocated \nworker participants who enroll in training services. Potential providers may include:\n\n(1) Institutions of higher education that provide a program which leads to a recognized post-secondary credential;\n\n(2) Entities that carry out programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.);\n\n(3) Other public or private providers of a program of training services, which may include joint labor-management \norganizations and eligible providers of adult education and literacy activities under title II if such activities are \nprovided in combination with occupational skills training; and\n\n(4) Local Boards, if they meet the conditions of WIOA sec. 107(g)(1).\n\n(b) In order to provide training services, a provider must meet the requirements of this part and WIOA sec. 122.\n\n(1) The requirements of this part apply to the use of WIOA title I-B adult and dislocated worker funds to provide \ntraining:\n\n(i) To individuals using individual training accounts to access training through the eligible training provider list; and\n\n(ii) To individuals for training provided through the exceptions to individual training accounts described at \u00a7\u00a7 \n680.320 and 680.530. Training services under WIOA title I-B may be provided through a contract for services \nrather than Individual Training Accounts under conditions identified in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(G). These exceptions \ninclude: on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker training or transitional employment; instances \nwhere the Local Board determines there are insufficient number of eligible providers of training services in the local \narea; where the Local Board determines an exception is necessary to meet the needs of individuals with barriers to \nemployment (including assisting individuals with disabilities or adults in need of adult education and literacy \nservices); where the Local Board determines that it would be most appropriate to award a contract to an institution \nof higher education or other eligible provider to facilitate the training of multiple individuals in in-demand industry \nsectors or occupations (where the contract does not limit customer choice); and, for pay-for-performance \ncontracts.\n\n(2) The requirements of this part apply to all entities providing training to adult and dislocated workers, with specific \nexceptions for entities that carry out registered apprenticeship programs, as described in \u00a7 680.470.\n\n\u00a7 680.420\n\nWhat is a \u201cprogram of training services\u201d?\n\n\n\nA program of training services, as referred to in \u00a7 680.410(a), is one or more courses or classes, or a structured \nregimen that leads to:\n\n(a) A recognized post-secondary credential, secondary school diploma or its equivalent,\n\n(b) Employment, or\n\n(c) Measurable skill gains toward such a credential or employment.\n\n\u00a7 680.430\n\nWho is responsible for managing the eligible provider process?\n\n(a) The Governor, in consultation with the State Board, establishes the criteria, information requirements and \nprocedures, including procedures identifying the respective roles of the State and local areas, governing the \neligibility of providers of training services to receive funds for adult and dislocated worker training activities as \ndescribed under WIOA sec. 133(b).\n\n(b) The Governor may designate a State agency (or appropriate State entity) to assist in carrying out the process \nand procedures for determining the eligibility of training providers. The Governor or such agency (or appropriate \nState entity) is responsible for:\n\n(1) Ensuring the development and maintenance of the State list of eligible providers and programs, as described is \n\u00a7\u00a7 680.450, 680.460, and 680.490;\n\n(2) Ensuring that programs meet eligibility criteria and performance levels established by the State, including \nverifying the accuracy of the information;\n\n(3) Removing programs that do not meet State-established program criteria or performance levels, as described in \n\u00a7 680.480(c);\n\n(4) Taking appropriate enforcement actions against providers that intentionally provide inaccurate information, or \nthat substantially violate the requirements of WIOA, as described in \u00a7 680.480(a) and (b) (WIOA secs. 122(f)(1)(A) \nand (B)); and\n\n(5) Disseminating the State list, accompanied by performance and cost information relating to each provider, to the \npublic and the Local Boards throughout the State, as further described in \u00a7 680.500.\n\n(c) The Local Board must:\n\n(1) Carry out the procedures assigned to the Local Board by the State, such as determining the initial eligibility of \nentities providing a program of training services, renewing the eligibility of providers, and considering the possible \ntermination of an eligible provider due to the provider's submission of inaccurate eligibility and performance \ninformation or the provider's substantial violation of WIOA requirements;\n\n(2) Work with the State to ensure there are sufficient numbers and types of providers of training services, including \neligible providers with expertise in assisting individuals with disabilities and eligible providers with expertise in \nassisting adults in need of adult education and literacy activities described under WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E), serving \nthe local area; and\n\n(3) Ensure the dissemination and appropriate use of the State list through the local one-stop system.\n\n(d) The Local Board may:\n\n(1) Make recommendations to the Governor on the procedure used in determining eligibility of providers;\n\n(2) Require additional criteria and information from local providers as criteria to become or remain eligible; and\n\n\n\n(3) Set higher levels of performance than those required by the State as criteria for local providers to become or \nremain eligible to provide services in that particular local area.\n\n\u00a7 680.440\n\nWhat are the transition procedures for Workforce Investment Act-eligible providers to become eligible under the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n(a) The Governor may establish a transition procedure under whichproviders eligible to provide training services \nunder WIA may continue to be eligible to provide such services until December 31, 2015 or such earlier date as the \nGovernor determines to be appropriate.\n\n(b) After this transition period, which may extend no later than December 31, 2015, the eligibility of these providers \nwill be determined under the application procedure for continued eligibility established by the Governor as \ndescribed in \u00a7 680.460.\n\n(c) Providers that were previously eligible under WIA are not subject to the initial eligibility procedures described \nunder \u00a7 680.450.\n\n\u00a7 680.450\n\nWhat is the initial eligibility procedure for new providers?\n\n(a) All providers that have not previously been an eligible provider of training services under WIOA sec. 122 or WIA \nsec. 122, except for registered apprenticeship programs, must submit required information to be considered for \ninitial eligibility in accordance with the Governor's procedures.\n\n(b) Apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA) are exempt from initial \neligibility procedures. Registered apprenticeship programs must be included and maintained on the list of eligible \nproviders of training services as long as the corresponding program remains registered, as described at WIOA sec. \n122(a)(3). Procedures for registered apprenticeship programs to be added and maintained on the list are described \nin \u00a7 680.470.\n\n(c) In establishing the State requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Governor must, in \nconsultation with the State Board, develop a procedure for determining the eligibility of training providers. This \nprocedure, which must be described in the State Plan, must be developed after:\n\n(1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local Boards and providers of training services \nwithin the State;\n\n(2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor \norganizations, to submit comments on the procedure; and\n\n(3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and \nproviders, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.\n\n(d) For institutions of higher education that provide a program that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential \nand for other public or private providers of programs of training services, including joint labor-management \norganizations, and providers of adult education and literacy activities, the Governor must establish criteria and \nState requirements for providers seeking initial eligibility.\n\n(e) The Governor must require providers seeking initial eligibility to provide verifiable program specific performance \ninformation. At a minimum, these criteria must require applicant providers to:\n\n(1) Describe each program of training services to be offered;\n\n(2) Provide information addressing a factor related to the indicators of performance, as described in WIOA secs. \n116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV) and \u00a7 680.460(g)(1) through (4) which include unsubsidized employment during the second \n\n\n\nquarter after exit, unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit, median earnings and credentials \nattainment;\n\n(3) Describe whether the provider is in a partnership with a business;\n\n(4) Provide other information the Governor may require in order to demonstrate high quality training services, \nincluding a program of training services that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential; and\n\n(5) Provide information that addresses alignment of the training services with in-demand industry sectors and \noccupations, to the extent possible.\n\n(f) In establishing the initial eligibility procedures and criteria, the Governor may establish minimum standards, \nbased on the performance information described in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(g) Under WIOA sec. 122(b)(4)(B), providers receive initial eligibility for only 1 fiscal year for a particular program.\n\n(h) After the initial eligibility expires, these initially-eligible providers are subject to the Governor's application \nprocedures for continued eligibility, described at \u00a7 680.460, in order to remain eligible.\n\n\u00a7 680.460\n\nWhat is the application procedure for continued eligibility?\n\n(a) The Governor must establish an application procedure for training providers to maintain their continued \neligibility. The application procedure must take into account the provider's prior eligibility status.\n\n(1) Training providers that were previously eligible under WIA, as of July 21, 2014, will be subject to the application \nprocedure for continued eligibility after the close of the Governor's transition period for implementation, described in \n\u00a7 680.440.\n\n(2) Training providers that were not previously eligible under WIA and have been determined to be initially-eligible \nunder WIOA, under the procedures described at \u00a7 680.450, will be subject to the application procedure for \ncontinued eligibility after their initial eligibility expires.\n\n(b) The Governor must develop this procedure after:\n\n(1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local Boards and providers of training services \nwithin the State;\n\n(2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor \norganizations, to submit comments on such procedure; and\n\n(3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and \nproviders, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.\n\n(c) Apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA) must be included and \nmaintained on the list of eligible providers of training services for as long as the corresponding program remains \nregistered. The Governor's procedure must include a mechanism for registered apprenticeship programs to indicate \ninterest in being included on the list, as described in \u00a7 680.470.\n\n(d) The application procedure must describe the roles of the State and local areas in receiving and reviewing \nprovider applications and in making eligibility determinations.\n\n(e) The application procedure must be described in the State Plan.\n\n(f) In establishing eligibility criteria, the Governor must take into account:\n\n\n\n(1) The performance of providers of training services on the performance accountability measures described in \nWIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV) and required by WIOA sec. 122(b)(2), which may include minimum performance \nstandards, and other appropriate measures of performance outcomes for program participants receiving training \nunder WIOA title I-B, as determined by the Governor. Until data from the conclusion of each performance indicator's \nfirst data cycle is available, the Governor may take into account alternate factors related to such performance \nmeasure.\n\n(2) Ensuring access to training services throughout the State including rural areas and through the use of \ntechnology;\n\n(3) Information reported to State agencies on Federal and State training programs other than programs within \nWIOA title I-B;\n\n(4) The degree to which training programs relate to in-demand industry sectors and occupations in the State;\n\n(5) State licensure requirements of training providers;\n\n(6) Encouraging the use of industry-recognized certificates and credentials;\n\n(7) The ability of providers to offer programs that lead to post-secondary credentials;\n\n(8) The quality of the program of training services including a program that leads to a recognized post-secondary \ncredential;\n\n(9) The ability of the providers to provide training services to individuals who are employed and individuals with \nbarriers to employment;\n\n(10) Whether the providers timely and accurately submitted eligible training provider performance reports as \nrequired under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4); and\n\n(11) Other factors that the Governor determines are appropriate in order to ensure: the accountability of providers; \nthat one-stop centers in the State will meet the needs of local employers and participants; and, that participants \nwill be given an informed choice among providers.\n\n(g) The information requirements that the Governor establishes under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must require \ntraining providers to submit appropriate, accurate and timely information for participants receiving training under \nWIOA title I-B. That information must include:\n\n(1) The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after \nexit from the program;\n\n(2) The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit \nfrom the program;\n\n(3) The median earnings of program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter \nafter exit from the program;\n\n(4) The percentage of program participants who obtain a recognized post-secondary credential, or a secondary \nschool diploma or its recognized equivalent during participation in or within 1 year after exit from the program;\n\n(5) Information on recognized post-secondary credentials received by program participants;\n\n(6) Information on cost of attendance, including costs of tuition and fees, for program participants;\n\n(7) Information on the program completion rate for such participants.\n\n(h) The eligibility criteria must require that:\n\n\n\n(1) Providers submit performance and cost information as described in paragraph (g) of this section and in the \nGovernor's procedures for each program of training services for which the provider has been determined to be \neligible, in a timeframe and manner determined by the State, but at least every 2 years; and\n\n(2) That the collection of information required to demonstrate compliance with the criteria is not unduly \nburdensome or costly to providers (WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv)).\n\n(i) The procedure for continued eligibility must also provide for the State to review biennially-required provider \neligibility information to assess the renewal of training provider eligibility. Such procedures may establish minimum \nlevels of training provider performance as criteria for continued eligibility.\n\n(j) The procedure for biennial review of the provider eligibility must include verification of the registration status of \nregistered apprenticeship programs as described in \u00a7 680.470.\n\n(k) Local Boards may require higher levels of performance for local programs than the levels specified in the \nprocedures established by the Governor.\n\n(l) The Governor may establish procedures and timeframes for providing technical assistance to eligible providers of \ntraining who are not intentionally supplying inaccurate information or who have not substantially violated any of the \nrequirements under this section but are failing to meet the criteria and information requirements due to undue cost \nor burden.\n\n\u00a7 680.470\n\nWhat is the procedure for registered apprenticeship programs that seek to be included in a State's eligible training \nprovider list?\n\n(a) All registered apprenticeship programs that are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of \nApprenticeship, or a recognized State apprenticeship agency are automatically eligible to be included in the State \nlist of eligible training providers. Some program sponsors may not wish to be included on the State eligible training \nprovider list. Therefore, the Governor must establish a mechanism for registered apprenticeship program sponsors \nin the State to indicate that the program sponsor wishes to be included on the State eligible training provider list. \nThis mechanism should be developed with the assistance of the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship \nrepresentative in the State or, if the State oversees the administration of the apprenticeship system, with the \nassistance of the recognized State apprenticeship agency.\n\n(b) Once on the State eligible training provider list, registered apprenticeship programs will remain on the list until \nthey are deregistered or until the registered apprenticeship program notifies the State that it no longer wants to be \nincluded on the list.\n\n(c) Inclusion of a registered apprenticeship in the State eligible training provider list allows an individual who is \neligible to use WIOA title I-B funds to use those funds toward apprentice training, consistent with their availability \nand limitations as prescribed by \u00a7 680.300. The use of individual training accounts and other WIOA title I-B funds \ntoward apprenticeship training is further described in \u00a7 680.330.\n\n(d) The Governor is encouraged to consult with the State and Local Boards, ETA's Office of Apprenticeship, \nrecognized State apprenticeship agencies (where they exist in the Governor's State) or other State agencies, to \nestablish voluntary reporting of performance information.\n\n\u00a7 680.480\n\nMay an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?\n\n(a) Yes. A training provider must deliver results and provide accurate information in order to retain its status as an \neligible training provider.\n\n(b) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have substantially violated any \nprovision of title I of WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37, must be removed from the list in \n\n\n\naccordance with the enforcement provisions of WIOA sec. 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under \nthese conditions must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all adult and dislocated worker \ntraining funds it received during the period of noncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures which \nindividual or entity is responsible for making these determinations and the process by which the determination will \nbe made, which must include an opportunity for a hearing that meets the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b).\n\n(c) As a part of the biennial review of eligibility established by the Governor, the State must remove provider \nprograms that fail to meet criteria established by the Governor to remain eligible, which may include failure to meet \nestablished minimum performance levels.\n\n(d) The Governor must establish an appeals procedure for providers of training to appeal a denial of eligibility under \nthis subpart that meets the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b), which explains the appeals process fordenial or \ntermination of eligibility of a provider of training services.\n\n(e) Where a Local Board has established higher minimum standards, according to \u00a7 680.460(k), the Local Board \nmay remove a provider program from the eligible programs in that local area for failure to meet established criteria. \nThe Local Board must establish an appeals procedure for providers of training to appeal a denial of eligibility under \nthis subpart that meets the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b), which explains the appeals process for denial or \ntermination of eligibility of a provider of training services.\n\n\u00a7 680.490\n\nWhat kind of performance and cost information must eligible training providers provide for each program of training?\n\n(a) In accordance with the State procedure and \u00a7 680.460(h), eligible providers of training services must submit, at \nleast every 2 years, appropriate, timely and accurate performance and cost information.\n\n(b) Program-specific performance information must include:\n\n(1) The information described in WIOA sec. 122(b)(2)(A) for individuals participating in the programs of training \nservices who are receiving assistance under WIOA sec. 134. This information includes indicators of performance as \ndescribed in WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(I)-(IV) and \u00a7 680.460(g)(1) through (4).\n\n(2) Information identifying the recognized post-secondary credentials received by such participants.\n\n(3) Program cost information, including tuition and fees, for WIOA participants in the program, and\n\n(4) Information on the program completion rate for WIOA participants.\n\n(c) Governors may require any additional performance information (such as the information described at WIOA \nsec. 122(b)(1)) that the Governor determines to be appropriate to determine or maintain eligibility.\n\n(d) Governors must establish a procedure by which a provider can demonstrate that providing additional information \nrequired under this section would be unduly burdensome or costly. If the Governor determines that providers have \ndemonstrated such extraordinary costs or undue burden:\n\n(1) The Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of the information;\n\n(2) The Governor may provide additional resources to assist providers in the collection of the information from funds \nfor statewide workforce investment activities reserved under WIOA secs. 128(a) and 133(a)(1); or\n\n(3) The Governor may take other steps to assist training providers in collecting and supplying required information \nsuch as offering technical assistance.\n\n\u00a7 680.500\n\nHow is the State list of eligible training providers disseminated?\n\n\n\n(a) In order to assist participants in choosing employment and training activities, the Governor or State agency must \ndisseminate the State list of eligible training providers and accompanying performance and cost information to \nLocal Boards in the State and to members of the public online including through Web sites and searchable \ndatabases and through whatever other means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers, including \nthe one-stop delivery system and its program partners throughout the State.\n\n(b) The State list and information must be updated regularly and provider eligibility must be reviewed biennially \naccording to the procedures established by the Governor in \u00a7 680.460(i).\n\n(c) In order to ensure informed consumer choice, the State eligible training provider list and accompanying \ninformation must be widely available to the public through electronic means, including Web sites and searchable \ndatabases, as well as through any other means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers. The list \nand accompanying information must be available through the one-stop delivery system and its partners including \nthe State's secondary and post-secondary education systems. The eligible training provider list should be \naccessible to individuals seeking information on training outcomes, as well as participants in employment and \ntraining activities funded under WIOA, including those under \u00a7 680.210, and other programs. In accordance with \nWIOA sec. 188, the State list must also be accessible to individuals with disabilities.\n\n(d) The State eligible training provider list must be accompanied by appropriate information to assist participants in \nchoosing employment and training activities. Such information must include:\n\n(1) Recognized post-secondary credential(s) offered;\n\n(2) Provider information supplied to meet the Governor's eligibility procedure as described in \u00a7\u00a7 680.450 and \n680.460;\n\n(3) Performance and cost information as described in \u00a7 680.490; and\n\n(4) Additional information as the Governor determines appropriate.\n\n(e) The State list and accompanying information must be made available in a manner that does not reveal \npersonally identifiable information about an individual participant. In addition, in developing the information to \naccompany the State list described in \u00a7 680.490(b), disclosure of personally identifiable information from an \neducation record must be carried out in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, including \nthe circumstances relating to prior written consent.\n\n\u00a7 680.510\n\nIn what ways can a Local Board supplement the information available from the State list?\n\n(a) Local Boards may supplement the criteria and information requirements established by the Governor in order to \nsupport informed consumer choice and the achievement of local performance measures.\n\n(b) This additional information may include:\n\n(1) Information on programs of training services that are linked to occupations in demand in the local area;\n\n(2) Performance and cost information, including program-specific performance and cost information, for the local \noutlet(s) of multi-site eligible providers;\n\n(3) Information that shows how programs are responsive to local requirements; and\n\n(4) Other appropriate information related to the objectives of WIOA.\n\n\u00a7 680.520\n\nMay individuals choose training providers located outside of the local area?\n\n\n\nYes, individuals may choose any of the eligible providers and programs on the State list. A State may also \nestablish a reciprocal agreement with other States to permit providers of eligible training programs in each State to \naccept individual training accounts provided by the other State. See WIOA sec. 122(g). Providers of training \nservices that are located outside the local area may not be subject to State eligibility procedures if the provider has \nbeen determined eligible by another State with such an agreement.\n\n\u00a7 680.530\n\nWhat requirements apply to providers of on-the-job-training, customized training, incumbent worker training, and \nother training exceptions?\n\nProviders of on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker training, internships, paid or unpaid work \nexperience, or transitional employment are not subject to the same requirements as entities listed on the eligible \ntraining provider list. For these training programs, one-stop operators in a local area must collect such performance \ninformation as the Governor may require and determine whether the providers meet the Governor's performance \ncriteria. The Governor may require one-stopoperators to disseminate a list of providers that have met the \nperformance criteria, along with the relevant performance information about them, through the one-stop delivery \nsystem. Providers that meet the criteria are considered eligible providers of training services. These providers are \nnot subject to the other requirements of WIOA sec. 122 or this part.\n\nSubpart E Priority and Special Populations\n\n\u00a7 680.600\n\nWhat priority must be given to low-income adults and public assistance recipients and individuals who are basic \nskills deficient served with adult funds under title I?\n\n(a) WIOA states, in sec. 134(c)(3)(E), that priority for individualized career services (see \u00a7 678.430(b)) and training \nservices funded with title I adult funds must be given to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, \nwho are basic skills deficient (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(5)(B)) in the local area.\n\n(b) States and local areas must establish criteria by which the one-stop operator will apply the priority under WIOA \nsec. 134(c)(3)(E). Such criteria may include the availability of other funds for providing employment and training-\nrelated services in the local area, the needs of the specific groups within the local area, and other appropriate \nfactors.\n\n(c) The priority established under paragraph (b) of this section does not necessarily mean that these services may \nonly be provided to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals without basic work \nskills. The Local Board and the Governor may establish a process that also gives priority to other individuals eligible \nto receive such services, provided that it is consistent with priority of service for veterans (see \u00a7 680.650).\n\n\u00a7 680.610\n\nDoes the statutory priority for use of adult funds also apply to dislocated worker funds?\n\nNo, the statutory priority applies only to adult funds for individualized career services, as described in \u00a7 680.150(b), \nand training services. Funds allocated for dislocated workers are not subject to this requirement.\n\n\u00a7 680.620\n\nHow does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program relate to the one-stop delivery system?\n\nThe local TANF program is a required partner in the one-stop delivery system. Part 678 describes the roles of such \npartners in the one-stop delivery system and it applies to the TANF program. TANF serves individuals who may \nalso be served by the WIOA programs and, through appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have \naccess to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the TANF program in the one-stop system. TANF \nparticipants, who are determined to be WIOA eligible, and who need occupational skills training may be referred \nthrough the one-stop system to receive WIOA training, when TANF grant and other grant funds are not available to \nthe individual in accordance with \u00a7 680.230(a). WIOA participants who are also determined TANF eligible may be \nreferred to the TANF operator for assistance.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 680.630\n\nHow does a displaced homemaker qualify for services under title I?\n\n(a) Individuals who meet the definitions of a \u201cdisplaced homemaker\u201d (WIOA sec. 3(16)) qualify for career and \ntraining services with dislocated worker title I funds.\n\n(b) Displaced homemakers may also qualify for career and training services with adult funds under title I if the \nrequirements of this part are met (see \u00a7\u00a7 680.120 and 680.600).\n\n(c) Displaced homemakers may also be served in statewide employment and training projects conducted with \nreserve funds for innovative programs for displaced homemakers, as described in 20 CFR 682.210(c).\n\n(d) The definition of displaced homemaker includes the dependent spouse of a member of the Armed Forces on \nactive duty (as defined in sec. 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code) and whose family income is significantly \nreduced because of a deployment, a call or order to active duty under a provision of law referred to in sec. \n101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United State Code, a permanent change of station, or the service-connected death or \ndisability of the member.\n\n\u00a7 680.640\n\nMay an individual with a disability whose family does not meet income eligibility criteria under the Act be eligible for \npriority as a low-income adult?\n\nYes, even if the family of an individual with a disability does not meet the income eligibility criteria, the individual \nwith a disability is to be considered a low-income individual if the individual's own income:\n\n(a) Meets the income criteria established in WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi); or\n\n(b) Meets the income eligibility criteria for payments under any Federal, State or local public assistance program \n(see WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(i)).\n\n\u00a7 680.650\n\nDo veterans receive priority of service under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nYes, veterans under WIOA sec. 3(63)(A) and 38 U.S.C. 101 receive priority of service in all Department of Labor-\nfunded training programs under 38 U.S.C. 4215 and described in 20 CFR 1010. A veteran must still meet each \nprogram's eligibility criteria to receive services under the respective employment and training program. For income-\nbased eligibility determinations, amounts paid while on active duty or paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) for vocational rehabilitation, disability payments, or related VA-funded programs are not to be considered as \nincome in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4213 and 20 CFR 683.230.\n\n\u00a7 680.660\n\nAre separating military service members eligible for dislocated worker activities under the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act?\n\nIf the separating service member is separating from the Armed Forces with a discharge that is anything other than \ndishonorable, the separating service member qualifies for dislocated worker activities based on the following \ncriteria:\n\n(a) The separating service member has received a notice of separation, a DD-214 from the Department of Defense, \nor other documentation showing a separation or imminent separation from the Armed Forces to satisfy the \ntermination or layoff part of the dislocated worker eligibility criteria in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(i);\n\n(b) The separating service member qualifies for the dislocated worker eligibility criteria on eligibility for or \nexhaustion of unemployment compensation in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(ii)(I) or (II); and,\n\n\n\n(c) As a separating service member, the individual meets the dislocated worker eligibility criteria that the individual \nis unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(iii).\n\nSubpart F Work Based Training\n\n\u00a7 680.700\n\nWhat are the requirements for on-the-job training?\n\n(a) On-the-job training (OJT) is defined at WIOA sec. 3(44). OJT is provided under a contract with an employer in \nthe public, private non-profit, or private sector. Through the OJT contract, occupational training is provided for the \nWIOA participant in exchange for the reimbursement, typically up to 50 percent of the wage rate of the participant, \nfor the extraordinary costs of providing thetraining and supervision related to the training. In limited circumstances, \nas provided in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(h) and \u00a7 680.730, the reimbursement may be up to 75 percent of the wage rate \nof the participant.\n\n(b) On-the-job training contracts under WIOA title I, must not be entered into with an employer who has received \npayments under previous contracts under WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of failing to \nprovide on-the-job training participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages and \nemployment benefits (including health benefits) and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as \nother employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work. (WIOA sec. 194(4))\n\n(c) An OJT contract must be limited to the period of time required for a participant to become proficient in the \noccupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, \nconsideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level \nof the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's individual employment plan. (WIOA sec. 3(44)(C))\n\n\u00a7 680.710\n\nWhat are the requirements for on-the-job training contracts for employed workers?\n\nOJT contracts may be written for eligible employed workers when:\n\n(a) The employee is not earning a self-sufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy;\n\n(b) The requirements in \u00a7 680.700 are met; and\n\n(c) The OJT relates to the introduction of new technologies, introduction to new production or service procedures, \nupgrading to new jobs that require additional skills, workplace literacy, or other appropriate purposes identified by \nthe Local Board.\n\n\u00a7 680.720\n\nWhat conditions govern on-the-job training payments to employers?\n\n(a) On-the-job training payments to employers are deemed to be compensation for the extraordinary costs \nassociated with training participants and potentially lower productivity of the participants while in the OJT.\n\n(b) Employers may be reimbursed up to 50 percent of the wage rate of an OJT participant, and up to 75 percent \nusing the criteria in \u00a7 680.730, for the extraordinary costs of providing the training and additional supervision related \nto the OJT. (WIOA secs. 3(44) and 134(c)(3)(H)(i))\n\n(c) Employers are not required to document such extraordinary costs.\n\n\u00a7 680.730\n\nUnder what conditions may a Governor or Local Board raise the on-the-job training reimbursement rate up to 75 \npercent of the wage rate?\n\n(a) The Governor may increase the reimbursement rate for OJT contracts funded through the statewide \nemployment and training activities described in \u00a7 682.210 up to 75 percent, and the Local Board may also increase \n\n\n\nthe reimbursement rate for OJT contracts described in \u00a7 680.320(a)(1) up to 75 percent, when taking into account \nthe following factors: (WIOA sec. 134(c)(H)(ii))\n\n(1) The characteristics of the participants taking into consideration whether they are \u201cindividuals with barriers to \nemployment,\u201d as defined in WIOA sec. 3(24);\n\n(2) The size of the employer, with an emphasis on small businesses;\n\n(3) The quality of employer-provided training and advancement opportunities, for example if the OJT contract is \nfor an in-demand occupation and will lead to an industry-recognized credential; and\n\n(4) Other factors the Governor or Local Board may determine to be appropriate, which may include the number of \nemployees participating, wage and benefit levels of the employees (both at present and after completion), and \nrelation of the training to the competitiveness of the participant.\n\n(b) Governors or Local Boards must document the factors used when deciding to increase the wage reimbursement \nlevels above 50 percent up to 75 percent.\n\n\u00a7 680.740\n\nHow can on-the-job training funds be used to support placing participants into a registered apprenticeship program?\n\n(a) OJT contracts may be written with registered apprenticeship programs or participating employers in registered \napprenticeship programs for the on-the-job training portion of the registered apprenticeship program consistent with \n\u00a7 680.700. Depending on the length of the registered apprenticeship and State and local OJT policies, these funds \nmay cover some or all of the registered apprenticeship training.\n\n(b) If the apprentice is unemployed at the time of participation, the OJT must be conducted as described in \u00a7 \n680.700. If the apprentice is employed at the time of participation, the OJT must be conducted as described in \u00a7 \n680.700\n\n\u00a7 680.750\n\nCan Individual Training Account and on-the-job training funds be combined to support placing participants into a \nregistered apprenticeship program?\n\nThere is no Federal prohibition on using both ITA and OJT funds when placing participants into a registered \napprenticeship program. See \u00a7 680.330 on using ITAs to support participants in registered apprenticeship.\n\n\u00a7 680.760\n\nWhat is customized training?\n\nCustomized training is training:\n\n(a) That is designed to meet the special requirements of an employer (including a group of employers);\n\n(b) That is conducted with a commitment by the employer to employ an individual upon successful completion of \nthe training; and\n\n(c) For which the employer pays for a significant cost of the training, as determined by the Local Board in \naccordance with the factors identified in WIOA sec. 3(14).\n\n\u00a7 680.770\n\nWhat are the requirements for customized training for employed workers?\n\nCustomized training of an eligible employed individual may be provided for an employer or a group of employers \nwhen:\n\n(a) The employee is not earning a self-sufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy;\n\n\n\n(b) The requirements in \u00a7 680.760 are met; and\n\n(c) The customized training relates to the purposes described in \u00a7 680.710(c) or other appropriate purposes \nidentified by the Local Board.\n\n\u00a7 680.780\n\nWho is an \u201cincumbent worker\u201d for purposes of statewide and local employment and training activities?\n\nStates and local areas must establish policies and definitions to determine which workers, or groups of workers, \nare eligible for incumbent worker services (WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)). To qualify as an incumbent worker, the \nincumbent worker needs to be employed, meet the Fair Labor Standards Act requirements for an employer-\nemployee relationship, and have an established employment history with the employer for 6 months or more. The \ntraining must satisfy the requirements in WIOA sec. 134(d)(4) and \u00a7 680.790 and increase the competitiveness of \nthe employee or employer. An incumbent worker does not necessarily have to meet the eligibility requirements for \ncareer and training services for adults and dislocated workers under this Act.\n\u00a7 680.790\n\nWhat is incumbent worker training?\n\nIncumbent Worker training, for purposes of WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)(B), is training:\n\n(a) Designed to meet the special requirements of an employer (including a group of employers) to retain a skilled \nworkforce or avert the need to lay off employees by assisting the workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain \nemployment.\n\n(b) Conducted with a commitment by the employer to retain or avert the layoffs of the incumbent worker(s) trained.\n\n\u00a7 680.800\n\nWhat funds may be used for incumbent worker training?\n\n(a) The local area may reserve up to 20 percent of their combined total of adult and dislocated worker allotments \nfor incumbent worker training as described in \u00a7 680.790 (see WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)(A)(i));\n\n(b) The State may use their statewide activities funds (per WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(i)) and Rapid Response funds \nfor statewide incumbent worker training activities (see \u00a7\u00a7 682.210(b) and 682.320(b)(3)).\n\n\u00a7 680.810\n\nWhat criteria must be taken into account for an employer to be eligible to receive local incumbent worker funds?\n\nThe Local Board must consider under WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)(A)(ii):\n\n(a) The characteristics of the participants in the program;\n\n(b) The relationship of the training to the competitiveness of a participant and the employer; and\n\n(c) Other factors the Local Board determines appropriate, including number of employees trained, wages and \nbenefits including post training increases, and the existence of other training opportunities provided by the \nemployer.\n\n\u00a7 680.820\n\nAre there cost sharing requirements for local area incumbent worker training?\n\nYes. Under WIOA secs. 134(d)(4)(C) and 134(d)(4)(D)(i)-(iii), employers participating in incumbent worker training \nare required to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of providing training to their incumbent workers. The amount \nof the non-Federal share will depend upon the limits established under WIOA secs. 134(d)(4)(ii)(C) and (D).\n\n\u00a7 680.830\n\n\n\nWhat is a transitional job?\n\nA transitional job is one that provides a limited work experience, that is subsidized in the public, private, or non-\nprofit sectors for those individuals with barriers to employment because of chronic unemployment or inconsistent \nwork history; these jobs are designed to enable an individual to establish a work history, demonstrate work success, \nand develop the skills that lead to unsubsidized employment. (WIOA sec. 134 (d)(5))\n\n\u00a7 680.840\n\nWhat funds may be used for transitional jobs?\n\nThe local area may use up to 10 percent of their combined total of adult and dislocated worker allotments for \ntransitional jobs as described in \u00a7 680.810 (see WIOA sec. 134(d)(5)). Transitional jobs must be combined with \ncomprehensive career services (see \u00a7 680.150) and supportive services (see \u00a7 680.900).\n\n\u00a7 680.850\n\nMay funds provided to employers for work-based training be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing?\n\nNo, funds provided to employers for work-based training, as described in this subpart, must not be used to directly \nor indirectly assist, promote or deter union organizing. (WIOA sec. 181(b)(7))\n\nSubpart G Supportive Services\n\n\u00a7 680.900\n\nWhat are supportive services for adults and dislocated workers?\n\nSupportive services for adults and dislocated workers are defined at WIOA sec. 3(59) and secs. 134(d)(2) and (3). \nThey include services such as transportation, child care, dependent care, housing, and needs-related payments \nthat are necessary to enable an individual to participate in activities authorized under WIOA secs. 134(c)(2) and (3). \nLocal Boards, in consultation with the one-stop partners and other community service providers, must develop a \npolicy on supportive services that ensures resource and service coordination in the local area. The policy should \naddress procedures for referral to such services, including how such services will be funded when they are not \notherwise available from other sources. The provision of accurate information about the availability of supportive \nservices in the local area, as well as referral to such activities, is one of the career services that must be available to \nadults and dislocated workers through the one-stop delivery system. (WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(ix) and \u00a7 678.430) \nLocal Boards must ensure that needs-related payments are made in a manner consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 680.930, 680.940, \n680.950, 680.960, and 680.970.\n\n\u00a7 680.910\n\nWhen may supportive services be provided to participants?\n\n(a) Supportive services may only be provided to individuals who are:\n\n(1) Participating in career or training services as defined in WIOA secs. 134(c)(2) and (3); and\n\n(2) Unable to obtain supportive services through other programs providing such services.

L. 113-128, 128 Stat. 1425 (Jul. 22, 2014).\n\nSubpart a Standing Youth Committees\n\n\u00a7 681.100\n\nWhat is a standing youth committee?\n\nWIOA eliminates the requirement for Local Boards to establish a youth council. However, the Local Board may \nchoose to establish a standing committee to provide information and to assist with planning, operational, oversight, \nand other issues relating to the provision of services to youth. If the Local Board does not designate a standing \nyouth committee, it retains responsibility for all aspects of youth formula programs.\n\n\u00a7 681.110\n\nWho is included on a standing youth committee?\n\n(a) If a Local Board decides to form a standing youth committee, the committee must include a member of the Local \nBoard, who chairs the committee, members of community-based organizations with a demonstrated record of \nsuccess in serving eligible youth and other individuals with appropriate expertiseand experience who are not \nmembers of the Local Board (WIOA secs. 107(b)(4)(A) and (ii)).\n\n(b) The committee should reflect the needs of the local area. The committee members appointed for their \nexperience and expertise may bring their expertise to help the committee address the employment, training \neducation, human and supportive service needs of eligible youth including out-of-school youth. Members may \nrepresent agencies such as education, training, health, mental health, housing, public assistance, and justice, or be \n\n\n\nrepresentatives of philanthropic or economic and community development organizations, and employers. The \ncommittee may also include parents, participants, and youth. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(C))\n\n(c) A Local Board may designate an existing entity such as an effective youth council as the standing youth \ncommittee if it fulfills the requirements above in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n\u00a7 681.120\n\nWhat does a standing youth committee do?\n\nUnder the direction of the Local Board, a standing youth committee may:\n\n(a) Recommend policy direction to the Local Board for the design, development, and implementation of programs \nthat benefit all youth;\n\n(b) Recommend the design of a comprehensive community workforce development system to ensure a full range of \nservices and opportunities for all youth, including disconnected youth;\n\n(c) Recommend ways to leverage resources and coordinate services among schools, public programs, and \ncommunity-based organizations serving youth;\n\n(d) Recommends ways to coordinate youth services and recommend eligible youth service providers; and\n\n(e) Provide on-going leadership and support for continuous quality improvement for local youth programs;\n\n(f) Assist with planning, operational, and other issues relating to the provision of services to youth; and\n\n(g) If so delegated by the Local Board after consultation with the CEO, oversee eligible youth providers, as well as \nother youth program oversight responsibilities.\n\nSubpart B Eligibility for Youth Services\n\n\u00a7 681.200\n\nWho is eligible for youth services?\n\nBoth in-school youth (ISY) and out-of-school youth (OSY) are eligible for youth services. (WIOA sec. 3(18))\n\n\u00a7 681.210\n\nWho is an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d?\n\nAn out-of-school youth (OSY) is an individual who is:\n\n(a) Not attending any school (as defined under State law);\n\n(b) Not younger than 16 or older than age 24 at time of enrollment. Because age eligibility is based on age at \nenrollment, participants may continue to receive services beyond the age of 24 once they are enrolled in the \nprogram; and\n\n(c) One or more of the following:\n\n(1) A school dropout;\n\n(2) A youth who is within the age of compulsory school attendance, but has not attended school for at least the \nmost recent complete school year calendar quarter. School year calendar quarter is based on how a local school \ndistrict defines its school year quarters;\n\n(3) A recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent who is a low-income individual and is \neither basic skills deficient or an English language learner;\n\n(4) An individual who is subject to the juvenile or adult justice system;\n\n\n\n(5) A homeless individual (as defined in sec. 41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n14043e-2(6))), a homeless child or youth (as defined in sec. 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2))), a runaway, in foster care or has aged out of the foster care system, a child eligible for \nassistance under sec. 477 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677), or in an out-of-home placement;\n\n(6) An individual who is pregnant or parenting;\n\n(7) An individual with a disability;\n\n(8) A low-income individual who requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to \nsecure or hold employment. (WIOA secs. 3(46) and 129(a)(1)(B))\n\n\u00a7 681.220\n\nWho is an \u201cin-school youth\u201d?\n\nAn in-school youth (ISY) is an individual who is:\n\n(a) Attending school (as defined by State law), including secondary and post-secondary school;\n\n(b) Not younger than age 14 or (unless an individual with a disability who is attending school under State law) older \nthan age 21 at time of enrollment. Because age eligibility is based on age at enrollment, participants may continue \nto receive services beyond the age of 21 once they are enrolled in the program;\n\n(c) A low-income individual; and\n\n(d) One or more of the following:\n\n(1) Basic skills deficient;\n\n(2) An English language learner;\n\n(3) An offender;\n\n(4) A homeless individual (as defined in sec. 41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n14043e-2(6))), a homeless child or youth (as defined in sec. 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2))), a runaway, in foster care or has aged out of the foster care system, a child eligible for \nassistance under sec. 477 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677), or in an out-of-home placement;\n\n(5) An individual who is pregnant or parenting;\n\n(6) An individual with a disability;\n\n(7) An individual who requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or \nhold employment. (WIOA secs. 3(27) and 129(a)(1)(C))\n\n\u00a7 681.230\n\nWhat does \u201cschool\u201d refer to in the \u201cnot attending or attending any school\u201d in the out-of-school and in-school \ndefinitions?\n\nIn general, the applicable State law for secondary and post-secondary institutions defines \u201cschool.\u201d However, for \npurposes of WIOA, the Department does not consider providers of Adult Education under title II of WIOA, \nYouthBuild programs, and Job Corps programs to be schools. Therefore, WIOA youth programs may consider a \nyouth to be out-of-school youth for purposes of WIOA youth program eligibility if they are attending Adult Education \nprovided under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild, or Job Corps.\n\n\u00a7 681.240\n\nWhen do local youth programs verify dropout status, particular for youth attending alternative schools?\n\n\n\nLocal WIOA youth programs must verify a youth's dropout status at the time of WIOA youth program enrollment. A \nyouth attending an alternative school at the time of enrollment is not a dropout. States must define \u201calternative \nschool\u201d in their State Plan. The definition should be consistent with their State Education Agency definition, if \navailable. An individual who is out-of-school at the time of enrollment and subsequently placed in an alternative \nschool or any school, is an out-of-school youth for the purposes of the 75 percent expenditure requirement for out-\nof-school youth.\n\n\u00a7 681.250\n\nWho does the low-income eligibility requirement apply to?\n\n(a) For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and \nare either basic skills deficient or an English language learner and youth who require additional assistance to enter \nor complete an educational program or tosecure or hold employment must be low-income. All other OSY meeting \nOSY eligibility under \u00a7 681.210(c)(1), (2) and (4) through (7) are not required to be low-income. (WIOA secs. \n129(a)(1)(iii)(I)-(II) and 129(a)(1)(iii)(IV)-(VII))\n\n(b) All ISY must be low-income to meet the ISY eligibility criteria, except those that fall under the low-income \nexception.\n\n(c) WIOA allows a low-income exception where five percent of all WIOA youth participants may be participants who \nordinarily would be required to be low-income for eligibility purposes and who meet all other eligibility criteria for \nWIOA youth except the low-income criteria. A program must calculate the five percent based on the percent of all \nyouth served by the program in the local area's WIOA youth program in a given program year.\n\n(d) In addition to the criteria in the definition of \u201clow-income individual\u201d in WIOA sec. 3(36), a youth is low-income if \nhe or she receives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National \nSchool Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq. or if she or her lives in a high-poverty area.\n\n\u00a7 681.260\n\nHow does the Department define \u201chigh poverty area\u201d for the purposes of the special rule for low-income youth in \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nA youth who lives in a high poverty area is automatically considered to be a low-income individual. A high-poverty \narea is a Census tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, Indian Reservation, tribal land, or Native Alaskan Village \nor county that has a poverty rate of at least 30 percent as set every 5 years using American Community Survey 5-\nYear data.\n\n\u00a7 681.270\n\nMay a local program use eligibility for free or reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program as a \nsubstitute for the income eligibility criteria under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\nYes, WIOA sec. 3(36) defines a low-income individual to include an individual who receives (or is eligible to receive) \na free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.\n\n\u00a7 681.280\n\nIs a youth with a disability eligible for youth services under the Act if their family income exceeds the income \neligibility criteria?\n\nYes, for an individual with a disability, income level for eligibility purposes is based on the individual's own income \nrather than his or her family's income. WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi) states that an individual with a disability whose own \nincome meets the low-income definition in clause (ii) (income that does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or \n70 percent of the lower living standard income level), but who is a member of a family whose income exceeds this \nincome requirement is eligible for youth services.\n\n\u00a7 681.290\n\nHow does the Department define the \u201cbasic skills deficient\u201d criterion in this part?\n\n\n\n(a) As defined in \u00a7 681.210(c)(3), a youth is \u201cbasic skills deficient\u201d if they:\n\n(1) Have English reading, writing, or computing skills at or below the 8th grade level on a generally accepted \nstandardized test; or\n\n(2) Are unable to compute or solve problems, or read, write, or speak English at a level necessary to function on the \njob, in the individual's family, or in society. (WIOA sec. 3(5))\n\n(b) The State or Local Board must establish its policy on paragraph (a)(2) of this section in its respective State or \nlocal plan.\n\n(c) In assessing basic skills, local programs must use assessment instruments that are valid and appropriate for the \ntarget population, and must provide reasonable accommodation in the assessment process, if necessary, for \npeople with disabilities.\n\n\u00a7 681.300\n\nHow does the Department define the \u201crequires additional assistance to complete an educational program, or to \nsecure and hold employment\u201d criterion in this part?\n\nAs defined in \u00a7 681.200(c)(8), either the State or the local level may establish definitions and eligibility \ndocumentation requirements for the \u201crequires additional assistance to complete an educational program, or to \nsecure and hold employment\u201d criterion of \u00a7 681.200(c)(8). In cases where the State Board establishes State policy \non this criterion, the State Board must include the definition in the State Plan. In cases where the State Board does \nnot establish a policy, the Local Board must establish a policy in their local plan if using this criterion.\n\n\u00a7 681.310\n\nMust youth participants enroll to participate in the youth program?\n\n(a) Yes, to participate in youth programs, participants must enroll in the WIOA youth program.\n\n(b) Enrollment in this case requires:\n\n(1) The collection of information to support an eligibility determination; and\n\n(2) Participation in any of the fourteen WIOA youth program elements.\n\nSubpart C Youth Program Design Elements and Parameters\n\n\u00a7 681.400\n\nWhat is the process used to select eligible youth providers?\n\n(a) As provided in WIOA sec. 123, the Local Board must identify eligible providers of youth workforce investment \nactivities in the local area by awarding grants or contracts on a competitive basis, except as provided below in \nparagraph (a)(3) of this section, based on the recommendation of the youth standing committee, if they choose to \nestablish a standing youth committee and assign it that function. If such a committee is not established for the local \narea, this responsibility falls to the Local Board.\n\n(1) Local areas must include the criteria used to identify youth providers in the State Plan (including such quality \ncriteria established by the Governor for a training program that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential) \ntaking into consideration the ability of the provider to meet the performance accountability measures based on \nprimary indicators of performance for youth programs.\n\n(2) Local areas must conduct a full and open competition to secure youth service providers according to the Federal \nprocurement guidelines at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, in addition to applicable State and local procurement laws.\n\n(3) Where the Local Board determines there is an insufficient number of eligible providers of youth workforce \ninvestment activities in the local area, such as a rural area, the Local Board may award grants or contracts on a \nsole source basis (WIOA sec. 123(b)).\n\n\n\n(b) The requirement in WIOA sec. 123 that eligible providers of youth services be selected by awarding a grant or \ncontract on a competitive basis does not apply to the design framework services when these services are more \nappropriately provided by the grant recipient/fiscal agent. Design framework services include intake, objective \nassessments and the development of individual service strategy, case management, and follow-up services.\n\n\u00a7 681.410\n\nDoes the requirement that a State and local area expend at least 75 percent of youth funds to provide services to \nout-of-school youth apply to all youth funds?\n\nYes. The 75 percent requirement applies to both statewide youth activities funds and local youth funds with two \nexceptions.\n\n(a) Only statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.Funds \nspent on statewide youth activities that do not provide direct services to youth, such as most of the required \nstatewide youth activities listed in WIOA sec. 129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. For \nexample, administrative costs, monitoring, and technical assistance are not subject to OSY expenditure \nrequirement; while funds spent on direct services to youth such as statewide demonstration projects, are subject to \nthe OSY expenditure requirement.\n\n(b) For a State that receives a small State minimum allotment under WIOA sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) or WIOA sec. \n132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II), the State may submit a request to the Secretary to decrease the percentage to a percentage \nnot less than 50 percent for a local area in the State, and the Secretary may approve such a request for that \nprogram year, if the State meets the following requirements:\n\n(1) After an analysis of the in-school youth and out-of-school youth populations in the local area, the State \ndetermines that the local area will be unable to use at least 75 percent of the local area WIOA youth funds to serve \nout-of-school youth due to a low number of out-of-school youth; and\n\n(2) The State submits to the Secretary, for the local area, a request including a proposed percentage decreased to \nnot less than 50 percent to provide workforce investment activities for out-of-school youth.\n\n(c) In the exercise of the discretion afforded by WIOA sec. 129(a)(4) the Secretary has determined that requests to \ndecrease the percentage of funds used to provide activities to OSY will not be granted to States based on their \nhaving received 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the preceding year. Therefore, when the Secretary \nreceives such a request from a State based on having received 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the \npreceding year, the request will be denied without the Secretary exercising further discretion.\n\n(d) For local area funds, the administrative costs of carrying out local workforce investment activities described in \nWIOA sec. 128(b)(4) are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. All other local area youth funds beyond \nthe administrative costs are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.\n\n\u00a7 681.420\n\nHow must Local Boards design Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth programs?\n\n(a) The design framework services of local youth programs must:\n\n(1) Provide for an objective assessment of each youth participant that meets the requirements of WIOA sec. \n129(c)(1)(A), and includes a review of the academic and occupational skill levels, as well as the service needs, of \neach youth for the purpose of identifying appropriate services and career pathways for participants and informing \nthe individual service strategy;\n\n(2) Develop, and update as needed, an individual service strategy for each youth participant that is directly linked to \none or more indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii), that identifies appropriate career \npathways that include education and employment goals, that considers career planning and the results of the \nobjective assessment and that prescribes achievement objectives and services for the participant; and\n\n\n\n(3) Provides case management of youth participants, including follow-up services.\n\n(b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth programs in the local area, and how the fourteen \nprogram elements required in \u00a7 681.460 are to be made available within that framework.\n\n(c) Local Boards must ensure appropriate links to entities that will foster the participation of eligible local area youth. \nSuch links may include connections to:\n\n(1) Local area justice and law enforcement officials;\n\n(2) Local public housing authorities;\n\n(3) Local education agencies;\n\n(4) Local human service agencies;\n\n(5) WIOA title II adult education providers;\n\n(6) Local disability-serving agencies and providers and health and mental health providers;\n\n(7) Job Corps representatives; and\n\n(8) Representatives of other area youth initiatives, such as YouthBuild, and including those that serve homeless \nyouth and other public and private youth initiatives.\n\n(d) Local Boards must ensure that WIOA youth service providers meet the referral requirements in WIOA sec. \n129(c)(3)(A) for all youth participants, including:\n\n(1) Providing these participants with information about the full array of applicable or appropriate services available \nthrough the Local Board or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners; and\n\n(2) Referring these participants to appropriate training and educational programs that have the capacity to serve \nthem either on a sequential or concurrent basis.\n\n(e) If a youth applies for enrollment in a program of workforce investment activities and either does not meet the \nenrollment requirements for that program or cannot be served by that program, the eligible provider of that program \nmust ensure that the youth is referred for further assessment, if necessary, or referred to appropriate programs to \nmeet the skills and training needs of the youth.\n\n(f) In order to meet the basic skills and training needs of applicants who do not meet the eligibility requirements of a \nparticular program or who cannot be served by the program, each youth provider must ensure that these youth are \nreferred:\n\n(1) For further assessment, as necessary, and\n\n(2) To appropriate programs, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(B))\n\n(g) Local Boards must ensure that parents, youth participants, and other members of the community with \nexperience relating to youth programs are actively involved in both the design and implementation of its youth \nprograms. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(C))\n\n(h) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the individual service strategy \nrequired under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program provider determines that it is \nappropriate to use a recent objective assessment or individual service strategy that was developed under another \neducation or training program. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A))\n\n\n\n(i) The Local Board may implement a pay-for-performance contract strategy for program elements described at \u00a7 \n681.460, for which the Local Board may reserve and use not more than 10 percent of the total funds allocated to \nthe local area under WIOA sec. 128(b). For additional rules on pay-for-performance contracts see \u00a7 683.500.\n\n\u00a7 681.430\n\nMay youth participate in both the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth and adult programs concurrently, \nand how do local program operators track concurrent enrollment in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nyouth and adult programs?\n\n(a) Yes, individuals who meet the respective program eligibility requirements may participate in adult and youth \nprograms concurrently. Such individuals must be eligible under the youth or adult eligibility criteria applicable to the \nservices received. Local program operators may determine, for these individuals, the appropriatelevel and balance \nof services under the youth and adult programs.\n\n(b) Local program operators must identify and track the funding streams which pay the costs of services provided to \nindividuals who are participating in youth and adult programs concurrently, and ensure no duplication of services.\n\n(c) Individuals who meet the respective program eligibility requirements for WIOA youth title I and title II may \nparticipate in title I youth and title II concurrently.\n\n\u00a7 681.440\n\nHow does a local youth program determine if an 18 to 24 year old is enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act youth program or the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act adult program?\n\nA local program should determine the appropriate program for the participant based on the service needs of the \nparticipant and if the participant is career-ready based on an objective assessment of their occupational skills, prior \nwork experience, employability, and participants needs as required in WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A).\n\n\u00a7 681.450\n\nFor how long must a local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth program serve a participant?\n\nLocal youth programs must provide service to a participant for the amount of time necessary to ensure successful \npreparation to enter post-secondary education and/or unsubsidized employment.

Entrepreneurship education programs often guide youth through the development of a business plan and \nmay also include simulations of business start-up and operation.\n\n(2) Enterprise development which provides supports and services that incubate and help youth develop their own \nbusinesses. Enterprise development programs go beyond entrepreneurship education by helping youth access \nsmall loans or grants that are needed to begin business operation and by providing more individualized attention to \nthe development of viable business ideas.\n\n(3) Experiential programs that provide youth with experience in the day-to-day operation of a business. These \nprograms may involve the development of a youth-run business that young people participating in the program work \nin and manage. Or, they may facilitate placement in apprentice or internship positions with adult entrepreneurs in \nthe community.\n\n\u00a7 681.570\n\nWhat are supportive services for youth?\n\nSupportive services for youth, as defined in WIOA sec. 3(59), are servicesthat enable an individual to participate in \nWIOA activities.

(WIOA sec. 129(c)(4))\n\n\u00a7 681.600\n\nWhat are work experiences?\n\n(a) Work experiences are a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited \nperiod of time. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience may take place in the \nprivate for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience \nwhere an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act or applicable State law, \n\n\n\nexists. Work experiences provide the youth participant with opportunities for career exploration and skill \ndevelopment.\n\n(b) Work experiences must include academic and occupational education.\n\n(c) The types of work experiences include the following categories:\n\n(1) Summer employment opportunities and other employment opportunities available throughout the school year;\n\n(2) Pre-apprenticeship programs;\n\n(3) Internships and job shadowing; and\n\n(4) On-the-job training opportunities as defined in WIOA sec. 3(44) and in \u00a7 680.700.\n\n\u00a7 681.610\n\nHow will local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth programs track the work experience priority?\n\nLocal WIOA youth programs must track program funds spent on paid and unpaid work experiences, including \nwages and staff costs for the development and management of work experiences, and report such expenditures as \npart of the local WIOA youth financial reporting. The percentage of funds spent on work experience is calculated \nbased on the total local area youth funds expended for work experience rather than calculated separately for in-\nschool and out-of-school youth. Local area administrative costs are not subject to the 20 percent minimum work \nexperience expenditure requirement.\n\n\u00a7 681.620\n\nDoes the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act require Local Boards to offer summer employment \nopportunities in the local youth program?\n\nNo, WIOA does not require Local Boards to offer summer youth employment opportunities as summer employment \nis no longer its own program element under WIOA.

Providers \nadministering the work experience program element must be selected by the Local Board by awarding a grant or \ncontract on a competitive basis as described in WIOA sec. 123, based on criteria contained in the State Plan. \nHowever, the summer employment administrator does not need to select the employers who are providing the \nemployment opportunities through a competitive process.\n\n\u00a7 681.640\n\nWhat does education offered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and \ntraining for a specific occupation or occupational cluster mean?\n\nThis program element reflects the integrated education and training model and requires integrated education and \ntraining to occur concurrently and contextually with workforce preparation activities and workforce training. This \nprogram element describes how workforce preparations activities, basic academic skills, and hands-on \noccupational skills training are to be taught within the same time frame and connected to training in a specific \noccupation, occupational cluster, or career pathway. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(E))\n\n\u00a7 681.650\n\nDoes the Department allow incentive payments for youth participants?\n\n\n\nYes, the Department allows incentive payments to youth participants for recognition and achievement directly tied \nto training activities and work experiences. The local program must have written policies and procedures in place \ngoverning the awarding of incentives and must ensure that such incentive payments are:\n\n(a) Tied to the goals of the specific program;\n\n(b) Outlined in writing before the commencement of the program that may provide incentive payments;\n\n(c) Align with the local program's organizational policies; and\n\n(d) Accord with the requirements contained in 2 CFR 200.\n\n\u00a7 681.660\n\nHow can parents, youth, and other members of the community get involved in the design and implementation of \nlocal youth programs?\n\nLocal Boards and programs must provide opportunities for parents, participants, and other members of \nthecommunity with experience working with youth to be involved in the design and implementation of youth \nprograms. Parents, youth participants, and other members of the community can get involved in a number of ways \nincluding serving on youth standing committees, if they exist and they are appointed by the Local Board. They can \nalso get involved by serving as mentors, serving as tutors, and providing input into the design and implementation \nof other program design elements. Local Boards must also make opportunities available to successful participants \nto volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors or in other activities.\n\nSubpart D One Stop Services to Youth\n\n\u00a7 681.700\n\nWhat is the connection between the youth program and the one-stop service delivery system?\n\n(a) WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) requires that the youth program function as a required one-stop partner and fulfill the \nroles and responsibilities of a one-stop partner described in WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(A).\n\n(b) In addition to the provisions of 20 CFR part 678, connections between the youth program and the one-stop \nsystem may include those that facilitate:\n\n(1) The coordination and provision of youth activities;\n\n(2) Linkages to the job market and employers;\n\n(3) Access for eligible youth to the information and services required in \u00a7 681.460;\n\n(4) Services for non-eligible youth such as basic labor exchange services, other self-service activities such as job \nsearches, career exploration, use of career center resources, and referral as appropriate; and\n\n(5) Other activities described in WIOA secs. 129(b)-(c).\n\n(c) Local Boards must either collocate WIOA youth program staff at one-stop centers and/or ensure one-stop \ncenters and staff are equipped to advise youth in order to increase youth access to services and connect youth to \nthe program that best aligns with their needs.\n\n\u00a7 681.710\n\nDo Local Boards have the flexibility to offer services to area youth who are not eligible under the youth program \nthrough the one-stop centers?\n\nYes. However, Local Boards must ensure one-stop centers fund services for non-eligible youth through programs \nauthorized to provide services to such youth. For example, one-stop centers may provide basic labor exchange \nservices under the Wagner-Peyser Act to any youth.\n\n\n\n9.

As explained in that subpart, such assistance may be used for such employment or training only when the \nassistance is provided indirectly within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and not \nwhen the assistance is provided directly. As explained in that subpart, assistance provided through an Individual \nTraining Account is generally considered indirect, and other mechanisms may also be considered indirect. See also \n\u00a7 683.255 and 29 CFR 37.6(f)(1).\n\n(2) 29 CFR part 2, subpart D also contains requirements related to equal treatment of religious organizations in \nDepartment of Labor programs, and to protection of religious liberty for Department of Labor social service \nproviders and beneficiaries.

See also WIOA sec. 188(a)(3).\n\n\u00a7 683.290\n\nAre there salary and bonus restrictions in place for the use of title I and Wagner-Peyser funds?\n\n(a) No funds available under title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act may be used by a recipient or subrecipient of \nsuch funds to pay the salary and bonuses of an individual, either as direct costs or indirect costs, at a rate in excess \nof the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level II of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5313, which can be \nfound at www.opm.gov.\n\n(b) In instances where funds awarded under title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act pay only a portion of the \nsalary or bonus, the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser Act funds may only be charged for the share of the employee's \nsalary or bonus attributable to the work performed on the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser Act grant. That portion \ncannot exceed the proportional Executive level II rate. The restriction applies to the sum of salaries and bonuses \ncharged as either direct costs or indirect costs under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\n(c) The limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to contractors (as defined in 2 CFR \n200.23) providing goods and services.

(1) The Governor or direct grant recipient is responsible for resolving \nfindings that arise from the monitoring reviews, investigations, other Federal monitoring reviews, and audits \n(including under 2 CFR part 200) of subrecipients awarded funds through title I of WIOA or Wagner-Peyser.\n\n(i) A State or direct grant recipient must utilize the written monitoring and audit resolution, debt collection and \nappeal procedures that it uses for other Federal grant programs.\n\n(ii) If a State or direct grant recipient does not have such written procedures, it must prescribe standards and \nprocedures to be used for this grant program.\n\n(2) For subrecipients awarded funds through a recipient of grant funds under subtitle D of title I of WIOA, the direct \nrecipient of the grant funds must have written monitoring and resolution procedures in place that are consistent with \n2 CFR part 200.\n\n(b) Resolution of State and other direct recipient-level findings. (1) The Secretary is responsible for resolving \nfindings that arise from Federal audits, monitoring reviews, investigations, incident reports, and audits under 2 CFR \npart 200 for direct recipients of Federal awards under title I of WIOA and Wagner Peyser.\n\n(2) The Secretary will use the Department audit resolution process, consistent with 2 CFR part 200 (and \nDepartment modifications at 2 CFR part 2900), and Grant Officer Resolution provisions of \u00a7 683.440, as \nappropriate.\n\n(3) A final determination issued by a Grant Officer under this process may be appealed to the DOL Office of \nAdministrative Law Judges under the procedures at \u00a7 683.800.\n\n(c) Resolution of nondiscrimination findings. Findings arising from investigations or reviews conducted under \nnondiscrimination laws will be resolved in accordance with WIOA sec. 188 of WIOA and the Department of Labor \nnondiscrimination regulations implementing sec. 188 of WIOA, codified at 29 CFR part 37.\n\n\u00a7 683.430\n\nHow does the Secretary resolve investigative and monitoring findings?\n\n(a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit, other monitoring, or an audit (i.e., Single Audit, OIG Audit, GAO \nAudit, or other audit), the Secretary will notify the direct recipient of the Federal award of the findings of the \ninvestigation and give the direct recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take \nappropriate corrective actions.\n\n\n\n(1) Adequate resolution. The Grant Officer in conjunction with the Federal project officer, reviews the complete file \nof the monitoring review, monitoring report, or final audit report and the recipient's response and actions under this \nparagraph (a). The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of secs. 184(b)-(c) of WIOA. If \nthe Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of the situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient.This \nnotification constitutes final agency action.\n\n(2) Inadequate resolution. If the direct recipient's response and actions to resolve the findings are found to be \ninadequate, the Grant Officer will begin the Grant Officer resolution process under \u00a7 683.440.\n\n(b) Audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be resolved through the Grant Officer resolution process, as discussed in \u00a7 \n683.440.\n\n\u00a7 683.440\n\nWhat is the Grant Officer resolution process?\n\n(a) General. When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the a recipient's disposition of an audit or other resolution of \nfindings (including those arising out of site visits, incident reports or compliance reviews), or with the recipient's \nresponse to findings resulting from investigations or monitoring reports, the initial and final determination process as \nset forth in this section is used to resolve the matter.\n\n(b) Initial determination. The Grant Officer makes an initial determination on the findings for both those matters \nwhere there is agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's resolution, including the \nallowability of questioned costs or activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of WIOA, \nWagner-Peyser, and applicable regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants, contracts, or other \nagreements under the award.\n\n(c) Informal resolution. Except in an emergency situation, when the Secretary invokes the authority described in \nsec. 184(e) of WIOA, the Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, nor institute corrective \nactions or sanctions, without first providing the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments \nto resolve informally those matters in dispute contained in the initial determination. The initial determination must \nprovide for an informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial determination. If the matters \nare resolved informally, the Grant Officer must issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which \nnotifies the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the file.\n\n(d) Final determination. (1) Upon completion of the informal resolution process, the Grant Officer provides each \nparty with a written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested. For audits of recipient-level entities \nand other recipients which receive WIOA funds directly from the Department, ordinarily, the final determination is \nissued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved \naudit report to the Employment and Training Administration. For audits of subrecipients conducted by the OIG, \nordinarily the final determination is issued not later than 360 days from the date the OIG issues the final approved \naudit report to ETA.\n\n(2) A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:\n\n(i) Indicate whether efforts to resolve informally matters contained in the initial determination have been \nunsuccessful;\n\n(ii) List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;\n\n(iii) List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions set forth in the initial determination and the \nrationale for such modifications;\n\n(iv) Establish a debt, if appropriate;\n\n(v) Require corrective action, when needed;\n\n\n\n(vi) Determine liability, method of restitution of funds, and sanctions; and\n\n(vii) Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 683.800.\n\n(3) Unless a hearing is requested, a final determination under this paragraph (d) is final agency action and is not \nsubject to further review.\n\nSubpart E Pay for Performance Contract Strategies\n\n\u00a7 683.500\n\nWhat is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategy?\n\n(a) A WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is a specific type of performance-based contract strategy that \nhas four distinct characteristics:\n\n(1) It is a strategy to use WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts as they are described in \u00a7 683.510;\n\n(2) It must include the identification of the problem space and target populations for which a local area will pursue a \nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy; the outcomes the local area would hope to achieve through a Pay-\nfor-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; the acceptable cost to government associated with \nimplementing such a strategy; and a feasibility study to determine whether the intervention is suitable for a WIOA \nPay-for-Performance contracting strategy;\n\n(3) It must include a strategy for independently validating the performance outcomes achieved under each contract \nwithin the strategy prior to payment occurring;\n\n(4) It must include a description of how the State or local area will reallocate funds to other activities under the \ncontract strategy in the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA Pay-\nfor-Performance contract.\n\n(b) The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy must be developed in accordance with guidance issued by \nthe Secretary.\n\n\u00a7 683.510\n\nWhat is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract?\n\n(a) Pay-for-Performance contract. A WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract is a type of Performance-Based \ncontract.\n\n(b) Applicability. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts may only be entered into when they are a part of a WIOA \nPay-for-Performance contract strategy described in \u00a7 683.500.\n\n(c) Cost-plus percentage contracts. Use of cost-plus percentage contracts is prohibited. (2 CFR 200.323.)\n\n(d) Services provided. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts must be used to provide adult training services \ndescribed in sec. 134(c)(3) of WIOA or youth activities described in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA.\n\n(e) Structure of payment. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts must specify a fixed amount that will be paid to the \nservice provider based on the achievement of specified levels of performance on the performance outcomes in sec. \n116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA for target populations within a defined timetable. Outcomes must be independently validated, \nas described in \u00a7\u00a7 683.500 and 683.510(j), prior to disbursement of funds.\n\n(f) Eligible service providers. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts may be entered into with eligible service \nproviders, which may include local or national community-based organizations or intermediaries, community \ncolleges, or other training providers that are eligible under sec. 122 or 123 of WIOA (as appropriate). (WIOA sec. \n3(47)(A))\n\n\n\n(g) Target populations. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts must identify target populations as specified by the \nLocal Board, which may include individuals with barriers to employment. (WIOA sec. 3(47)(A))\n\n(h) Bonus and incentive payments. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts may include bonus and/or incentive \npayments for the contractor, based on achievement of specified levels of performance.\n\n(1) Bonus payments for achieving outcomes above and beyond those specified in the contract must be usedby the \nservice provider to expand capacity to provide effective training.\n\n(2) Incentive payments must be consistent with incentive payments for performance-based contracting as \ndescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulations.\n\n(i) Performance reporting. Performance outcomes achieved under the WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, \nmeasured against the levels of performance specified in the contract, must be tracked by the local area and \nreported to the State pursuant to WIOA sec. 116(d)(2)(K) and \u00a7 677.160.\n\n(j) Validation. WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts must include independent validation of the contractor's \nachievement of the performance benchmarks specified in the contract. (WIOA sec. 3(47)(B)) This validation must \nbe based on high-quality, reliable, and verified data.\n\n(k) Guidance. The Secretary may issue additional guidance related to use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance \ncontracts.\n\n\u00a7 683.520\n\nWhat funds can be used to support Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract \nstrategies?\n\n(a) For WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies providing adults and dislocated worker training services, \nfunds allocated under secs. 133(b)(2)-(3) of WIOA can be used. For WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \nstrategies providing youth activities, funds allocated under WIOA sec. 128(b) can be used.\n\n(b) No more than 10 percent of the total local adult and dislocated worker allotments can be expended on the \nimplementation of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for adult training services described in sec. \n134(c)(3) of WIOA.

Any exception not specifically raised in the petition is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition \nfor review must also be sent to the opposing party and if an applicant or recipient, to the Grant Officer and the Grant \nOfficer's Counsel at the time of filing. Unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, notifies \nthe parties that the case has been accepted for review, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. Any \ncase accepted by the ARB must be decided within 180 days of acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the \nALJ constitutes final agency action.\n\n\u00a7 683.840\n\nIs there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law \nJudges hearing?\n\n(a) The parties to a complaint which has been filed according to the requirements of \u00a7 683.800 may choose to \nwaive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement \nof their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts \nand render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after \nsubmission of the matter for informal review.\n\n(b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ described in paragraph (a) of this section will \nautomatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a written decision has not been issued within the \n60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n\n\n(c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as a final decision of an Administrative \nLaw Judge under WIOA sec. 186(b).\n\n\u00a7 683.850\n\nIs there judicial review of a final order of the Secretary issued under WIOA?\n\n(a) Any party to a proceeding which resulted in a Secretary's final order under WIOA sec. 186 in which the \nSecretary awards, declines to award, or only conditionally awards financial assistance or with respect to a \ncorrective action or sanction imposed under WIOA sec. 184 may obtain a review in the United States Court of \nAppeals having jurisdiction over the applicant or recipient of funds involved, by filing a review petition within 30 days \nof the issuance of the Secretary's final order in accordance with WIOA sec. 187.\n\n(b) The court has jurisdiction to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the \nSecretary, in whole or in part.\n\n(c) No objection to the Secretary's order may be considered by the court unless the objection was specifically \nurged, in a timely manner, before the Secretary. The review is limited to questions of law, and the findings of fact of \nthe Secretary are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\n\n(d) The judgment of the court is final, subject to certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n11.

Services should be provided in a \nculturally appropriate manner, consistent with the principles of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.). (WIOA sec. 166(a)(2)).\n\n\u00a7 684.110\n\nHow must Indian and Native American programs be administered?\n\n(a) INA programs will be administered to maximize the Federal commitment to support the growth and development \nof INAs and their communities as determined by representatives of such communities.\n\n\n\n(b) In administering these programs, the Department will follow the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. 450a, as well as the Department of \nLabor's \u201cAmerican Indian and Alaska Native Policies.\n\n(c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the trust responsibilities of the Federal government to \nfederally-recognized tribes in any way.\n\n(d) The Department will administer INA programs through a single organizational unit and consistent with the \nrequirements in sec. 166(i) of WIOA. The Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within the \nEmployment and Training Administration (ETA) is designated as this single organizational unit as required by sec. \n166(i)(1) of WIOA.\n\n(e) The Department will establish and maintain administrative procedures for the selection, administration, \nmonitoring, and evaluation of INA employment and training programs authorized under this Act.\n\n\u00a7 684.120\n\nWhat obligation does the Department have to consult with the Indian and Native American grantee community in \ndeveloping rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for Indian and Native American programs?\n\nThe Department's primary consultation vehicle for INA programs is the Native American Employment and Training \nCouncil. The Department will consult with the INA grantee community in developing policies for the INA programs, \nactively seeking and considering the views of INA grantees prior to establishing INA program policies and \nregulations. (WIOA sec. 166(i)(4)). The Department will follow DOL's tribal consultation policy and Executive Order \n13175 of November 6, 2000.\n\n\u00a7 684.130\n\nWhat definitions apply to terms used in this part?\n\nIn addition to the definitions found in secs. 3 and 166 of WIOA, and 20 CFR 675.300, the following definitions apply:\n\nAlaska Native-Controlled Organization means an organization whose governing board is comprised of 51 percent or \nmore of individuals who are Alaska Native as defined in secs. 3(b) and 3(r) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct (43 U.S.C. 1602(b), (r)).\n\nCarry-in means the total amount of funds unobligated by a grantee at the end of a program year. If the amount of \nfunds unobligated by a grantee at the end of a program year is more than 20 percent of the grantee's \u201ctotal funds \navailable\u201d for that program year, such excess amount is considered \u201cexcess carry-in.\u201d\n\nDINAP means the Division of Indian and Native American Programs within the Employment and Training \nAdministration of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nGoverning body means a body of representatives who are duly elected, appointed by duly elected officials, or \nselected according to traditional tribal means.

Incumbent grantees \nwhich do not meet this dollar threshold will be grandfathered in. Additionally, the Department will make an exception \nto the $100,000 minimum for grantees wishing to participate in the demonstration program under Public Law 102-\n477 if all resources to be consolidated under the Public Law 102-477 plan total at least $100,000, with at least \n$20,000 derived from sec. 166 funds. However, incumbent Public Law 102-477 grantees that are receiving WIA \nfunding of less than $20,000 as of the date of implementation of WIOA will be grandfathered into the program and \ncan continue to be awarded the same amount.\n\n(b) To be eligible to apply as a consortium, each member of the consortium must meet the requirements of \nparagraph (a) of this section and must:\n\n(1) Be in close proximity to one another, but may operate in more than one State;\n\n(2) Have an administrative unit legally authorized to run the program and to commit the other members to \ncontracts, grants, and other legally-binding agreements; and\n\n(3) Be jointly and individually responsible for the actions and obligations of the consortium, including debts.\n\n(c) Entities eligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:\n\n(1) Federally-recognized Indian tribes;\n\n(2) Tribal organizations, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b;\n\n(3) Alaska Native-controlled organizations;\n\n(4) Native Hawaiian-controlled organizations;\n\n(5) Indian-controlled organizations serving INAs; and\n\n\n\n(6) A consortium of eligible entities which meets the legal requirements for a consortium described in paragraph (b) \nof this section.\n\n(d) State-recognized tribal organizations that meet the definition of an Indian-controlled organization are eligible to \napply for WIOA sec. 166 grant funds. State-recognized tribes that do not meet this definition but are grantees under \nWIA will be grandfathered into WIOA as Indian-controlled organizations.\n\n\u00a7 684.210\n\nWhat priority for awarding grants is given to eligible organizations?\n\n(a) Federally-recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or a consortium of such entities will have priority to \nreceive grants under this part for those geographic service areas in which they have legal jurisdiction, such as an \nIndian reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Service Area (OTSA), or Alaska Native Village Service Area (ANVSA).\n\n(b) If the Department decides not to make an award to an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity that has legal \njurisdiction over a service area, it will consult with such tribe or Alaska Native entity that has jurisdiction before \nselecting another entity to provide services for such areas.\n\n(c) The priority described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply to service areas outside the legal \njurisdiction of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity.\n\n\u00a7 684.220\n\nWhat is the process for applying for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\n(a) Entities seeking a WIOA sec. 166 grant, including incumbent grantees, will be provided an opportunity to apply \nfor a WIOA sec. 166 grant every 4 years through a competitive grant process.\n\n(b) As part of the competitive application process, applicants will be required to submit a 4-year plan as described \nat \u00a7 684.710.

The Grant Officer will provide an entity whose request for a grant award was \ndenied, in whole or in part, with a copy of the appeal procedures.\n\n\u00a7 684.240\n\nAre there any other ways in which an entity may be awarded a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\nYes. For areas that would otherwise go unserved, the Grant Officer may designate an entity, which has not \nsubmitted a competitive application, but which meets the qualifications for a grant award, to serve the particular \ngeographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP will seek the views of INA leaders in the community that would \notherwise go unserved before making the decision to designate the entity that would serve the community. DINAP \nwill inform the Grant Officer of the INA leaders' views. The Grant Officer will accommodate views of INA leaders in \nsuch areas to the extent possible.\n\n\u00a7 684.250\n\nCan an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award be terminated?\n\n(a) Yes, the Grant Officer can terminate a grantee's award for cause, or the Secretary or another Department of \nLabor official confirmed by the Senate can terminate a grantee's award in emergency circumstances where \ntermination is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program \nunder sec. 184(e) of WIOA.\n\n\n\n(b) The Grant Officer may terminate a grantee's award for cause only if there is a substantial or persistent violation \nof the requirements in WIOA or the WIOA regulations. The grantee must be provided with written notice 60 days \nbefore termination, stating the specific reasons why termination is proposed. The appeal procedures at 20 CFR \n683.800 apply.\n\n\u00a7 684.260\n\nDoes the Department have to award a grant for every part of the country?\n\nNo, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for a grant award in a particular area, or willing to serve that \narea, the Department will not award funds for that service area. The funds that otherwise would have been \nallocated to that area under \u00a7 684.270 will be distributed to other INA program grantees, or used for other program \npurposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for technical assistance and \ntraining are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under \u00a7 684.270(e). Areas which \nare unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent grant award cycle, when and if a current \ngrantee or other eligible entity applies for a grant award to serve that area.\n\n\u00a7 684.270\n\nHow are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds allocated to Indian and Native American program \ngrantees?\n\n(a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this section and funds used for other program purposes \nunder \u00a7 684.260, all funds available for WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive workforce investment services \nprogram at the beginning of a program year will be allocated to INA program grantees for the geographic service \narea(s) awarded to them through the grant competition.\n\n(b) Each INA program grantee will receive the sum of the funds calculated using the following formula:\n\n(1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of unemployed American Indian, \nAlaska Native and Native Hawaiian individuals in the grantee's geographic service area(s) compared to all such \nunemployed persons in the United States.\n\n(2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of American Indian, Alaska \nNative and Native Hawaiian individuals in poverty in the grantee's geographic service area(s) as compared to all \nsuch persons in poverty in the United States.\n\n(3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas are provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.\n\n(c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section, \nbased upon criteria to be described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the Department may utilize a \nhold harmless factor to reduce the disruption in grantee services which would otherwise result from changes in \nfunding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American \nEmployment and Training Council.\n\n(d) The Department may reallocate funds from one INA program grantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve \nits area for any reason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal (political) strife, failure to adhere to \nor meet grant terms and conditions, or lack of ability or interest. If a grantee has excess carry-in for a program year, \nthe Department may also readjust the awards granted under the funding formula so that an amount that equals the \nprevious program year's carry-in will be allocated to another INA program grantee(s).\n\n(e) The Department may reserve up to one percent of the funds appropriated under WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for \nany program year for technical assistance and training (TAT) purposes.

A 1998 U.S. District Court decision, Michigan v. \nHerman, 81 F. Supp. 2nd 840 (http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/) upheld \nthis policy. State merit staff employees are directly accountable to State government entities, and the standards \nfor their performance and their determinations on the use of public funds require that decisions be made in the best \ninterest of the public and of the population to be served. State merit staff meet objective professional qualifications \nand provide impartial, transparent information and services to all customers while complying with established \ngovernment standards.\n\n\u00a7 652.216\n\nMay the one-stop operator provide guidance to State merit staff employees in accordance with the Act?\n\nYes, the one-stop delivery system envisions a partnership in which Wagner-Peyser Act labor exchange services are \ncoordinated with other activities provided by other partners in a one-stop setting. As part of the local Memorandum \nof Understanding described in \u00a7 678.500, the State agency, as a one-stop partner, may agree to have staff receive \nguidance from the one-stop operator regarding the provision of labor exchange services. Personnel matters, \nincluding compensation, personnel actions, terms and conditions of employment, performance appraisals, and \naccountability of State merit staff employees funded under the Act, remain under the authority of the State agency. \nThe guidance given to employees must be consistent with the provisions of the Act, the local Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, and applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nSubpart D Workforce and Labor Market Information\n\n\u00a7 652.300\n\nWhat role does the Secretary of Labor have concerning the Workforce and Labor Market Information System?\n\n(a) The Secretary of Labor must oversee the development, maintenance, and continuous improvement of the \nworkforce and labor market information system defined in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15 and 20 CFR 651.10.\n\n(b) With respect to data collection, analysis, and dissemination of workforce and labor market information as \ndefined in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15 and 20 CFR 651.10, the Secretary must:\n\n(1) Assign responsibilities within the Department of Labor for elements of the workforce and labor market \ninformation system described in sec. 15(a) of the Wagner-Peyser Act to ensure that the statistical and \nadministrative data collected are consistent with appropriate Bureau of Labor Statistics standards and definitions, \nand that the information is accessible and understandable to users of such data;\n\n(2) Actively seek the cooperation of heads of other Federal agencies to establish and maintain mechanisms for \nensuring complementarity and non-duplication in the development and operation of statistical and administrative \ndata collection activities;\n\n(3) Solicit, receive, and evaluate the recommendations of the Workforce Information Advisory Council established \nby Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15(d);\n\n(4) Eliminate gaps and duplication in statistical undertakings;\n\n(5) Through the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Employment and Training Administration, and in collaboration \nwith States, develop and maintain the elements of the workforce and labor market information system, including the \ndevelopment of consistent procedures and definitions for use by States in collecting and reporting the workforce \nand labor market information data described in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15 and defined in 20 CFR 651.10; and\n\n(6) Establish procedures for the system to ensure that the data and information are timely, and paperwork and \nreporting for the system are reduced to a minimum.\n\n\u00a7 652.301\n\nWhat are wage records for purposes of the Wagner-Peyser Act?\n\nhttp://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/\n\n\nWage records, for purposes of the Wagner-Peyser Act, are records that contain \u201cwage information\u201d as defined in 20 \nCFR 603.2(k).

The determination of the minimum service levels required of significant MSFW \nStates for each year must be based on the following:\n\n(1) Past State agency performance in serving MSFWs, as reflected in on-site reviews and data collected under \u00a7 \n653.109;\n\n(2) The need for services to MSFWs in the following year, comparing prior and projected levels of MSFW activity.\n\n\u00a7 653.110\n\nDisclosure of data.\n\n(a) State agencies must disclose to the public, on written request, in conformance with applicable State and \nFederal law, the data collected by State and local employment service offices pursuant to \u00a7 653.109, if possible \nwithin 10 working days after receipt of the request.\n\n(b) If a request for data held by a State agency is made to the ETA national or regional office, the ETA must forward \nthe request to the State agency for response.\n\n(c) If the State agency cannot supply the requested data within 10 business days after receipt of the request, the \nState agency must respond to the requestor in writing, giving the reason for the delay and specifying the date by \nwhich it expects to be able to comply.\n\n(d) State agency intra-agency memoranda and reports (or parts thereof) and memoranda and reports (or parts \nthereof) between the State agency and the ETA, to the extent that they contain statements of opinion rather than \nfacts, may be withheld from public disclosure provided the reason for withholding is given to the requestor in writing. \nSimilarly, documents or parts thereof, which, if disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal or \nemployer privacy, or are otherwise privileged against disclosure, may also be withheld provided the reason is given \nto the requestor in writing.\n\n\u00a7 653.111\n\nState agency staffing requirements.\n\n(a) The State agency must implement and maintain an affirmative action program for staffing in significant MSFW \none-stop centers, and will employ ES staff in a manner facilitating the delivery of ES services tailored to the special \nneeds of MSFWs, including:\n\n(1) The positioning of multilingual staff in offices serving a significant number of Spanish-speaking or LEP \nparticipants; and\n\n(2) The hiring of staff members from the MSFW community or members of community-based migrant programs.\n\n\n\n(b) The State agency must hire sufficient numbers of qualified, permanent minority staff in significant MSFW \nemployment service offices. State agencies will determine whether a \u201csufficient number\u201d of staff has been hired by \nconducting a comparison between the characteristics of the staff and the workforce and determining if the \ncomposition of the local office staff(s) is representative of the racial and ethnic characteristics of the work force in \nthe local employment office service area(s). State agencies with significant MSFW local employment service \noffices, must undertake special efforts to recruit MSFWs and persons from MSFW backgrounds for its staff.\n\n(1) Where qualified minority applicants are not available to be hired as permanent staff, qualified minority part-time, \nprovisional, or temporary staff must be hired in accordance with State merit system procedures, where applicable.\n\n(2) If a local employment service office does not have a sufficient number of qualified minority staff, the State \nagency must establish a goal to achieve sufficient staffing at the local employment service office. The State agency \nwill also establish a reasonable timetable for achieving the staffing goal by hiring or promoting available, qualified \nstaff in the under-represented categories. In establishing timetables, the State agency must consider the vacancies \nanticipated through expansion, contraction, and turnover in the office(s) and available funds. All affirmative action \nprograms must establish timetables that are designed to achieve the staffing goal no later than 1 year after the \nsubmission of the Unified or Combined State Plan or annual summary, whichever is sooner. Once such goals have \nbeen achieved, the State agency must submit a State Plan modification request to the Department with the \nassurance that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section have been achieved.\n\n(3) The State monitor advocates, regional monitor advocates, or the national monitor advocate, as part of their \nregular reviews of State agency compliance with these regulations, must monitor the extent to which the State \nagency has complied with its affirmative action program.\n\nSubpart C E Reserved\n\nSubpart F Agricultural Recruitment System for U.S. Farmworkers Ars\n\n\u00a7 653.500\n\nPurpose and scope of subpart.\n\nThis subpart includes the requirements for the acceptance of intrastate and interstate job clearance orders which \nseek U.S. workers to perform farmwork on a temporary, less than year-round basis. Orders seeking workers to \nperform farmwork on a year-round basis are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. This section affects all \njob orders for workers who are recruited through the employment service interstate and intrastate clearance \nsystems for less than year-round farmwork, including both MSFWs and non-MSFW job seekers.\n\n\u00a7 653.501\n\nRequirements for processing clearance orders.\n\n(a) No local employment service office or State agency may place a job order seeking workers to perform \nfarmwork into intrastate or interstate clearance unless:\n\n(1) The local employment service office and employer have attempted, and have not been able, to obtain sufficient \nworkers within the local labor market area, or\n\n(2) The local employment service office anticipates a shortage of local workers.\n\n(b) Employment service office responsibilities. (1) Each employment service office must ensure that the agricultural \nclearance form prescribed by the Department (ETA Form 790 or its subsequently issued form), and its attachments \nare complete when placing intrastate or interstate clearance orders seeking farmworkers.\n\n(2) All clearance orders must be posted in accordance with applicable ETA guidance. If the job order for the local \nemployment service office incorporates offices beyond the local office commuting area, the employment service \noffice must suppress the employer information in order to facilitate the orderly movement of workers within the \nemployment service system.\n\n\n\n(3) Employment service staff must determine, through a preoccupancy housing inspection performed by \nemployment service staff or other appropriate public agency, that the housing assured by the employer is either \navailable and meets the applicable housing standards or has been approved for conditional access to the clearance \nsystem as set forth in 20 CFR 653.502; except that mobile range housing for sheepherders and goatherders must \nmeet existing Departmental guidelines and/or applicable regulations.\n\n(c) State agency responsibilities. (1) State agencies must ensure that intrastate and interstate orders:\n\n(i) Include the following language: \u201cIn view of the statutorily established basic function of the employment service as \na no-fee labor exchange, that is, as a forum for bringing together employers and job seekers, neither the ETA nor \nthe State agencies are guarantors of the accuracy or truthfulness of information contained on job orders submitted \nby employers. Nor does any job order accepted or recruited upon by the employment service constitute a \ncontractual job offer to which the ETA or a State agency is in any way a party;\u201d\n\n(ii) Do not contain an unlawful discriminatory specification by race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity, age, disability, or genetic information;\n\n(iii) Are signed by the employer; and\n\n(iv) State all the material terms and conditions of the employment, including:\n\n(A) The crop;\n\n(B) The nature of the work;\n\n(C) The anticipated period and hours of employment;\n\n(D) The anticipated starting and ending date of employment and the anticipated number of days and hours per \nweek for which work will be available;\n\n(E) The hourly wage rate or the piece rate estimated in hourly wage rate equivalents for each activity and unit size;\n\n(F) Any deductions to be made from wages;\n\n(G) A specification of any non-monetary benefits to be provided by the employer;\n\n(H) Any hours, days or weeks for which work is guaranteed, and, for each guaranteed week of work except as \nprovided in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the exclusive manner in which the guarantee may be abated due to \nweather conditions or other acts of God beyond the employer's control; and\n\n(I) Any bonus or work incentive payments or other expenses which will be paid by the employer in addition to the \nbasic wage rate, including the anticipated time period(s) within which such payments will be made.\n\n(2) State agencies must ensure that:\n\n(i) The wages and working conditions offered are not less than the prevailing wages and working conditions among \nsimilarly employed farmworkers in the area of intended employment or the applicable Federal or State minimum \nwage, whichever is higher. If the wages offered are expressed as piece rates or as base rates and bonuses, the \nemployer must make the method of calculating the wage and supporting materials available to employment service \nstaff who must check if the employer's calculation of the estimated hourly wage rate is reasonably accurate and is \nnot less than the prevailing wage rate or applicable Federal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher; and\n\n(ii) The employer has agreed to provide or pay for the transportation of the workers and their families at or before \nthe end of the period of employment specified in the job order on at least the same terms as transportation is \ncommonly provided by employers in the area of intended employment to farmworkers and their families recruited \nfrom the same area of supply. Under no circumstances may the payment or provision of transportation occur later \nthan the departure time needed to return home to begin the school year, in the case of any worker with children 18 \n\n\n\nyears old or younger, or be conditioned on the farmworker performing work after the period of employment specified \nin the job order.\n\n(3) State agencies must ensure that the clearance order includes the following assurances:\n\n(i) The employer will provide to workers referred through the clearance system the number of hours of work cited \nin paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(D) of this section for the week beginning with the anticipated date of need, unless the \nemployer has amended the date of need at least 10 working days prior to the original date of need (pursuant to \nparagraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section) by so notifying the order-holding office. The State agency must make a record \nof this notification and must attempt to expeditiously inform referred workers of the change.\n\n(ii) No extension of employment beyond the period of employment specified in the clearance order may relieve the \nemployer from paying the wages already earned, or if specified in the clearance order as a term of employment, \nproviding transportation or paying transportation expenses to the worker's home.\n\n(iii) The working conditions comply with applicable Federal and State minimum wage, child labor, social security, \nhealth and safety, farm labor contractor registration and other employment-related laws.\n\n(iv) The employer will expeditiously notify the order-holding office or State agency by emailing and telephoning \nimmediately upon learning that a crop is maturing earlier or later, or that weather conditions, over-recruitment or \nother factors have changed the terms and conditions of employment.\n\n(v) The employer, if acting as a farm labor contractor (\u201cFLC\u201d) or farm labor contractor employee (\u201cFLCE\u201d) on the \norder, has a valid Federal FLC certificate or Federal FLCE identification card; and when appropriate, any required \nState farm labor contractor certificate.\n\n(vi) The availability of no cost or public housing which meets the Federal standards and which is sufficient to house \nthe specified number of workers requested through the clearance system. This assurance must cover the \navailability of housing for only those workers, and, when applicable, family members who are unable to return to \ntheir residence in the same day.\n\n(vii) Outreach workers must have reasonable access to the workers in the conduct of outreach activities pursuant \nto \u00a7 653.107.\n\n(viii) The job order contains all the material terms and conditions of the job. The employer must assure this by \nsigning the following statement in the clearance order: \u201cThis clearance order describes the actual terms and \nconditions of the employment being offered by me and contains all the material terms and conditions of the job.\u201d\n\n(4) If a State agency discovers that an employer's clearance order contains a material misrepresentation, the State \nagency may initiate the Discontinuation of Services as set forth in 20 CFR part 658, subpart F.\n\n(5) If there is a change to the anticipated date of need and the employer fails to notify the order-holding office at \nleast 10 working days prior to the original date of need the employer must pay eligible (pursuant to paragraph \n(d)(4) of this section) workers referred through the clearance system the specified hourly rate of pay, or if the pay is \npiece-rate, the higher of the Federal or State minimum wage for the first week starting with the originally anticipated \ndate of need or provide alternative work if such alternative work is stated on the clearance order. If an employer \nfails to comply under thissection the order holding office may notify DOL's Wage and Hour Division for possible \nenforcement.\n\n(d) Processing clearance orders. This section does not apply to clearance orders that are attached to applications \nfor foreign temporary agricultural workers pursuant to 20 CFR 655 subpart B.\n\n(1) The order-holding office must transmit an electronic copy of the approved clearance order to the State agency. \nThe State agency must distribute additional electronic copies of the form with all attachments (except that the State \nagency may, at its discretion, delegate this distribution to the local office) as follows:\n\n\n\n(i) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to each of the State agencies selected for recruitment \n(areas of supply);\n\n(ii) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to each applicant-holding ETA regional office;\n\n(iii) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to the order-holding ETA regional office; and\n\n(iv) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to the Regional Farm Labor Coordinated Enforcement \nCommittee and/or other Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Wage and Hour Division regional \nagricultural coordinators, and/or other committees as appropriate in the area of employment.\n\n(2) The local office may place an intrastate or interstate order seeking workers to perform farmwork for a specific \nfarm labor contractor or for a worker preferred by an employer provided the order meets employment service \nnondiscrimination criteria. The order would not meet such criteria, for example, if it requested a \u201cwhite male crew \nleader\u201d or \u201cany white male crew leader.\u201d\n\n(3) The ETA regional office must review and approve the order within 10 working days of its receipt of the order, \nand the Regional Administrator or his/her designee must approve the areas of supply to which the order will be \nextended. Any denial by the Regional Administrator or his/her designee must be in writing and state the reasons for \nthe denial.\n\n(4) The applicant holding office must notify all referred farmworkers, farm labor contractors on behalf of \nfarmworkers, or family heads on behalf of farmworker family members, to contact a local employment service office, \npreferably the order-holding office, to verify the date of need cited in the clearance order between nine and 5 \nworking days prior to the original date of need cited in the clearance order; and that failure to do so will disqualify \nthe referred farmworker from the first weeks' pay as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. The State \nagency must make a record of this notification.\n\n(5) If the worker referred through the clearance system contacts a local employment service office (in any State) \nother than the order holding office, that local employment service office must assist the referred worker in \ncontacting the order holding office on a timely basis. Such assistance must include, if necessary, contacting the \norder holding office by telephone or other timely means on behalf of the worker referred through the clearance \nsystem.\n\n(6) Local employment service office staff must assist all farmworkers, upon request in their native language, to \nunderstand the terms and conditions of employment set forth in intrastate and interstate clearance orders and must \nprovide such workers with checklists in their native language showing wage payment schedules, working \nconditions, and other material specifications of the clearance order.\n\n(7) If an order holding office learns that a crop is maturing earlier than expected or that other material factors, \nincluding weather conditions and recruitment levels, have changed since the date the clearance order was \naccepted, the agency must immediately contact the applicant holding office which must immediately inform crews \nand families scheduled to report to the job site of the changed circumstances and must adjust arrangements on \nbehalf of such crews and families.\n\n(8) When there is a delay in the date of need, State agencies must document notifications by employers and \ncontacts by individual farmworkers or crew leaders on behalf of farmworkers or family heads on behalf of \nfarmworker family members to verify the date of need.\n\n(9) If weather conditions, over-recruitment or other conditions have eliminated the scheduled job opportunities, the \nState agencies involved must make every effort to place the workers in alternate job opportunities as soon as \npossible, especially if the worker(s) is already en-route or at the job site. Employment service office staff must keep \nrecords of actions under this section.\n\n(10) Applicant-holding offices must provide workers referred on clearance orders with a checklist summarizing \nwages, working conditions and other material specifications in the clearance order. Such checklists, where \n\n\n\nnecessary, must be in the workers' native language. The checklist must include language notifying the worker that \na copy of the original clearance order is available upon request. State agencies must use a standard checklist \nformat provided by the Department (such as in Form WH516 or a successor form).\n\n(11) The applicant-holding office must give each referred worker a copy of the list of worker's rights described in \nthe Department's ARS Handbook.\n\n(12) If the labor supply State agency accepts a clearance order, the State agency must actively recruit workers for \nreferral. In the event a potential labor supply State agency rejects a clearance order, the reasons for rejection must \nbe documented and submitted to the Regional Administrator having jurisdiction over the State agency. The \nRegional Administrator will examine the reasons for rejection, and, if the Regional Administrator agrees, will inform \nthe Regional Administrator with jurisdiction over the order-holding State agency of the rejection and the reasons. If \nthe Regional Administrator who receives the notification of rejection does not concur with the reasons for rejection, \nthat Regional Administrator will inform the national monitor advocate, who, in consultation with the Administrator of \nETA's Office of Workforce Investment, will make a final determination on the acceptance or rejection of the order.\n\n\u00a7 653.502\n\nConditional access to the agricultural recruitment system.\n\n(a) Filing requests for conditional access\u2014(1) \u201cNoncriteria\u201d employers. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of \nthis section, an employer whose housing does not meet applicable standards may file with the local employment \nservice office serving the area in which its housing is located, a written request that its clearance orders be \nconditionally allowed into the intrastate or interstate clearance system, provided that the employer's request \nassures that its housing will be in full compliance with the requirements of the applicable housing standards at least \n20 calendar days (giving the specific date) before the housing is to be occupied.\n\n(2) \u201cCriteria\u201d employers. If the request for conditional access described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is from \nan employer filing a clearance order pursuant to an application for temporary alien agricultural labor certification for \nH-2A workers under subpart B of part 655 of this chapter, the request must be filed with the Certifying Officer (CO) \nat the Department's Chicago National Processing Center (NPC) designated by the Office of Foreign Labor \nCertification (OFLC) Administrator to make determinations on applications for temporaryemployment certification \nunder theH-2A program.\n\n(3) Assurance. The employer's request pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section must contain an \nassurance that the housing will be in full compliance with the applicable housing standards at least 20 calendar \ndays (stating the specific date) before the housing is to be occupied.\n\n(b) Processing requests\u2014(1) State agency processing. Upon receipt of a written request for conditional access to \nthe intrastate or interstate clearance system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the local employment service \noffice must send the request to the State agency, which, in turn, must forward it to the Regional Administrator.\n\n(2) Regional office processing and determination. Upon receipt of a request for conditional access pursuant to \nparagraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Administrator must review the matter and, as appropriate, must either \ngrant or deny the request.\n\n(c) Authorization. The authorization for conditional access to the intrastate or interstate clearance system must be in \nwriting, and must state that although the housing does not comply with the applicable standards, the employer's \njob order may be placed into intrastate or interstate clearance until a specified date. The Regional Administrator \nmust send the authorization to the employer and must send copies (hard copy or electronic) to the appropriate \nState agency and local employment service office. The employer must submit and the local employment service \noffice must attach copies of the authorization to each of the employer's clearance orders which is placed into \nintrastate or interstate clearance.\n\n\n\n(d) Notice of denial. If the Regional Administrator denies the request for conditional access to the intrastate or \ninterstate clearance system they must provide written notice to the employer, the appropriate State agency, and \nthe local employment service office, stating the reasons for the denial.\n\n(e) Inspection. The local employment service office serving the area containing the housing of any employer \ngranted conditional access to the intrastate or interstate clearance system must assure that the housing is \ninspected no later than the date by which the employer has promised to have its housing in compliance with the \napplicable housing standards. An employer, however, may request an earlier preliminary inspection. If, on the date \nset forth in the authorization, the housing is not in full compliance with the applicable housing standards as assured \nin the request for conditional access, the local employment service office must afford the employer 5 calendar days \nto bring the housing into full compliance. After the 5-calendar-day period, if the housing is not in full compliance with \nthe applicable housing standards as assured in the request for conditional access, the local employment service \noffice immediately:\n\n(1) Must notify the RA, or the NPC designated by the Regional Administrator;\n\n(2) Must remove the employer's clearance orders from intrastate and interstate clearance; and\n\n(3) Must, if workers have been recruited against these orders, in cooperation with the employment service \nagencies in other States, make every reasonable attempt to locate and notify the appropriate crew leaders or \nworkers, and to find alternative and comparable employment for the workers.\n\n\u00a7 653.503\n\nField checks.\n\n(a) If a worker is placed on a clearance order, the State agency must notify the employer in writing that the State \nagency, through its local employment service offices, and/or Federal staff, must conduct random, unannounced \nfield checks to determine and document whether wages, hours, and working and housing conditions are being \nprovided as specified in the clearance order.\n\n(b) The State agency must conduct field checks on at least 25 percent of all agricultural worksites where \nplacements have been made through the intrastate or interstate clearance system or at 100 percent of the \nworksites where less than 10 employment service placements have been made. This requirement must be met on a \nquarterly basis.\n\n(c) Field checks must include visit(s) to the worksite at a time when workers are present. When conducting field \nchecks, local employment service staff must consult both the employees and the employer to ensure compliance \nwith the full terms and conditions of employment.\n\n(d) If State agency or Federal personnel observe or receive information, or otherwise have reason to believe that \nconditions are not as stated in the clearance order or that an employer is violating an employment-related law, the \nState agency must document the finding and attempt informal resolution. If the matter has not been resolved within \n5 working days, the State agency must initiate the Discontinuation of Services as set forth at 20 CFR part 658 \nsubpart F and must refer apparent violations of employment-related laws to appropriate enforcement agencies in \nwriting.\n\n(e) State agencies may enter into formal or informal arrangements with appropriate State and Federal enforcement \nagencies where the enforcement agency staff may conduct field checks instead of and on behalf of State agency \npersonnel. The agreement may include the sharing of information and any actions taken regarding violations of the \nterms and conditions of the employment as stated in the clearance order and any other violations of employment \nrelated laws. An enforcement agency field check must satisfy the requirement for State agency field checks where \nall aspects of wages, hours, working and housing conditions have been reviewed by the enforcement agency. The \nState agency must supplement enforcement agency efforts with field checks focusing on areas not addressed by \nenforcement agencies.\n\n(g) ES staff must keep records of all field checks.\n\n\n\nPart 654 Special Responsibilities of the Employment Service System\n\n20.

The experiences of the employment service \nagencies indicate that employees so referred have on many occasions been provided with inadequate, unsafe, and \nunsanitary housing conditions. To discourage this practice, it is the policy of the Federal-State employment service \nsystem to deny its intrastate and interstate recruitment services to employers until the State employment service \nagency has ascertained that the employer's housing meets certain standards.\n\n(b) To implement this policy, \u00a7 653.501 of this chapter provides that recruitment services must be denied unless the \nemployer has signed an assurance that if the workers are to be housed, a preoccupancy inspection has been \nconducted and the employment service staff has ascertained that, with respect to intrastate or interstate clearance \norders, the employer's housing meets the full set of standards set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142 or 20 CFR 654 \nsubpart E, except that mobile range housing for sheepherders or goatherders must meet existing Departmental \nguidelines and/or applicable regulations.\n\n(c) Per \u00a7 654.401(a) below, this subpart is effective only until [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF \nTHE FINAL RULE IN THEFEDERAL REGISTER].\n\n\u00a7 654.401\n\nApplicability.\n\n(a) Housing that was completed or under construction prior to April 3, 1980 or was under a signed contract for \nconstruction prior to March 4, 1980 may continue to follow the full set of the Department's ETA standards set forth \nin this subpart until the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(b) On [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THEFEDERAL REGISTER] all \nhousing for agricultural workers governed by the standards set forth in this subpart must comply with the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) housing standards set forth in 29 CFR 1910.142.\n\n(c) To effectuate the transition to the OSHA standards, agricultural housing to which this subpart applies and which \ncomplies with the full set of standards and provisions set forth in this subpart must be considered to be in \ncompliance with the OSHA temporary labor camp standards at 29 CFR 1910.142 until [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE \nOF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THEFEDERAL REGISTER].\n\n\u00a7 654.402\n\nVariances.\n\n(a) An employer may apply for a structural variance from a specific standard(s) in this subpart by filing a written \napplication for such a variance with the local employment service office serving the area in which the housing is \nlocated. This application must:\n\n(1) Clearly specify the standard(s) from which the variance is desired;\n\n\n\n(2) Provide adequate justification that the variance is necessary to obtain a beneficial use of an existing facility, and \nto prevent a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and\n\n(3) Clearly set forth the specific alternative measures which the employer has taken to protect the health and safety \nof workers and adequately show that such alternative measures have achieved the same result as the standard(s) \nfrom which the employer desires the variance.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of a written request for a variance under paragraph (a) of this section, the local employment \nservice office must send the request to the State office which, in turn, must forward it to the ETA Regional \nAdministrator (RA). The RA must review the matter and, after consultation with OSHA, must either grant or deny the \nrequest for a variance.\n\n(c) The variance granted by the RA must be in writing, must state the particular standard(s) involved, and must \nstate as conditions of the variance the specific alternative measures which have been taken to protect the health \nand safety of the workers. The RA must send the approved variance to the employer and must send copies to \nOSHA's Regional Administrator, the Regional Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), and the \nappropriate State agency and the local employment service office. The employer must submit and the local \nemployment service office must attach copies of the approved variance to each of the employer's job orders which \nis placed into intrastate or interstate clearance.\n\n(d) If the RA denies the request for a variance, the RA must provide written notice stating the reasons for the denial \nto the employer, the appropriate State agency and the local employment service office. The notice must also offer \nthe employer an opportunity to request a hearing before a DOL Hearing Officer, provided the employer requests \nsuch a hearing from the RA within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice. The request for a hearing must be \nhandled in accordance with the complaint procedures set forth at \u00a7\u00a7 658.424 and 658.425 of this chapter.\n\n(e) The procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section only apply to an employer who has chosen, as \nevidenced by its written request for a variance, to comply with the ETA housing standards at \u00a7\u00a7 654.404-654.417 of \nthis subpart.\n\n(f) All requests and/or approvals for variance under this section will expire on [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF \nPUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THEFEDERAL REGISTER]. After that date no requests for variance will \nbe accepted by the Department.\n\n\u00a7 654.403\n\n[Reserved].\n\nHousing Standards\n\n\u00a7 654.404\n\nHousing site.\n\n(a) Housing sites must be well drained and free from depressions in which water may stagnate.

The RMA must notify the Regional Administrator of any \nstaffing deficiencies and the Regional Administrator must take appropriate action.\n\n(i) The RMA within the first 3 months of their tenure must participate in a training session(s) approved by the \nNational Office.\n\n(j) At the regional level, the RMA must have primary responsibility for:\n\n(1) Monitoring the effectiveness of the Complaint System set forth at subpart E of this part;\n\n(2) Apprising appropriate State and ETA officials of deficiencies in the Complaint System; and\n\n(3) Providing technical assistance to SMAs in the region.\n\n(k) At the ETA regional level, the RMA must have primary responsibility for ensuring that SWA compliance with ES \nregulations as they pertain to services to MSFWs is monitored by the regional office. He/she must independently \nassess on a continuing basis the provision of ES services to MSFWs, seeking out and using:\n\n(1) Information from SMAs, including all reports and other documents;\n\n(2) Program performance data;\n\n(3) The periodic and other required reports from State ES offices;\n\n(4) Federal on-site reviews;\n\n(5) Other reports prepared by the National Office;\n\n(6) Information received from farmworker organizations and employers; and\n\n(7) Any other pertinent information which comes to his/her attention from any possible source.\n\n(8) In addition, the RMA must consider his/her personal observations from visits to ES offices, agricultural work \nsites and migrant camps.\n\n(l) The RMA must assist the Regional Administrator and other appropriate line officials in applying appropriate \ncorrective and remedial actions to State agencies.\n\n(m) The Regional Administrator's quarterly report to the National Office must include the RMA's summary of his/her \nindependent assessment as required in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. The fourth quarter summary must include \n\n\n\nan annual summary from the region. The summary also must include both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis \nof his/her reviews and must address all the matters with respect to which he/she has responsibilities under these \nregulations.\n\n(n) The RMA must review the activities and performance of the SMAs and the State monitoring system in the \nregion, and must recommend any appropriate changes in the operation of the system to the Regional Administrator. \nThe RMA's review must include a determination whether the SMA:\n\n(1) Does not have adequate access to information;\n\n(2) Is being impeded in fulfilling his/her duties; or\n\n(3) Is making recommendations which are being consistently ignored by SWA officials. If the RMA believes that the \neffectiveness of any SMA has been substantially impeded by the State Administrator, other State agency officials, \nor any Federal officials, he/she must report and recommend appropriate actions to the Regional Administrator. \nCopies of the recommendations must be provided to the NMA electronically or in hard copy.\n\n(o) The RMA must be informed of all proposed changes in policy and practice within USES, including ES \nregulations, which may affect the delivery of services to MSFWs. He/she must advise the Regional Administrator on \nall such proposed changes which, in his/her opinion, may adversely affect MSFWs or which may substantially \nimprove the delivery of services to MSFWs. The RMA may also recommend changes in ES policy or regulations, as \nwell as changes in the funding of State agencies and/or adjustments of reallocation of the discretionary portions of \nfunding formulae as they pertain to MSFWs.\n\n(p) The RMA must participate in the review and assessment activities required in this section and 20 CFR part \n658.700 et seq. He/she, an assistant, or another RMA, must participate in National Office and regional office on-site \nstatewide reviews of ES services to MSFWs in States in the region. The RMA must engage in the following \nactivities in the course of participating in an on-site SWA review:\n\n(1) He/she must accompany selected outreach workers on their field visits;\n\n(2) He/she must participate in a random field check of migrant camps orwork sites where MSFWs have been placed \non intrastate or interstate clearance orders;\n\n(3) He/she must contact local WIOA sec. 167 National Farmworker Jobs Program grantees or other farmworker \norganizations as part of the on-site review, and must discuss with representatives of these organizations perceived \ntrends, and/or other relevant information concerning MSFWs in the area; and\n\n(4) He/she must meet with the SMA and discuss the full range of the ES services to MSFWs, including monitoring \nand the Complaint System.\n\n(q) During the calendar quarter preceding the time of peak MSFW activity in each State, the RMA must meet with \nthe SMA and must review in detail the State agency's capability for providing full services to MSFWs as required \nby ES regulations, during the upcoming harvest season. The RMA must offer technical assistance and recommend \nto the SWA and/or the Regional Administrator any changes in State policy or practice that he/she finds necessary.\n\n(r) The RMA each year during the peak harvest season must visit each State in the region not scheduled for an on-\nsite review during that fiscal year and must:\n\n(1) Meet with the SMA and other SWA staff to discuss MSFW service delivery; and\n\n(2) Contact representatives of MSFW organizations to obtain information concerning ES service delivery and \ncoordination with other agencies and interested employer organizations.\n\n(s) The RMA must initiate and maintain regular and personal contacts, including informal contacts in addition to \nthose specifically required by these regulations, with SMA in the region. In addition, the RMA must have personal \n\n\n\nand regular contact with the NMA. The RMA must also establish routine and regular contacts with WIOA sec. 167 \nNational Farmworker Jobs Program grantees, other farmworker organizations and agricultural employers and/or \nemployer organizations in his/her region. He/she must attend conferences or meetings of these groups wherever \npossible and must report to the Regional Administrator and the Regional Farm Labor Coordinated Enforcement \nCommittee on these contacts when appropriate. He/she must also make recommendations as to how the \nDepartment might better coordinate ES and WIOA sec. 167 National Farmworker Jobs Program services to \nMSFWs.\n\n(t) The RMA must attend MSFW-related public meeting(s) conducted in the region. Following such meetings or \nhearings, the RMA must take such steps or make such recommendations to the Regional Administrator, as he/she \ndeems necessary to remedy problem(s) or condition(s) identified or described therein.\n\n(u) The RMA must attempt to achieve regional solutions to any problems, deficiencies or improper practices \nconcerning services to MSFWs which are regional in scope. Further, he/she must recommend policies, offer \ntechnical assistance or take any other necessary steps as he/she deems desirable or appropriate on a regional, \nrather than State-by-State basis, to promote region-wide improvement in the delivery of employment services to \nMSFWs. He/she must facilitate region-wide coordination and communication regarding provision of ES services to \nMSFWs among SMAs, State Administrators and Federal ETA officials to the greatest extent possible. In the event \nthat any SWA or other RMA, enforcement agency, or MSFW group refers a matter to the RMA which requires \nemergency action, he/she must assist them in obtaining action by appropriate agencies and staff, inform the \noriginating party of the action taken, and, upon request, provide written confirmation.\n\n(v) The RMA must initiate and maintain such contacts as he/she deems necessary with RMAs in other regions to \nseek to resolve problems concerning MSFWs who work, live or travel through the region. He/she must recommend \nto the Regional Administrator and/or the National Office inter-regional cooperation on any particular matter, \nproblem, or policy with respect to which inter-regional action is desirable.\n\n(w) The RMA must establish regular contacts with the regional agricultural coordinators from WHD and OSHA and \nany other regional staff from other Federal enforcement agencies and, must establish contacts with the staff of \nother Department agencies represented on the Regional Farm Labor Coordinated Enforcement Committee, and to \nthe extent necessary, on other pertinent task forces or committees.\n\n(x) The RMA must participate in the regional reviews of the Unified State Plans, and must comment to the Regional \nAdministrator as to the SWA compliance with the ES regulations as they pertain to services to MSFWs, including \nthe staffing of employment service offices.\n\n\u00a7 658.604\n\nAssessment and evaluation of program performance data.\n\n(a) State agencies must compile program performance data required by the Department, including statistical \ninformation on program operations.\n\n(b) The Department must use the program performance data in assessing and evaluating whether each SWA has \ncomplied with ES regulations and its Unified State Plan.\n\n(c) In assessing and evaluating program performance data, the Department must act in accordance with the \nfollowing general principles:\n\n(1) The fact that the program performance data from a SWA, whether overall or relative to a particular program \nactivity, indicate poor program performance does not by itself constitute a violation of ES regulations or of the State \nagency's responsibilities under its Unified State Plan;\n\n(2) Program performance data, however, may so strongly indicate that a SWA's performance is so poor that the \ndata may raise a presumption (prima facie case) that a SWA is violating ES regulations or the Unified State Plan. A \nSWA's failure to meet the operational objectives set forth in the Unified State Plan raises a presumption that the \nagency is violating ES regulations and/or obligations under its Unified State Plan. In such cases the Department \n\n\n\nmust afford the SWA an opportunity to rebut the presumption of a violation pursuant to the procedures at subpart H \nof this part.\n\n(3) The Department must take into account that certain program performance data may measure items over which \nSWAs have direct or substantial control while other data may measure items over which the SWA has indirect or \nminimal control.\n\n(i) Generally, for example, a SWA has direct and substantial control over the delivery of employment services such \nas referrals to jobs, job development contacts, counseling, referrals to career and supportive services and the \nconduct of field checks.\n\n(ii) State Workforce Agencies, however, have only indirect control over the outcome of services. For example, \nSWAs cannot guarantee that an employer will hire a referred applicant, nor can they guarantee that the terms and \nconditions of employment will be as stated on a job order.\n\n(iii) Outside forces, such as a sudden heavy increase in unemployment rates, a strike by SWA employees, or a \nsevere drought or flood may skew the results measured by program performance data.\n\n(4) The Department must consider a SWA's failure to keep accurate and complete program performance \ndatarequired by ES regulations as a violation of the ES regulations.\n\n\u00a7 658.605\n\nCommunication of findings to State agencies.\n\n(a) The Regional Administrator must inform SWAs in writing of the results of review and assessment activities and, \nas appropriate, must discuss with the State Administrator the impact or action required by the Department as a \nresult of review and assessment activities.\n\n(b) The ETA National Office must transmit the results of any review and assessment activities it conducted to the \nRegional Administrator who must send the information to the SWA.\n\n(c) Whenever the review and assessment indicates a SWA violation of ES regulations or its Unified State Plan, the \nRegional Administrator must follow the procedures set forth at subpart H of this part.\n\n(d) Regional Administrators must follow-up any corrective action plan imposed on a SWA under subpart H of this \npart by further review and assessment of the State agency pursuant to this subpart.\n\nSubpart H Federal Application of Remedial Action to State Agencies\n\n\u00a7 658.700\n\nScope and purpose of subpart.\n\nThis subpart sets forth the procedures which the Department must follow upon either discovering independently or \nreceiving from other(s) information indicating that SWAs may not be adhering to ES regulations.\n\n\u00a7 658.701\n\nStatements of policy.\n\n(a) It is the policy of the Department to take all necessary action, including the imposition of the full range of \nsanctions set forth in this subpart, to ensure that State agencies comply with all requirements established by ES \nregulations.\n\n(b) It is the policy of the Department to initiate decertification procedures against SWAs in instances of serious or \ncontinual violations of ES regulations if less stringent remedial actions taken in accordance with this subpart fail to \nresolve noncompliance.\n\n\n\n(c) It is the policy of the Department to act on information concerning alleged violations by SWAs of the ES \nregulations received from any person or organization.\n\n\u00a7 658.702\n\nInitial action by the Regional Administrator.\n\n(a) The ETA Regional Administrator is responsible for ensuring that all SWAs in his/her region are in compliance \nwith ES regulations.\n\n(b) Wherever a Regional Administrator discovers or is apprised of possible SWA violations of ES regulations by the \nreview and assessment activities under subpart G of this part, or through required reports or written complaints \nfrom individuals, organizations or employers which are elevated to the Department after the exhaustion of SWA \nadministrative remedies, the Regional Administrator must conduct an investigation. Within 10 days after receipt of \nthe report or other information, the Regional Administrator must make a determination whether there is probable \ncause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations.\n\n(c) The Regional Administrator must accept complaints regarding possible SWA violations of ES regulations from \nemployee organizations, employers or other groups, without exhaustion of the complaint process described at \nsubpart E, if the Regional Administrator determines that the nature and scope of the complaint are such that the \ntime required to exhaust the administrative procedures at the State level would adversely affect a significant \nnumber of applicants. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must investigate the matter within 10 working days, \nmay provide the SWA 10 working days for comment, and must make a determination within an additional 10 \nworking days whether there is probable cause to believe that the SWA has violated ES regulations.\n\n(d) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is no probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES \nregulations, he/she must retain all reports and supporting information in Department files. In all cases where the \nRegional Administrator has insufficient information to make a probable cause determination, he/she must so notify \nthe Administrator in writing and the time for the investigation must be extended 20 additional working days.\n\n(e) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES \nregulations, he/she must issue a Notice of Initial Findings of Non-compliance by registered mail (or other legally \nviable means) to the offending SWA. The notice will specify the nature of the violation, cite the regulations involved, \nand indicate corrective action which may be imposed in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. If \nthe non-compliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to \nthe NMA.\n\n(f)(1) The SWA may have 20 working days to comment on the findings, or a longer period, up to 20 additional days, \nif the Regional Administrator determines that a longer period is appropriate. The SWA's comments must include \nagreement or disagreement with the findings and suggested corrective actions, where appropriate.\n\n(2) After the period elapses, the Regional Administrator must prepare within 20 working days, written final findings \nwhich specify whether or not the SWA has violated ES regulations. If in the final findings the Regional Administrator \ndetermines that the SWA has not violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must notify the State \nAdministrator of this finding and retain supporting documents in his/her files. If the final finding involves services to \nMSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator must also notify the NMA. If the Regional \nAdministrator determines that a SWA has violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must prepare a Final \nNotice of Noncompliance which must specify the violation(s) and cite the regulations involved. The Final Notice of \nNoncompliance must be sent to the SWA by registered mail or other legally viable means. If the noncompliance \ninvolves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of the Final Notice must be sent to the NMA.\n\n(g) If the violation involves the misspending of grant funds, the Regional Administrator may order in the Final Notice \nof Noncompliance a disallowance of the expenditure and may either demand repayment or withhold future funds in \nthe amount in question. If the Regional Administrator disallows costs, the Regional Administrator must give the \nreasons for the disallowance, inform the SWA that the disallowance is effective immediately and that no more funds \nmay be spent in the disallowed manner, and offer the SWA the opportunity to request a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 \n\n\n\n658.707. The offer, or the acceptance of an offer of a hearing, however, does not stay the effectiveness of the \ndisallowance. The Regional Administrator must keep complete records of the disallowance.\n\n(h) If the violation does not involve misspending of grant funds or the Regional Administrator determines that the \ncircumstances warrant other action:\n\n(1) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must direct the SWA to implement a specific corrective action plan to correct \nall violations. If the SWA's comment demonstrates with supporting evidence (except where inappropriate) that all \nviolations have already been corrected, the Regional Administrator need not impose a corrective action plan and \ninstead may cite the violation(s) and accept theirresolution, subject to follow-up review, if necessary. If the Regional \nAdministrator determines that the violation(s) cited had been found previously and that the corrective action(s) \ntaken had not corrected the violation(s) contrary to the findings of previous follow-up reviews, the Regional \nAdministrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to \u00a7 658.704.\n\n(2) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must specify the time by which each corrective action must be taken. This \nperiod may not exceed 40 working days unless the Regional Administrator determines that exceptional \ncircumstances necessitate corrective actions requiring a longer time period. In such cases, and if the violations \ninvolve services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in \nwriting of the exceptional circumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and must specify that time period. \nThe specified time period must commence with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.\n\n(3) When the time period provided for in paragraph (h)(2) of this section elapses, Department staff must review the \nSWA's efforts as documented by the SWA to determine if the corrective action(s) has been taken and if the SWA \nhas achieved compliance with ES regulations. If necessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part \nof this review.\n\n(4) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines that the SWA has corrected the violation(s), \nthe Regional Administrator must record the basis for this determination, notify the SWA, send a copy to the \nAdministrator, and retain a copy in Department files.\n\n(5) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines that the SWA has taken corrective action but \nis unable to determine if the violation has been corrected due to seasonality or other factors, the Regional \nAdministrator must notify in writing the SWA and the Administrator of his/her findings. The Regional Administrator \nmust conduct further follow-up at an appropriate time to make a final determination if the violation has been \ncorrected. If the Regional Administrator's further follow-up reveals that violations have not been corrected, the \nRegional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to \u00a7 658.704.\n\n(6) If, as a result of the review the Regional Administrator determines that the SWA has not corrected the violations \nand has not made good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of the violations, the Regional \nAdministrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to \u00a7 658.704.\n\n(7) If, as a result of the review, the Regional Administrator determines that the SWA has made good faith efforts \nand adequate progress toward the correction of the violation and it appears that the violation will be fully corrected \nwithin a reasonable time period, the SWA must be advised by registered mail or other legally viable means (with a \ncopy sent to the Administrator) of this conclusion, of remaining differences, of further needed corrective action, and \nthat all deficiencies must be corrected within a specified time period. This period may not exceed 40 working days \nunless the Regional Administrator determines that exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective action \nrequiring a longer time period. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of \nthe exceptional circumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and must specify that time period. The \nspecified time period commences with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.\n\n(8)(i) If the SWA has been given an additional time period pursuant to paragraph (h)(7) of this section, Department \nstaff must review the SWA's efforts as documented by the SWA at the end of the time period. If necessary, the \nDepartment must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review.\n\n\n\n(ii) If the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must document that finding, notify in writing \nthe SWA and the Administrator, and retain supporting documents in Department files. If the SWA has not corrected \nthe violation(s), the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions pursuant to \u00a7 658.704.\n\n\u00a7 658.703\n\nEmergency corrective action.\n\nIn critical situations as determined by the Regional Administrator, where it is necessary to protect the integrity of the \nfunds, or insure the proper operation of the program, the Regional Administrator may impose immediate corrective \naction. Where immediate corrective action is imposed, the Regional Administrator must notify the SWA of the \nreason for imposing the emergency corrective action prior to providing the SWA an opportunity to comment.\n\n\u00a7 658.704\n\nRemedial actions.\n\n(a) If a SWA fails to correct violations as determined pursuant to \u00a7 658.702, the Regional Administrator must apply \none or more of the following remedial actions to the SWA:\n\n(1) Imposition of special reporting requirements for a specified period of time;\n\n(2) Restrictions of obligational authority within one or more expense classifications;\n\n(3) Implementation of specific operating systems or procedures for a specified time;\n\n(4) Requirement of special training for SWA personnel;\n\n(5) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to \nrequest a conference with the Assistant Secretary, the elevation of specific decision-making functions from the \nState Administrator to the Regional Administrator;\n\n(6) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to \nrequest a conference with the Assistant Secretary, the imposition of Federal staff in key State agency positions;\n\n(7) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to \nrequest a conference with the Assistant Secretary, funding of the State agency on a short-term basis or partial \nwithholding of funds for a specific function or for a specific geographical area;\n\n(8) Holding of public hearings in the State on the SWA's deficiencies;\n\n(9) Disallowance of funds pursuant to \u00a7 658.702 (g); or\n\n(10) If the matter involves a serious or continual violation, the initiation of decertification procedures against the \nState agency, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(b) The Regional Administrator must send, by registered mail, a Notice of Remedial Action to the SWA. The Notice \nof Remedial Action must set forth the reasons for the remedial action. When such a notice is the result of violations \nof regulations governing services to MSFWs (20 CFR 653.100 et seq.) or the Complaint System (\u00a7\u00a7 658.400 et \nseq.), a copy of said notice must be sent to the Administrator, who must publish the notice promptly in theFederal \nRegister.\n\n(c) If the remedial action is other than decertification, the notice must state that the remedial action must take effect \nimmediately. The notice must also state that the SWA may request a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 658.707 by filing a \nrequest in writing with the Regional Administrator pursuant to \u00a7 658.707 within 20 working days of the SWA's \nreceipt of the notice. The offer ofhearing, or the acceptance thereof, however, does not stay or otherwise delay the \nimplementation of remedial action.\n\n\n\n(d) Within 60 working days after the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator must conduct a \nreview of the SWA's compliance with ES regulations unless the Regional Administrator determines that a longer \ntime period is necessary. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the \ncircumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and specify that time period. If necessary, Department staff \nmust conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review. If the SWA is in compliance with the ES regulations, the \nRegional Administrator must fully document these facts and must terminate the remedial actions. The Regional \nAdministrator must notify the SWA of his/her findings. When the case involves violations of regulations governing \nservices to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to the Administrator, who must \npromptly publish the notice in theFederal Register. The Regional Administrator must conduct, within a reasonable \ntime after terminating the remedial actions, a review of the SWA's compliance to determine whether any remedial \nactions should be reapplied.\n\n(e) If, upon conducting the on-site review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Administrator \nfinds that the SWA remains in noncompliance, the Regional Administrator must continue the remedial action and/or \nimpose different additional remedial actions. The Regional Administrator must fully document all such decisions \nand, when the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, must \nsend copies to the Administrator, who must promptly publish the notice in theFederal Register.\n\n(f)(1) If the SWA has not brought itself into compliance with ES regulations within 120 working days of the initial \napplication of remedial action, the Regional Administrator must initiate decertification unless the Regional \nAdministrator determines that circumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for a longer period of time. In \nsuch cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the circumstances which \nnecessitate the longer time period, and specify the time period.\n\n(2) The Regional Administrator must notify the SWA by registered mail or by other legally viable means of the \ndecertification proceedings, and must state the reasons therefor. Whenever such a notice is sent to a State \nagency, the Regional Administrator must prepare five copies (hard copies or electronic copies) containing, in \nchronological order, all the documents pertinent to the case along with a request for decertification stating the \ngrounds therefor. One copy must be retained. Two must be sent to the ETA National Office, one must be sent to the \nSolicitor of Labor, Attention: Associate Solicitor for Employment and Training, and, if the case involves violations of \nregulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, one copy must be sent to the NMA. All copies \nmust also be sent electronically to each respective party. The notice sent by the Regional Administrator must be \npublished promptly in theFederal Register.\n\n\u00a7 658.705\n\nDecision to decertify.\n\n(a) Within 30 working days of receiving a request for decertification, the ETA Assistant Secretary must review the \ncase and must decide whether to proceed with decertification.\n\n(b) The Assistant Secretary must grant the request for decertification unless he/she makes a finding that:\n\n(1) The violations of ES regulations are neither serious nor continual;\n\n(2) The State agency is in compliance; or\n\n(3) The Assistant Secretary has reason to believe that the SWA will achieve compliance within 80 working days \nunless exceptional circumstances necessitate a longer time period, pursuant to the remedial action already applied \nor to be applied. (In the event the Assistant Secretary does not have sufficient information to act upon the request, \nhe/she may postpone the determination for up to an additional 20 working days in order to obtain any available \nadditional information.) In making a determination of whether violations are \u201cserious\u201d or \u201ccontinual,\u201d as required by \nparagraph (b)(1) of this section, the Assistant Secretary must consider:\n\n(i) Statewide or multiple deficiencies as shown by performance data and/or on-site reviews;\n\n(ii) Recurrent violations, even if they do not persist over consecutive reporting periods, and\n\n\n\n(iii) The good faith efforts of the State to achieve full compliance with ES regulations as shown by the record.\n\n(c) If the Assistant Secretary denies a request for decertification, he/she must write a complete report documenting \nhis/her findings and, if appropriate, instructing that an alternate remedial action or actions be applied. Electronic \ncopies of the report must be sent to the Regional Administrator. Notice of the Assistant Secretary's decision must \nbe published promptly in theFederal Register, and the report of the Assistant Secretary must be made available for \npublic inspection and copying.\n\n(d) If the Assistant Secretary decides that decertification is appropriate, he/she must submit the case to the \nSecretary providing written explanation for his/her recommendation of decertification.\n\n(e) Within 30 working days after receiving the Assistant Secretary's report, the Secretary must determine whether to \ndecertify the SWA. The Secretary must grant the request for decertification unless he/she makes one of the three \nfindings set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the Secretary decides not to decertify, he/she must then instruct \nthat remedial action be continued or that alternate actions be applied. The Secretary must write a report explaining \nhis/her reasons for not decertifying the SWA and copies (hard copy and electronic) will be sent to the State agency. \nNotice of the Secretary's decision must be published promptly in theFederal Register, and the report of the \nSecretary must be made available for public inspection and copy.\n\n(f) Where either the Assistant Secretary or the Secretary denies a request for decertification and order further \nremedial action, the Regional Administrator must continue to monitor the SWA's compliance. If the SWA achieves \ncompliance within the time period established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Regional Administrator \nmust terminate the remedial actions. If the SWA fails to achieve full compliance within that time period after the \nSecretary's decision not to decertify, the Regional Administrator must submit a report of his/her findings to the \nAssistant Secretary who must reconsider the request for decertification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph \n(b) of this section.\n\n\u00a7 658.706\n\nNotice of decertification.\n\nIf the Secretary decides to decertify a SWA, he/she must send a Notice of Decertification to the State agency \nstating the reasons for this action and providing a 10 working day period during which the SWA may request an \nadministrative hearing in writing to the Secretary. The notice must be published promptly in theFederal Register.\n\n\u00a7 658.707\n\nRequests for hearings.\n\n(a) Any SWA which received a Notice of Decertification under \u00a7 658.706 or a notice of disallowance under \u00a7 \n658.702(g) may request a hearing on the issue by filing a written request for hearing with the Secretary within 10 \nworking days of receipt of the notice. This request must state the reasons the SWA believes the basis of the \ndecision to be wrong, and it must be signed by the State Administrator (electronic signatures may be accepted).\n\n(b) When the Secretary receives a request for a hearing from a State agency, he/she must send copies of a file \ncontaining all materials and correspondence relevant to the case to the Assistant Secretary, the Regional \nAdministrator, the Solicitor of Labor, and the DOL Chief Administrative Law Judge.

Discerning the number of \nState and local-sector employees and private-sector employees at the local level is difficult; therefore, the \nDepartment used the State and local-sector loaded wage factor (1.55) instead of the private-sector wage factor \n(1.42) for all non-Federal employees to avoid underestimating the costs.\n\n(12) BLS OES, May 2013, 43-0000 Office and Administrative Support Occupations \n(http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#43-0000).\n\n(13) BLS OES, May 2013, 23-10111 Lawyers (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#23-0000).\n\n(14) BLS OES, May 2013, 15-1131 Computer Programmers (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151131.htm).\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\nhttp://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2013/general-schedule/gs_h.pdf\nhttp://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2013/general-schedule/gs_h.pdf\nhttp://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/ecec_nr.htm\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#43-0000\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#23-0000\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151131.htm\n\n\n(15) BLS OES, May 2013, 11-1021 General and Operations Managers \n(http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#11-0000).\n\n(16) BLS OES, May 2013, average for the following occupational categories weighted by the number of employees \nin State government: 15-1131 Computer Programmers; 15-1132 Software Developers, Applications; 15-1133 \nSoftware Developers, Systems Software; and 15-1134 Web Developers \n(http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#15-0000).\n\n(17) The number of States that have not established career pathways is provided in the \u201cNational Dialogue on \nCareer Pathways Viewing Party Guide.\u201d\n\n(18) The Department transfers funds to each State through a formal grant process. States may set aside a portion \nof these funds for discretionary use under WIOA. If a State were sanctioned, we would de-obligate the funds \ncomprising the penalty from the State's set-aside, thereby reducing funding without incurring additional costs.\n\n(19) The Department distributes funds through a combination of multi-step formula distributions, Title III (Wagner-\nPeyser) distribution, and national grant competitions that award funds directly to partners. The Department supplies \nfunding to cover payments for partners proportionate to their use of one-stop delivery systems, although partners \nmay instead opt to use pay-in-kind or other leveraged funds.\n\n(20) This number is derived from OFLC data on employers that have submitted H-2A applications. The Department \nextrapolated the number of unique employers from the full list of applications to avoid duplication and to identify the \nfewest employers that may be impacted by these proposed changes.\n\n(21) Department of Labor et al. \u201cWhat Works In Job Training: A Synthesis of the Evidence.\u201d July 2014.\n\n(22) Ibid.\n\n(23) Decker, Paul T. and Jillian A.
