{"title": "U.S. Urges Cuba to Lower Emigres' Fees", "body": "\nThe United States urged Cuba today to lower exit fees for those wishing to migrate but said bilateral agreements \non immigration are working, despite recent evidence of organized human smuggling.\n\nThe two countries held their ninth round of talks since 1994 on implementing agreements whereby the United \nStates turns back most illegal \"rafters\" trying to reach American shores but takes 20,000 immigrants a year who \napply through legal channels.\n\n\"In the main, the agreements are working,\" said John Hamilton, deputy assistant secretary of state for Central \nAmerica, the Caribbean and Cuba, who conducted the talks with Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's parliamentary president.\n\n\"Illegal migration attempts across the Florida Straits -- even with the recent alien smuggling -- are at historically low \nlevels,\" Hamilton said. Coast Guard crews have rescued 102 migrants at sea so far this month in a summer influx of \nfleeing Cubans.\n\nBut Hamilton said the high fees associated with various steps of the immigration process in Cuba led many Cubans \nto abandon the effort to leave the island legally.\n\nIn recent months, U.S. authorities say that smuggling rings dropping migrants off in fast boats appear to be behind \nmost attempts to flee, unlike in previous years, when Cubans often put to sea in rafts or leaky boats in risky \nindividual efforts.\n\nAlarcon did not address the news media after the talks conducted at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, across \nthe street from U.N. headquarters.\n"}
