{"title": "Protesters decry immigrant bill", "body": "\nAbout 50 people gathered at the Minnesota state Capitol on Saturday to demonstrate against a proposed amnesty \nfor illegal immigrants.\n\nThe rally was organized by the Minnesota Coalition for Immigration Reduction, which supports strengthening U.S. \nborders to keep illegal immigrants out.\n\n\"What we believe in is that you should come here legally, you should speak the language of the land, which is \nEnglish, you must abide by the same laws that we abide to, without exhausting the financial assistance programs \nthat are out there,\" organizer Ruthie Hendrycks said.\n\nThe protesters carried American flags and signs with messages such as \"Boycott businesses that hire illegals\" and \n\"Stop the invasion.\"\n\nHendrycks said they don't oppose legal immigration but proposals to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants already \nhere.\n\nThe rally preceded one scheduled for this afternoon that's expected to draw thousands of supporters of immigrant \nrights. Participants will gather at the St. Paul Cathedral and march to the Capitol.\n\nOne of the organizers of today's rally, immigration attorney Benjamin Casper, stopped to check out Saturday's \nevent. Although a bill before Congress that would offer eventual citizenship to millions of illegal immigrants fell \nvictim Friday to internal disputes in both parties, Casper said a consensus is emerging that an amnesty is needed. \n\"It's a humanitarian crisis and it needs to be resolved. \u2026 You can't simplistically ask 11 million people to disappear \novernight.\"\n"}
