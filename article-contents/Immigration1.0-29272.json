{"title": "LAWMAKERS CHALLENGE NYPD STOP-FRISK PRACTICE", "body": "\nTWO STATE LAWMAKERS yesterday kicked off a legislative attack on the NYPD's controversial stop-and-frisk \npolicy and compared it to Arizona's new immigration law.\n\nAssemblyman Hakeem Jeffries and state Sen. Eric Adams plan to introduce bills in Albany today to ban the NYPD's \npractice of saving personal data of people who are stopped and questioned but not charged with a crime or issued \na violation.\n\n\"Since the NYPD will not end this practice, the state Legislature must step in to protect the people,\" Jeffries said at \na City Hall press conference.\n\nThe bills are the first legislative challenge to the stop-and-frisk database compiled by the NYPD, which stopped \nand questioned people in record numbers last year.\n\nThe NYPD maintains the confidential database has proven helpful to detectives in solving crimes.\n\nBut two key City Council leaders have argued the policy violates privacy rights.\n\nAnd just last week, the New York Civil Liberties Union sued the NYPD to end the practice.\n\nJoined yesterday by civil libertarians and other lawmakers, Jeffries and Adams, both Brooklyn Democrats, argued \nthat the NYPD is stopping and questioning blacks and Latinos in disproportionate numbers.\n\nSaving the information of those who are innocent is a civil rights violation, they said, and appears similar in spirit to \nthe controversial Arizona law, which allows cops to demand immigration papers from any citizen deemed \nsuspicious.\n\n\"We are not the northern Arizona,\" Adams said.\n\nThe NYPD said it does not stop and question people based on census data, but instead focuses its efforts in crime-\nplagued neighborhoods.\n"}
