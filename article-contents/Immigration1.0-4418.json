It now emerges that Friedman's \nfinancial ties to the settlement movement run deeper than Beit El. Friedman has also made contributions over the \nyears to Ateret Cohanim, a right-wing organization that buys land in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City and \nArab East Jerusalem for creating a 'Jewish presence' there The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled \nto vote on Friedman's appointment Thursday. If Friedman is confirmed as expected, the vote will go to the full \nSenate. \n\nIn his Senate confirmation hearings several weeks ago, Friedman tried to play down his connections to the settler \nmovement According to Peace Now, an Israeli organization that monitors settlement activity, Ateret Cohanim owns \n59 properties in the Muslim Quarter and Arab East Jerusalem. Since its establishment in 1987, it has settled 1,100 \nJews in these areas, including hundreds of yeshiva students Ateret Cohanim's latest project, approved in \nDecember, is a new three-story building in the middle of the crowded Silwan neighborhood. Opposition members in \nthe Jerusalem City Council have been fighting the plan. 'Ateret Cohanim is known as an organization that tries to \nmake the most provocative purchases possible right in the heart of East Jerusalem,' said Laura Wharton, a city \ncouncil member for the left-wing Meretz party.

Ghalib Abdullah Daraghma, a 48-\nyear-old resident of the occupied West Bank city of Tubas, died in the Palestine medical complex in Ramallah on \nSunday evening after his health deteriorated less than 48 hours after launching a hunger strike. A Palestinian police \nspokesman told Ma'an that Daraghma started his hunger strike on Saturday after he had been taken to the hospital \non Feb. 26. The reason for the hunger strike remained unclear as of Monday. Palestinian security sources said that \nDaraghma had been held in a Palestinian prison for the past two years after being charged with killing five \nPalestinians, including two police officers, in Tubas, adding that he however had not been sentenced in court. \nPalestinian prosecution said it has opened an investigation to uncover the circumstances of his death. Daraghma's \ndeath comes amid renewed outcry against the PA's incarceration system as Palestinian activist Basel al-Araj, who \nhad been detained by the PA for five months in 2016, was killed by Israeli forces on Monday[4].           \nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775816[5] Palestinian journalists protest al-Quds newspaper's \n'normalization' of Israeli occupation[6]RAMALLAH (Ma'an) 6 Mar \u2014 Dozens of Palestinian journalists gathered on \nMonday outside offices of the Palestinian Journalists' Union in the town of al-Bireh adjacent to Ramallah in the \ncentral occupied West Bank, to protest what they called the 'promotion' of illegal Israeli settlements in the al-Quds \nnewspaper. Protests against al-Quds newspaper began after the paper published an interview with the extreme \nright-wing Israeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Liberman, covering a wide range of political topics, including the issue \n\n\nof Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The newspaper has also come under fire in the past for publishing \nannouncements by the Israeli Civil Administration. Head of the union of Palestinian writers Murad Sudani delivered \na speech on behalf of writers unions and federations affiliated to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), \nconfirming their rejection of al-Quds newspaper's 'approach and insistence' to 'continue to promote the Israeli \nnarrative and settlements.' 'All unions and federations,' Sudani said, 'are unanimously against normalization and we \nwill continue to fight all its aspects.' He went on to urge al-Quds newspaper to 'apologize to the Palestinian people \nand to journalists.'.           http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775830[7] 13-year-old Palestinian boy found \nhanged to death in Jerusalem-area town[8]JERUSALEM (Ma'an) 7 Mar \u2014 A teenage Palestinian boy was found \ndead in a tent in the town of al-Eizariya in the central occupied West Bank's Jerusalem district, according to \nPalestinian police. Police spokesman Luay Irzeiqat told Ma'an that police were notified of a dead body found in a \ntent in the town, and that officers from the nearby Abu Dis police station rushed to the place to find the body of a 13-\nyear-old boy lying on the ground inside a tent which served as a children's playroom. The victim was identified as \nAli Salih al-Umour. His brother told police officers that he found al-Umour hanged inside the tent. Police said traces \nof a rope were clear on the victim's neck.

'The Knesset [parliament] passed on its second and third \nreadings the entry into Israel[11] bill,' it said in a statement on Monday night. 'A visa will not be granted nor a \nresidence permit of any kind to any person who is not an Israeli citizen or permanent resident if he, or the \norganisation or body in which he is active, has knowingly issued a public call to boycott the state of Israel or \npledged to take part in such a boycott,' the statement said. Israel has been faced with a boycott movement over its \nnearly 50-year occupation of the West Bank but it has lately intensified the diplomatic and legal fight against it. The \nBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement campaigns for a global boycott of Israel until, among other demands, \nthe country withdraws from all occupied Palestinian territories. Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat[12] \nand accuses it of antisemitism - a claim BDS denies. Haaretz newspaper said the wording of the new law left open \nthe possibility that it could be used against Palestinians living in Israel as temporary residents while their \napplications for permanent residence were being considered. Such a process is required by Palestinians seeking \nright of abode with their Israeli-Arab spouses. Last year, Israeli authorities refused to renew the travel documents of \nprominent BDS campaigner Omar Barghouti. His family are Palestinian but he was born in the Gulf state of Qatar. \nHe is married to an Israeli-Arab and as such has permanent resident status, although not full citizenship. But interior \nminister, Aryeh Deri, has been considering revoking Barghouti's residence permit, the ministry has said.           \nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775830\nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775832\n\nindirect message and not a hint \u2014 from the United States.

The Palestinians seek the West Bank as the heartland of a future state, a position that has wide \ninternational backing.

Beginning at 6 p.m. in the USAO Ballroom, Lockwood will discuss the attack on the USS Liberty and \nthen lead an open-ended discussion about foreign relations in the United States. The event is free and open to the \npublic. The USS Liberty was a technical research vessel under the United States Navy. The ship was attacked by \nIsraeli aircraft and torpedo boats on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War. The combined assault resulted in the \ndeaths of 34 crewmen, 171 wounded, as well as severe damage to the Liberty. Israeli forces claimed that the attack \nwas a case of mistaken identity, believing the ship to be Egyptian. The true intentions behind the incident and the \nU.S. government's response to it have remained a source of controversy to the present day. 'The attack on the USS \nLiberty makes the Gulf of Tonkin incident look like nothing,' said Dr. Kevin Crow, professor of history at USAO. \n'There aren't many people who still remember that this happened\u2014much less lived through it\u2014so having Sgt. \nLockwood on campus may well be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the public to hear about what really occurred \nthat day from someone who was actually there.'           https://usao.edu/news/survivor-attack-uss-liberty-address-\nusao-students-public[19]  Violence / Detentions \u2014 West Bank / Jerusalem Basil al-Araj executed by Israeli \noccupation forces after PA imprisonment and months in hiding[20]Samidoun 6 Mar \u2014 In a pre-dawn raid attacking \na home in el-Bireh, Basil al-Araj[21], 31, Palestinian youth activist and writer pursued by Israel for nearly a year, \nwas assassinated by invading Israeli occupation forces this morning. Al-Araj, from the village of Walaja near \nBethlehem, fought back and resisted[22] the invading forces for two hours before the attacking occupation soldiers \nbroke into the home where he was staying and executed him at close range. They then seized his body and took it \nto an unknown location. The attack on the home included rocket fire as well as al-Araj's extrajudicial execution in a \nhail of bullets. Al-Araj's family home in al-Walaja had been repeatedly raided[23] by occupation forces for months. \nAl-Araj, a writer and activist involved in a wide array of Palestinian grassroots struggles for liberation, was among \nthe Palestinian youth dedicated to reviving the Palestinian national liberation movement. One of six Palestinian \nyouth[24] released from Palestinian Authority prisons after nearly six months of detention when they launched a \nhunger strike, Al-Araj and other youth had been seized in April in what was touted as a victory[25] for security \ncoordination between the PA and Israel. While they were imprisoned by the PA, they were subject to torture and ill-\ntreatment[26] by PA security forces. After their hunger strike[27] and widespread attention to their case, including \nprotests[28] after reports of their torture[29], secured their release, four of the youth[30] - Mohammed al-Salameen, \nSeif al-Idrissi, Haitham Siyaj, and Mohammed Harb - have been seized by Israeli occupation forces. All four have \nbeen ordered to administrative detention, imprisonment without charge or trial. The extrajudicial execution of Basil \nal-Araj is yet another example of the ongoing use of 'arrest raids' as assassination raids[31] against Palestinian \nstrugglers, including the killing of Abdullah Shalaldeh[32] in the hospital and the murder of former prisoner and \nstruggler Muataz Washaha[33]. It also highlights once again the devastating and deadly reality of 'security \ncoordination' between the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian Authority for Palestinians struggling for their \nliberation, pursued and imprisoned through this coordination up to the point of their execution.           \nhttp://samidoun.ca/2017/03/basil-al-araj-executed-by-israeli-occupation-forces-after-pa-imprisonment-and-months-\nin-hiding/[34] another account:Palestinian activist 'executed' by Israeli forces after 2-hour gun battle[35]RAMALLAH \n(Ma'an) 6 Mar \u2014 Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian activist early Monday morning, culminating a two-hour-long \ngun battle in the Ramallah area of the central occupied West Bank, after Israeli forces had been pursuing the man \nsince he was released from Palestinian prison last September. The raid sparked clashes, which left two \nPalestinians shot and injured by Israeli forces. No Israelis were injured in the incident. Israeli police identified the \nslain man as Basel al-Araj, who was wanted for 'planning terror attacks against Israelis.' Al-Araj was detained \nwithout charges or explanation by Palestinian security forces in April last year[36] along with Haitham Siyaj and \nMuhammad Harb. The controversial case made headlines when the three men joined three other detainees in a \nhunger strike [37]in Palestinian prison, amid reports of torture and mistreatment. After being released [38]in \n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-minister-us-warned-israel-annexing-west-bank-45934561\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-minister-us-warned-israel-annexing-west-bank-45934561\n\nSeptember, Palestinian activists had feared that Israeli forces would immediately detain the six men, as the \nPalestinian Authority (PA) has been widely criticized for its security coordination with Israel through what critics \nhave called a 'revolving door policy' of funneling Palestinians from PA jails into Israeli prisons. Muhammad Harb \nand Haitham Siyaj, along with two of the other hunger striking detainees Muhammad al-Salamin and Seif al-Idrissi, \nwere eventually detained by Israeli forces and ordered to administrative detention, imprisonment without charge or \ntrial, while a video was released by Israeli media[39] showing Israeli forces beating Siyaj in custody. However, \nIsraeli forces were unable to immediately apprehend al-Araj, and the months-long manhunt continued until the \nMonday morning raid, when forces from the Israeli army, Israeli border police, Israeli intelligence, and Israel's \ncounter-terrorism unit surrounded a house in the outskirts of the refugee camp of Qaddura, where al-Araj was \nallegedly staying. Eyewitnesses told Ma'an that gunfire was exchanged between Israeli forces and a Palestinian \nman for around two hours until he ran out of ammunition, after which Israeli forces raided the house and 'executed' \nhim by shooting him at close range with several bullets.A video [below] shared by Israeli police showed Israeli \nforces entering a home and firing heavily towards an overhead crawl space. It remained unclear whether the video \nshowed the exact moment when al-Araj was shot and killed, and whether he first opened fire, as per Israeli claims. \nIsraeli forces also fired an Energa anti-tank rifle grenade into the building, causing the destruction of parts of the \nhouse, witnesses said. Witnesses said they saw Israeli forces dragging a man's body by his feet outside of the \nhouse. Meanwhile the Palestinian Ministry of Health has reportedly confirmed al-Araj's death, according to online \nmedia reports, while his body was taken by Israeli forces to an unknown destination.           \nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775810[40] In final letter, slain Palestinian activist Basel al-Araj \nponders looming death[41]RAMALLAH (Ma'an) 6 Mar \u2014 In a final letter written before he was killed by Israeli forces \nin a two-hour shootout[42], Palestinian activist and writer Basel al-Araj revealed his thoughts over his seemingly \nineluctable end 'Greetings of Arab nationalism, homeland, and liberation,' the letter, shared on social media by al-\nAraj's family, read. 'If you are reading this, it means I have died and my soul has ascended to its creator. I pray to \nGod that I will meet him with a guiltless heart, willingly, and never reluctantly, and free of any whit of hypocrisy.' Al-\nAraj went on to ponder the initial difficulty of writing a last testament, like many other Palestinians who were killed \nby Israeli forces. 'How hard it is to write your own will. For years I have been contemplating testaments written by \nmartyrs, and those wills have always bewildered me. They were short, quick, without much eloquence. They did not \nquench our thirst to find answers about martyrdom,' he wrote. 'Now I am walking to my fated death satisfied that I \nfound my answers. How stupid I am! Is there anything which is more eloquent and clearer than a martyr's deed? I \nshould have written this several months ago, but what kept me was that this question is for you, living people, and \nwhy should I answer on your behalf? Look for the answers yourself, and for us the inhabitants of the graves, all we \nseek is God's mercy.'In a lengthy statement [43]released on Monday, the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine (PFLP) described al-Araj as a freedom fighter, intellectual, and theorist, who was 'one of the most \nprominent young Palestinian strugglers' to resist the Israeli occupation, and who 'worked to chronicle the history of \nPalestine and confront all attempts to liquidate the Palestinian cause.' The group said the killing laid bare 'an urgent \nneed to confront all forms of security coordination, political arrests, and prosecutions' by the Palestinian Authority \n(PA), describing security coordination with Israel as 'a betrayal' of the principles and values of Palestinian \nresistance.           http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775829[44] VIDEO: Aftermath of Israeli raid into al-\nBireh/Ramallah resulting in one martyr and two injured[45]Quds News 5 March 22:44           \nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775810\nhttp://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=775829\n\nPalestinian politician, said he visited the house in Ramallah where the Israelis said a firefight occurred.

The Israeli side is trying to claim there was shoot back.' 'No safety or \nsecurity' Barghouti said it was 'really amazing' that the Israeli army entered the centre of Ramallah, which is \nsupposed to be under the Palestinian Authority's control. Regular raids by the Israeli army and police units in the \noccupied West Bank are controversial because they often involve incursions into Area A, which was designated as \nsolely under the remit of Palestinian security forces in the Oslo peace accords. 'Usually the Israeli army claim that \nthey inform before entering the area, but they came into the centre of Ramallah, which shows that they have full \nmilitary control there,' Barghouti said.

Military sources, \nwho said this seems to be the direction the prosecution is taking, said a final decision will be made in the coming \ndays. Those pushing for the appeal argue that Azaria's sentence was not congruent with the ruling of the judges, \nwhich was very critical of him. Prosecutors had asked for a three-to-five year sentence. In the end, the military \ncourt, headed by Col. Maya Heller, decided on 18 months, which seemed to be the lightest sentence to fit the \nverdict. The minority view, apparently that of Col. Carmel Wahabi, held that Azaria should have been sentenced to \ntwo and a half to five years in prison. If the prosecution wants to appeal, it will have to do so within the next few \ndays. Last week, Azaria, through attorney Yoram Sheftel, filed an appeal of his conviction, and the military appeals \ncourt ruled that the start of his sentence would be delayed until that appeal is heard.           \nhttp://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.775413[50] Violent detention raid in East Jerusalem sparks \nclashes[51]JERUSALEM (Ma'an) 6 Mar \u2014 A predawn Israeli police raid to detain five Palestinians in the occupied \nEast Jerusalem neighborhood of 'Issawiya sparked clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian youth on \nMonday morning, according to local sources who said police violently assaulted the five Palestinians before \napprehending them.

They fired shots to scare them, slapped \nthem, inflicted pain and left them bound and blindfolded out in the cold for several hours. Then the police were \ncalled in on a baseless pretext to finalize the abuse. The arrests without cause of S. and Saif al-Din Ibrahim are two \nmore of those unreported run-ins, an entirely normal circumstance in the holy kingdom of Judea and Samaria. \nThat's how a junta that forces itself on a civilian population conducts itself. Humiliation and the infliction of fear, the \ndemonstration of superiority and harassment are the necessary ammunition that the soldiers employ. Along with \nlying. Ibrahim, 21, was herding sheep that were munching on the fresh grass of the terraced landscape just a few \nmeters below his house, when suddenly, at around 2:30 P.M., he heard the sounds of gunfire to the west and saw \ntwo people running away. He then spotted soldiers on their way down the slope. Two were on foot with a jeep close \nbehind. An armed civilian, apparently a security coordinator, showed up as well. 'They called out to me to come \ndown to them from the terrace,' Ibrahim told Haaretz. 'I understand Hebrew. I didn't know what they wanted from \nme. I asked them: 'How do you want me to come down when I'm with the sheep?' They shot near me into the air. I \nwas forced to come down. Three of them grabbed me. One held me by the head and slammed me against the \nterrace's stones. The second one pulled my hands to the side and cuffed them, and the third held my legs.' Then \nthey beat the major criminal and dragged him to the jeep. The girls in the house saw what was happening and \nstarted screaming.

It said, according to \nWAFA, that Israel has detained some 15,000 Palestinian women since its occupation of the West Bank, East \nJerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967[71].

Located in the village of Tana east of \nthe West Bank city of Nablus, Hanani's home \u2014 along with 300 other modest Palestinian homes \u2014 was razed by \nIsraeli bulldozers early this year, prompting displaced residents to seek refuge inside nearby caves. The Israeli \nauthorities, for their part, attempted to justify the demolitions by saying the homes had been built without state \npermission. 'Life is difficult in the caves,' Hanani told Anadolu Agency. 'We lack most basic requirements.' 'But we \nhave no alternative,' he said bitterly. 'We build our homes out of corrugated iron and Israeli bulldozers eventually \ncome and demolish them.' 'I've seen it happen more than 20 times,' he added. While watching an old television set \npowered by solar energy, Hanani said: 'I fear difficult days ahead; harassment by the Israeli army \u2014 and the Jewish \nsettlers \u2014 will continue.' He pointed to an outpost on a nearby hilltop, saying: 'That's a [Jewish] settler who came \nseveral years ago with his caravan. Today, he runs a farm for breeding cattle.' 'He established a settlement outpost \nthere,' he explained. 'Now he wants to extend the boundaries of his property to include land on which we were living \nbefore the 1967 occupation.' Hanani owns some 200 sheep and lives off the money he makes selling the milk they \nproduce and the cheese his wife makes. Describing the cave in which he and his wife now live as 'our modest \nkingdom', Hanani said: 'It's a simple life. We only want to live in safety and security.' Their cave contains two small \nbeds, a television set perched on a rickety table, and a simple cooking oven.           \nhttp://www.daysofpalestine.com/features/fleeing-israel-bulldozers-palestinians-resort-caves/[94] Khan al-Ahmar \nvillage scheduled for demolition[95]IMEMC/Agencies 6 Mar \u2014 Israeli Civil Administration in the occupied West \nBank announced, on Monday, that it has decided to demolish the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar. The village \nis located in Area C, according to the Oslo Peace Accords signed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in \n1993. This area is under Israel security and administrative control. Israel newspaper Haaretz reported, according to \nDays of Palestine, that the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank had issued 42 demolition orders. According \nto local Palestinian villagers who have been living in this village since before the Israeli occupation of 1948, the \ndemolition of 42 homes means that more than two thirds of the village would disappear. Earlier, the villagers \nappealed against Israeli demolition orders, but the Israeli courts failed to prevent occupation authorities from \ncarrying out the demolitions. Hundreds of the Palestinians live in the village without the basic infrastructure. They \nrejected an Israeli proposal to move to another place, stressing this is their own land and no one will oblige them to \nleave it.

Mayor Ruvik Danilovich decided to close \nBeersheba's traditional Bedouin market, which had been in operation for some 120 years, by the end of the month. \nAn appeal has already been filed against the decision to postpone the closure of the market, known colloquially as \nthe 'Thursday market.' Danilovich said that the decision to close the market was made after experts found that the \nmarket did not 'represent real Bedouin heritage,' and said that the location of the market could be turned into a \ntouristic, educational or entertainment center. However, protesters expressed their anger towards the decision, \narguing that the market was an important institution for the merchants working there, as well as for low-income \ncustomers who could not afford shopping at other more expensive locations. Protesters held signs reading 'Ruvik, \nhow much did they pay you to kill us?,' 'struggling to make a living,' 'racist Ruvik,' or otherwise calling the closure a \n'death sentence against 1,000 families' dependent on the market.

He spent 26 years in Italy, first working as a sous-chef in several pizzerias and then, \nafter eight years, Hassan opened his own pizza restaurant. Within a decade, the ambitious chef had opened three \nrestaurants[116] in Rome offering Italian-style pizza, meat dishes and all types of pasta. However, Hassan, now \n55, yearned to return to the Arab world. He sold his restaurants, left Italy and headed to Gaza, where he opened a \nrestaurant that specializes in kushari[117], a traditional Egyptian dish made of rice, macaroni and lentils. The move \nwas a success, and his decision to relocate to Gaza appeared to be much more profitable than heading back to \nEgypt. On Omar al-Mukhtar Street in the center of Gaza City, hundreds of customers from all over the Gaza Strip \nhead to Hassan's Nile Kushari restaurant, which is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day.

Faithful to Defense \nMinister Avigdor Lieberman's view that 'our orders to the Israel Defense Forces are to act with full force until the \nother side cries uncle and raises a white flag,' Israel has responded aggressively to the launch of every lone rocket \nfrom Gaza - bombing Hamas command posts, but also civilian buildings. Israel acknowledges that Hamas isn't the \none launching occasional missiles at its territory, and that the guilty parties are Salafi organizations close to or \naffiliated with the Islamic State. Despite this, it holds Hamas responsible for the rocket fire and demands that the \norganization, which it doesn't recognize and which it defines as a terrorist group, fight the Salafists. These are the \nsame groups that launched missiles at Eilat from Sinai in early February, but Israel doesn't operate in or bomb \nEgyptian territory - at least not publicly. It leaves the work to the Egyptian army. Nor does it denounce Egypt or hold \nit responsible for the rocket fire on the grounds that it is the sovereign power in Sinai.The paradoxical situation in \nwhich Israel views Hamas as the sovereign, and therefore holds it responsible for what happens in Gaza yet at the \nsame time fights against it, cannot produce the quiet it seeks. Residents of border-area communities around Gaza \nshouldn't have to endure a 'trickle' of rockets. But brutal clashes with Hamas - at the very moment when the \norganization is strengthening its ties with Egypt and cooperating with Cairo in the battle against terrorist \norganizations in Sinai - don't demonstrate wisdom one can only be amazed by Hamas' ability to maintain \ncomparative quiet, and the steps it has taken against the organizations that seek to undermine its authority by \nlaunching rockets at Israel. Given the absence of any intent to conduct negotiations with the Palestinians in general \nand Hamas in particular, the government must immediately consider other ways of halting the deterioration in Gaza \n- first and foremost by alleviating the wretchedness of life there.           \nhttp://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/1.775247[121] Solidarity / BDS Are British universities silencing critics of \nIsrael?[122]MANCHESTER, England 6 Mar by Shafik Mandhai \u2014 On a gloomy afternoon outside the University of \nManchester Students' Union, pro-Palestinian activists took turns to man a small stall collecting signatures in support \nof the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS. Huda Ammori enthusiastically helped students \nasking how to get more involved in pro-Palestinian activism, as her colleagues considered the best way to move a \nmock two-metre high Israeli separation wall behind them. 'They want us gone by half three,' Ammori told Al \nJazeera, explaining the agreement she had made with the union to vacate the area before it became too busy. A \nlocal of the nearby town of Bolton, Ammori, a British citizen of Palestinian and Iraqi heritage, has spent the week \ndrumming up support for Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW). The event is held at universities across the world to shine a \nlight on Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and within the state itself. The University of \nManchester has allowed the series of talks marking the event to go ahead, but that approval has only come after \nseveral meetings and email exchanges with Ammori, and is subject to a strict set of conditions. 'The university has \nheavily scrutinised every single detail of each event the number of conditions the university has placed on us is \nunheard of,' Ammori said, adding: 'Other societies and groups do not face the same problems.' The conditions, \nlisted in emails seen by Al Jazeera, relate to the impartiality of event conveners and scrutiny of speakers.

They include 13 minor girls under the age of 18, and Palestinian women \nprisoners have recently escalated complaints regarding their conditions of imprisonment, especially for the 14 \nwomen prisoners who are injured, shot by Israeli occupation forces and requiring extensive medical care and \npersonal assistance, provided mostly by fellow women prisoners. In particular, protesters highlighted the case of \nLena Jarbouni[126], the longest-held Palestinian woman prisoner. Jarbouni, from Akka, is a Palestinian citizen of \nIsrael who worked in sewing workshops and was arrested in 2002. She is ill and suffers from a number of diseases. \nLina is the spokesperson and representative of women prisoners in HaSharon; sentenced to 17 years, she has \nthree years remaining in her sentence. She received this lengthy sentence for 'aiding the enemy' - Palestinian \nresistance. She was denied essential medical treatment until her fellow women prisoners launched a strike for her \n\nhttp://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/03/palestine-egypt-kushari-restaurant-gaza-success-story.html\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/1.775247\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/british-universities-silencing-critics-israel-170305010803829.html\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/british-universities-silencing-critics-israel-170305010803829.html\n\n\ntreatment.
