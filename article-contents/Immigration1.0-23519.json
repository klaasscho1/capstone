{"title": "Apple fades in race to conquer TV", "body": "\nIt is the revolutionary television that gadget fans have been waiting years for. A camera recognises you and \ninstantly personalises the screen. Ask what is on the Discovery Channel, the voice recognition understands and \nshows you. Call up Breaking Bad, and the device offers a choice of episodes on live TV, Netflix or its own video \nservice.\n\nThis might have been the Apple TV that Steve Jobs had in mind when he told his biographer Walter Isaacson in \n2011 that he had \"finally cracked\" the perfect user interface for TV.\n\nBut instead it is  Microsoft's new Xbox One console, which has received rave reviews for its media-centre \ncapabilities as well as gaming.\n\n\"Using voice to navigate around the TV experience opened my eyes to the potential with this experience. Other \nboxes have tried this and failed,\" said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, in a review of the console.\n\nA year ago, when Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, began to raise expectations that it was about to launch a new \nTV product, the company's existing set-top box was par for the course in a market of humdrum streaming devices \nand clunky smart TVs. But now it looks in danger of being left behind by the more radical steps taken by its rivals.\n\nAs well as the Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, which both sold 1m units in their first day on sale this month, \nGoogle has released its $35 Chromecast, which allows smartphone-toting couch potatoes to transmit wirelessly \nwhatever is on their small screen to the big one. It works with most devices that can run Google's Chrome web \nbrowser.\n\nApple offers something similar with its Airplay feature, but it is limited to its own devices and its Apple TV receiver is \nthree times as expensive.\n\nAt the same time, Samsung is courting developers to make apps that run on its mobiles and smart TVs, as well as \ntouting integration between them for consumers, such as carrying over a film from a TV to a tablet when you leave \nthe living room.\n\n\n\"A more advanced living room play is beginning to look like a growing opportunity for Apple,\" says Dan Cryan, \ndigital media analyst at IHS. \"The rest of the market has moved on a lot.\"\n\nGoogle, Microsoft and Samsung all have viable \"ecosystems\" that encompass the biggest screen in the house and \nthe smallest in the pocket, Mr Cryan says, while Apple still sits on the sidelines in TV.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; \"It would be strange for a company as involved in entertainment as it is to not try to further its involvement in \nthe one major screen and point of interaction out there in consumers' homes that it's not already got some kind of \nstory for.\"\n\nThis week, Apple paid about $360m  to acquire PrimeSense, an Israeli company that provided some of the \ntechnology behind the previous Xbox's motion-sensing device, Kinect.\n\n\"Some sort of living-room appliance is in Apple's future and gesture technology could be critical,\" wrote analysts at \nJefferies in a note to clients this week, calling PrimeSense a \"global pioneer and leader in gesture technologies.\n\n\"Smart TVs and gaming consoles are key recipients of these technologies.\"\n\nHowever, Jefferies analysts also described Apple TV as \"the Unicorn\", as it had been rumoured for so long without \never being seen.\n\nApple executives have been dropping hints about its plans for the TV market for almost two years. Mr Cook said on \nseveral occasions throughout 2012 that it was an \"area of intense interest\".\n\n\"It's a market that we see, that has been left behind,\" he told NBC last December in a rare TV interview. In May, he \nsaid Apple had sold more than 13m TV boxes to date, about 6.5m of which were in the previous 12 months.\n\n&lt;&gt;Since then, however, Apple's progress in TV has fallen short of the revolutionary. Its existing $100 set-top \nbox has acquired new channels such as HBO Go, ESPN, the NFL and Sky News.\n\nBut while the iPhone and iPad's user interface has seen a complete overhaul, the Apple TV still looks pretty much \nthe same as before software design duties were handed to Sir Jonathan Ive late last year.\n\nPeople who own the Apple TV box spend far more on content than those who merely own an iPhone or iPad, \nanalysts say. In June, Apple said it sells more than 800,000 TV episodes and 350,000 movies every day on iTunes, \na large portion of which is through Apple TV, generating upwards of $3m a day in revenue.\n\nA substantial amount of that spending is believed to be from \"cord cutters\" who have used Apple TV to replace their \ncable subscription. But some analysts believe that Apple's future is more likely to be working with the existing \nbroadcasters and service providers than against them.\n\nMr Bajarin says that Apple could take the same partnership approach to TV that it did with AT&T for the iPhone.\n\n\"The Xbox One has convinced me that a very disruptive opportunity exists to become the one box for TV,\" says Mr \nBajarin, \"and you don't become the one box without doing a deal with the service providers\", because they still \ncontrol direct access to their networks.\n\nApple could one-up Microsoft by striking such a deal with the lure of better technology and the opportunity for \ncable companies to sell more expensive services, he suggests, citing Apple's recent talks with Time Warner.\n\n\n\nBut striking many of those deals across the patchwork of satellite and cable operators in the US and abroad would \nbe a long-term task. One former Apple employee says the company believed taking that approach was too risky \nbecause it would rely on competitors' networks for quality of service.\n\nIf Mr Jobs had indeed \"cracked\" how to sell an Apple TV through such networks, this person said, it would be on \nsale by now.\n\nPerhaps PrimeSense and other deals can help Apple raise its game in the living room but for now, many watchers \nof the company still doubt its TV unicorn exists.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But \nthe party's efforts to enter government by building a new coalition have since been stymied by problems amid \nallegations that Mr Babis was an informant for Czechoslovakia's repressive StB secret police in the 1980s.\n\nIf true, the charges would exclude him from taking a job as a minister in any new government, and Ano could \nfracture. Czech law forbids former StB agents from government posts, and Milos Zeman, the Czech president, has \nsaid he will not appoint people without a clean record from the communist past. \n\nThe allegations emerged in newspaper reports in neighbouring Slovakia during the election campaign, but still did \nnot prevent Ano - which ran on a pro-business, low-tax platform - from taking 18.5 per cent of the vote. That placed \nit behind the Social Democrats, who garnered 20.5 per cent and whose leader, Bohuslav Sobotka, was last week \ngiven the task of cobbling together a majority coalition.\n\nArchives kept by Slovakia's Nation's Memory Institute allege that Mr Babis, who was a member of the Communist \nparty, met with the StB in the early 1980s and later became an agent, using the code-name \"Bures\", informing for \npolice on his co-workers in the fertiliser business in an operation named Oko, or \"Eye\". However, parts of the secret \npolice files have been shredded.\n\nMr Babis, 59, denies the reports, and is suing the institute, insisting he was registered by the StB without his \nknowledge.\n\n\"I legally defend myself against the accusation that I co-operated with the communist secret police,\" Mr Babis told \nthe Financial Times in an email exchange. \"The Secret Police (StB) kept a file that I didn't know about and there is \nnot even my signature in this file.\"\n\nMr Babis, an ethnic Slovak who speaks Czech with an accent, admitted that he had met with StB agents because \nhe was working for a foreign trading company importing phosphates to Czechoslovakia, but says he did not inform \non anyone.\n\nThe Institute says it is confident of its records. \"There is generally a low probability that the pieces of evidence were \nfabricated as they exist in three files independent from each other,\" Ondrej Krajnak, the Institute's head, told the \nCTK Czech news agency.\n\nThe allegations haunting Mr Babis add another element of uncertainty to a Czech political landscape that has been \nshaken by the recent collapse of the centre-right government of Petr Necas in a sex, spying and bribery scandal. \nThe political uncertainty is weighing on the country as it struggles to emerge from a record-long recession.\n\n\n\nOne of the more surprising elements of the Babis affair may be how little ordinary Czechs seem to care about it. If \nanything, Ano continues to gain in local opinion polls.\n\nJiri Pehe, a Prague-based political scientist, said the allegations \"don't cause strong emotions here\" because there \nwere relatively few dissidents in communist times, with the exception of a tiny but hardy group gathered around \nformer president V\u00e1clav Havel. Most ordinary people accommodated themselves to the system, he added.\n\nCzechs voters seem more animated by the antics of the current political class. Mr Babis built Ano as a response to \nthe frequent corruption scandals swirling through Czech politics, saying that the country's leadership had become \ndominated by \"godfathers\" linked to lobby groups.\n\nThe outcome of the October vote saw no party take an outright majority, in part because established parties lost \nmuch of their credibility. In fact, no government can be created without at least three political parties. Mr Sobotka is \nexpected to tap Ano and the smaller centrist Christian Democrats in his attempt to form a coalition. There are \nalready fissures between the three potential partners over whether the so-called \"lustration\" law preventing former \nspies from serving in government should be scrapped or not.\n\nMr Babis had wanted to be finance minister, which would allow him to push his low-tax policies in a government led \nby the left-leaning Social Democrats. But if the law is not changed he may be content to put in a proxy from his \nparty.\n\n\"If the president insists on my certificate of innocence, I don\u00b4t have to be in the government,\" said Mr Babis. \"I am \nexcluded from the society only because somebody kept a falsified record. There is no evidence about my \nconscious co-operation with StB. And my conscience is clear.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

In total he had spent \n$236. So was the sales scramble worth it? \"It is. And I love it,\" he said, as his wife took a picture.\n\nHoliday buying traditionally begins the day after Thanksgiving on what is known as Black Friday, but in a fragile \npost-crisis economy, where ecommerce is booming, retailers started early with big discounts that are likely to sap \nprofits.\n\nOnline sales rose by 19.7 per cent year-on-year on Thanksgiving and by 9 per cent in the hours up until 3pm on \nBlack Friday, according to IBM Digital Analytics research. Adobe said Thanksgiving online sales topped $1bn.\n\nBill Simon, head of Walmart US, which released its first discounts at 6pm on Thursday, said on Friday morning that \nthe retailer had a \"great\" night with shopper numbers up on last year's 22m, though he would not say by how much.\n\nWalmart sold 2m televisions and 1.4m tablet computers. Asked how shoppers' average spend compared to last \nyear, Mr Simon said: \"I don't think that we saw a dramatic difference generally speaking.\"\n\n\n\nThere were scattered reports of violence breaking out among overeager shoppers at several retailers, but Mr Simon \nsaid the number of incidents at Walmart was down from last year.\n\nKenneth Onuorah, a Nigerian doctor, walked out of Best Buy in Westbury carrying a $325 Toshiba laptop. \"I was \nlooking for a cheaper one\" from Hewlett-Packard, he said. \"But when I got in, it was sold out.\" It was worth the effort \nto join the queues, he said. \"But sometimes it makes you buy something you don't need.\"\n\nThe only obvious problem for others was fitting a 55-inch, $500 LG television into their cars. One man had put it on \nthe back seat but could not shut the rear door. \"Can I pick it up tomorrow?\" he asked plaintively. \"I don't know,\" \nreplied a Best Buy employee.\n\nThe long weekend that begins with Thanksgiving accounts for about 10 per cent of US retail sales in November and \nDecember, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. The pressure this year has been intensified by the fact there are \nsix fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas than last year.\n\nSimeon Siegel, a Nomura analyst visiting New Jersey malls, said the traditional three-hour spending rush on Black \nFriday morning was fading out and being replaced by ecommerce and mall shopping stretched over a longer \nperiod.\n\n\"That's probably not healthy for your business,\" he said. \"You start having to put more [workers] in stores, pay more \nhours . . . You start fighting against yourself and your competitors more.\"\n\nLabour activists have criticised retailers for requiring staff to work on Thanksgiving, but most shoppers said they \nhad managed to have a traditional meal before heading out.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;But no one was compelled to go shopping. Except perhaps Seema Baldeosingh, who was at Long Island's \nRoosevelt Field mall. \"I hate people. I hate crowds,\" she said. \"Especially Macy's. It's so crowded and people are so \nrude.\"\n\nShe had been forced out to the stores by her brother and her husband, who had disappeared in search of more \nbargains. But it was not all bad, she conceded. \"My husband scored a Perry Ellis leather jacket for $80 [at Macy's], \nwhich was amazing.\"\n\nOutside Walmart, as one woman pushed a trolley with a 32-inch television on the lower rack, a late-arriving motorist \nslowed to yell: \"Hey, is that the $100 TV?\" It was. Or rather the $98 Funai screen, one of Walmart's most popular \ndeals.\n\nThe woman with the trolley, who said her name was Sunshine, had also bought a soundbar for the TV and a Doc \nMcStuffins toy, among other goods. But she added: \"This is my last year. I'm gonna do it online next year. You get \npretty much the same prices online. No more of this craziness.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This perspective defies basic logic: if the Iranians were \neager for a deal because of the harshness of the sanctions and yet were only willing to settle for an interim step \nforward, why would they give up more in six months when the sanctions are relaxed and the west's leverage is \ndecreased? And if the sanctions were not so devastating as to encourage a full dismantling of the nuclear \nprogramme today, wouldn't the right approach have been to threaten an increase in sanctions unless a full \ndismantlement took place immediately?\n\nOf course we hear the usual argument that dealing \"reasonably\" with Tehran \"strengthens the moderates in Iran\" - \nalthough who these moderates are, and why giving in rather than standing strong doesn't actually encourage the \n\"conservatives\" - remains unexplained. Most glaringly, the Obama administration has failed to inform us why \nreapplying the logic of America's failed policy toward North Korea is likely to produce different results with a \nstronger and cannier adversary.\n\nThe interim agreement not only fails to contain the Iranian nuclear programme; it decreases the incentive for Tehran \nto make a strategic shift and seek a broad rapprochement with the US. The major incentive for Tehran to re-\nevaluate its relationship with Washington was to protect its nuclear programme (and by extension, the very survival \nof the regime); in other words, for a broad geopolitical arrangement to have a chance, it had to be negotiated \nconcomitantly with a solution to the nuclear issue. What incentive will Tehran now have to make further \nconcessions or seek a broader agreement? Why would a regime that flaunted America in Syria and Iraq (which is \ncascading toward a civil war in which Iran is a major if silent participant) and still managed to get a good deal from \nthe west feel any incentive to co-operate further?\n\nThe deal with Iran speaks to a fundamental flaw in America's Middle East policy: a legalism that approaches each \nproblem individually and attempts to get the best deal possible in a short timeframe. This may result in good \noutcomes in boardrooms and court rooms; it's a path to disaster in geopolitics.\n\nAlex Turkeltaub, Washington, DC, US\n\nCo-Founder and Board Member, Frontier Strategy Group; Co-Founder and Chief Executive, Roam\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

You cannot really put in the same category planning for the Olympics \nand High Speed 2.\n\nPlanning for the Olympics is a game that belongs to a league of its own. The International Olympic Committee \nunilaterally dictates all the rules of the game, picks and chooses the winners and losers, keeps the upper hand on \nmany design negotiations, but, alas, does not supply the cash. There are way too many countries - and politicians - \ninterested in hosting the games, and only one brand owner. This is about sports, but ironically, it is not about a level \nplaying field.\n\nPlanning for HS2 is more similar to Crossrail and other megaprojects that require conventional planning consent. By \nthe time the scheme leaves the parliamentary process, there is no reason to expect that promoters will not be able \nto have reconciled design, timescale and budget with confidence. Of course, this does not mean the budget will not \nevolve in planning. It will. The fact of the matter is that, in an ideal world, the promoters would never release single-\npoint estimates in the early planning stages because they can only know how much things will cost after they finish \nnegotiating the megaproject design through the political and democratic process. Many concessions and deals \nhave to be made in order to beat off opponents who are competing for the same resources to do other things with \nequally ambiguous business cases.\n\n\n\nComparing megaproject final costs and early estimates without controlling for design evolution is like comparing \napples and oranges. The argument that project promoters suffer from optimistic bias (ie, are incompetent) or \nstrategically misrepresent these projects (ie, are crooks and liars) has long been a popular one. It is also hard to \ndismiss as it appeals to common conceptions. But it is time we shelved it. It has no scientific basis and has been a \nserious disservice to a serious public debate about megaprojects.\n\nNuno Gil, Professor of New Infrastructure Development, Manchester Business School, UK\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It was a major instrument in the co-operative Euro-Atlantic security architecture. It not only paved \nthe way for the destruction of military equipment, it also established an inspection and verification regime that led to \nan unprecedented level of transparency.\n\nSince then, new challenges have emerged in other parts of the world (international terrorism, proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction), with serious repercussions for Europe. Former foes in the Euro-Atlantic area are \nfacing these threats together. To make this co-operation effective we must build trust. This must stem from a stable \nsecurity architecture in Europe, including a viable system of arms control and confidence-building measures.\n\nBut this system is now in crisis. Implementation of the CFE treaty has come to a partial halt. We risk losing the fruits \nof years of work and confidence-building. Some may ask, why bother if Europe is at peace today? In short: because \nrecent history has shown that local and sub-regional conflicts can develop into military confrontations with serious \nconsequences for Europe and neighbouring regions. Peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area have not come \nabout by themselves. Trust and confidence as a necessary basis need to be constantly earned and maintained.\n\nWe, the ministers of Poland, Germany and Denmark, met on September 27 in New York to confirm our initiative to \ndevelop a new generation of conventional arms control in Europe. The world has changed and so have the threats. \nMilitary capabilities have developed in an almost revolutionary manner. The confrontation of military blocs is a thing \nof the past. If we want to maintain and improve a viable system of co-operative security in Europe, we need to \nredesign it to take into account these new realities.\n\nA new system must be built on the basis of existing structures and focus on confidence-building measures and \nincreased transparency. It should confirm the basic principles of international law and neighbourly relations. Since \nreal and perceived threats still vary among countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, a modernised agreement should, if \ninterested states call for it, provide instruments tailored to subregional needs.\n\nWe also need to think about the capabilities of armed forces rather than the sheer quantity of equipment. Counting \nbattle tanks or combat helicopters remains important, but to understand the true potential of today's highly mobile \nconventional armed forces we need a much broader approach that captures qualitative aspects and complex \ncapabilities.\n\nMuch has been achieved through the CFE treaty. Now is the time to take serious steps towards a new generation of \nconventional arms control in Europe. We will work with our partners to make this happen.\n\nRadoslaw Sikorski, Guido Westerwelle and Villy Sovndal, Foreign Ministers of Poland, Germany and Denmark \nrespectively\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Blocking the US$3.1bn acquisition of GrainCorp  by Archer Daniels Midland might be the one-\noff that Canberra wants to see it as. The risk is that it is not.\n\nJoe Hockey, Australian treasurer, decided that GrainCorp's dominant position - it handles more than four-fifths of \neastern Australia's bulk grain exports - meant a full takeover was not in the national interest. It is not clear how \ntransferring ownership of an already dominant player to another that is prepared to play nicely (ADM had already \nproffered $200m of local infrastructure investment) is damaging to that interest.\n\nMore worrying was the \"significant consideration\" Mr Hockey gave to the risk that approving this contentious deal \nwould have generated wider hostility to foreign takeovers. That sounds like another public outcry could produce a \nsimilar result.\n\nApproving 131 investment applications, as Mr Hockey says he has, does not matter if you turn down the big ones. \nAsk France, whose spirited defence of Danone in 2005 before a rumoured takeover offer from Pepsi had even \nmaterialised, has become a symbol of that country's perceived hostility to foreign funds.\n\nFor a better example of the dangers of restricting foreign funds, Australians need look no further than Qantas. The \nairline is watching its cash-burning domestic rival suck in new capital from foreign airlines. It cannot access those \nfunds because politicians in the 1990s deemed foreign ownership of the flag carrier not in the national interest. \nGrainCorp can only hope it isn't in a similar position in 2033.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

How about some horse hair jewellery? Small businesses \nare using the targeting power of social networks to advertise to the most niche of audiences this holiday season.\n\nFrom the purveyor of \"Turkducken\" to the makers of custom bracelets from your own horse's tail hair, the number of \nsmall businesses using Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn has increased as the sites develop their self-service \nplatforms to make it easier for the uninitiated to advertise.\n\nFacebook says the great majority of its more than 1m advertisers are small and medium-sized businesses, which it \nsees as a \"big opportunity\". Twitter says 4.5m small businesses use the site, building follower bases to promote \nlocal menus and new products, though Twitter does not say how many of them pay for advertisements.\n\nThe percentage of small businesses using social media has risen in the last year, with 37 per cent saying they use \nFacebook, 23 per cent more than the year before, according to the American Express Open Small Business \nMonitor released last month. The number of small businesses on LinkedIn and Twitter have increased by more than \n50 per cent, albeit from a much lower base.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nBrian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal research, said small business advertising on Facebook in particular is \"growing \nby leaps and bounds\" because of the social network's massive audience of over 1bn users. Niche companies can \nuse the site to find customers all over the world with the same interests, he said.\n\n\"There are a good many gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, pizza crust makers whose market might be small but the \nbeauty of paid search and social is they allow so much in the way of targeting,\" he said. \"You can easily become a \nnational and international brand.\"\n\nIn the last month, Facebook has given small businesses many of the tools that larger advertisers have benefited \nfrom such as 'custom audiences', which allows them to advertise only to existing customers on Facebook, and \n'lookalike audiences', which allow small businesses to find people who have similar interests to their existing \nconsumers.\n\nFor TailSpin Bracelets, the Orange County-based maker of $85 horse hair bracelets, Facebook advertising allows \nthem to target over 5m horse enthusiasts. Divas Snow Gear, which designed a fashionable line for female \nsnowmobilers, turned to social media after realising traditional sources of advertising would make it hard to reach \nthis very specific audience. By using Facebook to target active women in snowy states, it has expanded the \nbusiness by 500 per cent in the last three years.\n\nFacebook does not break out how much revenue small business adverts generate but Mr Wieser estimates it could \nbe \"very substantial\", saying the average small business on the site might spend $1000-$2000 a year compared \nwith the $10,000 they spend on Google. But the growth potential is even higher as a new generation of small \nbusinesses prefer social media to search, he said.\n\nSocial networks are keen to develop their self-service platforms for small business so they do not have to spend on \nlarge sales teams across the world and can maintain sizeable margins as they grow.\n\nDebbie Williamson, a social media analyst at research firm E-Marketer, said Facebook was making a \"strong effort\" \nto court small businesses, with the aim of getting the 20m who use the free \"pages\" service to buy adverts.\n\nShe said Facebook had improved the once-complex process of buying adverts online last month by allowing \nbusinesses to choose an \"objective\" such as getting people to click on their website or redeem a special offer in-\nstore. Before, they had to navigate a range of options from right rail adverts to native promotions in timelines \nthemselves.\n\n\"Facebook helps by selecting which kind of ad Facebook thinks works best. If a small business even has a \nmarketing development person, chances are it is only one person,\" she said.\n\nMs Williamson said Twitter is also trying to lure more small businesses to advertise but with about 230m active \nusers, advertisers outside major cities could find it harder to reach Twitter users.\n\nIn the right market, however, Twitter's live news feed can help some businesses keep in contact with their \ncustomers in real time. San Francisco-based 4505 Meats uses Twitter to tell its followers what it is selling. Ryan \nFarr, the owner, said he tried to create an entertaining dialogue on Twitter which could lead to lines outside their \nfarmer's market stall before they even opened.\n\n\"I definitely feel that we wouldn't be the company we are now if we didn't start using Twitter so early in our \nexistence,\" he said, adding it had grown from a stall to a butcher's shop and a restaurant in the last four years. \"It is \na way for a business that has zero capital when it starts to inform people of who they are.\"\n\nOn the eve of Thanksgiving, 4505 Meats was busy tweeting pictures of its \"Turkduckens\" to its over 10,000 \nfollowers. \"So happy to be delivering Turkduckens today.

He's the man in charge of Royal Bank of Scotland's hit squad, the Global \nRestructuring Group, and it seems that, just as in the movies, he's almost single-handedly blown up the great \nswaths of British business that were his targets.\n\nTo read two reports this week, you'd think Mr Sach's bonus depends on destroying as many viable companies as \nhe can, before flogging the rubble at silly prices to his mates in other parts of the bank. Well, maybe. The behaviour \nof big banks never ceases to surprise, and seldom on the upside, but this is a bit much.\n\nWe haven't seen all the gory details of the Tomlinson report into the treatment RBS meted out to small businesses, \nbut even the author must be surprised at the traction it's got, considering he commissioned himself to write it. \nHowever, many of the cases that we have seen have a common theme.\n\nThey are essentially about property, the great British obsession. The developers/speculators from whom Mr Sach's \nmen pulled the rug had borrowed heavily from RBS in the good times. Had they continued to roll, the borrowers \nwould have got stinking rich, while the bank would get its money back - a high-stakes version of heads I win, tails \nyou lose.\n\nThis hardly excuses the more extreme brutality of Mr Sach's hitmen, but both borrower and lender might have \ninvestigated beyond the mark-to-market value of the property before taking the plunge. Merely looking at the asset \nbacking of a venture is lazy banking. A loan may be under water, but if the business plan still stands up, an \nintelligent lender will not pull the plug, or cause death by a thousand cuts with fees and charges.\n\nLooking may be what GRG actually did. The other report, from Andrew Large, found that only one in ten businesses \nwhich went to the boot camp subsequently went bust. Unfortunately for Mr Sach, they are the loudest decile.\n\nThe days may be short, but it's still autumn at the Treasury, and next week George Osborne will make a statement \nto prove it. Please don't call it a Budget (we will, we will). This is supposed to be about spending, but no recent \nchancellor has resisted the chance of a headline-grabbing tax initiative.\n\n\n\nFew tax increases are popular, but an outfit called the Intergenerational Foundation may have found one. It argues \nthat removing tax breaks from buy-to-let landlords would yield \u00a35bn, and judging from the invective that followed \nNorma Cohen's report of the report, the Foundation may be on to something.\n\nThe rentier benefits from tax relief on the mortgage, dilapidation allowances and - if the owner times his residence \nmoves right - freedom from capital gains tax on disposal. The Foundation argues convincingly that buy-to-let has \nhelped push up property prices, particularly in London, and has done little to stimulate new building.\n\nWell, the clue's in the name, and since everyone else has a lobby group, we shouldn't argue about one for the \nyoung. There's nothing inherently wrong with buy-to-let, but subsidies for the rentier class are another transfer of \nwealth from the young to the old. That looks wrong today - and \u00a35bn is a useful extra sum for George Osborne to \nplay with.\n\nRobin Leigh-Pemberton, who died this week, was a very odd choice for governor of the Bank of England in 1983. \nBut after Kit McMahon had described Nigel Lawson's Medium Term Financial Strategy as hokum, and Jeremy \nMorse spoke out about being bullied into subsidising the financing of UK exports, the two front runners effectively \nruled themselves out.\n\nGordon Richardson had been governor for a decade. He was so cross at not being asked to continue that he gave \nlittle help to his successor, whose mixture of effortless charm and ability to delegate overcame his ignorance of the \nmechanics of central banking. Lord Kingsdown, as he later became, considered that being made Lord Lieutenant of \nKent mattered more to him than being governor of the Bank - which may also help explain why he was rather good \nat it.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But the ill-timed acquisition of Hewden \nTools for \u00a3115m in 2007 led to a succession of rights issues and left the group carrying net debt to earnings before \ninterest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of three times in the deepest downturn in construction in decades.\n\nThe Merseyside-based group has since acted on costs, reducing its headcount from more than 5,100 in 2008 to \nabout 3,800. It has also cut the number of depots, from 488 in 2008 to 264.\n\nIt had been seen to be turning itself round with a focus on international expansion and a move towards services \nrather than pure tool hire. Before today, the shares were up more than 90 per cent in 12 months.\n\nSpeedy said on Thursday that information had very recently emerged of \"the misstatement of a number of \naccounting balances within the international division over recent accounting periods\". It said the impact of the \nirregularities would reduce full-year pre-tax profit by about \u00a33m. Pre-tax profit for the year to the end of March was \n\u00a312.8m.\n\n\n\nThe finance director of the international division has been suspended and other senior divisional management are \nthe subject of further investigation.\n\nSpeedy pointed out that the accounting issues did not relate to its prized oil services contract with Zadco in Abu \nDhabi or a recently announced joint venture in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe company this month appointed a new chief operating officer, former Serco and Costain executive Mark \nRogerson, who is set to start work on Monday and will be seen as the frontrunner for the chief executive role.\n\nMr Corcoran, a former Royal Engineer, joined the company in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become chief \nexecutive in 2005.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said: \"Although the issues are solely due to the international division, the turmoil is \nlikely to slow down progress on Speedy's UK network reconfiguration programme, which could hinder the \ncompany's ability to fully benefit from improving domestic markets.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But China is engaged in a number of equally contentious territorial disputes with Southeast \nAsian nations - particularly the Philippines and Vietnam - over the resource-rich South China Sea.\n\nIan Storey, a security expert at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, said the most obvious \ncandidates for any new Chinese air defence zones were the northern part of the South China Sea and the Yellow \nSea.\n\nChinese maps often include a controversial \"nine-dash line\" that loops the South China Sea, running close to the \ncoasts of Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, and stretching south to Indonesia. It first emerged in a 1947 \nRepublic of China map that was later used by the Communist government of Mao Zedong when it came to power in \n1949.\n\nWhile some Chinese scholars say China does not claim the entire South China Sea, the use of the map has \nsparked concern among Southeast Asian nations. China last year started issuing passports that included an image \nof the \"nine-dash line\", provoking angry responses from Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nMr Storey said China would probably not create an ADIZ for the whole South China Sea, saying it would be \n\"absolutely outrageous\" if they included the whole area inside the \"nine-dash line\". Instead, he said China was more \nlikely to establish a zone in the northern part of the sea, and particularly surrounding Hainan Island.\n\nHainan hosts the Chinese navy's South Sea fleet - one of its three naval fleets - and also a new generation of \nnuclear submarines that are an increasingly important part of China's naval capabilities in the South China Sea.\n\nBut Mr Storey added that creating an ADIZ over even some of the South China Sea would be \"unnecessarily \nprovocative\" at a time when China is trying to reduce tensions with its Southeast Asian neighbours.\n\nIn October, Chinese President Xi Jinping took advantage of the absence of US President Barack Obama at the \nApec summit in Indonesia to launch a charm offensive with Southeast Asian countries, including by floating the idea \n\n\n\nof creating an \"Asian infrastructure bank\" to promote development in the region. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang then \nembarked on a tour of Southeast Asia that was widely seen as an effort to repair relations.\n\nThe creation of an ADIZ over the South China Sea would be unlikely to generate the same kind of military response \nthat occurred this week when the US flew B-52 bombers near the Senkaku without alerting China - mainly because, \nwith the exception of Singapore, most Southeast Asian nations have limited air power.\n\nBut Gary Li, a senior analyst at IHS maritime, said a Chinese ADIZ in the northern South China Sea would be \"very, \nvery sensitive\". He said it would almost certainly overlap with Vietnam's ADIZ, which reaches north to about 100km \nfrom Hainan Island, and includes the disputed Paracel Islands.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Mr Li said the Yellow Sea was also a contender for a new Chinese ADIZ. China has repeatedly criticised the US \nand South Korea for holding joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, which lies between East China and the \nKorean peninsula, and particularly so when the US sails its aircraft carriers through the area.\n\nWu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies in Hainan, a think-tank that advises the \nChinese foreign ministry, said that while China had the right to create new zones, it would take its time.\n\n\"We cannot rule out the possibility of setting up new ADIZs, but not in the short term,\" said Mr Wu. \"Given the \nstrong reaction from the international community to the East China Sea ADIZ, China will further evaluate when and \nhow to set up new ADIZs. But it will happen sooner or later, since it is related to its national security.\"\n\nShi Yinhong, an international relations expert at Renmin University, agreed that China was unlikely to create a zone \nin the South China Sea anytime soon, mainly because Beijing does not see the same urgency, but he said that \ncould change if \"confrontations in the South China Sea escalate\".\n\nChina and Japan had for decades put the Senkaku dispute to the side. But Beijing reacted angrily last year when \nJapan bought three of the islands from their private owner, in a move that sparked anti-Japan protests across \nChina.\n\nMr Li said China probably decided to create an ADIZ - which other countries such as Japan and the US did long \nago - because Tokyo has routinely pointed to the number of Chinese incursions into Japan's zone as a way to rally \npublic support.\n\n\"That caused the Chinese side to say we need to get one too. There is a huge PR war here,\" said Mr Li.\n\nAdditional reporting by Julie Zhu\n\ndemetri.sevastopulo@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Those who attended meetings with Mr Lew assumed he was coming to apologise for the way \nthe debate in Washington on extending the debt ceiling was handled in the previous month and to offer \nreassurance that the next time the matter comes up, it will be handled more smoothly.\n\nFor those investors who are judged on their performance in dollar terms - such as the Chinese sovereign wealth \nfund; and those in non US dollar terms - such as the Singaporeans - since the greenback is the world's reserve \ncurrency, such issues matter enormously. But listeners who expected an apology or an explanation were mistaken.\n\nmailto:demetri.sevastopulo@ft.com\n\n\nInstead Mr Lew instructed his audiences that Asia needed to get its act together and improve its own governance. \nHe further alienated attendees at one session in Singapore by refusing to address the concerns of local bankers \nabout extraterritoriality as the US unilaterally imposes rules on foreign banks with any presence in the US at all.\n\nBut today none of that matters. The consensus is that despite the cavalier treatment of investors in Treasury \nsecurities, whether foreign or domestic, and despite official behaviour that is unworthy of a nation whose currency is \nthe universal safe haven and store of value, the US dollar will be strong next year and the US market will be the \nbiggest game in global markets. This past week the composite Nasdaq rose above 4,000, a level not seen in 13 \nyears, not since the euphoria of the tech bubble. As everything financial rallies to pre-crisis levels. It is no longer \n2007 again - it is better than that.\n\nMore sober observers may well wonder why that should be the case.\n\nAt this odd moment in time, the US markets are the beneficiaries of two contradictory trends: one is today's reality \nand the other is tomorrow's expectation.\n\nNeither of them has anything to do with economic fundamentals, unfortunately. The bullish reality today is that the \nFed is still supplying massive liquidity to the markets, driving asset prices ever higher. Moreover, incoming \nchairman Janet Yellen is even more committed to quantitative easing than the current occupant of the seat Ben \nBernanke.\n\nAt the same time, though, the same market pundits who were sure that the Fed would tighten policy and taper asset \npurchases back in September are predicting that the Fed will now do so early next year on the back of some \npositive economic signs - including the recent stronger than expected payrolls report.\n\nThe anticipated move away from QE is, ironically, also supportive since that expected tapering will mean a stronger \ndollar and an expectation of improved fundamentals - and finally perhaps corporate spending on plant and \nequipment.\n\nSo the market is going up for both reasons. Price/earnings multiples have gone from 14 times at the end of last year \nto almost 17 times - (2007 again).\n\n\"Multiple expansion is driving stock market performance to a far greater degree than earnings, while earnings \nthemselves are being driven to a remarkable extent by share buybacks,\" notes CLSA analyst Christopher Woods.\n\nThose share buybacks amounted to some $218bn in the first half of the year, and keep rising, as do dividend \npayouts. Capex, of course, remains as subdued as ever - but never mind because for the moment, that is what \nkeeps the Fed with its foot on the monetary accelerator.\n\nAnalysts like Mr Wood are now beginning to query what can go wrong and bring the stock market down, beyond the \nsort of geopolitical shock that is always a possibility. His answer is the continuing thereat of deflation.\n\nAs the disconnect between the rising prices of financial assets and the real economy continues, is it possible that \neven the most aggressive easing has limits? And does the fact that the more sceptical analysts are beginning to \npose the question that this point is in sight?\n\nThe real incomes of most of the population have not risen at all. And if the only beneficiaries of QE are the very \nwealthiest, can their spending be enough to support the real economy? In a world where demand will probably be \nweaker tomorrow than it is today, can asset prices rise indefinitely?\n\nEvery day they rise suggests perhaps that the end point is nearer.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Of the 17 members of the single currency bloc, only Germany, Finland and Luxembourg still \nhold the highest rating from S&P.\n\nThere was little reaction to the downgrade in the bond markets; the yield on the Dutch 10-year bond was barely \nchanged at 2.03 per cent in early trading on Friday.\n\n\"There was no knee jerk reaction from the markets as they had already factored in that the Dutch economy was not \nworth a triple A rating,\" said Nick Kounis, economist at ABN Amro.\n\nThe Netherlands has been suffering from the bursting of a housing bubble, rising unemployment and weak \nconsumer spending.\n\nThe country's gross domestic product increased 0.1 per cent in the third quarter but shrank 0.6 per cent compared \nwith the same period a year ago.\n\n\"We do not anticipate that real economic output will surpass 2008 levels before 2017, and believe that the strong \ncontribution of net exports to growth has not been enough to offset a weak domestic economy,\" said S&P.\n\nThe economy is expected to contract 1 per cent this year, according to the European Commission forecast, more \nthan double the projected eurozone contraction.\n\n\n\nMr Dijsselbloem accepted the downgrade, but was confident that the economy was starting to improve.\n\n\"We're a country where we have a strong structural base but we have a number of issues to deal with,\" he told \nCNBC. \"This confirms the need to push forward with some of the reforms.\"\n\nHe added that the government was making the labour market \"more flexible\" and the pension system \"more \nsustainable\", and helping stimulate the housing market.\n\nThe Dutch economy is expected to start growing in 2014 at 0.2 per cent, according to the Commission. Economists \nexpect sustained growth of above 1 per cent to return in 2016.\n\n\"Despite the many difficulties it faces the Dutch economy remains one of the most competitive in the eurozone,\" \nsaid Mr Kounis at ABN Amro.\n\nThe other two major rating agencies, Moody's and Fitch, recently confirmed their triple A ratings for the \nNetherlands.\n\nThe unemployment rate has improved slightly since hitting 9 per cent in July 2013. In October, 8.3 per cent of the \nworking population were without a job, compared to 5.4 per cent in December 2011.\n\nProperty prices have been falling since 2009, and slipped a further 4 per cent in October year-on-year.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain, which last month emerged from a two-year recession, had its outlook upgraded by S&P to \n\"stable\" from \"negative\", suggesting that a further downgrade in the next 18-24 months was unlikely for the BBB- \nrated country.\n\nThe agency also upgraded the long-term credit rating of Cyprus from CCC+ to B-, thanks to receding risks to the \ncountry's ability to service its debts.\n\nAdditional reporting James Fontanella-Khan in Brussels\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Mr Rothschild failed this year in an attempt to unseat a number of directors from \nthe Bumi board.\n\nBumi's response to Mr Rothschild's challenge was to unwind the relationship with the Bakries, but doubts over \nfinancing dogged the complex two-step separation deal.\n\n\n\nIf the separation agreement is backed by shareholders, Bumi will be left with a stake in Berau, another Indonesian \ncoal miner, and change its name to Asia Resource Minerals, while Mr Tan will own more than 47 per cent of the \nnew company.\n\nThe Bumi saga, along with the scandal at Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, have tarnished the reputation of \nthe City as a listing venue for emerging-market minerals companies and driven regulators to tighten rules on the \nLondon Stock Exchange. \n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

That should lead to energy companies holding back their price rises for the coming year \n- although they will not promise a total freeze.\n\nMr Miliband will set out a range of energy policies in an attempt to show that Labour's vision in the area is not \nrestricted to the 20-month price freeze which he announced at party conference in September. He will claim that \nthese represent the biggest shake-up of the energy market since the privatisations of the 1980s.\n\nMr Miliband's new plan for an energy security board will be modelled on the Office of Budget Responsibility, the \nneutral body which ensures that the government's fiscal promises add up.\n\nLabour would also replace Ofgem, the energy regulator, introduce a new energy \"pool\" to break the dominance of \nthe big six and improve transparency in both generation and retail markets.\n\nThe Tories have claimed that Labour's energy freeze would merely lead to energy companies putting up their bills \nbefore and afterwards.\n\nThe BBC reported on Thursday night that ministers were pleading with the big six to freeze bills until mid-2015, \nbarring any increase in wholesale fuel costs.\n\nBut coalition insiders said this was inaccurate: \"There is no plan to freeze energy prices,\" said one aide. \"That is \nMiliband's policy, which would deter competition and investment and push up prices long term for consumers.\"\n\nInstead the government plans to \"roll back\" certain green and social levies including the \"ECO\" insulation scheme \nand the \"warm homes discount\".\n\nThe current proposal is to extend the deadline for energy companies to fulfil their ECO obligations by two years to \n2017, while shifting the Warm Homes Discount to general taxation.\n\nHowever there are no plans to cut the subsidies which go towards supporting solar panels, wind farms, nuclear \npower and other low-carbon energy schemes.\n\nEnergy UK, the industry body, said that only about half of the typical energy bill was made up of energy - with the \nrest from distribution, tax and levies.\n\n\"`The only piece that actually sits within the control of the energy company themselves is the 18 per cent-20 per \ncent of the bill for operating costs and so forth,\" said Angela Knight, head of the group.\n\n\n\nShe said energy companies were operating in a \"pretty competitive market'' and were not making \"a particularly big \nprofit'', adding: \"Having to make some profit is essential for any business to remain in business.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

For the Chinese it's their ceramics, paintings and ink on paper, but as \nthey travel they see more of the world, they visit museums, and their interests broaden. It's a natural progression of \nthe market,\" she said.\n\nThis month a Picasso oil painting, Claude et Paloma, went for $28m to Wang Jianlin, chairman of Chinese property \ngroup Dalian Wanda, at a Christie's auction in New York. Last year, a Chinese buyer lost out at Sotheby's New \nYork sale of Edvard Munch's The Scream - but only after bidding $73m.\n\nInterest in western art is growing both in China and across the wider Asia region. Over $2bn was spent by Asian \nclients in Sotheby's \"non-Chinese\" categories in the five years to 2012 - an increase of over 200 per cent on the \nprevious five-year period.\n\nTen years ago Sotheby's Hong Kong sales - which offered only Chinese art and jadeite jewellery - accounted for \nabout 5 per cent of global sales, but by 2011 Asia, Europe and the Americas contributed to the auction house's \nrevenues in roughly equal proportions.\n\nChristie's, the auction house, said the Chinese were now bidding and buying across a range of its categories, from \nBritish Victorian art and Old Masters to contemporary work. Last year Asian bidders registering at Christie's grew by \n15 per cent. The number of Chinese clients registering in Hong Kong rose by 32 per cent and by 21 per cent in \nLondon\n\nSteven P. Murphy, chief executive of Christie's, said Chinese collectors' move into Western art was \"a hugely \nsignificant trend\". At its New York art auctions earlier this month, he said, \"we saw Chinese bidding in both evening \nand day sales, and at every price level.\"\n\nBoth Sotheby's and Christie's have been actively courting business on the mainland in recent years, conscious of \nthe growing wealth of China's elite and entrepreneurial classes.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Christie's this year became the first foreign auction house to be granted a licence to operate in mainland China, \nholding its first auction in Shanghai in September. Sotheby's has entered the China market as part of a joint venture \nwith state-owned Beijing GeHua Art Company, and on Sunday will hold its first commercial auction on the \nmainland.\n\n\n\nMelanie Gerlis, art market editor of the Art Newspaper, said the Chinese were showing more interest in Western art \nafter rubbing shoulders with international super-rich. \"It seems the Chinese want to be part of the global elite - the \npeople who want an apartment in Battersea Power Station, wine from a vineyard in Burgundy or paintings from a \ndealer in London. It's more that, rather than a genuine love of Old Masters.\"\n\nDoes the shift imply London and New York would soon be supplanted by Beijing?

It \nwas not clear whether he was one of the four employees fired. Christian Luiga, head of Telia's chief executive's \noffice, has been appointed acting chief financial officer.\n\nShares in Telia were down 2.2 per cent to SKr53.25 in early trading.\n\nThe clear-out of senior management comes just months after Telia's chief executive, Lars Nyberg, resigned in \nFebruary amid sharp criticism over corruption allegations in Uzbekistan.\n\nA review by Mannheimer Swartling, a Swedish law firm commissioned by Telia, found that the telecoms operator \nfailed adequately to look into its Uzbek partner and who its ultimate owners were. It could not confirm claims that \nTelia had committed bribery or money laundering in the central Asian country but nor could it dismiss them.\n\nAnders Narvinger, the telecoms group's former chairman, resigned in December, succumbing to pressure from the \nSwedish government, which is Telia's largest shareholder with a 37.3 per cent stake.\n\nTelia said on Friday that its \"processes for conducting some transactions have not been in line with sound business \npractices.\" The company will continue its Eurasia review which is being conducted by law firm Norton Rose \nFulbright.\n\n\"Together with the board I have come to the conclusion that the way some transactions in the past were managed \ndoes not live up to the high standards of business ethics and transparency that TeliaSonera wants to stand for,\" \nsaid Johan Dennelind, Telia chief executive.\n\n\"Going forward we need strong leadership on all levels to create a sound culture,\" Mr Dennelind added.\n\nThe corruption claims surfaced after a TV investigation accused TeliaSonera of paying money to an alleged close \nfriend of Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbekistan's authoritarian president.\n\nThe Mannheimer review said that when Telia was setting up in 2007 in Uzbekistan the telecoms operator intended \nto \"enter into an agreement with Gulnara Karimova's investment team as the local partner\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

His refusal came despite appeals from the 28 EU heads of \ngovernment and European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso.\n\nSeveral thousand protesters, meanwhile, continued to demonstrate in central Kiev calling for Mr Yanukovich to sign \nthe deal. Protest leaders claimed Ukrainian authorities were bringing groups of pro-government youths into the \ncapital, expressing fears they could stage provocations against the protesters, with demonstrations expected to \nswell later on Friday.\n\nAt a summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius EU leaders insisted the way remained open for Ukraine to sign the \ndeal. But it appeared even a mooted joint declaration that Kiev would reopen talks with the aim of signing a deal at \na summit in the Ukrainian capital in March would not be signed.\n\nFrench president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande told reporters \"the partnership remains open, but it is up to the Ukrainians first \nto want it.\" He said the EU was not prepared to \"pay\" Ukraine to sign the deal, by offering more financial support \nthan Brussels had already pledged.\n\nVideo footage released by Lithuania, holder of the EU presidency, showed an uncomfortable-looking Mr \nYanukovich meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel and Mr Barroso on Thursday night.\n\nMs Merkel can be heard telling Mr Yanukovich in English, \"Nice to see you here. But we expected more.\"\n\nMr Yanukovich is heard replying: \"The economic situation in our country is very complicated . . . we had very big \nthreats.\"\n\n\"I wanted you to listen to me. I've been alone for three and a half years,\" the Ukrainian president continues. \"In very \nunequal conditions, with a very strong Russia, I was one on one.\"\n\nBut EU officials on the margins of the Vilnius meeting began shifting blame for the failure to sign Ukraine agreement \nfrom Russia and on to Mr Yanukovich himself, saying the president had been too intent on playing Moscow off \nagainst Brussels.\n\n\"I think he didn't really want to sign with either\" the EU or Russia, one senior EU politician said. \"He just wanted free \nmoney.\"\n\nThe summit salvaged some success for its \"Eastern Partnership\" programme, designed to export democratic values \ninto ex-Soviet republics, with Moldova and Georgia initialling agreements with the EU. Initialling texts is the final \nstage before signing, expected to happen next year.\n\nMr Yanukovich watched the signing ceremony with the Moldovan and Georgian leaders from the end of the second \nrow, where he sat next to the foreign minister of autocratic neighbour Belarus - which has played little part in the \nEastern Partnership process.\n\nThe summit came eight days after Ukraine's government surprised the EU by suspending preparations to sign the \ndeal, and said it would reopen talks on deepening relations with Russia.\n\nThe move followed months of pressure from Moscow, including bans on a range of Russian goods and disruptions \nto cross-border trade, as well as two closed-door meetings this month between Mr Yanukovich and Russian \npresident Vladimir Putin.\n\nAn adviser to the Ukrainian president, however, insisted it was still possible to sign the EU deal in March. He said \nhe hoped a working group could sort out \"all contradictory questions\" with Brussels.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Why would a country want one? And why \nare Japan and the US - who both have ADIZs of their own - so set against China's?\n\nWhat is an air defence identification zone?\n\nA zone that provides an early warning system to help a country detect possible incursions into its sovereign \nairspace. It stretches beyond the boundary of a country's national airspace. When an aircraft enters an ADIZ \nwithout warning, the country in question may scramble fighter jets to visually identify the aircraft and determine \nwhether it poses a threat.\n\nThe US and Soviet Union relied on ADIZs during the Cold War to ensure they were not surprised by sudden \nincursions into their national airspaces.\n\nWhich countries have ADIZs?\n\nMany countries have ADIZs, including the US, Canada, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nHow do you create an ADIZ?\n\nADIZs are not binding legal agreements covered by international treaties. Countries can create an ADIZ just by \nproviding its GPS co-ordinates. This is what China did on November 23 2013.\n\nCan a country legally shoot down an aircraft that enters its ADIZ without notification?\n\nNo. ADIZs are considered to be international airspace.\n\nHow does China's ADIZ differ from others?\n\nChina requires commercial aircraft flying through its air defence zone to provide advance warning even when their \nfinal destination is another country. In contrast, commercial aircraft flying through the US ADIZ are only required to \nprovide advance flight details when they are destined to land in the US.\n\nDo different countries ADIZs overlap?\n\nThey can. The new Chinese zone overlaps with both the Japanese and South Korean zones.\n\nSome countries have had ADIZs for decades. Why did China wait until now?\n\nWe are not sure. One theory is that China felt it needed an ADIZ for the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands because Japan \nwas publicising Chinese incursions into its ADIZ in an effort to rally public opinion.\n\nWhich commercial airlines are complying with the new Chinese restrictions?\n\nCathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Taiwanese airlines have acknowledged complying.\n\nAre any commercial airlines refusing to comply?\n\nYes. Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways originally complied, but reversed course following pressure from the \nJapanese government. Korean Airlines and Asiana Airlines are reporting their flight plans to China only when they \nfly through Chinese airspace, not when they fly though the country's ADIZ.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani and Jennifer Thompson in Tokyo, Simon Mundy in Seoul and Sarah \nMishkin in Taipei\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Excluding both fresh food and \nenergy, it reached 0.3 per cent, the highest reading since 1998, indicating that rising energy costs alone were not \nthe sole factor in inflationary pressure.\n\nThe figures will be a fillip to Shinzo Abe, prime minister, and the Bank of Japan, suggesting the country is on track \nto hit the 2 per cent inflation target set almost a year ago and that monetary easing efforts are beginning to bear \nfruit. Separately industrial output also increased in October - by 0.5 per cent - for a second straight month.\n\nSince returning to power last December, Mr Abe has gone all out to overturn more than a decade of deflation \nthrough the \"three arrows\" of aggressive monetary easing, extra doses of fiscal stimulus and a host of measures to \nboost Japan's competitiveness.\n\nAfter the BoJ left its policy framework unchanged at a regular policy meeting last week, Haruhiko Kuroda, governor, \nsaid \"we are making steady progress on the path to realising our goal\".\n\nThe bank has bought trillions of yen of government bonds from banks and other big holders, seeking to push them \ninto riskier instruments such as loans, stocks and foreign assets.\n\nSo far, prices have been rising in line with the BoJ's forecasts, thanks largely to the steep fall in the yen since the \nend of 2012, which has pushed up the cost of fuel and other imports.\n\nThe headline CPI figure of 0.9 per cent was a reconfirmation that Japan was starting to put deflation behind it, said \nJunko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS in Tokyo.\n\n\"All in all, CPI data are developing fully in line with BoJ's view,\" she added.\n\nJapan's Government Pension Investment Fund announced on Friday that its assets had reached a record high of \nY124trn at the end of September, the rise of 2.4 per cent over the preceding quarter being spurred in part by the \nstock market rally unleashed by Abenomics. The world's largest pool of retirement savings has been encouraged to \nreduce its emphasis on domestic bonds to improve returns.\n\nBut many fear that the way ahead may be more difficult, as the effects of a weaker yen wear off.\n\nThree of the nine board members at the BoJ have expressed doubts that the target can be reached by the latter \nhalf of the 2015 fiscal year. Two of them - Takehiro Sato and Takahide Kiuchi, both former investment bank \neconomists - have raised particular concerns over the lack of basic wage increases, which they say are necessary \nto stoke a positive cycle of demand-based inflation.\n\nThe October CPI rise will increase expectations of wage rises after the annual round of negotiations between \nunions and employers are concluded next spring, so that workers' salaries keep pace. There is also pressure to \nraise salaries given an increase in Japan's consumption tax from 5 to 8 per cent next April.\n\nSayuri Shirai, another board member who objected to parts of the BoJ's growth and inflation forecasts in October, \nsays she is concerned about the risk of dips in the economy caused by continuing weakness overseas, as well as \nflat household incomes.\n\nKiichi Murashima, chief economist at Citi in Tokyo, said: \"If, as we anticipate, wages do not pick up in a meaningful \nmanner and the negative impact from the consumption tax increase is larger than policy makers currently expect, it \nshould be difficult for longer-term inflation expectations to rise substantially.\"\n\n\n\nNomura Holdings said on Friday it would increase the base wages of up to 4,000 of its lowest paid employees, \nwhich represents around a third of its Japanese workforce, by 2 per cent in April.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

That was dinner.\n\nTo grasp how daily life in most western countries has improved in recent decades, food is the perfect case study. \nTrue, we have all got fatter. True, we eat too much processed stuff. True, with food prices rising and incomes falling \nsince 2007, poor people can barely afford enough to eat. And yet for most westerners, tastier food now provides \neveryday happiness to a degree unimaginable when I was growing up.\n\nBack then, most Europeans and north Americans ate bland food daily. Going to a restaurant was a rare treat. There \nwas little ethnic food around - certainly no sushi in the supermarket. A friend of mine raised in a small Dutch town in \nthe 1970s recalls that whereas all their neighbours ate meat and potatoes every evening, his family were \nconsidered snobs because they ate meat and rice.\n\nA few mothers and grandmothers produced wonderful home cooking, the stuff of nostalgia today. But most northern \nEuropean children grew up regarding meals as something to endure. To quote the hysterical English schoolmaster \nin Pink Floyd's album The Wall (1979): \"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have \nany pudding if you don't eat yer meat?\"\n\nIn those postwar decades, attitudes to most goods were utilitarian: nobody needed sensory pleasures. A woman \nfrom Gillingham, in Kent, told me that her childhood was made less happy by the ugly surroundings. Tedious eating \nhad the same effect.\n\nFood was possibly even dourer in communist Europe. The summer after the Berlin Wall fell, I lodged with a family in \nan east German village. Every evening we had pork, potatoes and beer. It got boring within a week - let alone a \nlifetime.\n\nNo wonder East Germans craved the exotic. In 1966 Rolf Ansch\u00fctz, a restaurateur in a small Thuringian town who \nhad never been to Japan, began serving Japanese food. (You'd have thought that East Germany lagged in exotic \ncuisine, but in fact London in 1966 had zero Japanese or Thai restaurants.) By 1989, when the Wall fell, several \nhundred thousand East Germans had eaten Ansch\u00fctz's Japanese meals.\n\nThe fall of the Wall accelerated globalisation, and globalisation tends to improve cooking. Our food has kept getting \nmore exotic. The number of Indian restaurants in Britain, for instance, has gone from 1,200 in 1970 to about 9,000 \ntoday. (Indian food, incidentally, epitomises globalisation: chilli reached India from Portugal, tandoori from west \nAsia, and curry powder, bizarrely, from England, writes Amartya Sen.) Gradually, more westerners came to regard \nfood as more than just fuel. On April 14 1999, Jamie Oliver presented his first cookery show on BBC television. A \nnew generation of \"foodies\" was born.\n\nThe word conjures up images of bearded Brooklynites queueing at food trucks. The \"food renaissance\" is indeed \nlinked to class, and therefore encourages status displays: the fastest-growing demographic category from Britain to \nChina today is \"cheese bores\".\n\nHowever, tastier eating isn't only an elite phenomenon. Enjoying food doesn't have to mean buying \u00a325 chickens or \nboring on about Amazonian vegetables. Great masses of people now watch cookery shows on TV. They don't all \nthen cook the dishes but they must be influenced. Often they consume the foods in simplified or snack forms: in \ncoffee shops, or as ready-made supermarket meals. There's even a \"fresh fast food\" phenomenon. Recent TV \ncommercials for Taco Bell in the US, for instance, feature the celebrity chef Lorena Garcia rhapsodising about \n\n\n\n\"beautiful ingredients\" while preparing a \"burrito bowl\" in her kitchen. This sort of thing is easy to mock, but these \nfoods are probably tastier than, say, the Wonder Bread that used to be an American staple.\n\nImmigration is bringing good ethnic foods even to poorer neighbourhoods. And until the current spike in prices, food \nhad been getting cheaper for decades. Americans on average now spend just a tenth of their disposable income on \nfood, says the US Department of Agriculture. That is around the lowest level in human history. Most westerners can \nnow afford to think about food as a source of everyday happiness.\n\nI live in Paris, where this attitude has been taken for granted for centuries. Every lunchtime I toddle to one of \ndozens of restaurants around my work flat, and sit down alone to a two-course meal. Often it's the highlight of my \nday. Once, over dinner with expat friends, we debated the question: would we stay in Paris if the food was bad? \nNah, we concluded. I may never leave this city, so the quest for happiness through food has shaped my life.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nsimon.kuper@ft.com; Twitter @KuperSimon\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Loubet, who also runs an eponymous \nbistro at the Zetter Townhouse hotel, uses veg with style, as seen in this pumpkin prize-piece.\n\nRoast pumpkin with mulled wine sauce\n\nServes 6 people\n\n1 pumpkin\n\n6 parsnips\n\n6 carrots\n\n500g Jerusalem artichokes\n\n6 potatoes\n\n1 celeriac\n\n4 red onions\n\n4 red beetroots\n\n500g soft goat's cheese\n\n8 cloves garlic\n\n1 tbs pickled rosemary\n\n5 sprigs thyme\n\n6 sage leaves\n\n100ml olive oil\n\nmailto:simon.kuper@ft.com\n\n\nMulled wine sauce\n\n350g fruit chutney\n\n750ml red wine\n\n\u00bc orange zest\n\n\u00bc cinnamon stick\n\n2 cloves\n\n1 tbsp sliced ginger\n\n5 crushed cardamom pods\n\n1 fresh bay leaf (2 if dried)\n\n8 black peppercorns\n\n1 bag English Breakfast tea\n\nSherry vinegar to taste\n\nMaple syrup to taste\n\nFor the mulled wine sauce\n\n- Place the wine, tea bag, orange zest and spices in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, lower the heat to a light simmer \nand reduce the liquid by half; take off the heat and cover with a lid to infuse. When the liquid is tepid, pass through a \nfine sieve and discard the tea bag and spices; add the chutney and bring to the boil. Once boiled, add sherry \nvinegar and maple syrup to taste. Set aside to cool.\n\nFor the stuffed and roast pumpkin\n\n- Preheat oven to 180C. Cut all the vegetables (except the pumpkin) into large chunks. Cut a lid from the top of the \npumpkin, scoop out the seeds in the middle and discard. With a strong metal spoon, scrape out the pumpkin flesh \ninto a bowl, making sure to leave a layer (about 1.5cm). It is important not to scrape right back to the skin. Place the \npumpkin with its lid off and its lid (separate from each other) in the oven for 20 minutes, then remove and keep \naside.\n\n- Place the carrots, artichoke, parsnips, celeriac, potatoes, red onions and beetroot in a roasting tray, toss with olive \noil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for about 20 minutes (until a nice golden colour), \nthen add the pumpkin flesh, crushed garlic, rosemary, thyme and sage. Cook for another 20 minutes. Drain the \nvegetables, place on a clean kitchen towel and pat dry. Layer the vegetables and crumbled goat's cheese inside the \npumpkin. Place the pumpkin and the lid (again, separately) in the oven for a further 10-15 minutes.\n\n- Serve with the lid on the pumpkin and the rich mulled wine sauce on the side.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTOM KERRIDGE\n\nTom Kerridge's 2013, featuring a successful BBC television series, has been a \"huge year\" for the chef at the Hand \n& Flowers pub in Marlow. \"Pub\" is a loose term here; Kerridge's menu has two Michelin stars and is all about \nbeautiful English ingredients - roast quail, venison, crispy pig's head - in a relaxed setting. Christmas for Kerridge \ngrowing up meant \"turkey roll, cheap port and rubbish movies\". This year his mother-in-law will be doing the \nhonours but Kerridge \"will help out - I love cooking\".\n\n\n\nSlow roast venison haunch with shallots, cranberries and chestnuts\n\nServes 6 people\n\n2-2\u00bdkg venison haunch from the top end (bone in)\n\n12 banana shallots, peeled but whole\n\n100g dried cranberries\n\n150g vac-pack chestnuts, crumbled\n\n300ml red wine\n\n50g redcurrant jelly\n\n750ml dark chicken/beef stock\n\n2 tsp dried sage\n\n200g bacon lardons\n\n400g brussel sprout tops (washed)\n\nVegetable oil for cooking\n\nVenison rub\n\n2 tsp juniper\n\n8 cloves\n\n1 tbs cracked black pepper\n\n2 tbs flaky sea salt\n\n1 tbs cumin seeds\n\n2 tbs thyme leaves\n\nThis fantastic slow-cooked dish is perfect for this time of year - a great Christmas alternative.\n\n- Lightly score the venison haunch with a sharp knife. In a pestle and mortar or spice grinder blend together the \nvenison rub ingredients. Rub them all into the haunch and leave it to sit for 1-2 hours to take on the flavours.\n\n- In a large casserole pan, heat a layer of vegetable oil and cook the bacon lardons until crispy and brown.\n\n- Add the shallots and cook until they start to brown. Add the dried sage and stir. Put in the redcurrant jelly, red wine \nand the stock. Bring to the boil and then place the venison on top. Turn the heat off and place a lid on the top or \ncover with tin foil. Place in a preheated oven at 150C for 2 hours. After 2 hours, remove from the oven and take off \nthe lid. Check the stock level to make sure it is not burnt, and add a little more if needed.\n\n- Place back into the oven for a further 1\u00bd-2 hours, until the venison is cooked, tender and can be flaked from the \nbone. Leave to rest for half an hour.\n\n- Gently lift the venison from the shallots and stock and place on the serving plate or board. Place the pan on the \nhob and heat up. Add the flaked chestnuts and dried cranberries. Stir and season. Then add the brussel sprout tops \nand stir until wilted - about 1 minute. Serve with the venison and some roast potatoes. There should be enough \nstock and red wine to act as a gravy.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nKARAM SETHI\n\nFood is a family business for Karam Sethi: his sister Sunaina is sommelier, his brother Jyotin is business partner \nand together they have raised the game for contemporary Indian cooking in London, both at Trishna in Marylebone \nand at their new colonial-style Mayfair restaurant, the excellent Gymkhana. Its menu is a novel curry paradise - \npepper partridge, spiced pig cheek vindaloo - and here Sethi's turkey biryani, aromatic trimmings and mince pie \nsamosas should make for a perfectly spicy Christmas supper.\n\nTurkey biryani with potatoes, spinach and root veg\n\nServes 4 people\n\n750g skinless and boneless turkey, cut into dice (approximately 4cm)\n\n500g long-grain basmati rice\n\n250g onions blended to a paste in a food processor\n\nGround seeds of 2 black cardamoms\n\n85ml ghee mixed with oil\n\n2 tbsp ginger paste (50g ginger with 1 tbs water)\n\n1 tbsp whole black peppercorns\n\n\u00bd tbsp cumin seeds\n\n7 cloves\n\n\u00bd g (small pinch) saffron threads\n\n1l whisked yoghurt\n\n125ml milk\n\n284ml water\n\nSalt, fresh coriander, mint andcrispy fried onions, to taste\n\nDried rose petals, for garnish\n\nAtta bread (for sealing the pan, optional)\n\n250g dry atta (chapatti flour or whole-wheat flour)\n\n125ml water\n\n1-2 tbs oil (optional)\n\n- This dish can be made using atta dough to seal the pan. To make the atta dough, combine the flour, water and oil, \nthen knead together.\n\n- Place the skinless, boneless turkey in a large bowl or tray. Rub on the saffron and onion paste and leave to \nmarinate at room temperature for 2 hours (24 hours if you can). During this time, dry roast the black pepper, cumin \nand cloves separately in a hot pan. Allow the spices to cool and then grind in a pestle and mortar.\n\n\n\n- Once the spices are cool, add half the whisked yoghurt and ground black cardamom seeds. Then rub the mixture \ninto the turkey before placing it in a heavy-bottomed pan. In a separate pan, heat three-quarters of the ghee/oil \nmixture and, once warmed through, pour it over the turkey.\n\n- Wash the rice by running it through cold water to remove some of the starch [I use Amira's \"Superior\" rice]. Leave \nto soak for 20 minutes. Strain the rice and mix it with the remaining yoghurt, 284ml of water and two teaspoons of \nsalt, then add the rice to the turkey mixture.\n\n- Cover the pan with a tightfitting lid and seal the edges with the atta dough to stop any steam escaping. \nAlternatively you can cook your turkey in a pressure cooker. Cook over a high heat for 10 minutes, then reduce the \nheat to low for approximately half an hour. Uncover the dish and pour over the remaining ghee/oil mixture before \nsprinkling the milk on to the rice.\n\n- Cover the turkey once again and cook for a further 15 minutes or until the meat is tender and the rice grains have \nseparated. Before serving, garnish with dried rose petals, crispy onions, chopped fresh coriander and mint.\n\nRoast potatoes with cumin, ginger and coriander\n\n1kg potatoes\n\n1 tbs cumin seeds\n\n1 tbs cumin powder\n\n1 tbs fresh grated ginger\n\n1 green chilli\n\nSalt to taste\n\n30g fresh coriander\n\n1l water\n\n- Preheat oven to 180C. Bring the water to a rolling boil and add the washed potatoes. Boil for about 20 minutes, \nuntil the potatoes are soft. Drain and place in a roasting tray. Add the cumin seeds, cumin powder, ginger, diced \ngreen chilli and salt to taste. Roast for approximately 45 minutes, until golden brown. Toss with fresh coriander.\n\nCreamed spinach\n\n4 bunches spinach\n\n1 tbsp cumin seeds\n\n1 tbsp oil\n\n1 green chilli, finely chopped\n\n\u00bd medium onion\n\n1 clove garlic\n\nSalt to taste\n\n\u00bd cup cream\n\n- In a pan, temper cumin seeds in oil, then add chopped green chilli, chopped onion and garlic. Cook until softened.\n\n\n\n- Boil the baby spinach until soft, then strain it and pur\u00e9e in a blender. Remove from the blender and add to the pan \nof cumin, chilli, onion and garlic. Continue to cook for five minutes, then add the cream and season with salt.\n\nMashed root vegetables\n\n1kg beets, parsnips, squash, celeriac\n\n1 tbs oil\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n1 tbs mustard seeds\n\n2 curry leaves\n\n1 tsp asafoetida\n\n1 red chilli\n\n5 shallots\n\n1 tbs fresh grated ginger\n\n1 tbs butter\n\nFew sprigs coriander\n\n- Heat the oven to 180C. In a tray, roast beets, parsnips, squash and celeriac in the oven with oil, salt and pepper \nuntil tender. Then strain and mash very coarsely.\n\n- In a pan, temper mustard seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida and whole red chilli in oil. Add diced shallots and ginger, \nand soften. Pour this mixture on to the veg and mix in. Finish with a dollop of butter and roughly chopped coriander \nincluding the stems.\n\nMince pie samosa\n\nThe filling\n\n200g mince pie mix\n\n100g chenna curd cheese\n\n50g roasted almond flakes\n\nPinch cardamom\n\nThe pastry\n\n500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting\n\n1 tbs sunflower oil\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n500ml water\n\nA little melted butter\n\n\n\n- Place flour, oil and salt in a bowl and make a well in the centre of the mixture. Add water slowly and knead dough \nuntil smooth, then make eight dough balls, about 5cm in diameter. Cover with a cloth and leave to rest for 10 \nminutes.\n\n- In the meantime, preheat oven to 180C. Mix together the mince pie mixture, chenna, roasted almond flakes and \ncardamom.\n\n- Once the pastry balls have rested, roll each one out on a lightly floured surface to a circle shape, about 10cm \nthick. Cut into quarters and layer the quarters on top of each other. Make sure to dust each layer lightly with flour so \nthat they do not stick together.\n\n- Add a spoonful of the mince pie mixture to the centre of the pastry quarters and brush the edges with melted \nbutter. Then layer another pastry quarter on top and seal edges of pastry together. Cook until golden brown.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSARIT PACKER\n\nThere is nobody we'd entrust our sweet-tooth cravings to more than the woman who used to be head pastry chef \nfor Yotam Ottolenghi.

You can, of course, use a bought sponge, but \nthis is so easy that there is no reason to be lazy - it is literally a two-step cake.\n\n- Line the base of a shallow rectangular baking tin (approximately 400cm x 20cm) with greaseproof paper. Preheat \nyour oven to 180C.\n\n- Mix all the dry ingredients together and pour them over all the wet ingredients. Mix to combine and tip into the \nlined tin. Smooth down and sprinkle the demerara sugar over the top - it will bake into a great crunchy crust. Place \nin the oven for 25-30 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack. Once cooled, cut in half and use one half to line the \n\n\n\nbase of your serving bowl. The other half I like to cut into dice and lay on a tray to dry a little, then use to garnish the \ntop of the trifle.\n\nQuince and jelly\n\n3 large quinces\n\n1 cinnamon stick\n\n3 cardamom pods, slightly crushed\n\n1l water\n\n500g sugar\n\nJuice of 2 lemons\n\n6 gelatin leaves (or use producer's guidelines to set 750ml liquid)\n\n3 tbsp sweet Muscat wine\n\nI like to leave the skin on the fruit as it has loads of flavour and helps it keep the shape. The cooking liquid will \nbecome the jelly - I like to add the sweet Muscat wine but it is up to you.\n\n- Combine the water, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon and cardamom in a large pan.\n\n- Cut the quince into wedges - 8-10 from each fruit, then with a sharp knife remove the core. Place all the wedges in \nthe water and bring to a boil on a medium-low heat. Once it has reached boiling point, reduce the heat to low and \ncook for 15 minutes. Soak the gelatin leaves in 200ml cold water. Very carefully, using a ladle, remove 500ml of the \nquince cooking liquid to a jug, then add the water and soaking gelatin to the hot liquid and stir till combined. Set \naside. Leave the remaining quince and liquid to cook for a further 30 minutes until the quince is fully cooked and the \ncolour has deepened to a warm orange.\n\nCardamom cream\n\n400g milk\n\n6 cardamom pods, crushed\n\n100g sugar\n\n4 egg yolks\n\n50g plain flour\n\n\u00bd tsp ground ginger\n\nYou can, of course, buy a ready-made custard and use that to top the trifle, but try to go to the extra effort and \nmake this pastry cream yourself. I use cardamom instead of the more traditional vanilla, as I think it works \namazingly well with the flavour of quince and honey.\n\n- In a small pan, combine the milk, sugar and cardamom and heat slowly. Once it has almost come to a boil, turn \nthe heat off and wait for 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. In the meantime, mix the egg yolks with the flour \nto make a thick paste, and add the ginger. Reheat the cream and, using a small tea strainer, remove the cardamom \npods, mix a ladleful of the milk into the egg mix and return to the pan. Set the pan on the stove and, while stirring \nconstantly, thicken the custard mix. Once it is thick, remove from the pan to a bowl, cover with cling film and allow \nto cool in the fridge.\n\n\n\nTo assemble the trifle\n\n2 tbsp sweet Muscat wine (optional)\n\n200ml double/whipping cream\n\n75g roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped\n\n1 tbsp honey\n\nPinch sea salt\n\n- Douse the sponge you have set in the serving bowl with the sweet wine, if you are using it. Lift the quince wedges \nout of their now thick syrup and layer them over the sponge. (You can reserve 3-4 wedges to use as a garnish \nlater). Pour over the mixed jelly and set in the fridge - it will take 3-4 hours to set fully.\n\n- In the meantime, whip the cream and fold it into the custard base until you achieve a silky-smooth mixture that \nholds in peaks. Set in the fridge. Mix the roasted hazelnuts with the honey and the salt.\n\n- Once the jelly has set, scoop large dollops of the cardamom cream and spread it all over the top, garnishing with \nthe hazelnuts, the cubed sponge pieces and the retained quince wedges cut into small dice.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The air is scented with spice, a drift of nutmeg and mace coiling enticingly through the front \nroom. Set on the dining table are festive treats, all \"traditional\" but with the historical twist that gives Boermans' \nbaking its fascinating character.\n\nHere are pretty little shortbreads, not plain but dotted with orange peel. Here is gingerbread, not cakey but \ncracklingly fragile and bittered with treacle. Here are Chelsea buns but entirely without the crowds of currants we've \ncome to associate with that treat. It's shocking. They look naked. But turn to Boermans' new book, Great British \nBakes, and you will discover why - for she has traced the true 18th-century origins of the \"Royal Chelsea bun\" with \na diligence that would put many a historian to shame.\n\nBoermans - who played rugby for Wales in the late 1980s, and who has travelled the world in the course of her \nteaching career - is perhaps the most wonderfully unlikely contestant The Great British Bake Off has seen: and \nlucky for us. Let's face it: the programme is kitsch, pure and simple, and so it's a wonder to discover that an \namateur who got her professional start there - she was a runner-up in 2011 - has produced a book that's as \nfascinating to read as it is to bake from. Its recipes are drawn not only from her collection of hundreds of second-\nhand, antique cookbooks but also from the Wellcome Library - which, being a medical library, keeps recipe books \nbecause they contain home remedies. But there's no reason you can't find a cheesecake in there, too. What \nBoermans has done is to choose her favourites and then modernise them both for our present-day kitchens (we \ntake it for granted that our ovens will run at a constant temperature - a fairly recent development) and for the fact \nthat we cook for ourselves rather than asking a kitchen maid to keep whisking a batter for eight hours solid. (Thank \nheavens for the Kenwood.)\n\nAnd so where better to come than Boermans' neat galley kitchen to find a version of a Christmas cake that will bring \nus back to the essence of British baking? For that's what she was after. When her daughter, now eight, was born, \nshe says, \"I wanted her to taste pure flavours. I know myself how delicious artificial flavours can be. When I was a \nchild a real treat was Angel Delight - because we had to have home-cooked meals! You didn't buy biscuits or cake - \n'boughten' stuff was looked down on. So it got me thinking: but which apple pie is the best apple pie - and who first \nthought of apple pie?\"\n\n\n\nIt was this that led her to start picking up second-hand cookery books in shops and on eBay. \"I began to think: it's \nwrong to dismiss 400 years of baking and cooking in general.\" And, she adds, \"It can be new if we haven't done it \nfor 200 years.\" In these old recipes, the newly trendy nostrums of eat fresh, eat local, eat nose-to-tail, be self-\nsufficient, were all right there, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nAs we chat, we make Wood Street Cake - a lightly yeasted fruitcake with a rosewater icing originating in the City of \nLondon. Wood Street is just between Cheapside and Cripplegate, and, in the 17th century, was famous for its \ncakes. So when, in 1648, Lady Anne Murray helped to smuggle the future King James II out of captivity and off to \nthe continent, she not only provided him with women's clothes as a disguise but also his favourite treat, a Wood \nStreet Cake. In her book, Boermans admires Lady Anne's devotion: \"I must admit that, were I to be intimately \ninvolved in the rescue of royalty in a time of civil unrest, the provision of snacks might be pretty low on my checklist \nof important tasks.\"\n\nWe can only be thankful that political calm has enabled Boermans to focus on such snacks. Having folded a mixture \nof dried fruit and currants into the dough, which is deliciously enriched by butter and cream, we need to give it an \nhour to rise - time enough to eat lunch, for which she has made little oval cheese and potato pies, their crusts made \nmeltingly delicate by cutting plain flour with a good dose of cornflour. Normally, such a pie wouldn't be what I'd \nchoose for my lunch: but these are straight-up fantastic. It doesn't surprise me when Boermans confesses a secret \nlove for savoury baking - here's to a follow-up volume, I say.\n\nHot water crusts for pork pies were something she'd never made until GBBO - an experience which, all in all, she \nloved. \"There was a lot of laughter in that tent, a lot of funny people. I'm really glad I met all of them, it was just a \nshame that one went every week.\" She is full of admiration for Mary Berry - \"At first I wanted to impress her; then I \ndidn't want to disappoint her.\" Paul Hollywood's name doesn't elicit the same admiration - not least because he \ncalled her everlasting syllabub -\"revolting\", which I rather agree is beyond the pale. She admits, however, that the \nkind of baking she's interested in was perhaps not the perfect fit for GBBO - their loss is our gain.\n\nAfter the cake has risen, we set it in a tin lined with parchment that rises above the springform walls so the fruit \ndoesn't scorch. Once out of the oven, the cake is iced hot - egg whites, confectioner's sugar and rose water, that's \nit. It's a perfect, simple Christmas cake, one that comes with the romance of history attached. We can be sure \nthere's more to come from Boermans. \"Think of the stories I haven't managed to find yet!\" she beams.\n\n'Great British Bakes: Forgotten Treasures for Modern Bakers' by Mary-Anne Boermans (Square Peg, \u00a320)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWood Street Cake (1675)\n\nThe cake itself is light and delicately spiced.\n\nThe high fruit content means that only a relatively small amount of sugar is needed and, like most of the fruited \ncakes of this era, it is iced hot. And so, without further ado, please enjoy a cake fit for a king.\n\nServes 10-12\n\nFor the cake\n\n600g plain flour\n\n2 sachets (14g) fast-action yeast\n\n112g caster sugar\n\n1 tsp ground mace\n\n\u00bd tsp ground cloves\n\n\n\n1 tsp ground nutmeg\n\n2 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n450g currants\n\n150g raisins\n\n150g butter\n\n200ml double cream\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n1 egg\n\n1-3 tbs rose water, to taste\n\nFor the icing\n\n2 egg whites\n\n1-2 tbs rose water, to taste\n\n225g icing sugar\n\nA 24cm springform cake tin\n\n- In a large bowl, mix together the flour, yeast, caster sugar, spices, currants and raisins.\n\n- Put the butter and cream into a saucepan over a low heat and warm gently until the butter is melted. Set aside to \ncool slightly.\n\n- In a separate bowl whisk the yolks and egg with the rose water, then continue to whisk while slowly adding the \ncooled cream mixture.\n\n- Stir the liquids into the dry ingredients. The texture should be rather wet and similar to a modern fruit cake mix - \ntoo wet to knead. When thoroughly mixed, cover and set aside to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.\n\n- Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and grease and line the base of the cake tin with baking parchment. \nLine the sides with a double layer of parchment and make sure it stands above the level of the tin itself by several \ncentimetres. This will help keep the top of the cake from scorching and also prevent the icing from colouring too \nmuch.\n\n- When the cake mix has risen, pour it into the prepared cake tin. Smooth the mixture but don't press down or you'll \nsquash out all the air bubbles. Bake for 45-50 minutes.\n\n- While the cake is baking, prepare the icing by whisking the egg white to soft peaks and then adding the rose \nwater. Gradually add the icing sugar and whisk to stiff peaks. Set aside.\n\n- When the cake is fully baked, remove it from the oven and, while it's still in the tin, spoon the icing over the top. \nReturn the iced cake to the oven and turn off the heat. Let the icing set for 15 minutes then remove the cake from \nthe oven and leave to cool in the tin.\n\n- When it's completely cold, remove the cake from the tin. Run a knife around the edge of the icing to loosen the \nbaking parchment and slowly peel away the paper.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHistory joys\n\nMary-Anne Boermans chooses three favourites from her collection of historical recipe books:\n\nGood Things in England by Florence White (1932).

That is a question which sparks heated political debate in Washington. \nLittle wonder. Earlier this year Barack Obama pledged to make immigration reform a central plank of his second \nterm as president.\n\nBut while that won him support among Hispanic voters, it infuriated many Republicans, particularly in the South. \nAnd with the unemployment rate remaining stubbornly high, the issue is doubly controversial due to a perception - \nor fear - that immigrants are stealing American jobs.\n\nLast week a curious new salvo was fired into this fiery debate from none other than the Dallas Federal Reserve. In \nrecent years, this institution has earned a reputation for being one of the more independent-minded parts of the \nFed: its president, Richard Fisher, has demanded policies to slash the size of banks, and its officials take a free-\nmarket, conservative view. (Indeed, as a sign of this Wild West heritage, it is the only western central bank I have \never seen where an official notice tells customers to put their guns aside before entering.)\n\nBut when it comes to immigration - of the legal and illegal kind - the Lone Star Fed is not sitting with the Tea Party \ncore. On the contrary, it has just published a paper - under the provocative title \"Gone to Texas\" - arguing that \nimmigration is good for the local economy. And it rebuffs the idea that immigrants are stealing jobs from native-\nborn Americans. On the contrary, it insists, they tend to boost growth in a win-win way.\n\nNow, if this conclusion had emerged in a state with few immigrants and plenty of unfilled jobs (think North Dakota), \nthat might be unsurprising. But the picture that Fed researchers paint of Texas is eye-popping. Since 1990, the \nnumber of foreign-born people living there has jumped from 1.5 million to 4.3 million, they say, noting that \"Texas \n[now] has more immigrants than Oklahoma and New Mexico have people\", and that \"among large states, none \nhas experienced a surge like Texas has, with immigrants rising from 9 per cent of the population in 1990 to 16.4 \nper cent in 2012\".\n\nSome immigrants are highly skilled, lured by the fast-growing energy sector, for example. But most are not: two-\nthirds do not have a high-school diploma, two-thirds come from Mexico, and almost half - or 1.8 million people - are \nillegal, according to the Fed's number crunchers. If you want to find a poster child for the vision of Mexicans \nflooding illegally across the border to work in American fields and factories, Texas is perfect.\n\nBut that has not hurt native-born Americans, the Fed insists. \"When immigrants flow into the labour force, it is not \njust a matter of adding more workers. As long as immigrants differ from natives - which they do to varying degrees \n- specialisation occurs,\" the report observes. Furthermore, \"Less-educated US natives have a comparative \nadvantage in communications-intensive jobs, and less-educated immigrants in manual-labour jobs.\" Or to put it \n\nhttp://www.thegingerpig.co.uk/\nhttp://www.freerangebirds.co.uk/\nhttp://www.hostingleyfarmfreerange.co.uk/\n\n\nanother way, Mexican tomato pickers do not compete with American receptionists (not least because almost half of \nthe immigrants in the study apparently have few or no English-language skills).\n\nWhat immigration does do is lower the price of \"immigrant-produced goods and services\", which equates to an \nincome gain of $3.4bn-$6.6bn a year, the study suggests. And while this needs to be offset against the rising strain \non public infrastructure and services, this is not such a big issue in bare-bones Texas, which has \"a skimpy safety \nnet and lower levels of publicly provided services than other large states\".\n\n. . .\n\nI daresay such conclusions will horrify many observers on both sides of the political divide. To Tea Party \nsupporters, it seems hard to believe that illegal immigrants do not displace American jobs; to leftwing economists, \nit seems even more abhorrent to think that businesses could be booming on the back of unprotected cheap labour. \nIn any case, as both left and rightwing economists might point out, Texas is something of an exceptional case: its \neconomy has been unusually fast growing in recent years, partly because of the energy boom, which has created \nplenty of new jobs - for immigrants and non-immigrants alike.\n\nWhen it comes to immigration, the state is also unusual in political terms in that the influx of newcomers has \noccurred under governors of both the Democrat (Ann Richards) and Republican persuasions (George W Bush and \nRick Perry). As president, Bush was also a strong advocate for immigration reform.\n\nIf nothing else, the results of the study are intriguing, particularly given that immigration reform will almost certainly \nrear its head in Congress soon, as Obama tries to define his legacy. The only pity is that the Dallas Fed paper did \nnot look at another curious and counter-intuitive recent development: namely, that in the past year it seems that the \nflow of those unskilled Mexicans north has slowed, if not stalled. And if that continues, it could twist the immigration \ndebate yet again - not just in the Lone Star state but in Washington too.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

For China, the president might prove a partner for a new infrastructure-for-\nresources deal of the sort that has spearheaded its thrust into Africa. For the multinational mining houses, Israeli \ntycoons and Russian oligarchs vying for Guinea's mineral wealth, he is regarded as everything from a dedicated \nreformer to an asset-grabber.\n\nIt is a heavy burden for a life-long opposition activist who until he narrowly won elections in 2010 - regarded by \nmany as both shambolic and Guinea's freest since independence from France in 1958 - had never held public \noffice.\n\nIn exile in France, he was sentenced to death in absentia by Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's repressive regime. Once home, \nafter twice failing to dislodge Lansana Cont\u00e9 at elections the long-ruling strongman was accused of stealing, he was \nthrown in jail. After two years of brutal rule by the military junta that took power on Cont\u00e9's death before giving way \nto civilians, Mr Cond\u00e9 took the helm of a country that was listing badly.\n\n\"It's not easy,\" Mr Cond\u00e9 told the Financial Times in an interview during a visit to Paris last week that included a \nmeeting with a fellow francophone socialist, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \"With 50 years of misrule, of corruption, \nbad habits have set in. But I think there is now truly the will to change things.\"\n\nCritics have suggested the old ways are creeping back. They point to what they say are sweetheart mining deals \nstruck by Guinea's new rulers, although most experts agree that nothing has emerged on the scale of the corruption \nthat went before.\n\nmailto:gillian.tett@ft.com\n\n\n\"Habits built up over 50 years are not changed in two or three days. But time is also against us,\" says the president, \nwhose energy, his aides say, belies his years. \"People are impatient. They want to see something concrete.\"\n\nA pariah state for half a century, Guinea endures some of the world's grimmest living standards. Of every 100 \nchildren born, 13 die before the age of five, twice as many as in Myanmar. Yet in terms of heavyweight foreign \ninterlopers per head, the nation of 11m people ranks highly.\n\nMr Cond\u00e9 counts among his advisers Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, whose governance initiative is \ntasked with improving Guinea's threadbare bureaucracy, and George Soros, the hedge fund billionaire. Mr Soros \nhas been instrumental in making Guinea what Mr Cond\u00e9 acknowledges is a \"laboratory\" for a global campaign, led \nby the US and EU, to open up the oil and mining industries to greater scrutiny.\n\nUnder Mr Cond\u00e9, the government has published mining contracts, overhauled the mining code and is nearing the \ncompletion of a review of deals signed under past dictatorships.\n\nThe contract review has made the president enemies, notably Beny Steinmetz, the Israeli diamond tycoon. BSG \nResources, the mining arm of the Steinmetz family conglomerate, has responded to allegations that it paid bribes to \nofficials in previous regimes to win rights to a $5bn iron ore deposit by claiming that Mr Cond\u00e9's \"illegitimate \ngovernment\" is seeking to expropriate its assets.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Mr Cond\u00e9 steers clear of discussing his clash with Mr Steinmetz. Instead, he declares a target to bring in \n$30bn-$40bn in mining investment over the next five years - about five times Guinea's annual gross domestic \nproduct.\n\nIt looks an ambitious goal, given that many in the industry believe that big miners such as Brazil's Vale and Anglo-\nAustralian Rio Tinto are more inclined to plant flags in choice deposits than to bring them into swift production.\n\nYet Guinea is already Africa's biggest producer of bauxite, the ore used to make aluminium, despite an often \nfraught relationship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska's UC Rusal, one of the sector's biggest investors. Abu \nDhabi and Dubai this week agreed to invest $5bn in Guinean bauxite mining and refining.\n\nWhile Mr Cond\u00e9 is keen to welcome investors from overseas - including Chinese state-owned groups, seen as the \nmost likely to find the billions required for rail and port infrastructure to tap Guinea's iron ore - he bristles at what he \nsees as foreign meddling in domestic politics.\n\nDonors' fiscal conditions imposed as part of a debt-relief deal frustrated his plans to invest in Guinea's crumbling \ninfrastructure, the president says.\n\nAsked about the \"breaches and irregularities\" reported by foreign observers including the EU, UN and west African \nbloc in September's legislative elections, Mr Cond\u00e9 says: \"There was a great deal of interference by the European \nUnion. Elections should be a symbol of a country's sovereignty.\" He adds that the results, which were approved this \nmonth by Guinea's supreme court and left his party short of an absolute majority, give the opposition a larger \npresence in the national assembly than in other recent African polls.\n\nFaultlines remain. Violent clashes during the election campaign were a sign that Guinean politics still runs on ethnic \nlines. Responding to reports that mercenaries, no strangers to west Africa, have been conducting covert recruitment \nmissions for an anti-government mission to Guinea, Mr Cond\u00e9 says: \"With the reform of the army that we are in the \nmiddle of doing, all the attempts at destabilisation - which are real - don't worry me because we can cope with \nthem.\"\n\n\n\nThe difficulty of bringing to heel an army that slaughtered 156 opposition demonstrators in the national stadium in \n2009 was underscored in July when Mr Cond\u00e9 survived an assassination attempt seemingly linked to the military.\n\nThe president believes he faces \"a coalition of interests against us who do not want to see reforms\", especially in \nmining. But he pledges to press on. \"That exposes me to a great deal of risk, politically and personally,\" he says. \n\"But in life you have to take risks.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Although the detail was never revealed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, one \nof the force's most celebrated gun and drug seizures of recent years began as an investigation into Chinese \ncounterfeit factories.\n\nThe FT has also learned that a Hong Kong private investigator who assisted in the hunt for Meehan remains in a \nChinese prison, after initial efforts by the PSNI to secure his release failed.\n\nThe plight of Danny Tsang Chi-fai, 53, highlights the dangerous work done in China by private investigators, many \nof them with UK links. Mr Tsang, a 20-year veteran of the Royal Hong Kong Police force, entered the investigations \nindustry shortly after the former UK colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.\n\nIn July 2013, Peter Humphrey, a private investigator and UK citizen, was detained by police in Shanghai. On the \neve of a long-delayed visit to China by David Cameron, UK prime minister, Mr Humphrey and his wife, a naturalised \nUS citizen, remain in custody without charge.\n\nAccording to documents seen by the Financial Times, the 2008 PSNI investigation was code-named \"Eclat\" and \ncracked a criminal enterprise that dealt in counterfeit cigarettes, weapons and narcotics. The PSNI were helped by \nMr Tsang, who is now serving a 10-year prison sentence in southern China after an apparent mix-up with local \npolice.\n\nThe China connection highlights the global reach of cigarette-smuggling rackets. Customs officials say one in seven \ncigarettes smoked in Ireland - and one in 10 in the UK - are illicit, costing the two countries EUR2.5bn in lost taxes \nin 2011. The EU estimates that the illegal tobacco trade costs the bloc EUR10bn a year.\n\nThe counterfeit cigarettes Meehan imported came from Fujian province in southern China. As Operation Eclat \nunfolded, Mr Tsang was working for a small Hong Kong investigation firm that took on contract assignments from \nlarge multinational companies such as Japan Tobacco International.\n\nWhen Meehan visited southern China in 2007, JTI executives informed the PSNI which then set up Operation Eclat. \n\"My father did many private investigations in China and Thailand,\" Mr Tsang's son Pakko told the FT. \"He often \nworked undercover, approaching the bad guys as a buyer so he could find out where their counterfeit factories \nwere. Sometimes he would take a bag with a hidden camera.\"\n\n\n\nFor Operation Eclat, Mr Tsang posed as the head of a Chinese counterfeit cigarette factory while an undercover UK \nofficer acted as middleman. The PSNI was thus able to fool Meehan, who thought he was dealing with a real \ncounterfeit cigarette ring.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Meehan and his associates were caught in a trilateral sting by UK, Irish and Dutch \nauthorities that led to the seizure of more than 250 handguns, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, three hand grenades, \n14kg of heroin and 5kg of cannabis.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Meehan was carrying more than EUR146,000 in cash, with which he had intended to \npurchase counterfeit cigarettes. He later pleaded guilty to ten counts including conspiracy to possess weapons and \ndrugs and evade duty on imported cigarettes. When the Crown Court in Northern Ireland handed Meehan a 21-year \nprison sentence in June 2010, Mr Justice Stephens found that he had \"played a significant and integral role in \ndealing at the highest scale of organised criminals\".\n\nBack in China, however, Operation Eclat had gone badly wrong for Mr Tsang. Chinese police had seized a \nshipment of counterfeit cigarettes bound for Northern Ireland as part of Operation Eclat and arrested Mr Tsang. \"For \na long time we didn't know why my father had been arrested. He just disappeared,\" said Pakko.\n\nThe PSNI initially tried to help Mr Tsang, according to emails seen by the FT. Between January and July 2009, \nPSNI officers repeatedly told JTI executives that they had lobbied on his behalf. \"[M]eetings have been arranged in \nLondon next Thurs[day] at the Chinese Embassy and at the UK Home office,\" one officer wrote. \"We will again \nmake the case for Danny and confirm to the Chinese that they can travel to the UK to interview Meehan. We hope \nthat this will persuade the Chinese to again reconsider Danny's detention.\"\n\nIt is not clear what efforts, if any, PSNI made on Mr Tsang's behalf after that. \"Criminal proceedings as a result of \nOperation Eclat have concluded in Northern Ireland,\" the PSNI told the FT earlier this week. \"The Police Service of \nNorthern Ireland does not comment on named individuals.\"\n\nThe Home Office declined to comment, saying that questions should be directed to the PSNI. The Chinese \nembassy in London did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to the FT, JTI confirmed that Mr Tsang was identified as someone who could help the PSNI on \nOperation Eclat.\n\n\"PSNI undertook to inform the Chinese authorities [about Operation Eclat] . . . and to secure Chinese approval,\" JTI \nadded. \"We simply do not know what, if anything, transpired between the authorities of Northern Ireland and China \nthat would have led to [Mr Tsang's] arrest.\"\n\nIn December 2010, six months after Meehan's conviction in Belfast, the Zhangzhou Intermediate People's Court in \nFujian sentenced Mr Tsang to ten years in prison for offences related to counterfeit cigarettes. The Chinese court \nrejected his defence that he had been involved in a PSNI operation.\n\n\"Hong Kong and China are different,\" Pakko said. \"As a Hong Kong police officer, I have to prove what you did and \nyou don't have to say anything. China is not like that. In China, my father has to prove that he is innocent.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Jamie Smyth in Dublin\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experts said that mortgage rates were likely to rise in the medium term, while savers should \nbenefit from higher deposit rates.\n\n\n\nThe BoE's Financial Policy Committee also warned that it could require banks to test borrowers' ability to withstand \nlarger interest rate rises than they currently do, as it unveiled an arsenal of possible tools to calm the housing \nmarket.\n\n\"Activity in the housing market is picking up and house price inflation appears to be gaining momentum. As a result \nthere is no longer a need for the FLS to provide further broad support to household lending,\" the Bank said.\n\nHouse prices rose 6.5 per cent in the year to November, according to the Nationwide house price index - the \nhighest rate of growth since July 2010. Mortgage approvals are up 34 per cent to their highest level since March \n2008.\n\nOne senior policy maker said: \"The BoE no longer wants to put its name to devices that stimulate the mortgage \nmarket.\"\n\nFunding for Lending was launched in July 2012 and has been widely credited with bringing down rates and \nincreasing lending volumes. It was originally destined to run until January 2015, but the provision of government \nfinance for mortgage lending will now cease a year earlier.\n\nCheap funding through FLS has had a marked impact on rates. According to Bank of England data, the interest rate \non two-year fixed-rate mortgages for those with a 10 per cent deposit has fallen from 5.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent \nover the past 12 months.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; \"Before FLS if you had a 10 per cent deposit there weren't a huge amount of options. Now it's quite common to \nget a 10 per cent deposit mortgage below 4 per cent,\" said Aaron Strutt, a mortgage broker at Trinity Financial \nGroup.\n\nThirty high street lenders now offer mortgages with rates below 2 per cent. Barclays will lend from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a32m \nat only 1.79 per cent.\n\nFLS will continue to support lending to small businesses, where growth has been much slower.\n\nMortgage brokers said the early end of the scheme would increase the cost of funds for lenders which would \neventually feed through into interest rates\n\n\"We might not see a complete reversal, but I think as the months go by, we may see a gentle drift upwards for \ninterest rates,\" David Hollingworth, a broker at London & Country, said.\n\nAside from government funds, the other main sources of finance for mortgage lending are wholesale markets and \nretail deposits. Rates in the savings market are expected to inch upwards as banks are forced to compete more \naggressively for savers' money.\n\n\"Banks will now be looking for extra funds, and therefore savings rates should increase particularly in the long term \nfixed rate market,\" said Charlotte Nelson at Moneyfacts.\n\nThe BoE also emphasised the range of tools at its disposal to combat future risk in the housing market, which \ninclude making recommendations on bank capital requirements for residential real estate lending, \nrecommendations on maximum loan to value ratios and recommendations to the Treasury regarding Help to Buy.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Increasingly, investors are having to \nnegotiate rising stock prices and valuations - which are running well ahead of the improvement in fundamentals. \nGermany's Dax, for example, hit an all-time high this week, led by industrial and bank stocks. In the US, the S&P is \ntrading at 25 times its 10-year average earnings, a level which presents investors with few easy wins and requires \nthem to remain very alert. In the UK, the government and Bank of England, sensing a potential housing bubble, \nwithdrew a stimulus measure that had been pumping up mortgage lending and personal loans. Housebuilders' \nshares fell on the news.\n\nYet, for all this, the crisis hangover lingers. Nowhere more so than at Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which \nhas drafted in a veritable Who's Who of banking advisers to get away its EUR3bn rights issue. Royal Bank of \nScotland, rescued by British taxpayer money and now 82 per cent government-owned, also remains under assault \nover its small business lending practices - a controversy that has done little for its investors, who have seen a flat \nshare price performance this year. And on the industrial front, French carmaker Peugeot, battered by the recent \nplunge in European car sales, is still trying to find a long-term partner - and perhaps some extra cash - to help drive \nmore internationalisation. It has brought in ex-Renault executive Carlos Tavares as its next chief executive.\n\nStill, there is light at the end of some tunnels. Cinda, founded in the 1990s to take on bad debt in China's banking \nsector, is heading to the stock market.\n\nDealmaking remains fairly subdued. But Germany's Bayer continued the trend for large pharma companies to \neffectively buy in new drugs. It made a $2.4bn offer for Norway's Algeta, which has developed prostate cancer \ntreatment Xofigo. That looks to be on the cheap side, though. Meanwhile, in the US, cable consolidation continues, \nwith Charter Communications circling larger rival Time Warner Cable. But if the smaller company buys the larger, \none danger could be another big debt pile. And if that leads to scrimping on services, it could be a customer turn-\noff.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regulators tailor secret Pillar 2A requirements to cover each bank's \nindividual risks.\n\nThe move comes after banks urged the PRA not to pile on excessively onerous capital demands as it brings in EU-\nwide rules aimed at improving the resilience of the banking sector by implementing the new global Basel III \nstandards.\n\nSome analysts had estimated that the PRA's original capital proposal, set out in a consultation paper in August, \ncould have forced UK lenders to hold an extra \u00a3100bn of equity capital as they push towards ratios of as much as \n13 per cent compared with an existing norm of 10 per cent. The Pillar 2A requirement would have been a big part of \nthat additional equity.\n\nBut the PRA has now changed tack, saying in a new paper that it would impose the same mix of capital as for \nbanks' Pillar 1 requirements.\n\nHowever the regulator insisted banks would still have to hold some top quality capital against risks associated with \ntheir pension liabilities - another bone of contention in its dialogue with the industry.\n\nThe PRA also said on Friday it would phase out the double-counting of capital held between subsidiaries in a \nbanking group by 2019.\n\n\"These decisions will enhance the stability of the financial sector and strengthen the capital regime in the UK,\" the \nPRA said.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The figure was slightly higher than most analysts expected.\n\nCore inflation, which does not include more volatile items such as food and energy prices, rose from 0.8 per cent to \n1 per cent.\n\nUnemployment in October was 12.1 per cent, down from 12.2 per cent in September, with the number of people \nwithout jobs falling by 61,000 to 19.3m. It is the first time since the beginning of 2011 that unemployment has fallen.\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, European Commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, said the fall was encouraging, \nbut the jobless rate remained unacceptably high.\n\nMarie Diron, senior economic adviser to the EY Eurozone Forecast, said it was too early to call a turning point. \"The \nOctober fall is concentrated on only very few countries, mainly France,\" Ms Diron said.  \"The French government \nhas put in place a scheme to create jobs for the young but, beside this scheme, there is no evidence yet that the \nprivate sector is creating more jobs.\"\n\nIn Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, unemployment was 5.2 per cent, compared with 27.3 per cent in Greece \nand 26.7 per cent in Spain.\n\nThe publication of the inflation and unemployment figures follow the release of worse than expected consumer \nspending figures for France. Spending in the bloc's second-largest economy fell by 0.2 per cent in October, against \nexpectations of a slight rise.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view.

Both pro- and anti-\ngovernment faction leaders are promising shows of strength this weekend.\n\nWhat are the protesters trying to achieve and how are they going about it?\n\nThey want to oust the government and - according to their leader, Suthep Thaugsuban - replace it with an \nunelected \"people's assembly\". They held mass rallies in Bangkok of up to 150,000 people on Sunday and have \nspent every day since occupying or blockading official buildings, bedding down in the ministry of finance and - on \nFriday - taking a brief stroll on the lawn of army headquarters.\n\nTheir rallying cry is for the end of the \"Shinawatra regime\" - a reference to Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister, \nand her older brother and predecessor, Thaksin, who still wields huge political influence despite living outside \nThailand since he was convicted on corruption-linked charges in 2008. Mr Thaksin's opponents say he and his \ncolleagues have bought their way to four successive election victories since 2001, governing corruptly and \nincompetently. (Mr Thaksin's supporters say the opposition - and in particular the wealthy cosmopolitan elite within \nit - just can't accept losing power to a new money plutocrat, who won by pouring funds into healthcare, agricultural \nsubsidies and other schemes in Thailand's poor rural heartlands).\n\nSo Mr Suthep is an anti-establishment warrior against graft and abuse of office?\n\nNot exactly. Until he resigned from parliament a few weeks ago, he was pretty much the ultimate insider's insider, \nbrokering power in parliament and the opposition Democrats for almost 35 years. He is also no stranger to the kind \nof charges he levels at his opponents. He resigned from government in 1995 amid allegations - which he denied - \nthat he had used land reforms aimed at the poor to benefit the wealthy instead. He is also facing a murder charge \nover the killing of some of the 90 people, many of them Thaksin supporters, who died in 2010 when the army \nopened fire on demonstrators in Bangkok. The boot was on the other foot then: Mr Suthep was the deputy prime \nminister facing down the anti-government mob whose demands he rejected.\n\nProtesters occupying ministries and other official buildings would not be tolerated in many countries. Why are the \nThai government and security forces not stopping it?\n\nPartly because the Yingluck government wants to avoid 2010-style bloodshed - or worse (although it's worth noting \nthat Mr Thaksin's administration oversaw the killings of an estimated 2,500 or more people in 2003, in a brutal \ncrackdown supposedly aimed at the drugs trade). Perhaps more important are political calculations that make it in \nthe administration's interest to play this softly. First, Ms Yingluck has no desire to worsen instability that will damage \nthe country's already weakening economy as the tourism high season begins. Second, she needs to cool a \nsituation sparked by her ill-conceived and abortive efforts to push through an amnesty that critics - including some \nof her own supporters - said would have given Mr Thaksin a ticket home, at the expense of whitewashing him and \nother politicians accused of serious crimes. Third, Bangkok is in many respects natural opposition territory: people, \nincluding civil servants who have welcomed demonstrators into their departments, tend to be wealthier and better \neducated than the more than 50m Thais outside the metropolis. Finally, Ms Yingluck needs to be careful in her \nhandling of the security forces - in particular the military, who deposed her brother in 2006 and owe their ultimate \nloyalty not to the government or parliament, but to the ageing King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nSo how will this all end?\n\nIf Ms Yingluck sticks by her refusal to hold an election, Thailand's recent history suggests three potential outcomes. \nOne is that the demonstrations fizzle out, restoring some of the premier's damaged authority and underlining the \nopposition's inability to mobilise a majority of Thais. A second possibility is that an agency outside politics \nintervenes to depose the prime minister (as the courts did in 2008, as well as the army two years previously). The \nfinal, disturbing, prospect is of violence on the streets of Bangkok again, either between pro- and anti-government \nsupporters, or security forces and demonstrators. Whichever it is, it is unlikely to end the existential struggle \nbetween the old and new political establishment, in a country where the exercise of parliamentary democracy is \ncomplicated by powerful competing influences - not least monarchy, military and money.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Rory Bate-Williams and Jeremy Solomons started at \nthe school in Beijing four months ago funded with annual bursaries worth \u00a350,000 each, to cover the cost of doing \nthe MBAs.\n\n\"It's been an absolutely extraordinary experience,\" says Mr Bate-Williams who says he has been enjoying the \nschool's emphasis on networking. He says CKGSB alumni visit the school twice a week and there are many \nopportunities for meeting people outside scheduled hours.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting on the same table as Chinese politicians and CEOs,\" says Mr Bate-Williams, adding: \n\"The access we've been given here is amazing.\"\n\nNow the school has launched its quest for the next two Hunter scholars, who will join CKGSB's 2014 intake on its \nfull time MBA. Although both this year's Hunter scholars are from UK, this year the school is keen to hear from \napplicants from anywhere in Europe.\n\nThe opportunities being enjoyed by Mr Bate-Williams are exactly what Sir Tom intended. \"It used to be go west \nyoung man, now it should be go east,\" he says.\n\nSir Tom says he was \"just blown away\" when he made his first visit to China last year. \"I thought, my goodness, \nthere's not a lot of knowledge in the UK about China.\" His decision to fund the scholarship programme comes from \nhis conviction that there should be more people in the west who do understand how things work in China.\n\nOliver Shiell, chief representative for Europe at CKGSB echoes his views.\n\n\"There's a massive knowledge deficit in the west on China. But if you're going to be a future CEO you're going to \nhave to have a core competence on China and east Asia or you're not going to make the cut.\"\n\nThis year's scholars form part of a cohort of 40 students on the 14-month, full time programme. Only four are \nwesterners, there are also two Koreans and three Hong Kong Chinese. The school is aiming to recruit more \ninternational students, but Mr Bate-Williams feels he has benefited enormously from the networking opportunities \noffered by having so many Chinese people on the course.\n\nHe says he dreams of setting up a company in China and hopes to identify a potential Chinese partner by the end \nof his time in Beijing.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Exports, however, were weak, falling 2.4 per \ncent.\n\n\"The much sought-after 'rebalancing' of the UK economy, one that relies less on domestic consumption and more \non net exports has yet to evolve,\" said Robert Lynch at HSBC. \"Market participants and policy makers should be \nquick to recognise that sterling's strength is impeding exports.\"\n\nThe pound rose 1.7 per cent against the yen over the week to Y167.07. Against its larger trading partners, the \npound's rise was less marked. The euro fell only 0.3 per cent over the five trading sessions to \u00a30.8326, while the \ndollar lost 0.7 per cent to $1.6341.\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that the Bank of England's decision this week to end its Funding for Lending Scheme for \nthe UK mortgage market helped lift the pound.\n\nHungary's central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark rate by 20 basis points to 3.2 per cent and said the \neconomic environment remained \"supportive overall\" for easing.\n\nThe Hungarian forint fell 1.1 per cent over the week against the euro to Ft301.50, and was down 0.6 per cent to \nFt221.44 against the dollar.\n\n\"This is in reaction to the latest cut in interest rates, expectations of further cuts to come and concern that the cuts \ncould be excessive,\" said Stephen Leach at Citigroup.\n\nThe euro climbed 0.4 per cent over the week against the dollar to $1.3611.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But persistent inflation of about 10 per cent and the threat of higher \ninterest rates to tackle it have lowered expectations for growth. The International Monetary Fund forecasts annual \ngrowth of only 4.3 per cent in the fiscal year to March.\n\n\"The growth of GDP at sub-5 per cent level for the fourth consecutive quarter is worrisome,\" said Chandrajit \nBanerjee, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry. \"The two drivers of growth this year - good \nmonsoons and exports - are insufficient to pull the economy out of the present slowdown, as mining, manufacturing \nand service sector output remain subdued.\"\n\nNaina Lal Kidwai, president of Ficci, another business group, called the latest numbers \"encouraging\" but \nexpressed concern about high inflation and the high cost of credit for companies.\n\n\n\nMiguel Chanco, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said Indian growth appeared to be \"bottoming out\", but he \nwarned that India's road to recovery would be \"slow and bumpy\".\n\nWith the central bank hawkish and the government determined to control its budget deficit, neither monetary nor \nfiscal policy would provide much support for growth. \"Investment activity is likely to stay subdued as the \ngovernment's efforts so far have not had any visible success in reinvigorating appetite for new projects or in \nclearing project bottlenecks.\"\n\nNarendra Modi, prime ministerial candidate for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist opposition, has \nmade growth and development the centrepiece of his election campaign and mocked Congress leaders for failing to \ndeliver prosperity to India's 1.3bn people.\n\nP. Chidambaram, finance minister, said on Friday he expected the economy to grow 6 per cent in the next fiscal \nyear, 7 per cent in 2015-16, and 8 per cent the year after that, but independent economists' GDP forecasts are \nabout a percentage point lower in each case.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Graced by Johan Cruyff, the team won the European Cup three \ntimes in a row in the early 1970s. Victory over a below-par Barcelona this week aside, Ajax now struggles against \nfootball's equivalent of core Europe, while retaining the trappings - expectant fans, huge stadium, impressive wage \nbill - of the elite. Given its bedraggled look, the Dutch economy is a bit like that.\n\nFriday's loss of its triple A rating from Standard & Poor's will be a jolt to Dutch amour propre. The Netherlands has \nan investor fan base that sees it as an integral part of the eurozone core. Its 10-year bond yield at about 2 per cent \nis half that of Italy or Spain. Yet perhaps it flatters to deceive. The Dutch economy is struggling to keep up with \nGermany; indeed, it has been the worst performer of the core eurozone countries for the past two years, a pattern \nthat is likely to continue in 2014.\n\nThe problem - one that has flown mostly under the radar - is that the Netherlands is suffering the consequences of \nthe bursting of a housing bubble. House prices have fallen 20 per cent from their peak. That is not nearly as bad as \nIreland or Spain, where house prices fell 50 and 30 per cent respectively. But it has created a troublingly large \nburden of household debt - 110 per cent of gross domestic product, S&P estimates (the country's sovereign debt \nlevel of 71 per cent of GDP is well below the eurozone average).\n\nA sharp bout of deleveraging by households, coinciding with tough government austerity measures, is the reason \nthe Dutch economy is stalling. This is not going to end soon: Deutsche Bank estimates that Dutch GDP growth will \nbe the slowest in the eurozone in 2014 at just 0.4 per cent.\n\nThe Netherlands has many strengths, including a bulging current account surplus and social and political \ncommitment to reform and fiscal common sense. Still, it is ironic, and a little disturbing, that the creditworthiness of \nthe core eurozone should be called into question just as that of the periphery is starting to recover.\n\nNow that the Netherlands has been expelled from the triple A club, only three eurozone countries - Germany, \nLuxembourg and Finland - retain the top S&P credit rating.

Xinhua said the jets were also responding to US surveillance planes without making clear \nwhether the American aircraft had also entered the zone.\n\nThe apparent growing number of military aircraft entering the contested area highlights the concerns voiced by \nexperts who say the risk of conflict - either accidental or deliberate - is rising quickly.\n\n\"This is a dangerous game of chicken,\" Ian Storey, a security expert at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in \nSingapore, before the Chinese revealed details of their latest fighter missions. \"China is testing the limits of the US-\nJapanese relationship, and the message from the US and Japan has been loud and clear\".\n\nEarlier Japan said it would not hold talks with Beijing over the controversial new air defence zone as that would \namount to accepting Chinese sovereignty over the contested Senkaku Islands, according to the Japanese defence \nminister.\n\n\"Under the Chinese air defence identification zone, the Senkaku Islands become Chinese territory, so Japan cannot \naccept it,\" Itsunori Onodera, Japan's defence minister, said on Friday. \"Under this assumption, we cannot accept \nany negotiation request from Chinese side over how the ADIZ should be operated.\"\n\nChina last Saturday created an \"air defence identification zone\" (ADIZ), requiring foreign aircraft flying near the \nSenkaku, which are controlled by Japan but claimed by China, to file flight plans with Beijing and remain in radio \ncontact with Chinese authorities while in the area.\n\nJapan and the US reacted angrily to the move, which they saw as an attempt to change the status quo over the \nislands, which China calls the Diaoyu.\n\nThe Chinese military on Thursday flew fighter jets into the ADIZ, which partly overlaps with Japan's air defence \nidentification zone, on Thursday, as tensions escalate in the region.\n\nEarlier this week, the US flew B-52 bombers near the islands without telling China. Japan and South Korea have \nalso continued surveillance missions in the area.\n\nChina on Friday hit back at Japanese criticism, saying Tokyo's actions were \"entirely unreasonable and have \nulterior motives\".\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Japan was \"merely allowing itself to set fires while forbidding others to \neven light a lamp\". He repeated China's mantra that the ADIZ was \"not directed against any specific country or \ntarget\" and added that over the past week, \"flights over the East China Sea were not affected at all\".\n\nCathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines have acknowledged complying with the new Chinese rules, but Japanese \nand South Korean carriers are refusing to file flight plans, unless their final destination is China.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;China's move to create an ADIZ comes decades after the US, Japan, South Korea, Russia and others created \nsimilar zones. Many non-Chinese experts say the creation of an ADIZ in itself is not a problem, but they say China \nhas stoked tensions by creating a zone that marks another bid to weaken Japan's control of the Senkaku.\n\n\n\nIn another sign that the Chinese move could cause tensions to ripple further, South Korea on Friday said it was \nconsidering expanding its air defence zone to include Socotra Rock. a submerged rock in the East China Sea that \nis claimed by both South Korea and China.\n\nThe rock, known as Loedo in South Korea and Suyan in China, has long been claimed by both nations, which have \nfailed to reach agreement on their maritime boundary despite years of sporadic negotiations. The rockfalls within \nthe air defence zone announced by China last Saturday, but not within the corresponding zone currently claimed by \nSouth Korea, which has installed a research base on it. During a meeting in Seoul on Thursday, Chinese officials \nrejected a request by South Korea's vice-minister for defence to redraw their air defence zone.\n\nSino-Japanese tensions have mounted over the past year, after the Japanese government bought three of the \nislands from their private Japanese owners. The move sparked widespread anti-Japanese demonstrations in China \nand damaged trade relations as Chinese consumers boycotted Japanese cars and other products.\n\nBarry Desker, dean of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said the Chinese move \namounted to an \"own goal\".\n\n\"While East Asian states are increasingly linked economically to China, they will be attracted to the United States \npolitically and will strengthen bilateral ties with the US to balance China's growing influence in the region,\" said Mr \nDesker. \"Even those sceptical of the US role in the region will acknowledge that regional support for the US policy \nof rebalancing will now increase.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Mitchell\n\ndemetri.sevastopulo@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

After spluttering on the launch-pad, the UK economy has finally taken off and now \nappears to be approaching what economists have dubbed \"escape velocity\".\n\nOutput expanded 0.8 per cent in the third quarter and the Bank of England has been revising higher its growth \nforecasts. Gross domestic product is still almost 3 per cent below its pre-crisis peak, but some think the gap can be \nclosed next year.\n\nIndeed, an apparently temperate combination of rising output and still subdued borrowing costs makes for an \nunusually pleasant backdrop for George Osborne, UK chancellor, when he presents his \"Autumn Statement\" to \nparliament next week. After years of gloomy speeches and spreadsheets drenched in red ink, Mr Osborne could be \nforgiven for whistling Rocket Man when he steps up to the dispatch box on Thursday.\n\nThe markets reflect this growing confidence in Britain's recovery. The rising optimism has buoyed sterling - which \nrose this week against the dollar, euro and yen - and the stock market. But it has weighed heavily on UK \ngovernment bonds.\n\nAfter plumbing historic lows over the past two years, the 10-year gilt yield, which moves inversely to prices, has \nclimbed steadily since early summer to near 3 per cent. The spread between gilts and German government bonds \nis now the highest since 2005.\n\nIndeed, gilt investors have lost 2.8 per cent this year, compared to 2.3 per cent for US Treasuries, and a 3 per cent \ngain for holders of eurozone government bonds. There are fears of a repeat for gilts in 2014.\n\n\"The outlook is not particularly positive,\" says Alan Bridges, UK investment director at Scottish Widows Investment \nPartnership. \"Growth is the highest in G7, and real yields are too low  Gilts look expensive.\"\n\nmailto:demetri.sevastopulo@ft.com\n\n\nIndeed, given the rising feeling that the Bank of England could be the first major central bank to be forced to raise \ninterest rates, some are even asking if 2014 could be the year of a great gilt rout.\n\nThe answer to that is probably not. While the gilt market will not be a great money-spinner next year, it is unlikely to \nbe trounced. For all the optimism surrounding the economy, few asset managers and analysts expect growth to \naccelerate so fast that inflation becomes a real worry and leads to a sharp rise in interest rates.\n\n\"The consensus seems remarkably rosy at the moment, and that makes me suspicious,\" says Michael Hampden-\nTurner, a strategist at Citi. \"It might only take one bad data point for people to get more sceptical again.\"\n\nWith household debt still high, the Bank of England will be reluctant to move aggressively. Alberto Gallo of RBS \nsays such high levels of household debt may only be sustainable as long as long-term interest rates remain low.\n\nTrue, the Bank has shown it is concerned about the risk of Britain's property boom and consumer debt getting out of \nhand. This week, in an effort to prevent the housing market overheating, it ended its support for mortgages and \npersonal loans through the Funding for Lending Scheme. But it is unlikely to hike rates soon.\n\nMike Amey, head of sterling portfolios at Pimco, says the Bank will not lift interest rates until 2015 and possibly \n2016.\n\n\"The economy is simply not strong enough to withstand higher rates yet,\" he argues. Extremely long-dated gilts \nmay still prove vulnerable to shifting expectations, but anchored interest rates will help support most of the market.\n\nMoreover, the UK's large institutional investor base is likely to help keep any increases in gilt yields relatively \nsubdued.\n\nMany pension funds and insurers remain keen to shift their portfolios more towards bonds, which better match their \nliabilities. Rising yields would actually make bonds more attractive to these investors, points out Robert Brown, \nchairman of Towers Watson's global investment committee, which advises investors.\n\n\"It's probably an inexorable trend,\" he says. \"Real rates could of course go much higher, but there is a lot of \nstructural demand in the UK that would put a lid on the move.\"\n\nGilt supply is also falling. John Wraith, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, estimates that the UK's net \nissuance will slip below \u00a3100bn over the next fiscal year, compared to the \u00a3110bn or so indicated by the March \nbudget. That would be the lowest net borrowing since 2007.\n\nAlan Wilde, head of fixed income and currencies at Baring Asset Management, expects the 10-year gilt yield to be \ncloser to 3.5 per cent by the end of next year.  But he, too, is far from convinced that the economy is approaching \nescape velocity quite yet. \"The numbers are better, but not racy enough to really damage the gilt market,\" he \npredicts.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

John Lewis, as well as matching competitors' \nprices, was for the first time offering its own savings on some electrical appliances and televisions.\n\n\"It's clear that Black Friday has stretched across the pond and is no longer just an American phenomenon,\" said Ed \nConnolly, buying director for electricals and home technology at John Lewis.\n\n\n\nA plethora of promotions was evident online and across the high street, with some well-known names offering \nsavings on clothing, homewares and beauty, as they try to capture Christmas spending in the crucial weekend after \npayday.\n\n\"Lots of people are trying to kick-start Christmas,\" said Christine Cross, the independent retail adviser. \"I think we \nwill probably see a seamless run [of promotions and sales] from now until the end of January.\"\n\nAmong the chains advertising savings, Debenhams was offering 10 per cent off beauty products and VAT savings \non individual bottles of fragrances. Hobbs, the fashion chain, began its sale on Thursday, with savings of up to 50 \nper cent across the store.\n\nSome retailers are concerned that by emulating the US with Black Friday deals, British store groups are importing a \ndamaging and unnecessary promotional event, ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino, the retail research group, said: \"There is real logic in the US as to \nwhy Black Friday exists, coming the day after Thanksgiving. There is no logic in the UK, and it is a terrible time to \nbe discounting.\"\n\nBut Andrew Moore, head of Asda's general merchandise business, defended the supermarket's decision to bring \nBlack Friday across the Atlantic from its parent Walmart.\n\n\"They said a similar sort of thing about Halloween, that Halloween was not a UK phenomenon, but look at it now,\" \nhe said.\n\n\"These are not products that we have had in store, that we are going to do [price] cross-offs on. These are new \nproducts that have been sourced specifically, and they represent our outstanding value for money,\" he added.\n\nThe high street promotions come after a poor October for fashion sales, according to senior retailers. However, the \npast few weeks have been better, they said, as the weather turned colder.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Saunders said Christmas trading had been sluggish so far, with consumers leaving it later to do \ntheir shopping. Conlumino found that only 53 per cent of people had finished their gift shopping, compared with 70 \nper cent this time a year ago.\n\nDespite the proliferation of promotions, some retailers, such as Fat Face and New Look have been moving away \nfrom discounting.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This is wrong.\"\n\nHis views are echoed by crowdfunding website operators. Jeff Lynn, chief executive of Seedrs, says US law was a \nlot more accommodating to people who wish to put money into ventures started by friends and family.\n\n\"Most people who want to get a portfolio of investments pass the [FCA] sophisticated investor test,\" notes Mr Lynn.\n\n\n\n\"Where we have concerns is where there are people who probably shouldn't be investing in start-ups generally but \nare good friends with someone who is starting a business and wants to put \u00a350 into it as an investment.\"\n\nA poll of 1,000 active investors, not classed as sophisticated or high net worth, conducted by crowdfunding platform \nInvestingZone found that two-thirds wanted more control over their investments and a third were frustrated with \nbroker and adviser fees.\n\nRichard Brockbank, co-founder of InvestingZone, says he welcomes the FCA's regulation of crowdfunding because \nit standardises the rules and gives investors confidence to use it.\n\nHowever, he claims that the benefits should not be limited to those classed as sophisticated investors or high net \nworth.\n\n\"At InvestingZone, we have gone to great efforts to make sure that the risks inherent in early stage investments are \nclearly presented on our platform and that only investors who understand those risks are admitted.\n\n\"With regards to limiting the amount that can be invested, we feel that this is patronising to investors who can \ndemonstrate that they know what they're doing but just don't happen to be rich.\"\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Tom Ball, founder of NearDesk, a web business that enables people to rent desk space by the hour, was \napproached by an angel wanting to invest \u00a350,000, who ended up investing through the company's \u00a384,500 \ncrowdfunding campaign on Seedrs.\n\n\"Having the crowd attracted the angel and gave him confidence,\" says Mr Ball. \"Seeing a large amount go in gave \nthe crowd confidence, so the two worked well together.\"\n\nThe lines between angel investing and crowdfunding are and should be getting increasingly blurred, adds Mr Ball.\n\n\"The Seedrs nominee structure means that smaller investors are amalgamated into one shareholder so the old \npaperwork and communication problems go away.\"\n\nAnother keen supporter of crowdfunding is Caspar Craven, co-founder of business analytics provider Trovus.\n\n\"We needed more working capital earlier this year [and] the offer from our bank frankly didn't make sense for us,\" \nhe says.\n\n\"We turned to crowdfunding and raised all we needed within one hour. It was unbelievably quick and easy.\"\n\nThe growth generated by the investment round has meant that Trovus is now looking at further financing rounds \nusing crowdfunding platforms, adds Mr Craven.\n\n\"I'm on a mission now to share with fellow entrepreneurs how crowdfunding is a game changer for the \nentrepreneur.\"\n\nDavid Cross, an FCA spokesman, says the proposed rules would not prevent people from putting money into their \nfamily members' start-ups on a one-to-one basis, but would limit the potential risks to individuals of losing money.\n\n\"I understand Mr Moulton's criticisms, however, there is nothing in the example he cites stopping kin from investing \nin their family member's venture,\" Mr Cross explains, adding that the FCA's proposed rules related to the promotion \nof unlisted shares through a crowdfunding platform.\n\n\n\n\"We want to make sure that those who are investing in quite high risk equities have the ability to either have access \nto advice or are sophisticated investors and have a limit on how much they could potentially lose,\" he adds.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

However, a combination of the \nslowing of the Chinese economy and a government crackdown on gift-giving is forcing marques to rethink their \nstrategies and face the threat of a drop in valuation premiums.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In September, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for corruption.\n\nThe clampdown has had a big effect on the Chinese watch market, which has powered the watch industry for the \npast three years. In 2012 Chinese imports of Swiss timepieces were worth SFr1.65bn, up from just SFr94.2m in \n2002. However, in the first seven months of this year, they were down 12 per cent, and have since recovered only \nslightly.\n\n\"The clampdown has basically killed gifting in mainland China,\" says Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. \"I \nassume that this accounted for one-third of the watch market on the mainland.\"\n\nHowever, while Mr Cox does not expect gifting to re-establish itself, he expects the Chinese market to grow more \nrobustly in 2014 than it has this year.\n\n\"First of all, the comparisons with this year will be easier. And second, the number of millionaires and rich \nhouseholds in China is rising faster than anywhere else. So I think we will see demand pick up again,\" he says.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysts in the UK \ndowngraded expectations for Marks and Spencer this week, and Retail Metrics, a US research group, says \nearnings at the 120 retailers it follows are forecast by analysts to rise by just 2.2 per cent year on year for \nNovember, December and January, compared with a 11.8 per cent jump for the same period last year.\n\nTheir pessimism comes despite overall economic data that suggest the two economies are on the recovery trail. UK \nthird-quarter growth was recently confirmed at 0.8 per cent, the highest rate since 2010, and business investment \nis rising. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.8 per cent in the same period. The problem for retailers \nand other companies that sell to consumers is that ordinary people appear to be experiencing little if any of the \nprosperity. In the UK, Markit's index of household finances, which measures perceptions of wellbeing, recently hit \n\n\n\nits lowest level since April, and the Conference Board's index of US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low \nthis week.\n\nSo far the main response by the retailers has been to roll out high-profile discounts pegged to Black Friday, the big \nshopping day after US Thanksgiving, and to flood email in-boxes around the world with special offers aimed at \ntempting consumers to open their wallets. These are so prevalent that some analysts are now calling Thanksgiving \n\"red Thursday\" to reflect all the loss-leading promotions.\n\nBut there might be another way. Back in the 20th century, when Henry Ford's car company set the model, many \nmanufacturers consciously sought to link their product prices and their employees' wages so that the latter became \na natural market for the former.\n\n\"Fordism\" fell apart when global competitors began offering similar products at lower prices - think of the Japanese \ncar invasion. But now wages and prices have become so decoupled that many workers cannot afford the goods \nthey build and sell. In a much discussed example, an Ohio Walmart holds an annual Thanksgiving food drive to \nhelp employees who are having personal financial issues.\n\nWhile retailers are in the spotlight because of Christmas, the same story applies to the car industry. Sales are \nstrongest in countries such as the US and UK, where leasing has taken hold and low interest rates make nicer cars \nrelatively affordable. The UK has also seen a jump in sales because of the \u00a314bn payment protection insurance \nscandal - many consumers are using their compensation money as the deposit on a new car. Once interest rates \nbegin to rise, the monthly payment on a new car may again climb out of reach.\n\nIn today's cost-cutting environment, raising worker salaries is not something many companies do voluntarily. But \nsuch a step is not out of the question. Japan's largest brokerage, Nomura Securities, announced on Friday that it \nplans to increase pay for 4,000 staff members. Aimed at fighting deflation, the pay rises are targeted at younger \nemployees who are more likely to go out and spend.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Today, his company's turnover is \u00a38.5m, with total sales of six \nmillion hairbrushes in more than 60 countries. The Tangle Teezer won the company the Queen's Award for \nEnterprise in Innovation in 2012.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nShaun Pulfrey CV\n\nBorn: Grimsby, 1961?\n\nEducation: Matthew Humberstone comprehensive school, Cleethorpes\n\nCareer: Worked for a local hairdresser before training as colourist at Vidal Sassoon in 1982. He went on to work for \nthem in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Boston before leaving to launch the Tangle Teezer\n\nLives: South London. He is single\n\nOther interests: Supports breast cancer charities\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDid you think you would get to where you are?\n\n\n\nIt did not totally surprise me that I am running my own company. I had no aspirations to own a salon but once I had \nthe idea for the product and began the research I was driven to make it a reality. Until then I had always wanted to \nbe the best colourist possible.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you had made your first \u00a31m did you want to slow down?\n\nDuring our financial year ending in March 2011 we generated sales of \u00a32.2m. The previous year it was \u00a3813,000. I \nwas aware of the money but I always look at the number of products. We could not slow down. It is like a beast that \nyou have got to feed. You have got to keep up with it, especially as we had managed to get our tooling capacity up. \nAll I wanted to do was to increase our distribution. In the next five years we want to achieve a turnover of \u00a350m per \nannum.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHow did you fund your invention?\n\nLargely by working as a hair colourist. In order to find \u00a398,000 I basically did not go out, I did not buy any new \nclothes and I did not go on holiday for three years. When I needed more money it came from remortgaging my two-\nbedroom flat in Brixton, which gave me \u00a325,000, six months' capital that was make or break. I worked four days in \nthe salon and the rest of the time I was doing Tangle Teezer. The research and development seemed to go on \nforever.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is the secret of your success?\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; It is to share my good fortune - empowering staff, encouraging them to develop as the company grows at such \na rapid rate, to travel and see different countries and cultures. The reason I am selling well in Brazil is that the \ndistributors there are so enthusiastic. They get as passionate about the product as I do. I am also driven, and \nconstantly looking to develop and grow the brand.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat did you ask for on Dragons' Den?\n\nI pitched for \u00a380,000 in return for 15 per cent of the company. I realised after a very short time that they were not \ninterested. They just did not get it, though my product was visual and I could show viewers it worked. Peter Jones \nsaid it was a hair-brained idea! It was interesting because I already had a route to market, and the way I looked at \nthe Dragons is that they were a pleasant distraction. They now regard Tangle Teezer as the idea that got away.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat was the most challenging period of your career?\n\nAfter doing almost everything on my own, it was finding people around me from 2008 onwards to come and take the \nbusiness further. We now have 15 staff in the office. I had to trust them to do the job. We are quite a varied bunch, \nincluding a chief operating officer, a sales team, in-house marketing/media team, two accountants, a lawyer, and \nfour logistics people.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHow much did it cost to take out patents worldwide?\n\nWe put about \u00a320,000 into the patents and intellectual property when we had not even sold one single product. It \nwas very risky. The patent and IP fees have to be constantly renewed. We spent \u00a3200,000 last year enforcing our \nintellectual property rights.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is your basic business philosophy?\n\nTo be honest it was to develop products to solve the problem of tangled hair. We put the technology into the \nhairbrush, the teeth design allows it to flex over tangles. It was a commitment to the customer.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHave Facebook and Twitter been a strong boost to sales?\n\nMassively. While we focused on advertising in the trade press, nearly all our sales have been through print and \nsocial media. That's how we have become global within five years. We had Victoria Beckham tweet about us, and \nEmma Watson and Cara Delevingne praised it in magazines and on podcasts.\n\nFor the first two years it was like a runaway train, trying to keep a grip on managing the supply to meet the ever-\ngrowing demand. It was the mothers of young daughters with tangled hair who kick-started our sales, then the \nproduct appealed to hair salons and teenage girls, and even men.\n\nInterest from China came through a blog nearly three years ago. A famous Chinese model and make-up artist \nbought a Tangle Teezer in Boots and tweeted about it. Then distributors in Shanghai approached us.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDo you want to carry on till you drop?\n\nI want to carry on because I owe it to those around me, for them to enjoy the success as well. There are still lots \nmore things for me to do. In about five years' time it will be in the interests of the business for me to sell it. Then I \nwould like to ask all my close friends to join me in sailing around the world.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHave you made any pension provision?\n\nWhen you get to a certain level and the company starts turning over so much money, you do get advice from the \nbanks. I took out a private pension when I was 48 because I simply did not have the spare cash to put aside before \nthen. I pay in the maximum possible, and I would like to think that when the business is sold the proceeds will be \npart of my pension pot.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is your commitment to charity?\n\nI support breast cancer charities both as a company and an individual, as my mother was diagnosed with cancer \nwhen I started the business. Mum has survived and now I can treat her to anything she wants. One of our Compact \nStylers we made specially to support breast cancer care, with 20 per cent of the retail price going to charity.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDo you allow yourself the odd indulgence?\n\n\n\nI have bought myself some nice Bottega Veneta \"man bags\". I spent \u00a32,200 on the last one. I have bought a lovely \nthree-bedroom house with a garden, which I never thought I would have in London. My latest indulgence is an Audi \nR8 Spider with a V10 engine.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHow have you survived the recession?\n\nThe recession did not affect us, though it was just kicking in when I quit my job in London and launched the Tangle \nTeezer in October 2007. I was ready and everything was in place. It was then or never.\n\nAt the outset my limited company paid me \u00a3549 a month, which had to cover the mortgage and everything else. By \nthe end of year two I was earning more than I had earned as a colourist. In a recession people spend their money \ncautiously. One American woman said the product looked like it cost 20 cents but it gave a $20 benefit. The Original \nhairbrushes retail at \u00a310.20.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

However, it backfired, \nprovoking a furious response from, among others, France's Union of Sex Workers (Strass), which also opposes the \nnew law.\n\nA sheepish Nicolas Bedos, comedian and film director, apologised for signing the petition. But he said: \"To want to \nabolish prostitution is like wanting to abolish rain.\"\n\nThe bill's supporters disagree.\n\nThe proposed legislation, which the National Assembly began debating on Friday, would scrap a 10-year-old law \nagainst soliciting and replace it with a provision outlawing payment for sex, punishable by a EUR1,500 fine. A \nsimilar step was taken by Sweden in 1999.\n\nAlso included are provisions to help women leave prostitution and a move to force internet providers to block \naccess to foreign websites offering prostitution services.\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government is not sponsoring the bill. The president, already deeply unpopular as he \nstruggles to get the economy moving, wants to avoid anything like the public furore that erupted when the \ngovernment pushed through a law enshrining same-sex marriage.\n\nNonetheless, the government is backing the bill. \"After the abolition of the slave trade, we must abolish the trade in \nprostitutes,\" declared Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, minister for women's rights.\n\nThe Paris brothels of the belle \u00e9poque may still evoke a certain romantic image but the modern-day reality is more \nabout foreign prostitutes controlled by criminal gangs plying their trade in streetside vans and city parks, such as \nthe Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\n\nOfficial estimates indicate that there are at least 20,000 prostitutes in France. \"We think there are many more than \nthat,\" says Morgane Merteuil, secretary-general of Strass.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Some 85 per cent are said by the authorities to be from outside France, from Africa, eastern Europe and Asia. \nPolice say 52 pimping networks were broken up last year, two-thirds of them foreign.\n\nUnlike in some neighbouring countries such as Germany, where there are systems for licensing prostitution, there \nare already tough laws in France against pimping and running brothels, although prostitution itself is legal.\n\nDominique Strauss-Kahn, former head of the International Monetary Fund, is awaiting trial on pimping charges, \nwhich he denies, linked to his admitted participation in \"libertine soir\u00e9es\" that allegedly involved prostitutes.\n\nHe has protested that he is the victim of a confusion of morals and the law. A similar argument is made by many \nopponents of the prostitution law. A group of celebrities, including the actress Catherine Deneuve and singer \nCharles Aznavour, have signed a protest petition that declares: \"We reject the criminalisation of those who \nprostitute themselves and those who seek their services.\"\n\nMs Merteuil says: \"If someone wants to work in the street she should be able to. If girls want to share a flat or a \nplace to work, that should be allowed as well.\"\n\nBut supporters of the bill insist the overwhelming number of people working as prostitutes are doing so under \nduress, at risk of violence and disease.\n\nMaud Olivier, one of the members of parliament who drew up the legislation, says there is a need to shift the \ncriminal emphasis on to the client to ensure that \"the prostitute is no longer treated as a delinquent but a victim who \nneeds help\".\n\nThe bill, which has split opinion across party lines, does not seem to have won popular backing: a recent TNS \nSofres poll showed just 22 per cent public support for targeting the client.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Moscow also \nbanned dairy goods from Lithuania, the summit host and one of only three ex-Soviet EU members.\n\n\"Actions taken by Russia [towards] Eastern Partnership countries are incompatible with how international relations \nshould function on our continent in the 21st century,\" said Herman van Rompuy, European Council president. He \nadded Russia's actions breached international treaties giving sovereign countries the right to \"freely define \nrelations\" with other states.\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, said the \"times of limited sovereignty in Europe are over\".\n\n\n\nThe EU's unusually blunt words came as thousands of Ukrainians demonstrated in Kiev over their president's \nfailure to sign the European deal, with more expected to gather through the day. The issue has sparked the biggest \nrift in EU-Russian relations since the Russian-Georgian war of 2008, which followed efforts to put Ukraine and \nGeorgia on the path to Nato membership.\n\nThe EU managed to salvage some success for the Eastern Partnership as both Moldova and Georgia shrugged off \nRussian pressure and initialled integration agreements, in what German chancellor Angela Merkel called a \"very \nbrave step\". The two countries are expected to reach the final stage and sign deals next year.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Armenia had been due to initial a deal, too, but U-turned in September, saying it would instead join a Russian-\nled customs union that Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, is also trying to entice Ukraine to join.\n\nMr Yanukovich said Ukraine could not proceed with an EU deal as his country needed \"decisive steps\" from \nBrussels to deliver a \"programme of financial-economic aid\" to help Kiev deal with a severe cash crunch and offset \nRussian trade retaliation.\n\nEU leaders failed even to sign a mooted joint declaration with Mr Yanukovich committing the two sides to work \ntowards signing the deal at a summit in Kiev in March, which officials had discussed on Thursday.\n\nVideo footage from inside the summit showed an awkward-looking Mr Yanukovich being greeted by Ms Merkel with \nthe words, \"Nice to see you here. But we expected more.\"\n\nMr Yanukovich replies: \"The economic situation in our country is very complicated . . . we had very big threats.\n\n\"I've been alone for three and a half years . . . in very unequal conditions, with a very strong Russia,\" he adds.\n\nBut Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuanian president, accused her Ukrainian counterpart of using Russian pressure as an \n\"excuse\".\n\n\"The whole experience of Lithuania shows that if you have the political will to resist and not to give in, pressures are \nnot working,\" she said. \"Here probably we see external pressure being used as an excuse for stopping the \nintegration process with the EU by the leadership of Ukraine themselves.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He added that any cost overruns would have to be recouped in the next five-year regulatory period from 2015 \n- if the regulator allowed it.\n\nThames had argued that a combination of customers' bad debts, extra responsibility for private sewer maintenance \nand preparations for a \u00a34.1bn London \"super-sewer project\" had justified its plan for an 8 per cent price rise.\n\nIts tough stance on attempting to claw back costs came as Ofwat and Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, \nwere calling for companies to moderate their price increases over the remainder of the decade.\n\nAll companies in England and Wales are scheduled to submit five-year pricing and investment proposals to Ofwat \non Monday that run from 2015.\n\nThis week, South West Water announced a two-year price freeze, while United Utilities said its April increase would \nnot exceed inflation. Severn Trent is already committed to below-inflation increases next year. Wessex Water has \nalso committed to reducing prices in real terms over the next six years.\n\nIn April, Thames raised average prices by 5.5 per cent, increasing a typical household bill by \u00a318 to \u00a3354 a year. \nThat led to a rise in turnover from \u00a3903m to \u00a3977m in the six months to September.\n\nOperating profit advanced from \u00a3311m to \u00a3349m but a \u00a316m increase in net financing costs, to \u00a3211m, moderated \nthe rise in Thames Water's pre-tax profits, which climbed from \u00a3113m to \u00a3134m.\n\nThe company attributed the rise in finance costs to the increase in its net debt from \u00a38.4bn to \u00a38.7bn over the \nperiod.\n\nA jump in tax credits from \u00a315m to \u00a399m, attributed to the fall in the marginal rate of corporation tax on deferred \nliabilities, prompted a near doubling of post-tax profit from \u00a3128m to \u00a3234m.\n\nEven so, Thames Water denied that shareholders would profit from the declining tax burden. \"The reduction in the \ndeferred tax provision has not resulted in any tax refund or rebate to the company and will, in the long term, benefit \ncustomers and not shareholders,\" it said.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Number 10 is billing the trip as an opportunity \nto \"turn the page\" after that row.\n\nMr Cameron has long stressed the importance of the UK-China trade relationship, promising in 2010 that he would \ndouble British trade there by 2015 to \u00a362bn. So far, the policy has not paid off - a Foreign Office study in January \nshowed the UK  share of the Chinese market had fallen to just 1 per cent in the past decade.\n\nIn an attempt to reboot the trading partnership, Mr Cameron will take 120 businesspeople with him next week, the \nlargest British trade delegation put together, much larger than the one he took to China in 2011.\n\nThe delegation will include Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, who is opening a new training centre \nin Beijing, as well as a string of other FTSE 100 executives. They include George Weston, chief executive of \n\n\n\nAssociated British Foods, Jorma Ollila, chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, Xavier Rolet, London Stock Exchange chief \nexecutive and Peter Sands, head of Standard Chartered bank.\n\nStephen Crisp, JLR's global director of government affairs, said the trip represented a \"huge opportunity\" for the \ncompanies involved. \"It shows the UK's long-term commitment to the country. But also the prime minister will be \nfollowed by Chinese politicians wherever he goes, and that will make sure they notice us.\"\n\nSir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, will also join the trade mission despite the company having \nadmitted it may have violated Chinese law with its sales practices.\n\nThe company is being investigated by the Chinese authorities over allegations that it bribed Chinese doctors to \nprescribe its medicines, but has since said it will change its commissions model. Mr Cameron may use the \nopportunity to lobby Beijing on the pharmaceutical group's behalf during the four-day visit.\n\nThe visit is expected to produce deals, but it is as important for its symbolism as it is for signing contracts. For the \nlast 18 months, the prime minister has not been able to meet his Chinese counterparts, while more junior ministers, \nsuch as Lord Green, the trade minister, and Jeremy Browne, the former Foreign Office minister, have had meetings \nin Beijing cancelled at the last minute.\n\nThe official deep freeze began in May 2012 when Mr Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London, which the Chinese \nforeign ministry said \"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\".\n\nThat damage was only repaired when Mr Cameron told the Commons in May that  the UK did not support Tibetan \nindependence, a statement that paved the way for George Osborne, the chancellor, and Boris Johnson, the London \nmayor, to travel to China last month.\n\nWestern diplomats in Beijing however say the UK has given up too much in its bid to attract Chinese money. One \nsenior Beijing-based Asian diplomat called Britain's position over the Dalai Lama \"total capitulation\".\n\nDowning Street insists it has sacrificed relatively little to win its way back into Beijing, pointing out that the Tibet \nstatement was merely a restatement of the government position. The statement also falls well short of the joint \nstatements with Beijing that both France and Germany had to sign after they suffered a similar reaction following \nmeetings with the Dalai Lama.\n\nHaving secured separate dinners with both Mr Xi and Mr Li, British officials may now feel the sacrifices they did \nmake were justified.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Rio's $38bn acquisition of Alcan in 2007, and subsequent huge writedowns on the overpriced \ndeal, have come to epitomise the problems of the world's largest diversified mining groups in dealing with the \naluminium sector's transformation.\n\nAluminium also has one of the worst oversupply problems among globally traded metals.\n\nRio is to close the Gove refinery after failing to reduce the plant's energy costs by securing a supply of natural gas \nfrom the government of Australia's Northern Territory, where the plant is located.\n\n\"The refinery is no longer a viable business in the current market environment . . . there is nothing more the \nNorthern Territory government could have done to help secure a long-term future for the refinery,\" Rio said. The \n\n\n\nminer said the decision was also based on continuing low alumina prices, a high exchange rate and substantial \nafter-tax losses for the refinery.\n\nThe closure, which will begin next year, was announced a day after Rio stepped up its commitment to another part \nof its Australian operations, saying it would expand output over the next four years at its iron ore mines in Western \nAustralia's Pilbara region.\n\nRio said on Friday it planned to maintain its bauxite mines at Gove. Bauxite is the raw material refined into alumina, \nwhich is then smelted into aluminium, and the miner has been more optimistic over the global market for bauxite \nthan for the finished metal. \"We have a firm belief in the potential of the bauxite operation, a quality asset with a \nlong-term future,\" said Sam Walsh, Rio's chief executive.\n\nGove was part of a set of aluminium assets known as Pacific Aluminium that Rio failed to sell this year, \nunderscoring the poor outlook for the sector. The Gove refinery produced almost a quarter of Rio's 7m tonnes of \nalumina in the first nine months of the year.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since January, average rates on a 2-year fixed rate mortgage with a 25 per cent downpayment have \nfallen 0.63 percentage points to 2.48 per cent. But standard variable rates (SVRs) have fallen by exactly 0.02 \npercentage points to 4.36 per cent.\n\nSurprisingly, neither the Bank of England nor the Financial Conduct Authority has data on how many of these \nmortgages remain outstanding. Yet with nearly two full percentage points between new, fixed-rate mortgages and \nstandard variable rates, one would think that most households who can afford to refinance, have.\n\nThe relatively low level of remortgaging activity last year points to very little refinancing of existing debt. That may \nbe because spreads between existing and new debt were relatively narrow. However, in recent months, the spread \nhas been blown apart (see chart).\n\nIt may well be that those who have not remortgaged are those who simply cannot. There may be too little equity in \nthe home to qualify for the best rates or incomes are not high enough. Some portion of them may be households \nwho had been transferred to interest-only mortgages as a means of avoiding foreclosure.\n\nOn Twitter: Follow Norma Cohen@NormaCohen3\n\nAnd it is precisely these credit-constrained households that would be most likely to step up consumption if they had \nthe benefit of lower rates. Just as refunds of Payment Protection Insurance were judged to have had higher \nmultipliers because they went to the cash-poor, so too would reductions in SVR.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The Spanish economy was found \nto have grown 0.1 per cent in the three months to September - a tiny improvement compared with the previous \nquarter, but a potentially crucial break in the economic trajectory.\n\nS&P made clear in its statement that Spain continued to face severe economic challenges, warning in particular of \nthe country's high unemployment rate and the severe debt problem hanging over the private and public sector.\n\n\"Domestic demand is weak and constrained by further declines in disposable income due to high unemployment, \nreduced wages and budget consolidation. In addition, investment activity remains subdued as the private sector \ndeleverages its balance sheets and credit activity continues to decline,\" said the agency.\n\nThe broadly positive stance taken by S&P was mirrored in a research report on the Spanish economy released by \nBarclays on Friday.\n\n\"The economy is turning around, unemployment is stabilising, and the internal devaluation appears to be working, \nas demonstrated by strong export performance and the gains in export shares of world markets,\" said the Barclays \nanalysis.\n\n\"However, the recovery is very mild, and is likely to remain subdued throughout 2014 as the private sector \ndeleverages, fiscal headwinds remain strong and credit conditions remain tight in 2014 and probably in 2015.\"\n\nThe Spanish government believes that the economy will grow 0.7 per cent next year, and will start creating jobs in \nthe first half of 2014. Spain's unemployment rate stands at 26 per cent - among the highest in the western world.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Crowdfunding applies this matchmaking \nprocess to people with a need for cash and donors or investors.\n\nWho is doing this?\n\nThe two largest crowdfunding marketplaces are New York-based Kickstarter, which focuses on creative projects, \nand San Francisco-based Indiegogo, which has a wider remit, enabling people not just to put money into creative \nprojects but to donate to charitable causes and take stakes in commercial start-ups. Seedrs, which has its \nheadquarters in London, focuses only on companies seeking equity backing.\n\nWhat is in it for the crowdfunding platforms?\n\n\n\nThey charge a fee, which tends to be a percentage of the amount raised. Seedrs, for instance, has a fee of 7.5 per \ncent of the total. Kickstarter will apply a 5 per cent fee, plus payment processing fees of 3 to 5 per cent, for \nsuccessful campaigns. It charges nothing if the target is not hit.\n\nIs crowdfunding the same thing as peer-to-peer lending?\n\nNot according to those who call themselves this, such as Zopa, Thincats and Funding Circle. Like crowdfunders, \nthese peer-to-peer lenders use the vast reach of the internet to bring together people with money and those that \nneed it. Unlike crowdfunding companies such as Kickstarter and Seedrs, the peer-to-peer lenders are focused on \nenabling people to lend money, as opposed to investing or donating cash.\n\nHow do you get involved as an investor/lender?\n\nInvestors can search the websites for projects using keywords. They then click to make an investment, much as \npeople buying something online after completing a sign in and giving their bank details. Money is taken when the \npledges reach the target set by those seeking funding.\n\nWhat kind of return, if any, can you expect?\n\nInvesting, whether in the conventional sense or through crowdfunding websites, is a risky venture. Even with \ntraditional venture capital financing, investors in start-ups lose their shirt up to 75 per cent of the time according to \nsome studies. Crowdfunding is still in its infancy so there is little data on actual return rates, although angel \ninvesting, which is comparable, has been found to produce, on average, an annualised rate of return of 22 per cent.\n\nMany people backing Kickstarter projects are donating the money. They may get an early prototype of a product \nthey are backing or some other \"reward\", but not an equity stake.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending may offer better returns to savers than traditional bank deposit accounts. For example, \nRatesetter has been offering a pre-tax five-year fixed interest rate of 5.7 per cent on loans, compared with 3.1 per \ncent from a conventional savings account, according to the price comparison website Moneysavingexpert.com. \nFunding Circle, which organises loans for businesses, not individuals, claims to offer an average net return of 5.7 \nper cent after fees and the bad debt rate.\n\nWhat is the timescale for a return on the investment?\n\nGiven that crowdfunding is aimed primarily at the very early stage rounds of funding, investors should expect to wait \nfor at least five years until they see any return.\n\nHow quick can companies raise money?\n\nCrowdfunding exercises are usually run over a period of weeks, but campaigns that capture people's attention can \nhit their target much more quickly. Kano, the UK-based start-up behind a cut-price computer that is designed to be \nas simple to build as Lego, raised more than $140,000 in crowdfunding in a matter of hours for its $99 kits.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The company had fended off an insurrection \nby two of its largest shareholders and was basking in the discovery of one of the world's largest shale gas \nformations by its Argentine YPF subsidiary, known as Vaca Muerta.\n\nOnly months later, armed guards arrived at YPF's headquarters in Buenos Aires to renationalise the company, \nforcing Repsol executives to flee the country, and sending its share price into free fall.\n\nMr Brufau had been attempting to reposition Repsol from a sluggish former state-run operation recovering from a \nscandal linked to overstating oil reserves into a honed explorer focused on world-class oil discoveries, but was \nforced to tear up his plans.\n\nTo avoid a credit rating downgrade, Repsol, which gained a fifth of its 2011 net profits from YPF and almost half of \nits proven reserves, was forced to sell assets and rework its strategic plan.\n\nTo make matters worse for Mr Brufau, Caixabank and Pemex had again started agitating against him behind the \nscenes as he pressed ahead with suing Argentina in international courts for at least $10.5bn in compensation.\n\nMr Brufau, while open to striking a deal with Buenos Aires at the right price, had become persona non grata to \nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina's populist president, who had refused to grant him an audience when he had flown \nout to try to persuade her against seizing YPF.\n\nFor Caixabank, Mr Brufau - a former employee of the lender - had become an obstacle to a deal.\n\nIsidro Fain\u00e9, Caixabank chairman and at turns one of Mr Brufau's oldest friends and bitterest rivals, took matters \ninto his own hands, travelling to Argentina to meet Ms Fern\u00e1ndez in secret with the aim of striking a deal he could \nthen present to the Repsol board.\n\nWhen a deal brokered by Mr Fain\u00e9 offering a $3.5bn stake in the seized assets and $1.5bn that would have to be \nreinvested in Argentina was finally tabled in June, it was voted down unanimously by the Repsol board as \nunacceptable.\n\nThis prompted Pemex, which stood to gain a stake in Vaca Muerta, to openly attack Mr Brufau for the size of his \nsalary, saying he had mismanaged the company.\n\nA new preliminary deal struck this week, based on $5bn of Argentine bonds and no forced reinvestment in the \ncountry, is undoubtedly an improved offer. For Mr Brufau's supporters, it was a vindication of his aggressive legal \npursuit of an intransigent Argentina. His critics say his large shareholders forced his hand against his will.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr Brufau has been weakened by recent developments. But Repsol's smaller investors feel \nthat if Mr Brufau, Mr Fain\u00e9 and Pemex are all going to have a future at the company, they must learn to be friends \nagain.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The police and other arms of the state they are meant to be \nconfronting are absent.\n\nIt makes for a strange but not untypical skirmish in this battle for the soul of southeast Asia's second-largest \neconomy, in which both sides have opted for passive resistance - and trying to lure the other into a false move.\n\n\n\n\"We will stay here until we achieve victory,\" said Sumalee Choothoad, a 35-year-old housewife as she perched in \nfront of a green-domed tent pitched on the hard floor of the main building's cavernous interior on Friday. \"We will \nnot use violence.\"\n\nMs Sumalee is part of  protests across Bangkok that have lasted nearly a week and are aimed at toppling the \ngovernment. They started on Sunday with rallies that attracted as many as 150,000 and continued with the \noccupation of the finance ministry and other government offices. Demonstrators fan out each day in groups around \nthe city and often favour short but high-profile guerrilla actions, such as Friday's stroll on the lawn of the army's \nheadquarters.\n\nThe mood may be light for now but it is underlaid by fears of a repeat of violence in 2010 that led to street battles in \nthe capital and scores of deaths. Like other protests before and since, that crisis was an act in an ever darker \ndrama dividing Thai society between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, a fugitive former prime \nminister - and older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra, the current premier.\n\nThe latest Bangkok stand-off has set up a tense weekend at the start of the peak tourist season, at a time when the \neconomy is weakening. Protest leaders have rejected an offer of talks by Ms Yingluck, who triggered the \ndemonstrations through a failed effort to introduce an amnesty law that critics say would have allowed Mr Thaksin \nand other senior politicians on both sides to escape accountability for alleged crimes.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;\"Now we have to fight,\" exclaimed Sakol Duangkaew, a 67-year-old former merchant seaman, who prowled the \nNonthaburi precincts with a string of Buddhist religious icons round his neck and loud denunciations of what anti-\ngovernment protesters call the \"Thaksin regime\".\n\n\"There are mistakes, and corruption - something like a cancer.\"\n\nThe latest protests are led by Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister. He is one of many longtime \nmembers of the opposition Democrats struggling to deal with the electoral dominance achieved by Mr Thaksin and \nhis allies since they came to power in 2001 on a surge of votes from the rural poor.\n\nMr Suthep smiled broadly amid the crowds and cameras as he strode about the shopping area of the Nonthaburi \ndevelopment, leaving Akanat Promphan, his spokesman and stepson, to field the trickier questions.\n\nMr Akanat, a 27-year-old Oxford university graduate and former MP and adviser to Mr Suthep, whipped out a \nsmartphone in an effort to scotch the allegation from some critics that the demonstrations are being driven by a \nBangkok-based anti-Thaksin elite. The device displayed a map of Thailand split into colour-coded blocks, with the \ngreen and blue segments dotted around the country showing, according to Mr Akanat, that demonstrations are \nunder way in about 30 of the 77 biggest population centres.\n\n\"It's a very organic, very natural movement,\" Mr Akanat said. \"Tens of thousands of people are surrounding city \nhalls in the south.\"\n\nIt is true that the opposition includes southern rubber farmers squeezed by falling world commodity prices, as well \nas Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Democrat leader and friend of Boris Johnson, the London mayor, from their Eton College \ndays. Twelve turbulent years of Thai politics dominated by pro-Thaksin parties have stirred genuine anger about \nalleged government abuse of power - as the Democrats also faced during their period of hegemony with Mr Suthep \nnow fighting murder charges over the shootings of protesters when he was in government in 2010.\n\nAt Nonthaburi, protesters claim something will give soon - perhaps before the natural pause offered by King \nBhumibol Adulyadej's birthday on Thursday. But even the partisans are vague in their predictions of the outcome of \na cat-and-mouse conflict still defined in good part by absences - first among them Mr Thaksin himself.\n\n\n\n\"We want to end this in the next two or three days by getting this government out,\" said Pantarak Kongnak, a 37-\nyear-old construction business owner. \"Then we will see from our leader what we plan to do next.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Previously \"dead\" plans for plain cigarette packaging backed by Labour were put \nback on the agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, George Osborne will next week set out plans to cut energy bills through a shake-up of environmental \nlevies, in an attempt to offset the success of opposition leader Ed Miliband's call for a 20-month price freeze after \nthe next election.\n\n\"Barely a day goes by without the Tories trying to steal one of our policies,\" said Jon Ashworth, a member of the \nLabour campaign team. \"It shows Ed Miliband is setting the agenda and David Cameron is dancing to our tune.\"\n\nMr Cameron's team insists that introducing policies that are popular with the voters - even if they are associated \nwith Labour - is better than soldiering on with the prospect of parliamentary defeats. \"All this talk about U-turns \ndoesn't bother voters,\" said one aide.\n\nThis willingness to change course is also consistent with the edict of Lynton Crosby, the Tory election chief. Mr \nCrosby said \"barnacles\" - or policy distractions - should be \"scraped off the boat\", in favour of a focus on areas \nvoters are most interested in.\n\nAs a lobbyist for a tobacco company, Mr Crosby had become a barnacle - as long as Labour could claim he was \ninfluencing policy on cigarette packaging. In the end, Mr Crosby went full-time for the Tory party at the start of \nNovember.\n\nThe Australian strategist wants the party to concentrate on just two simple messages: the economic recovery and \nthe choice between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband as the next prime minister.\n\nClearing away policy debris this week will allow the Tory leadership to focus on those two themes next week: Mr \nCameron will be performing on the world stage at the head of a trade delegation to China and Mr Osborne will be \npresenting the most optimistic autumn statement for years.\n\nBritain's economic rebound is also playing its part in recent policy shifts. With the recovery gaining momentum, the \nConservative side of the coalition is more willing to adopt populist policies that might irritate business.\n\nThe decision to take on the payday lenders and tobacco companies this week was accompanied by confirmation \nthat the coalition will introduce up to 50 weeks of shared parental leave in 2015, a Liberal Democrat-inspired policy \ndescribed by the Institute of Directors as an administrative \"nightmare\".\n\nThese socially popular measures will reassure disgruntled Tory modernisers, who have seen the prime minister \nforced to make spending cuts and tack to the right as the recession hit.\n\n\n\nOne backbencher said the about-turns were designed to remind voters of the Conservatives' caring side. \"We have \ndone the heavy lifting on the economy and now it is important to remind voters that we . . . care about creating a \nfairer society.\"\n\nTrying to get a fix on David Cameron's political position becomes harder by the day. In the past week he has \ntoughened his stance on EU migrants, \"rolled back\" the green levies he once supported. At the same time he has \npromised a crackdown on payday lenders and tobacco companies and signed off new rights for fathers to take \nparental leave.\n\nIt is a pragmatic, political mish-mash that drives many Tory MPs to distraction but the prime minister's team claim to \nbe following a template of electoral success: \"It's what Tony Blair did very effectively,\" said one strategist. \"You \nhave to neutralise your opponents' attacks.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It started \nin July and has been gaining momentum ever since. In the last quarter, European equity funds, including those \ninvesting in small and mid-sized stocks, generated net inflows of more than EUR15bn, compared with small \nredemptions of EUR500m in Q2 and EUR3bn or so of inflows in the equivalent period last year.\n\nThis latest quarterly volume data deliver two surprises, the first linked to sheer scale. The figure was not only \nsubstantial compared with recent periods, it was the best on record. Only in 2006 did sales volumes for European \nequity funds come close, reaching EUR13bn during the first quarter.\n\nThe second surprise brings us back to the active/passive issue and the fact that there was very little evidence in the \ndata to suggest any increased support for passive products.\n\nThe same data set showed a mere 17 per cent of sales flows were garnered by passive funds, of which just 10 per \ncent was attributed to ETFs and the remainder to index funds - not what I, nor many other pundits expected.\n\nThis lack of passive interest also flies in the face of the increasingly vocal comments from fund selectors on their \nsearch for lower-cost funds, particularly in relation to beta, or market, exposure.\n\nOf course, there is a distortion in the data that requires explanation; the inclusion of small and mid-cap vehicles will \ninevitably weight the results in favour of the active segment.\n\nHowever, these sectors are modest in asset size and even if we focus on the core European equity sector that \naccounted for nearly EUR11bn of quarterly net inflows, the passive share was less than EUR2bn or 18 per cent of \nthe total.\n\nMy reluctant conclusion is that the passive steamroller has yet to flatten demand for active funds or, to put it another \nway, the impact of fees on client portfolios has yet to be felt by European fund selectors.\n\n\n\nOutside the UK, a ban on commissions is not yet in place (meaning distributors can receive retrocession payments \nfrom asset managers for selling their funds), although it is expected sooner or later by many distributors. So is it the \ncase that their retrocession-fuelled decisions are driving investors into high-cost active funds?\n\nIf true, the UK sales data should have a greater weighting in favour of passives. The comparison is a difficult one to \nmake. UK investors have traditionally treated European equity funds as a marginal, rather than a core, portfolio \nplay. Thus, in the most recent quarter, net inflows into these sectors were just EUR648m, and index trackers \naccounted for just 4 per cent of the total. Unfortunately, a measure of ETF activity in the UK is problematic because \nall ETFs are listed on multiple stock exchanges so it is not possible to know where their sales volumes are derived, \nnor how much is sourced from UK investors.\n\nA better test of UK passive appetite is to look at the groups that are winning business across all equity sectors.\n\nIn such a ranking, BlackRock was the sales leader in the third quarter with Vanguard ranked a close third. For both \ngroups net inflows were almost entirely devoted to index trackers (excluding ETFs for thereasons explained above).\n\nThose groups that feature low-cost tracker offerings clearly have a following but the chase for alpha, or market-\nbeating returns, was still much stronger. In the entire equity space, net sales were EUR440m but a mere EUR73m \nof this was invested in trackers. This suggests that fee scales are not going to be the big driver to passives that \nmany might have expected. It could also mean, of course, that the criteria of fund choice has not changed much, ie \nit is more to do with the potential to deliver performance than a commission grab by distributors.\n\nThere is another issue - a matter of speculation rather than measurable fact: investors have been visibly absent \nfrom equity funds for so long that their immediate response to market opportunity is to pump up their investments \nwith alpha products to make up for ground they have lost on deposit returns or elsewhere.\n\nPossibly the more stable beta component of their portfolios is already in place so the action we are seeing now is in \nthe satellite arena. The fact that small/mid-cap funds have had such a good recent run, seems to support this \nhypothesis.\n\nAny judgment on the issue is probably precipitous but we should not ignore the potential effect of regulation on fees \nin driving greater demand for passives. It may yet come.\n\nDiana Mackay is chief executive of MackayWilliams and publisher of Fund-Radar\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The reason? China.\n\nBetween 2010 and last year, brands from the comparatively small and exclusive Herm\u00e8s to the bling of Louis \nVuitton have seen the mix of China's emerging wealth and its population's love of all things luxury fatten an entire \nindustry - during the leanest times almost anyone can remember.\n\nBut the mighty Chinese engine is moderating - at least by its own high-revving standards - and the new \ngovernment is cracking down on exuberant personal spending and gift-giving by officials.\n\nAs a result, people in the EUR217bn-a-year luxury industry find themselves staring at an uncomfortable but \ninescapable question: is the era of double-digit growth over?\n\nThe answer has huge implications for brand strategy in the world's most populous country - as it does for luxury \ngroups' approaches in other markets. It also has direct implications for the valuation premium that investors have \nplaced on the sector compared with other companies.\n\n\n\n\"Just a few years ago, a slowdown in Chinese consumption would barely have produced a ripple in the luxury \nsector,\" says Luca Solca, a sector analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. \"Today, it has the potential to produce a tidal \nwave.\"\n\nFor the past three years, revenue in the luxury sector has grown at an average of more than 11 per cent a year in \neuro terms, spurred on by Greater China, where revenue grew a heady 19 per cent in 2012, according to a study by \nFondazione Altagamma and Bain & Company. But this year, growth in Greater China is expected to fall to 4 per \ncent, dragging down overall revenue growth to just 2 per cent.\n\nThe falling growth numbers in China caused by the slowing economy and the government's crackdown - or what \nR\u00e9my Cointreau, the Paris-based spirits and liqueurs group, calls \"anti-extravaganza measures\" - have been so \nmarked that the Americas this year surpassed Asia as the luxury sector's main growth engine.\n\nOne of the problems for the brands that produce the world's most expensive and desirable watches, jewellery, \nfashion and bags is that China finally matters. Greater China now accounts for a quarter of Louis Vuitton's revenue, \n35 per cent of Cartier's, and a whopping 45 per cent in the case of Omega, according to Exane BNP Paribas.\n\nHerm\u00e8s, famous for its Birkin and Kelly bags, recently estimated that Chinese consumers could account for more \nthan half of global sales in the coming years.\n\nThe effects of the slowing growth have started to hit home. R\u00e9my Cointreau, maker of $3,000-a-bottle Louis XIII \ncognac, this week warned investors that operating profits would fall at least 20 per cent this year compared with \n2012 as a result of what it described as \"a sharp slowdown in China\".\n\nRevenue at the fashion-and-leather-goods unit of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group by sales and the \nparent of Louis Vuitton, suffered a small decline during the third quarter this year compared with the same period \nlast year. The poorer than expected figures provoked a 6 per cent fall in the group's share price, wiping EUR4bn of \nits market capitalisation.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pflanz, R\u00e9my Cointreau's new chief executive, is convinced that the slowing of growth in China is \ntemporary. \"It will come back,\" he says of demand. \"And when it comes back we will be there.\" Mr Pflanz's business \ncard is printed on both sides - in English and in Chinese.\n\nOther groups point out that even if sales growth is deflating in China, Chinese tourists are still buying abroad. \nAltagamma and Bain estimated that while sales of luxury goods in Greater China are only about 13 per cent of the \nglobal total, the Chinese account for 29 per cent of all luxury customers. In 2005, by contrast, they accounted for \nless than 5 per cent.\n\nHowever, luxury groups are now trading at an estimated 2014 price-to-earnings ratio of about 18.5 times, which is \nroughly 50 per cent higher than the Stoxx 600 index of European companies. That may be in line with historic \nvaluations for the sector, but it also represents a huge increase since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when luxury \nand Stoxx 600 p/e ratios were level pegging on seven times.\n\nL\u00e9opold Authi\u00e9, an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris, asked in a recent report \"whether the sector deserves to \ntrade at the same valuation level as in the past since its growth profile is now less attractive\".\n\nLuxury companies are reacting to the slowdown in several ways.\n\nOne response has been to command higher prices by going upmarket. Gucci, which is owned by Paris-based \nKering, is producing more bags made from exotic skins, such as python. LVMH's Louis Vuitton is also looking to \nestablish higher price points for its products.\n\nOthers are heading in the opposite direction, highlighting the difficulty of formulating an effective brand strategy in \nthe face of China's newfound disdain for luxury gifting. Shuijingfang, one of China's most exclusive brands of the \nspirit baijiu, the Communist party's favourite tipple, will now sell half its product range at Rmb500 a bottle or less - a \nprice point at which the company previously sold nothing.\n\n\n\nAnalysts say luxury groups also have to start looking elsewhere for growth. Mr Luca of Exane BNP Paribas believes \nthat one area is increasing the number of directly-operated stores. Another is ecommerce, where he argues that \nluxury goods groups have been slow to develop effective strategies.\n\nFor now, though, Mr Luca says that one thing is clear: \"The low-hanging fruit has mostly gone.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Consumers' opinion about the country's general economic \nsituation in the past 12 months has grown gloomier, while expectations for the next 12 months increased slightly. \nConsumers were less in the mood to make major purchases in November than in September.\n\nFrance\n\nHousehold consumption of goods decreased 0.2 per cent in October compared with the previous month, after \nhaving decreased by 0.1 per cent in September. The decline in October was influenced by a 4.9 per cent decrease \nin expenditure on energy products. However, household expenditure on durables rose 0.8 per cent month on \nmonth.\n\nIndustrial producer prices declined 0.2 per cent in October month on month, after increasing 0.3 per cent in \nSeptember. Prices for refined petroleum dipped 0.8 per cent, after three months of rises. Following two months of \nstability, import prices of industrial products fell 0.3 per cent - affecting all products, except textiles and apparel, \nwhich went up 0.8 per cent due to the new winter collections.\n\nTurkey\n\nAccording to provisional data, foreign trade deficit increased by 31.8 per cent in October year on year, reaching \n$7,375m. While exports decreased 8.2 per cent to $12,105m, imports went up 3.7 per cent to $19,480m.\n\nSweden\n\nGDP increased 0.3 per cent in the third quarter compared with the third quarter last year. While household \nconsumption expenditure increased 2.1 per cent non-adjusted, production of goods dropped 2.1 per cent. \nSeasonally adjusted, GDP increased 0.1 per cent from September to October.\n\nExports of goods went down 2.9 per cent in volume in the third quarter year on year - mainly due to a decline of 23 \nper cent in exports of mineral fuels, with the exports of petroleum products going down 21 per cent. Meanwhile, \nimports of goods decreased 2.6 per cent year on year, with the dominating sector in imports - machinery and \ntransport equipment - decreasing 0.5 per cent.\n\nItaly\n\nProducer price index decreased 1 per cent from September to October with respect to the previous month. In the \ndomestic market, the index decreased 1.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent on the non-domestic market. Year on year, the \nindex decreased 2.2 per cent, with both domestic and non domestic markets going down, by 2.7 per cent and 0.8 \nper cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter, the number of unemployed people rose 14.6 per cent year on year, with the unemployment rate \nreaching 11.3 per cent of the population. The situation is particularly critical in the south and on the Italian islands, \nwhere 18.5 per cent of the population is unemployed.\n\nSpain\n\nHaving emerged from a two-year recession in the third quarter, Spain registered a current account surplus of \nEUR3bn ($4.1bn) in September, putting the country on track for its first annual profits in decades. A year ago, Spain \nrecorded a EUR15.7bn current account deficit. The year-on-year change was mostly due to a EUR15.5bn  fall in the \ntrade deficit, with Spaniards buying fewer imported goods and domestic companies searching for new markets \nabroad.\n\nAsia\n\nThailand\n\nCurrent account registered a surplus of $376m in October, after a deficit of $530m in September. Year on year, \nexports dropped 0.5 per cent year, much less than the 6.3 per cent decline registered in September. Imports went \ndown 4.6 per cent year on year in October and 6.1 per cent in September.\n\nTaiwan\n\nIn the third quarter, GDP expanded 1.66 per cent year on year. The country has cut its 2013 full-year growth \nforecast for the second time in three months, from 2.31 per cent to 1.74 per cent. In a statement, the government \nattributed the downward revision to uncertainties arising from the restructuring of the Chinese economy and the US \nFederal Reserve's exit from its quantitative easing programme. Thailand has also cut its growth forecast this week.\n\nIndia\n\nGDP grew 4.8 per cent from the second to the third quarter - the fourth successive quarter of economic expansion \nbelow 5 per cent. However, the growth was slightly higher than the 4.4 per cent registered in the second quarter, \npartly due to an expansion in farm output.\n\nAmericas\n\nCanada\n\nGDP expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, following 0.4 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Both \nhousehold final consumption expenditure and business gross fixed capital formation rose 0.6 per cent. After three \nquarters of growth, exports fell 0.5 per cent, with exports of goods and services declining 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per \ncent, respectively. Month on month, GDP grew for 0.3 per cent in September, a third consecutive monthly increase.\n\nAfrica\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn October, the trade deficit went up to 12.4bn ($1.2bn), after a 11.9bn deficit in September. The deficit was, \nthough, smaller than economists expected due to a rebound in car exports following the end of a four-week strike \nby workers in the vehicle-manufacturing and auto-component industries.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Fifty marks the separation between contraction and expansion.\n\nBillions of dollars in cash injections from Gulf countries, two stimulus packages announced by the government and \nhopes of a recovery in tourism have helped generate optimism.\n\nHowever, analysts caution that the return of activity has not been accompanied by any significant new investment.\n\n\"I think sentiment for local businesses has improved a lot but it is difficult to separate their relief at Morsi's departure \nfrom cold business decisions,\" said Simon Kitchen, strategist EFG-Hermes, the Cairo-based regional investment \nbank. \"They are relieved not just because Morsi was not doing a good job managing the economy, but they felt that \ntheir businesses were under threat from his Muslim Brotherhood group trying to nurture an alternative economic \nelite.\"\n\nHe said that foreign investors remained wary of instability in Egypt. In addition, the deferral of big economic reforms \nsuch as the reduction of costly fuel subsidies continued to hamper a strong return of interest in the country.\n\nForeign investors are adopting a \"wait and see attitude,\" according to Mr Kitchen, though some international \ncompanies are now happier to send staff to Egypt after the US allowed the families of embassy employees to return \nhaving ordered their departure in the summer.\n\nThe lifting of a nightly curfew on Cairo and other provinces in mid November helped restore an image of normality in \nthe capital and eased pressures on retailers and local companies transporting goods overnight.\n\nAlthough many manufacturers have shut down or are struggling with debt, Ihab Derias, chairman of the Egyptian \nFurniture Export Council, said there has been \"a complete turnround\" in sentiment within his industry.\n\nHe argued that the expectations of a recovery in tourism has injected new momentum in hotel projects that had \nfaltered over the past two years. Many European countries have now lifted or eased travel bans on Egypt, and \nofficials say they expect tourist numbers to start climbing next year.\n\n\"Stalled projects are now moving,\" said Mr Derias. \"We have new orders. Jobs which take six months to complete, \nwe are being asked to finish in one month. Hotels which were reluctant to spend or were spending slowly now have \ntarget dates to open. For my company, the last quarter in 2013 will improve results for the whole year. We had a \nhorrible third quarter.\"\n\nDuring their year in power, Brotherhood officials spoke of promoting tourism, but according to Mr Derias, investors \nwere put off by comments from within the larger Islamist movement calling for alternatives to sun and sea tourism, \nthe biggest draw in Egypt.\n\n\"We are hoping 2014 will be better, and that at least hotels will break even instead of making losses like before,\" \nsaid Sameh Sobhi, general manager of the Semiramis InterContinental, one of the worst affected establishments \nbecause of its location near Tahrir Square, the iconic centre of protests since the 2011 revolution.\n\nThe recent turmoil in Egypt has severely damaged demand for office and retail space, but the housing market has \nbeen resilient as more Egyptians decided to put their savings in bricks and mortar rather than risk a further \ndevaluation of the currency which lost 18 per cent of its value this year.\n\nAhmed Badrawi, chief executive of SODIC, a high-end developer, said his company has had a record year in 2013, \nwith some E\u00a32.5 bn in sales, higher than their \"best year before the 2011 revolution.\"\n\n\n\n\"In the last two or three months we have seen a big surge,\" he said. \"There is liquidity, there is appetite. Maybe the \nrecent reduction in interest rates encouraged more people to buy.\"\n\nMr Badrawi cautioned, however, that the sector would be held back unless the government could stop the \"settling \nof scores\" with real estate companies. After the 2011 revolution contracts awarding land to developers came under \nlegal scrutiny amid allegations of corruption by the government of Hosni Mubarak.\n\nCar sales are also rising said Menatallah Sadek, corporate finance director of GB Auto, which assembles and \ndistributes a range of passenger vehicles and industrial equipment. September and October were \"phenomenal,\" \nshe said.\n\n\"As management we had two theories,\" she said. \"Either this is pent-up demand after the summer or the start of a \nrecovery. Sentiment is much better. As long as there are no major surprises or disasters, we see early signs of a \nrecovery for consumer demand.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scotland was transformed from a poor peripheral state to one of the world's richest regions. Steam \ntechnology made it a global leader in building ships and locomotives. In the mid-19th century it was common to \ntalk about North Britain.\n\nBut Scotland's performance was less impressive in the 20th century. The manufacturers of west central Scotland \nfailed. Nationalism revived and, in the 1970s, its adherents adopted the unsentimental slogan \"it's Scotland's oil!\" - \nmost of the UK's North Sea wealth was within what would be the territorial waters of an independent Scotland.\n\nIn the 1980s, the strident tones of Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, grated on Scottish nerves. She swept to \nelectoral victory in the UK as a whole, but eroded Conservative support in Scotland. When Labour won power in \n1997, not a single Tory MP was elected north of the border. Labour quickly implemented an election pledge to \nestablish a Scottish assembly.\n\nIn 2007, when Labour's popularity was at a low ebb, the Scottish National party became the largest party in the \nEdinburgh parliament. Alex Salmond, its charismatic leader, led an SNP administration more competent than the \ncoalitions that had preceded it. So he was re-elected in 2011 with a mandate to hold a referendum in Scotland on \nindependence - a poll that will be held in September 2014.\n\nThe speed with which independence for Scotland moved from a vague aspiration to a live issue wrongfooted \npoliticians on all sides. The SNP had few specific ideas of what independence would imply. Mr Salmond and the \nSNP are consistently more popular than their signature policy, and have struggled to win over moderate voters to it. \nThey have attempted to make the case that nothing would really change while everything would be better. The \nproblematic nature of this position is seen in the 667-page blueprint for independence published this week.\n\nIt seeks to reassure that an independent Scotland would have the same queen, the same relationship with the EU \nand the same currency. Her Majesty would no doubt be amenable to remaining Queen of Scotland. Spain and \nBelgium - each contending with their own separatist movements - might be unhelpful, but Scottish accession to the \nEU could certainly be negotiated.\n\nWhere the document does promise change, it is long on pledges and short on how they would be paid for. Its \nheadline-grabbing proposal - the extensive provision of free childcare - is one Scotland already has the power, if not \nthe financial resources, to implement.\n\nThe biggest outstanding question is over which currency an independent Scotland would use. Monetary union with \nthe rest of the UK is the most sensible course - and the one the Scottish government proposes. But in the context of \nthe troubles of the eurozone, the Treasury and Bank of England might be expected to seek extensive control of \nboth Scottish fiscal policy and banking supervision. Yet with Scotland representing only 8.5 per cent of the \n\n\n\nmonetary union, it is hard to imagine them conceding many such rights back to Scotland. While Mr Salmond insists \nthat there is no currency plan B, Scotland would have no negotiating power without one and the rational plan B - a \nScottish pound pegged to sterling - is also the likely outcome.\n\nScotland has income per head broadly in line with the UK average, making it the richest part of the UK outside \nLondon and the southeast. Its industrial and employment structure differs little from that of the UK. Unlike Wales \nand Northern Ireland, Scotland is plainly viable as an independent country.\n\nScottish government revenue is currently principally derived from a block grant from the UK Treasury, which \nsupports public expenditure per capita in Scotland at a level 10-12 per cent higher than the UK. An independent \nScotland would lose this subsidy, but gain most UK oil income. These revenues are uncertain, enabling both sides \nof the debate to find support for conflicting claims about the fiscal consequences of independence. But a more \nimportant question is whether Scottish business would perform better in an independent country.\n\nScotland has suffered from a drain of corporate headquarters activity. The pull of London would remain, but an \nindependent Scotland would have better opportunities to compete. Devolution since 1999 has been associated with \na revival of self-confidence that might gain strength in an independent country. Even small growth effects would \nhave economic consequences far larger than fiscal balances.\n\nBut the centre of political gravity in Scotland is far to the left of that of the UK and that is at the centre of the \nconcerns - widely held but little expressed - of Scottish business over independence. It is possible to imagine a \nfuture for an independent Scotland characterised by reactionary municipal socialism - and the crony capitalism that \nbrought Ireland and Iceland close to economic collapse.\n\nThe polls suggest independence will be defeated. A narrow margin leaves the issue alive - Quebec has done well \nby being always on the point of leaving Canada. A heavy loss would raise questions over the future of the SNP and \nits leadership. Yet arguments over independence that have caused strife elsewhere - from Ireland to Kosovo - have \nnot been about small economic benefits. That this issue dominates discussion in Scotland demonstrates that this \ndebate is not deeply serious. For the degree of economic independence a small European country can enjoy in a \nglobal marketplace is inevitably limited. Nothing that happens in Scotland in September 2014 will change that \nreality.\n\njohnkay@johnkay.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

That may have been hard. The \nbusiness investment data, due to be published on Wednesday at 9.30am, were two quarters out of date for most of \nthe morning. By itself, not such a big thing but this sort of glitch seems to happen too often. It does seem not all is \nwell with the ONS website.\n\nHence its proposal to drip-feed data?\n\nCareful: it's not an ONS idea. It was put forward by the UK Statistics Authority, which oversees the ONS.\n\nAnd why did it propose the idea?\n\nHard to say, especially since I couldn't work out how to download the UKSA report at first. (Its website is a little \ntricky to navigate, too.) But in a nutshell, some data are sensitive: they can move markets, and a trader with early \naccess to the latest figures would have a big advantage. The ONS is finding it hard to publish these data on time - \nhalf the sensitive releases in the first quarter of 2013 were more than a minute late.\n\nA minute late doesn't sound much. Have you tried to catch a train recently?\n\nHigh-frequency traders are making investments to shave a millisecond or two off the time it takes to send and \nreceive data. Usain Bolt's reaction time in the 2012 Olympic 100 metres final was 165 milliseconds; a minute is \n60,000 milliseconds. In context, a minute is a long time.\n\nWhy is it hard to publish on time?\n\nLeaving aside the question of what \"on time\" even means in a world of superfast algorithmic traders, the obvious \nway to publish promptly is to upload the data to the servers in advance, then reveal them at 9.30am. But the servers \naren't secure enough for this, and it would apparently cost several million pounds to fix that. So the ONS begins \nmanually uploading the most sensitive data four seconds before 9.30am and hopes it will go live at about the right \ntime. That process is prone to delay, especially when the data sets are large and eagerly anticipated.\n\n\n\nHence the embarrassing idea of releasing the headlines first and the details later. But does it matter if the market-\nsensitive stuff goes on the site a few minutes late?\n\nPerhaps not. Serious players  probably don't care - they get the data through proprietary trading platforms such as \nBloomberg and Reuters.\n\nAnd the rest of us have to wait.\n\nYes. Which looks bad. But prompt publication of statistics on the ONS site is more of a matter of pride than of \npractical significance. Most ONS watchers are complaining about other things; Mark Carney, the Bank of England \ngovernor, for example.\n\nONS watchers are complaining about Carney?\n\nNo, Carney is complaining about the ONS. He said this week that he wasn't happy with the quality of its data on \ninvestment, didn't put much weight on it and was much more comfortable with the data quality back in his native \nCanada.\n\nOuch.\n\nThe other complaint is the usability of the website. Big beasts of economics journalism, such as Evan Davis of the \nBBC, and the FT's own Chris Giles, have complained that the site is hard to use, especially for casual users asking \nrelatively simple questions.\n\nSounds like a shambles.\n\nThe ONS has my sympathy. It has a thankless task: nobody ever notices when things go right. The data sets were \ncrafted and categorised for a pre-web age, and it is no simple matter to preserve the continuity and integrity of the \ndata while making the site swift and simple to use. The problems with the website have been frankly acknowledged, \nand the ONS is trying to deal with them. But the ONS and UKSA are under severe budgetary pressure: they're \nheading towards a budget of \u00a3150m a year, or \u00a32.50 per person. Not such a lot of money to spend on figuring out \nthe state of the nation.\n\nAnd UKSA's new idea is bound to embarrass the ONS even more.\n\nWell, perhaps by accident, UKSA's idea has achieved something: it's been a loud, clear cry for help.\n\ntim.harford@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He wants Church leaders to scold people less for their sexual arrangements. He \nthinks capitalism in its present, lightly regulated state is a \"new tyranny\".\n\nThe Pope's apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium  (\"Joy of the Gospel\"), was released this week. He calls it a \nset of guidelines for a \"new phase of evangelisation\". The election in March of Francis, a charismatic priest serving \nthe working class of Buenos Aires, was a milestone in this phase.\n\nFor all the Church's recent difficulties, its leaders believe it has vast potential for growth. They are right. The \nconsumerism and materialism of the past decades have wrought economic marvels, but they have left a spiritual \nvoid - what Francis calls \"the desolation and anguish born of a complacent yet covetous heart\". And yet every time \nthe Church clashes with hedonism, it loses. So, at one level, Francis is making his self-abnegating religion more \nmarketable in this consumerist age. He has figured out that people would rather hear about the joys of salvation \nthan the wages of sin. \"An evangeliser,\" he writes, \"must never look like someone who has just come back from a \nfuneral.\"\n\nThis shift should not be mistaken for all-out modernisation. On fundamental questions - which include sex and \nmoney - the Pope is not revising the Church's beliefs, although he may change dramatically its attitude towards \npower.\n\nThe cornerstone of the Pope's thinking is that the Church is a community of sinners, subject to \"self-absorption, \ncomplacency and selfishness, to say nothing of the concupiscence which preys upon us all\". Francis is harder on \nhypocrites within the church than without. His tone is occasionally bilious and angry. His fellow clergymen are \npretentious. They write lousy homilies. They are cliquish and snobby, which leaves people feeling unwelcome. \"The \nEucharist,\" he writes, \"is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak.\"\n\nThose who follow the Catholic Church primarily to root against its sexual teachings will find little to please them in \nthis document, which lays out a number of non-negotiable points. No women priests, no reconsideration of abortion \nand (by implication) no gay marriage. The Pope is not at odds with the way previous popes understood these \nthings. He is just a bit more savvy about how, on television and online, \"certain issues which are part of the \nChurch's moral teaching are taken out of the context which gives them their meaning\".\n\nOn economic matters, the Pope's thinking is radical, albeit somewhat less radical than it looks. There are passages \nin Gaudium that sound like the manifesto of some mid-20th-century revolutionary front. (\"Solidarity is a \nspontaneous reaction by those who recognise that the social function of property and the universal destination of \ngoods are realities which come before private property.\") But the Gospels have always been an uneasy match with \n\n\n\nfree markets. At heart, the Pope is urging believers to pay more attention to the poor. Nothing could be more \nmainstream than that. The poor, and Christians' duty to them, are all over the Gospels. Latin American theology \nsince the 1960s has stressed that theme tirelessly. \"For the Church,\" Francis writes, \"the option for the poor is \nprimarily a theological category rather than a cultural, sociological, political or philosophical one.\"\n\nThese ideas will be harder for the Pope to apply in more prosperous parts of the world, where today there are, \nbroadly speaking, two ways to help the poor. You can help them directly, by giving alms or tutoring or ladling soup. \nThe help this affords is genuine, but it takes the heat off the wider system, centred in the west, which the Pope \nattacks as a tyranny. The other way to help is indirectly, through politics. In advanced European and North \nAmerican democracies, however, \"the poor\" tend not to speak for themselves. They are represented by the more \n\"compassionate\" of parties of the relatively wealthy, whose \"compassion\" often consists of pillaging the other party's \nvoters to compensate their own. The poor wind up an afterthought.\n\nIn less-developed political societies, such as, historically, those of Latin America, it is easier to tell rich from poor. \nAnd a lot more politically charged, too. Either the first New World Pope understands European and North American \npolitics less well than his predecessors or he has revealed a historic shift in the Church's culture. The Vatican may \nstill be in Rome, but the heart of the church is on other continents. After centuries of projecting its attentions \noutward, Catholic Europe now finds itself on the periphery. It is missionary territory.The writer is a senior editor at \nThe Weekly Standard\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

He was the Church of England vicar known as Cinephile in the Financial \nTimes for more than 30 years, alongside a 55-year association with The Guardian, where he took the name \nAraucaria.\n\nGraham, who has died aged 92, long set most of this newspaper's Saturday prize crosswords. The one published \ntoday is his last for the FT and, with one repeated phrase carrying the same meaning throughout, is typical of his \nthemed puzzles that extended the range of what solvers had come to expect.\n\nHe invented the alphabetical jigsaw crossword, where the clues are listed in order of the first letters of their answers \nand must be fitted into the grid wherever they will go. His ability to produce anagrams of long phrases was also \nremarkable.\n\nThere are countless instances where Graham clued phrases that would have defeated lesser compilers and caused \nastonishment to solvers over the breakfast table, on the train to work or when they later looked up the answers and \nfound that though he may have been devious he was never unfair.\n\nJohn Galbraith Graham was born in Oxford on February 16 1921 and educated at Manor House School, Horsham \nand St Edward's, Oxford. He became a classics scholar at King's College, Cambridge, in 1939 but war intervened \nand he joined the RAF, being made an air crew observer. He flew some 30 operations in Italy before he was shot \ndown, bailed out, was rescued by Americans and was eventually mentioned in dispatches.\n\nOn his return to King's he took part in one of the theology tripos. He then studied at Ely Theological College before \nbeing ordained in 1948. Various church posts followed before he became priest in charge at St Michael's \nBeaconsfield in 1955. While there he won the Observer crossword compiling competition two years running and as \na result was invited to compile for the Manchester Guardian, where his first puzzle appeared in 1958.\n\nWhen Graham's marriage broke down in the 1970s, church rules at the time meant he had to leave the ministry. He \nwas not allowed back until the death of his first wife some years later.\n\n\n\nIn 1982 John Perkin, crossword editor of The Guardian, wrote to the FT saying Graham wanted to extend his \ncompiling by a few puzzles a month. He did not wish to set for The Times because he expected (probably rightly) \nthat his clues would be \"pasteurised\". As Perkin's FT counterpart, I accepted gladly.\n\nAraucaria meant monkey puzzle; for the FT he chose Cinephile as an anagram of Chile pine, another name for the \nsame tree. Graham admitted to having been influenced (as are all compilers) by Ximenes - DS Macnutt, the \nlegendary Observer compiler - but his clueing was never slavish to Ximenean linguistic strictures. As he put it, \"any \nclue is legitimate which leads, by whatever route, to an answer which, 80 per cent of the time, can be known to be \ncorrect as soon as it appears to the mind\".\n\nThe range was extraordinary. Over recent years his themes included sauces, counties, track-and-field events, \nScottish writers, places of worship, composers, flowers, female whodunnit writers, cities of Italy spelt in either \nEnglish or Italian, Bonnie Prince Charlie, poets, young animals, castles, Gilbert and Sullivan, Scottish towns, police \nand Tennessee Williams. His Christmas puzzles also roamed widely: one had an Islamic theme, which ruffled a few \nfeathers among more traditionalist readers.\n\nAfter the death 20 years ago of his second wife Margaret, Graham lived alone in Somersham near Huntingdon, \ncomposing his puzzles in an upstairs room while accepting that he would sometimes be called out of retirement to \nfill in at a parish that had a sudden vacancy.\n\nHe was made an MBE in 2005. A lunch in the hall of King's College to celebrate his 90th birthday in 2011 was \nattended by more than 150 friends, admirers and crossword solvers, including a number of younger compilers to \nwhom he had acted as mentor. In the same year he was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs .\n\nWhen diagnosed at the end of 2012 with cancer of the oesophagus, Graham compiled a puzzle for One Across, a \nmagazine he had founded, where answers included those words as well as others such as \"palliative care\". It was a \nmoving and dignified way to say farewell.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Italy already gave its banks a similar helping hand in 2011.\n\nDTAs arise when a bank makes losses or incurs provisions that it can later offset against its tax bill. Under the new \nBasel III regime, such assets can no longer be counted as regulatory capital - a change that could have forced \nweakly capitalised lenders to raise billions in additional funding. Tax credits, in contrast, will still count towards a \nbank's capital cushion under Basel III.\n\nThe move comes amid a flurry of action by Spanish banks to strengthen their balance sheets through disposals, \nlistings and by raising fresh capital. BBVA last month sold down its stake in a Chinese lender to avoid the penalty \nthat Basel III attaches to large financial holdings.\n\nSantander and Banco Popular sold their property management arms this month, while Caixabank and the La Caixa \nfoundation have issued shares and exchangeable bonds.\n\nThese measures will be dwarfed, however, by the financial impact of the government announcement made on \nFriday. Across the sector, Spanish banks have amassed more than EUR70bn in DTAs, of which about EUR50bn \nare linked to their operations in Spain itself - equivalent to 40 per cent of core equity tier one capital.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Bankia, the nationalised former savings bank, DTAs account for more than 80 per cent of tangible \nbook value, according to research published this year by N+1, the investment bank. The corresponding figure for \nSantander, Spain's biggest bank by assets, was still about 40 per cent.\n\nShares in Spanish banks were broadly unchanged on Friday, suggesting investors had mostly priced in the widely \nanticipated move. Analysts also pointed out that the shift, though welcome, did little to bolster the banks' underlying \nfinancial strength.\n\n\"This is a change in the regulatory treatment of capital. There is no change to the real equity loss absorption \ncapacity of the banks. This does not change a bank's real ability to withstand losses,\" said Daragh Quinn, a Madrid-\nbased banking analyst for Nomura, the investment bank.\n\nThe main benefit of the Spanish move, analysts said, was that it was likely to reduce the regulatory pressure on \nbanks such as Bankia and Sabadell, two lenders that have been particularly reliant on DTAs, to raise additional \ncapital as a result of the Basel III change.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

For \ninstance, there are people who will happily pay $1,500 for a warm goose-down jacket - from stores in steamy Miami \nand Taipei. That is part of the case for buying into the initial public offering of Moncler, an Italian skiwear maker with \nrevenues of EUR490m last year. In terms of growth, Moncler hopes to apply its French Alps heritage to selling \nhigh-tech city-wear to rich young things in Asia and North America.\n\nFor its Milan listing, Moncler is going for a glamorous valuation. The midpoint of the proposed EUR8.75 to \nEUR10.25 per share range would give it a market capitalisation of EUR2.4bn and put the shares on about 20 times \nlikely 2014 earnings. More than that would be unwise. Private equity backers Carlyle, which owns a fifth of the \ncompany, and Eurazeo, with about half, would still have half of their stake left to sell after the IPO. They need a \nstable after-market. And the listing is supposed to be a marker of Moncler's status as a sophisticated brand - that is, \nnot for the brash or nouveau riche.\n\nThe big risk for Moncler is that its pricey puffy coats become bling. Since leading a buyout in 2003, chairman and \ncreative director Remo Ruffini has carefully guided the company towards measured growth. That has included \nbuilding out Moncler's own stores. At about 70 per cent, gross margins in the next few years are likely to rival those \nof peers in the luxury sector, and its return on capital of 22 per cent looks decent enough.\n\nMr Ruffini is also sticking around: he will not be selling any of his 32 per cent stake in the offering. And against a \nbling future, Moncler is next targeting North America, which accounts for only a tenth of revenues, for expansion \nrather than somewhere riskier, such as China.\n\nThe shares of luxury goods companies are not cheap these days; Moncler would not be alone at 20 times earnings. \nBut that sort of valuation would put it at a premium to Burberry. And compared with Burberry, which has gone far \nbeyond its raincoats, Moncler still has to grow past those warm down jackets - including in hotter climes.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

After writing three novels in his native Dari - one of the two main languages of Afghanistan - \nRahimi turned to French for this fourth book, which won France's top literature award, the Prix Goncourt.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nHe found that the story of an Afghan woman who cares for her much older husband after he is paralysed by a bullet \nrequired an earthy language anchored in reality, such as French, as opposed to a lyrical, unworldly one, such as \nDari. As the wife confides her years of pent-up frustrations to her prone, speechless husband, her language is by \nturns loving, crude, determined and fearful. It is all French. So it's interesting that Rahimi decided to revert to Dari \nfor the film version.\n\n\"When it was in novel form I started to translate The Patience Stone from French into Dari, but I just couldn't do it,\" \nsays Rahimi, whose carefully studied appearance - goatee beard, wide-brimmed felt hat and flowing foulard - gives \nhim a swashbuckling air. \"Cinema was a way for me to translate my novel, not only into images but also into my \nmother tongue,\" he continues. \"By using images I found myself able to sidestep my reserve regarding the language \nand what it can express. Even my actress, Golshifteh Farahani, who is incredibly open-minded, would say to me \n'No, Atiq, I can't say something like that in Dari.' So I used images to say things that I couldn't say with dialogue.\"\n\nWe are sitting in Rahimi's work den in Montparnasse, a place of \"solitude\" to which he can escape. \"As I'm an \ninsomniac, it's very difficult for my family [his wife and two children] to see me still up at four or five in the morning ... \n\"\n\nHe wrote much of the script for The Patience Stone here, aided by the veteran French screenwriter Jean-Claude \nCarri\u00e8re who was Bunuel's writing partner for many years. \"We work well together,\" he says, alternately munching \nfrom a bowl of sesame seeds and sipping on a Scotch. \"I came up with the structure and he is terrific with the \ndetails. One of the things we discussed at length was how to transform the present into the past in the way \nBergman does in Wild Strawberries. Jean-Claude was very adept at incorporating flashbacks without making them \ntoo obvious.\"\n\nInitially Rahimi was worried that Farahani, an Iranian actress who starred in Asghar Farhadi's About Elly (2009) and \nappeared with Leonardo DiCaprio in Ridley Scott's Body of Lies (2008), might be wrong for the main part. \"I didn't \nwant her beauty to detract from the character's story,\" he says. \"But when I'd done some tests and she told me \nabout the things she'd experienced in Iran, I knew I'd found the right actress. Apparently at one time she used to \nwalk around the streets of Tehran with her head shaved, disguised as a boy, so that she didn't have to cover up.\"\n\nRahimi's green eyes twinkle as he recounts Farahani's rebellious behaviour. In his captivating film, where myth and \nreality are constantly in flux, we discover the sadness of a culture in which women are reduced to a question of \nsexuality not personality. \"In Afghan society there is the idea that if a woman's ankle or her hair is visible then it is \nenticing,\" he says, momentarily evincing the hint of a stutter now all but mastered. \"You have to be sexually \nobsessed to think that way. So yes, indeed, a woman is reduced to her sexual function.\"\n\nWhile many have compared The Patience Stone to the story of Scheherazade it was Gustave Flaubert's classic \nnovel of a fallen woman who dared act out her fantasies, Madame Bovary, that Rahimi says was \"a huge indirect \ninfluence\". Rahimi has had a long love affair with French literature. Born in Kabul in 1962, he was educated at the \nelite Franco-Afghan Lyc\u00e9e Esteqlal, which still operates in the Afghan capital today. \"My father was a \ngermanophone, my brother, sister and mother were anglophones,\" he explains. \"They wanted someone from the \nfamily to be a francophone.\" Later, as a university student in Kabul, Rahimi was censored by the dominant \ncommunist youth committee for giving a talk on Albert Camus, whom they accused of being a \"bourgeois \nintellectual\".\n\n\"For the communists who held power at the time, Camus, Sartre, even Andr\u00e9 Malraux were all held to have been in \nforeign pay,\" he says. \"I didn't want to ally myself with the young communist movement, or the royalists who my \nfather supported, I was perturbed by all that.\" Instead Rahimi sought asylum in France, where he arrived in 1985. \nAfter completing his film studies at the Sorbonne he joined a Paris-based production company for whom he directed \nseveral documentaries, including one about Afghanistan's exiled former monarch, Mohammed Zahir Shah.\n\nIn 2000 he published his first novel Earth and Ashes, a Beckettian tale of thwartedness about an old man and his \ngrandchild set during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which he also crafted into a compelling film in 2004. Two \nyears before that, after the fall of the Taliban, he had ended 17 years of exile by returning to Kabul. There he \nemployed a primitive box camera left behind by the British 150 years earlier to take photographs of his war-\n\n\n\nwounded city: last year the Victoria and Albert Museum in London purchased six of these pictures for their \npermanent collection. And his latest novel A Curse on Dostoevsky, which revisits Crime and Punishment in an \nAfghan setting, has recently been translated into English.\n\nHis current projects include another screenplay with Carri\u00e8re, which is set between Brussels and India, and a Paris \nexhibition of his photographs and calligraphy, some examples of which he proudly shows me. \"When I've written a \nnovel it's very hard for me to throw myself straight into another one,\" he says. \"Yet I can't not work, I have to find \nsomething to do. I'm excited by each different art form for the way it can reveal a different dimension of a reality or a \nthought.\"\n\nThroughout Rahimi's novels and films we encounter characters who have lost their power of speech or are \nsomehow stymied in the way they express themselves or understand others. It is a theme that Rahimi believes will \ncontinue to absorb him. \"For centuries there was a pressure, a form of dictatorship which emanated as much from \nreligion as it did from tradition and politics,\" he says. \"The goal was to forbid people from speaking up. Even today \nin Afghanistan our lips are sealed, our ears and our bodies are sealed. Our problem is not to be or not to be, but to \nsay or not to say.\"\n\n'The Patience Stone' is released in the UK on December 6\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morning \nsunlight is turning the shaggy coats of the wild ponies the colour of horse chestnuts as they saunter across our path \nsingle-file. We make our way through the trees to the edge of the forest where our cottage is waiting, kick off our \nwellies at the front door and set about building a fire in the wood burner. It's almost lunchtime and I'm feeling \npeckish, so I pick up the phone. Within minutes, a golf buggy comes trundling up the drive laden with goodies.\n\nOur woodland hideaway may be rustic, but we're certainly not roughing it. It's one of three new cottages recently \nopened within the grounds of Lime Wood, the five-star country house hotel run by Robin Hutson, co-founder of the \nHotel du Vin chain. Hutson felt the hotel was not fully geared up to accommodate families, so he set about \nconverting the former gatehouse and an old stable block of the Regency manor house into three self-contained \ncottages.\n\n\"Everyone loves the idea of a cabin in the woods,\" says Hutson. \"We knew we could never match the nobility of the \nmain house, so it was important to give the cottages a character of their own.\"\n\nThe designer's brief was to recreate the rough-hewn romance of a \"woodsman's cottage\" - albeit a woodsman with \na subscription to Elle Decor magazine and a taste for the finer things in life. Chunky wooden bed frames are \nsoftened with the finest white bed linen, dark walls of unvarnished oak are offset with funky gilt mirrors, while the \nrustic-luxe theme reaches its apogee in the enormous upstairs bathroom with its walk-in shower for two, roll-top \nbath, Bamford organic unguents and \"chill-out zone\" with two leather armchairs and a pile of Vogue back issues.\n\nSo far, so stylish. But the all-important family-friendly details are in place too: my daughter is captivated by the cosy \nlittle bunk room (with a pile of Julia Donaldson books for bedtime reading), there's a stack of board games \ndownstairs, and the tiny kitchenette is just right for heating up some pasta or baked beans. You probably wouldn't \nattempt to cook a Sunday roast in it, but then, why would you want to, with Angela Hartnett's new restaurant, \nHartnett Holder & Co, at the top of the drive?\n\nIt's a winning combination: guests get the freedom, space and privacy of their own house, but with the facilities of a \nfive-star hotel on tap, while hoteliers get to add to their bed count without having to carry out disruptive building \nwork on the main hotel. It's no surprise to learn that Hutson is looking for other suitable spots within the grounds of \nLime Wood to \"sneak a couple more in\", nor that the concept is being emulated at five-star hotels across the \ncountry, as they look to tap into the increasingly lucrative family market.\n\n\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;\n\nAt Barnsley House, a beautiful Cotswold stone manor house in Gloucestershire, expansion within the boundaries of \nthe 17th-century listed building and gardens was out of the question and the room layout of the historic building was \nfar from family-friendly. So when the opportunity to take over the lease of a historic cottage in the village came up, \nthe owners jumped at the chance. Home Farm Cottage opened its doors in August. Unlike many of the cottages \nfound within the grounds of hotels, this one is completely self-contained and fully equipped for self-catering. Guests \ncan immerse themselves in village life, but with the added benefit of luxury fittings and furnishings on a par with \nthose found in the hotel, and access to all of the facilities, including the spa and cinema, a short walk away.\n\n\"We live hectic lives and the reality is that we often don't get to spend a great deal of time with our kids. Luxury \nhotels were missing out on this market, but if you do it well, you can welcome children and it doesn't have to impact \non the other guests,\" says Barnsley House general manager Michele Mella.\n\nIt's not a case of guests in the cottages in the grounds being the poor relations to those in the big house - quite the \nreverse in fact. Prices at these new deluxe cottages usually start well above the rate for a hotel room, so the onus is \non hoteliers to come up with something pretty special.\n\nAt Cliveden House in Berkshire, for example, guests pay upwards of \u00a31,800 a night to stay in the beautifully \nrestored summer house that reopened earlier this year on the banks of the river Thames. Originally built as a tea \nroom for the Countess of Orkney in 1813, Spring Cottage was a favourite haunt of Queen Victoria. In the 1960s it \nbecame infamous as the house where Stephen Ward and Christine Keeler were staying at the time of the Profumo \nscandal. It had fallen into dilapidation but has now been transformed into a secluded and exclusive retreat for up to \nsix guests, with vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows, landscaped gardens and a private river launch. The hotel \ncan provide a personal butler and guests get full use of the main house, the spa, gym and tennis centre, and free \nrange of the gorgeous National Trust-owned grounds.\n\nWhile the advantages for families are clear, it's not only parents who value the added privacy that a cottage brings. \nDormy House, a hotel close to the Cotswolds village of Broadway, is about to complete a \u00a310m, 10-month \nrenovation, which includes the conversion of a stone outbuilding (once used as a cleaners' storeroom) into Rose \nCottage. To be fair, it is on the far side of the car park from the main hotel, rather than lost in woodland on a huge \nestate, but it is still an ideal retreat for couples, blending pretty floral fabrics with some high-tech gadgets and a \nluxurious bathroom.\n\nOver the coming months, more country house hotels will be putting their stamp on the humble holiday cottage. The \nCeltic Manor Resort, near Newport in Wales, will launch 10 four-bedroom wooden lodges with saunas and whirlpool \nbaths in February. And the Isle of Eriska Hotel, a Baronial pile on a private island on the west coast of Scotland, will \ncelebrate its 40th anniversary next year with the opening of two standalone suites on the bluff above the main \nhouse. Built to a modern, sustainable design, the Applecrates (which take their name from the company that \ndesigns them) will have floor-to-ceiling windows and hot tubs with views of Loch Creran. The new properties join the \nexisting Arnott's House, a three-bedroom beachside house, which the hotel is letting on an exclusive-use basis for \nthe first time this winter.\n\nBack in the New Forest, Robin Hutson is looking into the possibility of creating three new family cottages within the \ngrounds of The Pig, the popular Hampshire bolt-hole credited with reinventing the country house hotel when it \nopened three years ago.\n\n\"It's not like 20 years ago when country house hotels didn't want children running around,\" says Hutson. \"People \ndon't necessarily want to dumb down their travel experience when they have children these days. They want to stay \nin nice places and be looked after. If we are going to accommodate them, then let's make sure we do it properly.\"\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by \nemail or post to the web.\n\nNicola Iseard\n\nEditor, Fall-Line magazine\n\nOne of my earliest childhood memories is learning to ski, aged four, dressed in a brand new, baby-blue, all-in-one \nski suit from C&A - which, my mum reckons, cost about \u00a315 - with a matching blue hat. Twenty-seven years later \nand I'm editor of Fall-Line, a skiing and snowboarding magazine, and still wearing matching skiwear: purple top, \npurple bottoms, purple and white hat. However, the cost of the Norr\u00f8na Lofoten jacket and pants I am currently \nwearing is just shy of \u00a3900. But then this is one of the most tech-packed get-ups I have ever worn.\n\nThe Norr\u00f8na brand dates back to 1929, when a Norwegian named J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen, a lover of the great outdoors, \nbegan to produce technologically advanced gear that could withstand Norway's often harsh climate and terrain. \nFast forward 84 years, and the company, run by J\u00f8rgensen's great-grandson, still operates on similar principles.\n\nMy outfit, for example, is made with new Gore-Tex Pro fabric, which features a polytetrafluoroethylene multilayer \nmembrane. I'm not sure what that means exactly, except that it makes the fabric up to 28 per cent more breathable \nthan previous versions. This is an essential feature in freeride skiing-specific gear, such as the Lofoten jacket and \ntrouser, which are designed for off-piste forays that usually involve some degree of hiking to virgin powder away \nfrom the pistes. (Incidentally, on expeditions like this, regardless of how breathable the fabric is, you are still likely to \noverheat.)\n\nThere wasn't much powder at Snowtrax, the artificial ski slope in Dorset where I tested the Lofoten on a balmy \nautumn day, so I was concerned about how hot I might feel with a merino mid-layer underneath. But during my \nclimb to the peak I simply whipped open the jacket's underarm vents and the full-length vents on the pants, all of \nwhich have easy-pull, two-way zips, and didn't sweat a drop. Rain wouldn't be a problem either: the fabric has the \nwater-repellent properties of cling film; water just beads up and rolls off.\n\nHad I been in a situation where there was waist-deep powder, however, there was also no chance of it getting into \nmy jacket: the removable powder skirt (material inside the jacket that clips together and sits snug to your body) has \na good fit, plus a silicon grip to keep it in place, aided with poppers that secure it to the trousers.\n\nIn addition, the trousers have an integrated zip-off bib - not normally my favourite feature, as it often feels restrictive, \nbut here it was so lightweight and elasticated that I forgot it was there after the first five minutes. Similarly, \nelasticated gaiters ensure no snow creeps in down below, while a helmet-compatible, wire-brimmed hood protects \nthe head.\n\nThere are two decent-sized pockets on the jacket (one has a handy goggle-wipe cloth attached to the inside), which \nsit clear of backpack straps, as well as a small interior zip pocket for a phone or money. I would have liked an \ninterior mesh pocket - useful for storing goggles on lifts - but the two thigh pockets on the trousers are roomy \nenough to serve this purpose. There is also a large back pocket and a small key card pocket at the waist.\n\nWhen I posted a picture of myself wearing the outfit on Facebook, I got 23 \"likes\", with several people commenting \non the purple and green colour combination. \"There's no chance of losing you in a whiteout!\" commented one \nfriend. The jacket also comes in green, yellow and two different blues, while the trousers come in green, blue and \nblack.\n\nThe fit of both jacket and trousers is relaxed, verging on loose. I tested a medium, which is what I normally wear in \nski gear, but given that I could have fitted the photographer down one leg, I would probably buy the small \n(Scandinavian ski gear often comes up large). Regardless of that, the Velcro adjustable waist tabs ensured the \ntrousers stayed in place.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who - like me - wore all-in-one ski suits back in the day and feel nostalgic now, the Lofoten range \nalso includes a unisex Gore-Tex Pro one-piece suit. Just don't forget to pair it with a matching hat.\n\nnorrona.com\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTom Robbins\n\nFT travel editor\n\nIn the 1980s, when ski racers were gods, their boldly-patterned skin suits and shiny, futuristic helmets inspired the \nexuberant clothes worn by many a downhill holiday maker. \"Then in 2010, freeskiing finally broke through,\" says \nReinhard Schitter, product director for clothing at Atomic, a leading skimaker. \"Freeskiing\" - skiing off-piste, heading \naway from the resorts and into the wilderness - \"changed the entire world of skiing.\"\n\nAnd the world of skiing wardrobes with it, as anyone shopping for new gear recently would have noticed. Out have \ngone the race pants and tight-waisted neon suits; \"backcountry\" skiing, walking your way uphill on your skis, rather \nthan using lifts, to access fresh powder fields means getting hot, so you need layers to regulate heat. Padded, \ntraditional ski jackets are useless for this. Instead, skiers need to dress more like mountaineers. The same trickle-\ndown effect that brought the aesthetics of racing to the ordinary slopes has ushered in an era of new, highly \ntechnical and far more sober backcountry looks; the novelty hats and poles with inbuilt hip-flasks that once filled the \npages of ski-shop catalogues have been replaced by shovels, avalanche probes and rucksacks.\n\nAdmittedly, I did feel like my \u00a31,000-plus Arc'teryx outfit was taking it a bit far, especially since I tried it out not in the \nAlaskan backcountry but on the backstreets of Hemel Hempstead (where the indoor Snow Centre offers the closest \npistes to London). Arc'teryx epitomises the modern look, and has impeccable freeskiing credentials. The company \nstarted out in 1991 in Vancouver, making climbing harnesses under the name Rock Solid, before diversifying into \nrucksacks and then, finally, skiwear. Rather than the racing slopes, its ideas came from climbing and camping, \nstraight from the backcountry.\n\nI tried a new version of the Sidewinder SV jacket, which is uninsulated, unpatterned, monochrome - and costs \u00a3500. \nThe main difference to its previous incarnation is the lack of lining, cutting weight from 690g to 585g. Cynics might \ndetect a whiff of emperor's new clothes here - you strip a product back to basics, then charge more. But great \nthought has gone into the tiniest details: the waist pockets are high enough not to be impeded by a climbing \nharness, while a lift-pass pocket on the left arm can be easily swiped on automated gates. The hood has a \nstrengthened peak; the underarms, long ventilation zips. Warmth comes from wearing layers underneath, either \nsynthetic or down.\n\nI opted for a Cerium LT (\u00a3240), part of a new range of down jackets, the first that Arc'teryx has made. Down still \noffers more warmth for its weight than any other fabric but only if it's dry, so teaming it with a waterproof shell such \nas the Sidewinder works well, especially since the Cerium uses \"down composite mapping\" (swapping feathers for \nsynthetic insulation in places prone to condensation or damp: cuffs, underarm and collar).\n\nI was not entirely convinced by the \"maize\" colour of my Sabre trousers (\u00a3370) but, again, the quality and detail \nwere clear: thigh vents to release heat, an inbuilt reflector to help during an avalanche rescue, and instep patches \nto prevent abrasion. The only problem is the width of the trouser leg (30cm): anyone embarking on serious \nbackcountry skiing will need to wear crampons occasionally, and a leg this wide would get caught in the spikes and \nwould soon be ripped to shreds.\n\nStill, that's a detail unlikely to worry most users, who might aspire to the wilderness but are likely to spend more \ntime on pistes and in apr\u00e8s-ski bars. True, there might be something risible about wearing kit fit for the Himalayas \non Hertfordshire's faux Alps but if you didn't know its origins, all you would know was the Arc'teryx kit is light, warm \nand comfortable. The fact is, apart from the price, there's no real downside in wearing backcountry gear for an \n\n\n\nordinary ski trip. Plus, on the train back to London, the simple grey jacket blended in far better than a neon one-\npiece ever could.\n\narcteryx.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Her partially paralysed body is strapped into a walking frame and she is half-watching Beauty and the \nBeast on a television. \"I'm tired, Mummy,\" she tells her mother every now and again.\n\nMar\u00eda and Leidy are taking a brief break from a very raw battle for survival. The doctors have been frank in their \nprognosis: one more setback and the little girl is unlikely to live much longer. Mar\u00eda is determined to fight for her \nchild, however, and so she has made the sort of \"drop everything\" decision that parents all over the world have to \nmake when confronted by a child's serious illness.\n\nThe family's entire life has been reoriented around Leidy. Mar\u00eda has given up her job selling tamales to relocate to \nthe capital and is renting a room near the hospital. For the past few months Leidy's two-year-old sister has been \nliving with her grandmother in the family's home town, five hours west of Bogot\u00e1. Leidy's father is out of the picture \nand does little to help, Mar\u00eda says, and she is surviving on about $60 a week from family and friends. Half of this \ngoes on rent.\n\nEvery visit to the hospital costs the equivalent of $6 on taxis there and back. \"I cannot take her in a minibus,\" Mar\u00eda \nexplains, almost apologising for what she can't help but see as an extravagance.\n\nYet Leidy is \"a source of strength for me and I for her,\" Mar\u00eda insists. \"It breaks my heart because I know she could \ndie any minute.\" Leidy's fight is a heartbreakingly difficult one but Mar\u00eda has good reason to maintain some hope.\n\nIn many ways, Colombia is an example of what can be done in the developing world to make sure that children with \ncancer get the best care available. Daunting problems remain but in recent years the future has brightened for \nchildren with cancer in Colombia, thanks in part to its work with World Child Cancer, the charity partner for this \nyear's FT Seasonal Appeal.\n\nThe country's National Cancer Institute is now far better resourced than many other facilities in the developing \nworld. It houses some of the best doctors in Colombia and the paediatric unit has 26 single rooms and a new \nintensive care unit. Over the past four years it has benefited from a special partnership with World Child Cancer that \nhas seen medical staff receive valuable training and mentorship from some of the world's leading paediatric \noncologists as part of a \"twinning programme\".\n\nWorld Child Cancer was founded in 2007 by the late Geoff Thaxter and colleagues from his time at the UK's largest \nchildren's cancer charity, Clic Sargent. Thaxter, who lost his own daughter to cancer, wanted to help children with \ncancer in developing countries, where little treatment was available. This year WCC will help more than 3,000 \nchildren in nine countries and hopes to reach 10,000 children annually by 2018.\n\nThe Bogot\u00e1 institute is a long way from catching up with the results seen in places such as the UK where eight in 10 \nchildren diagnosed with cancer survive, but the outside help is making a difference. Since WCC and the US-based \nDana-Farber Cancer Institute began working with National Cancer Institute doctors in 2009, the survival rate for \ncases treated at the Bogot\u00e1 facility has risen from less than 30 per cent to better than 65 per cent.\n\nMuch of the change is attributed to the work doctors have done to reduce the number of families who abandon \ntreatment. Before the partnership with WCC, as many as a third of children diagnosed with cancer abandoned \n\n\n\ntreatment - usually because of the financial strain cancer puts on impoverished families. This year the figure is \nexpected to be close to 2 per cent.\n\nThe number of deaths attributed to the toxicity of chemotherapy has also been vastly reduced. Before 2009, when \nthe WCC/Dana-Farber project began, 30 per cent of patients' deaths at the National Cancer Institute were attributed \nto toxicity, according to WCC figures. This year that is expected to be just 1 per cent.\n\n\"We are doing very good things here,\" says Dr Martha Pi\u00f1a, one of the institute's paediatric oncologists. There is, of \ncourse, more to be done, and Dr Pi\u00f1a and her peers bemoan the health system in Colombia which means parents \nof children with cancer often have to fight to get treatment.\n\nA law passed in 2010 gives all children with cancer a right to integral treatment and requires Colombia's health \ninsurance companies to pay costs without delays. Such political gestures can have a huge impact on the survival \nchances for children with cancer, says Dr Andreas Ullrich, lead medical officer for cancer control at the World \nHealth Organisation. He cites the example of Peru, where the treatment of childhood cancer is free and the \ngovernment has opened a facility in Lima offering first-world treatments such as bone marrow transplants. \"They \nmade it very clear that if you have political will, if you have political interest, in cancer it makes a lot of difference,\" \nDr Ullrich says.\n\nIn Colombia, doctors and patients' parents complain that the law is often ignored. And, they say, it does little to \naddress the economic burden of cancer on poor families. Child patients are often bounced around the system, \nreceiving fractured care at a time when their lives depend on it.\n\n\"The twinning programme [with WCC] has worked but we have already reached a ceiling,\" Dr Pi\u00f1a says. \"Now we \nhave physicians 24 hours a day, we have a new [intensive care unit], we have an established programme to avoid \n[patients abandoning] treatment, education, good oncologists - a lot of things we did not have before. But the law \nlimits us.\"\n\nAlejandro Gutierrez, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has worked with the Colombian institute as part of \nthe WCC/Dana-Farber partnership, voices frustration with the system. \"The terrible part is that all of the elements \nare in place to cure the majority of children with cancer in Colombia,\" he says. \"Yet the people who are profiting \nfrom the current health delivery system seem to have no misgivings about letting children die of curable diseases to \nmaintain their profit margins.\"\n\nThe frustration is shared by the parents of patients at the Bogot\u00e1 institute. They complain that they have been \nforced to fight their health insurers to secure proper care for their children. All have seen delays during potentially \ncrucial treatment, and all tell stories of a healthcare system that has at some point let their children down. The \nNational Cancer Institute is, however, a ray of hope in this dysfunctional system.\n\nIn June, when 11-year-old Donoban Steep L\u00f3pez came down with flu, his parents thought nothing of it, largely \nbecause his mother and 15-year-old brother were ill at the same time. Donoban, however, didn't get better. \"No \npaediatrician was able to tell us what he really had. They sent him home a couple of times, saying it was nothing \nbut a viral flu\" says Donoban's father, Alfonso L\u00f3pez.\n\nEventually, a doctor ordered blood tests, which apparently confirmed the diagnosis but Donoban deteriorated and \nthe mystery grew until a relative who is a nurse took the test results to a paediatrician at the private clinic where she \nworks. \"Two hours later, at 8pm, we got a call saying we needed to take Donoban urgently to the [emergency \nroom],\" Mariela Sierra, his mother, says. \"And at 3am they told us he probably had leukaemia.\"\n\nThat was five months ago. Donoban has acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and the diagnosis brought significant \nchange for the family, who live in one of Bogot\u00e1's poorest neighbourhoods. Alfonso, who used to earn some $300 a \nmonth as a waiter now earns half that, having cut down his working hours to take care of his son.\n\nThe battles with bureaucracy continue and the family occasionally has to wait up to two weeks for approval for \nmedicines. But in the care of the National Cancer Institute, Donoban's fightback is well under way. In the institute's \n\n\n\nplayroom, wearing the yellow jersey of Colombia's national team and playing a football game on an Xbox, Donoban \nis optimistic: \"I feel well now [and] I want to go back home and play football.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLetter from the editor\n\nThis year the staff of the Financial Times have chosen to support World Child Cancer (WCC), a London-based \ncharity that does impressive work in the developing world. It is estimated that in those countries about 100,000 \nchildren, who could be saved with comparatively simple treatments, die unnecessarily from cancer each year. \nWCC's mission is to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care for those children.\n\nFT reporters have visited the charity's projects in Myanmar, Colombia, Ghana and Malawi. We will publish their \nwork in the FT over the next six weeks, aiming to raise awareness and funds for the charity. Allison Ogden-Newton, \nchief executive of WCC, is hopeful that funds raised can transform the charity. \"With the help of the Financial Times \nand its readers we will achieve a step change in overcoming the crisis in childhood cancer in the developing world.\"\n\nSince 2005, the FT's seasonal appeals have raised more than \u00a311m. WCC has already received pledges of \nmatching funds from the UK government, Celgene, the Switzerland-based pharmaceuticals company, and the Vitol \nFoundation.\n\nJustine Greening, secretary of state for international development, says the British government will match all UK \ndonations to WCC. \"We will help them improve diagnosis, treatment and care for thousands of children in \nBangladesh and Ghana who would not otherwise get help. This means their families can focus on earning money \nand lifting themselves out of poverty for good,\" she says.\n\nSamantha Pearce, general manager at Celgene, says that with the additional money \"the work of this admirable \ncharity will give hope to even more of the world's poorest children\".\n\nI encourage you to follow our reporting of World Child Cancer's activities at ft.com/appeal and to give generously to \na life-changing cause.\n\nLionel Barber\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He whirrs them in a tight 360-degree spin or \nbrings them down on the beat like a conductor. Sometimes he tightens his fists to emphasise frustration, or holds \nhis hands flat - palms upwards, fingers splayed - as though weighing two bags of rice. At one point he stretches \nboth arms over his head before bringing them together as if along an invisible monkey bar. What could be \nprompting so much passion? You guessed it. We are talking economics.\n\nIn Chang's hands, though, economics is not dry. The 50-year-old South Korean-born academic is the author of \nseveral bestselling books on the subject, leavened with wit and bearing provocative titles such as 23 Things They \nDon't Tell You About Capitalism (2010) and Bad Samaritans: The Guilty Secrets of Rich Nations and the Threat to \nGlobal Prosperity (2007). His 23 Things, which claims that free markets don't exist and that the washing machine \nchanged society more than the internet, has sold 650,000 copies and been translated into 32 languages. All in all, \nhe estimates, his books have been bought by more than 1.3m people - not bad for an economist who turned up in \nCambridge 27 years ago barely able to speak English. Yet in an email sent before we meet, he spells out an irony. \n\"I am one of the most successful economists, according to what markets tell us, though most of my professional \ncolleagues, who are much keener to accept market outcomes than I am, would dismiss me as a crank or - the worst \nof all abuses among economists - a 'sociologist'.\"\n\nChang conducts his guerrilla war against economic orthodoxy from a cramped office at Cambridge university's \nSidgwick site. For him, economics is a tool for changing the world, not for explaining why the world is as we find it. \n\n\n\nHe is a reader at Cambridge rather than a full professor, a relative sidelining he attributes to his heterodox \napproach. \"I don't do maths,\" he says, blinking softly through his round, silver-rimmed spectacles. \"A lot of \neconomists think I'm not an economist.\"\n\nHe is, though, a star with a big following. In the wake of the global financial crisis, organisations such as the \nInternational Monetary Fund - which used to regard him as \"an oddity\" - regularly invite him to speak. Still, he \nreckons the economics profession overall remains resistant to fresh ideas, clinging to its status as a pseudoscience \nundergirded by unbreakable mathematical rules. \"These things do not change overnight. The German physicist \nMax Planck once said science progresses one funeral at a time.\"\n\nWe have come to the Rice Boat, a Keralan restaurant specialising in south Indian cuisine. A 10-minute walk from \nChang's office, it has become his unofficial canteen. The restaurant is large and, when we walk in, entirely empty, \nthough Chang assures me it's heaving in the evenings. The walls are a garish yellow and hung with the sort of \nIndian paintings you might find at a car-boot sale. The bathroom lights don't work and I am handed a lightsaber-type \nwand to negotiate the darkness. The food, despite the unpromising surroundings, turns out to be excellent.\n\nChang recommends chicken, lamb and tuna cutlets as a starter followed by Kerala red fish curry and the \nrestaurant's \"famous\" Kerala beef fry. \"You can have beef here because they are Christians.\" We also choose \nappam, a spongy pancake made with fermented rice and coconut milk, some chapattis, and a portion of Kerala \nboiled rice, which Chang explains is fluffier than the Basmati variety. I wonder if he'd like to join me for a beer. \"I \ndon't drink at lunchtime because I'm very weak at alcohol like most Asians,\" he says apologetically, ordering a \nsweet lassi instead. I decide not to let down the journalistic profession and select a bottle of Konrad 11, a sharp and \ntangy Czech lager.\n\n. . .\n\nChang is dressed in academic casual, an open-neck shirt and slacks. His fringe is as jagged as a graph of booms \nand busts - absent Keynesian countercyclical spending - and his kindly face boyishly pudgy. As he marshals \nargument after argument against his intellectual enemies, I think of a teddy bear savaging a Rottweiler.\n\n\"The predominant view in the profession is that there's one particular way of doing economics. It's basically to set \nup some mathematical model, the more complicated the better,\" he says, advocating instead what he calls a \nmultidisciplinary approach. \"In a biology department, you have people doing all sorts of different things. So some do \nDNA analysis, others do anatomy, some people go and sit with gorillas in the forests of Burundi, and others do \nexperiments with rats. But they are called biologists because biologists recognise that living organisms are complex \nthings and you cannot understand them only at one level. So why can't economists become like that? Yes, you do \nneed people crunching numbers, but you also need people going to factories and doing surveys, you need people \nwatching political changes to see what's going on.\"\n\nThe cutlets arrive with a clatter. Chang squeezes on lemon juice and cuts them up so we can share. The chicken is \nsumptuously juicy.\n\nDoesn't the success of Freakonomics (2005), written by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, disprove his notion that \neconomics is closed to new approaches? \"They don't get huge brownie points for writing for the general public \nbecause a lot of economists have a very dim view of what the general public can understand,\" he says. \"But the \nFreakonomics guys are accepted as part of the mainstream because they have this very particular view of human \nbehaviour, which is 'rational choice'. That is: 'We are all selfish, we basically do our best to promote our self-interest \nand that choice is made in a rational way.' \"\n\n\"I don't take that view,\" he says, cramming in a piece of lamb before he continues. \"Rational thinking is an important \naspect of human nature, but we have imagination, we have ambition, we have irrational fear, we are swayed by \nother people, we get indoctrinated and we get influenced by advertising,\" he says. \"Even if we are actually rational, \nleaving it to the market may produce collectively irrational outcomes. So when a bubble develops it is rational for \nindividuals to keep inflating the bubble, thinking that they can pull out at the last minute and make a lot of money. \nBut collectively speaking . . . \" His hands create a bomb blast above the cutlets.\n\n\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;He takes a slurp of lassi and smiles beatifically. I ask how the economics profession has been hijacked by a \nsingle methodology. \"Hijacked, yes. I think that's right,\" he says, evidently pleased with my choice of word. \n\"Unfortunately, a lot of economists wanted to make their subject a science. So the more what you do resembles \nphysics or chemistry the more credible you become. The economics profession is like the Catholic clergy. In the old \ndays, they refused to translate the Bible, so unless you knew Latin you couldn't read it. Today, unless you are good \nat maths and statistics, you cannot penetrate the economic literature.\"\n\nThis, he says, leaves economic decision-making to a high priesthood of technocrats and central bankers. \"Fat \nchance that a union official in Bradford will be able to beat the academic spouting rational choice theory,\" he says. \nThis - and here is his punchline - suits those with money and power. \"If you have a professor from MIT or Oxford \nsaying that things are as they are because they have to be, then as a person benefiting from the status quo you \ncan't be happier.\"\n\n. . .\n\nAs our main course arrives the table begins to fill with a fantastic array of curries and breads. I'm famished and \neating faster than Chang. The beef, full of competing flavours, is particularly terrific. \"A lot of social democrats \nbought into that fairy tale [of market perfection],\" he says. \"That's why I am writing these popular books, because \npeople have been told a very particular story and they need some antidote to it. I'm not saying I have some kind of \nmonopoly over truth, but at least you need to hear a different side of the story.\"\n\nWe turn to his childhood, when he witnessed first-hand how economic policies can transform a country's fortunes. \nHe was born in Seoul in 1963. His father was a finance ministry official and his mother a teacher. Two years before \nChang was born, Korea's gross domestic product per capita was $82 compared with $179 in Ghana. He \nremembers how red the soil was in Seoul, now one of the world's most neon-filled cities, because all the trees had \nbeen cut down for firewood. \"I wasn't deprived,\" says Chang, who grew up in a house with two maids and the \nneighbourhood's first television set. \"But poverty was everywhere.\"\n\nPark Chung-hee had recently seized power in a military coup. Korea established a steel industry, a seemingly \neccentric choice for a country without iron ore (it had to import it from Australia and Canada) or coking coal. Yet \nsteel became a foundation of Korea's industrial success. Chang believes that Park, though a dictator, made some \nsmart choices and that the only countries to have prospered are those that ignored the siren call of free markets \nand comparative advantage - the idea that you stick to growing bananas if you're a tropical island - and planned \ntheir escape from poverty.\n\nChang took those ideas with him to Cambridge in 1986, where he studied first for a masters and then a PhD on \nindustrial policy. His first impression was how quiet England was. \"In those days, everything closed at five o'clock \nand nothing was open on Sunday. Coming from Asia, it was like walking into a ghost town.\" But the UK also had its \ncharms: \"I used to joke that I came to England - not to the US where most Koreans go - because I like Arthur \nConan Doyle and Agatha Christie.\"\n\nHis studies consolidated his thinking. Countries, he argued, needed to develop their capabilities, just as a child's \npotential is stretched in school. In 1955, for example, when General Motors alone was producing 3.5m cars, Japan \nhad 11 or 12 manufacturers collectively producing 70,000. \"From the short-term point of view, it was madness for \nJapan to try to develop an auto industry,\" he says. \"Except that the Japanese realised, 'We will get nowhere if we \nstick to what we are already good at, like silk.' \"\n\nBut can't the protection of infant industries go terribly wrong? In countries such as Argentina and India, closed \neconomies led to lazy monopolies selling shoddy goods in the name of self-sufficiency. Chang agrees. Only those \nstates that forced their entrepreneurs to compete internationally succeeded, he says. \"In Bad Samaritans, I have \n\n\n\nthis chapter called 'My Six-Year Old Son Should Get a Job'. I'm trying to explain that the reason I don't send this \nlittle guy to the labour market is because I believe that it pays, in the long run, for him to have an education rather \nthan shining shoes and selling chewing gum. Protection is given with a view to eventually pushing your companies \ninto the world market in the same way that you send your kids to school but [you] don't subsidise them until they're \n45.\"\n\nHe tears the appam and hands me a piece. It's airy and faintly sweet and wonderful for mopping up the curry. \"We \nhave been led to believe that the market is some kind of natural phenomenon. But in the end, the market is a \npolitical construct.\" The regulations around us - for instance those banning child labour or private money-printing - \nare invisible, he says. He cites the example of how Park's government engineered a 30 per cent jump in wages \nthrough a massive shrinkage of the labour force. It was achieved, he explains, by making education compulsory up \nto the age of 12, removing at a stroke millions of children from the labour pool. Policy changed the market reality.\n\n. . .\n\nAs Chang turns to the fish curry, I ask about his family. He met his Korean wife in 1992 and married her the \nfollowing year. \"As a good Korean I am very impatient,\" he grins. He has two children. His son, now 13, is still being \nsheltered at school from a career in shoe shining. His daughter is reading history at Oxford university. So she's \nbroken out of the economics trap, I say. \"Good for her,\" he replies, raising his lassi.\n\nWe order a double espresso for Chang and black filter coffee for me. We've been talking for nearly two hours but he \nstill has bags of energy and I still have bags of questions. What's all this about the washing machine and the \ninternet?\n\n\"I was not trying to dismiss the importance of the internet revolution but I think its importance has been exaggerated \npartly because people who write about these things are usually middle-aged men who have never used a washing \nmachine,\" he replies. \"It's human nature to think that the changes you are living through are the most momentous, \nbut you need to put these things into perspective. I brought up the washing machine to highlight the fact that even \nthe humblest thing can have huge consequences. The washing machine, piped gas, running water and all these \nmundane household technologies enabled women to enter the labour market, which then meant that they had \nfewer children, had them later, invested more in each of them, especially female children. That changed their \nbargaining positions within the household and in wider society, giving women votes and endless changes. It has \ntransformed the way we live.\"\n\nFinally, I ask whether he thinks economics is a moral pursuit. Chang's starting point seems to be that economic \npolicies can make the world better. \"Moral dilemmas are unavoidable,\" he says as I signal for the bill. \"Don't forget \nthat, at least in this country, economics used to be a branch of moral philosophy. Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Joseph \nSchumpeter - they're not just writing about economics, but about politics and culture and society and morality.\" He \ndrains his cup. \"How has this wonderful subject we call economics become so narrow-minded? I find that really \nsad.\"\n\nDavid Pilling is the FT's Asia editor\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRice Boat\n\n37 Newnham Road, Cambridge\n\nSweet lassi \u00a32.50\n\nKonrad 11 beer \u00a34.00\n\nCutlet platter \u00a313.25\n\nKerala red fish curry \u00a310.00\n\n\n\nKerala beef fry \u00a310.00\n\nBoiled rice \u00a32.50\n\nAppam \u00a32.50\n\nChapatti \u00a32.25\n\nDouble espresso \u00a33.00\n\nCoffee \u00a32.50\n\nTotal (incl service) \u00a358.75\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The pub is the weekly meeting \nvenue for the local branch of Left Unity, a new political party aiming to fuse Britain's fissiparous socialists. Ahead of \nits founding conference in London on Saturday, I went to the shoemaking town to see what, according to Salman \nShaheen, a journalist and member of Left Unity's national committee, should represent a typical local party meeting. \n\"It's [in] the back room of a pub in a deprived area,\" he added.\n\nIn fact, the Unite union has booked the back room, so we meet in the main bar area. Five regulars keep the \nbartender company. A television plays The Paul O'Grady Show on mute while speakers blare a Trevor Nelson \nSpotify mix. Bianca Todd, the local Left Unity co-ordinator, tries to make herself heard over the beats, explaining \nhow this party will be different to the rest.\n\n\"I think people are fed up with protesting,\" she tells me. Todd, a sparky, hoodie-wearing 36-year-old who runs a \ncharity for ex-offenders, favours practical action over beardy chats about the Russian Revolution. She has a sense \nof fun. In a stunt to publicise the founding of the Northampton branch, she distributed \"guerrilla gardening\" kits \ncomplete with seeds and bulbs to nearby residents. \"We can't spend our time talking about Marx, Trotsky and \nLenin.\"\n\nYet, within a few minutes of the meeting starting, a familiar division emerges. There are 10 people around the table, \nincluding Todd, her partner, her mother and her father (her grandfather was general secretary of the Transport and \nGeneral Workers' Union). The latter has a problem with David Smith, another attendee, who is accused of being \ninsufficiently working class (he went to university.) The mood quickly darkens. If Northampton is indicative of Left \nUnity's future then, according to one attendee, \"it could dissolve on the basis of what happened at Kronstadt\".\n\nSince its launch in March by the film-maker Ken Loach and other activists, Left Unity has self-consciously presented \nitself as \"the Ukip of the left\". Shaheen says this is only a \"metaphor\" that expresses the need for \"a gravitational \npull\" on Labour from the left, in a similar sense to how Nigel Farage's United Kingdom Independence party moves \nthe Tories to the right.\n\nThe parallel is misguided, according to Robert Ford, a professor of politics at Manchester university. \"It took Ukip \nthe best part of 15 years and a very charismatic leader to get their heads off the canvas,\" he says. \"They have \nlearnt how to campaign.\" Ford predicts Ukip will finish first in next year's European elections before winning seats in \nWestminster.\n\nThe idea of Left Unity as socialist Faragism also misses how the party \"has no grounding in popular sentiment\", \nargues Nick Pearce, director of IPPR, a centre-left think-tank. In part this is because the far left and Ukip are not \nspeaking to different audiences. Ford says: \"Ukip is the most working-class party in Britain.\" Its typical supporter is \nnot the southern stockbroker of caricature but the \"sixtysomething voter from the Midlands and the north of England \nwho left school without qualifications\".\n\n\n\nJohn Allen, a member of the Northampton branch of Ukip, is a case in point. Allen, a third-generation military \nveteran, has been out of work for five years. The 63-year-old puts this down to a mix of age discrimination and \nimmigration. \"If we had control over our borders, then the jobs issue would be dead in the water,\" he says. \"I'm \nlooking at Ukip on the same basis as the wartime campaign my father fought.\"\n\nFor Ukip voters, immigration is a more important issue than the EU. They are often uncomfortable with recent \ncultural changes in modern Britain, says Anthony Painter, author of the recent book Left Without a Future. Ford \nbelieves \"the voters Ukip are winning are the voters that are losing in the recession\".\n\nThis reflects a deeper problem, according to American academic Francis Fukuyama, who in early 2012 wrote of \n\"the absent left\". Since the financial crisis, he argued, rightwing populist politicians who tapped into anxieties about \nglobalisation and cultural change have flourished in Europe and the US, while their opponents struggled.\n\nMany on the left agree with Fukuyama's premise. Owen Jones, author of Chavs: the Demonisation of the Working \nClass, and at 29 perhaps the most influential of a new generation of leftwing commentators, tells me he is fond of \nMilton Friedman's insight about how, when crisis occurs, \"the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are \nlying around\". And in 2008, he says, there was \"a vacuum on the left\".\n\n. . .\n\nNearly two years on from Fukuyama's article, has anything changed? If one sees the left as synonymous with \nparties such as Left Unity, then the answer seems to be No. As Fukuyama wrote dismissively: \"The left has not \nbeen able to make a plausible case for an agenda other than a return to an unaffordable form of old-fashioned \nsocial democracy.\"\n\nBut if one thinks of the left as a broader movement, defined by a belief in collective action to bring about greater \nequality (other definitions are available from good second hand bookshops), then there are signs of life, including at \nthe top of the Labour party.\n\nContemporary feminism, for example, is vibrant. Young writers such as Laurie Penny, Holly Baxter, Rhiannon Lucy \nCosslett and Helen Lewis are evidence that, in the latter's words, \"there's a critical mass of women who just won't \nshut up about the things they care about\". Campaigns such as End Violence Against Women and No More Page \nThree are gaining prominence. So too Everyday Sexism, a project highlighting the pervasiveness of gender \ndiscrimination, which this year forced Facebook to drop some target adverts that featured next to offensive posts.\n\nLaura Bates, 27, who founded Everyday Sexism in April 2012, says this is an \"incredibly exciting moment for \nfeminism in the UK\". Nevertheless, she says, \"I don't feel like it is currently a deeply politicised movement - the idea \nof being on the left doesn't feel like it is particularly at the heart of this resurgence.\" Bates describes the movement \nas \"very pragmatic and down-to-earth\". Though, as Melissa Benn points out in the IPPR journal Juncture, \"What's \nmost striking about this new wave . . . is how predominantly cultural the concerns are.\"\n\nThere is a pragmatic and fragmented quality to the economic pressure groups that have arisen on the left. UK \nUncut, founded in 2010, stages acts of civil disobedience to highlight tax avoidance. Campaigners against cuts to \nthe legal aid budget or the so-called \"bedroom tax\" focus on single issues. Community organisers, such as Citizens \nUK, have put the living wage higher up the agenda of all mainstream political parties. Groups such as Occupy \ndeliberately emphasise means over ends.\n\nThe most recent attempt to bring these disparate groups into a movement against the government's spending cuts \nis the People's Assembly, which launched this year and is part-funded by big trade unions. At a recent meeting of \nactivists in Manchester, Penny Hicks, local organiser, argues: \"Those groups that aren't willing to work together are \nbeing marginalised.\" She says it is too soon to tell whether it will be a mass movement. Jones, one of the \nAssembly's founders, is more optimistic, citing hundreds at recent meetings. However, he adds: \"If it's seen as a \nparty, then it disintegrates. People won't have anything to do with it.\"\n\n\n\nDespite Jones's optimism, the People's Assembly is for now at least a modest smorgasbord of curious newcomers \nand stalwart activists. However, the young commentator has been corresponding with the comedian Russell Brand, \nwho in a recent essay for the New Statesman called for a \"total revolution of consciousness and our entire social, \npolitical and economic system\". An accompanying BBC Newsnight interview has been viewed more than 9m times \non YouTube.\n\nThe comedian's intervention seems to have captured what Prof Ford describes as \"a feeling of voicelessness and a \nfeeling of powerlessness\" that has grown since the financial crisis. Scandals in parliament, the media and the police \nhave reduced trust in established institutions, according to the 2013 British Social Attitudes Survey. The study found \nthat 75 per cent of Britons agree with the statement that \"the political system is not working for them\".\n\n. . .\n\nFord believes this \"cross-party, cross-ideological loss of faith in the way of doing things\" also presents an \nopportunity. There is, he says, \"a groundswell for something politically new\", which offers succour to these Britons' \neconomic insecurities and cultural attitudes.\n\nThe pledge by Ed Miliband at this year's Labour conference to freeze energy prices was, his supporters argue, an \nanswer to those who accuse the left of having had no intellectual response to the crisis - and to the accusation that \npolitics does not matter to people's lives.\n\nLord Stewart Wood, an adviser to the opposition leader, says: \"You have to ask: what kind of centre-left faced the \ncrisis in 2008? It was a left that felt there were certain fundamentals about the market economy that you couldn't \nquestion.\"\n\nFive years on, he says, \"the rules of the game have changed\". Real incomes have been stagnant or worse since \n2003 and the Labour party is making a political bet on its hypothesis that even as macroeconomic growth returns, \nmicroeconomic fortunes will remain detached and, therefore, voters will be open to a less deferential approach to \nmarkets. Jones agrees, saying \"the public consciousness has shifted\".\n\nCritics of what Miliband calls \"responsible capitalism\" say his philosophy is no more than a return to the old-\nfashioned socialism that Fukuyama disdains, and which belongs in the Old Black Lion pub. Miliband's supporters \ndispute this. \"The policy has more in common with early 20th-century progressivism than postwar statism,\" one \nshadow cabinet minister tells me.\n\nMiliband will also need a cultural message to complement his economic one, Anthony Painter says. \"Traditionally \nLabour has spoken to the economically anxious; Conservatives to the culturally anxious. Now it is not so clear-cut.\" \nUkip's success shows that populist sentiment does not obey a simple left-right spectrum. Yet Miliband's bet that the \npublic will give his arguments a listen is a sign that the left is finding a voice again. It has yet to prove it is popular \nbut it is no longer absent.\n\nJohn McDermott is an FT commentator\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many of us - and I do not exclude the extended Leigh family from this - will be feeding the masses as usual \nthis year but there are probably almost as many who will be celebrating (and I choose the word with care) \nChristmas with a much smaller number of people. There are couples or threes or fours who will be very content to \nhave exchanged the hurly-burly of the family refectory for the quieter pleasures of the little dining table.\n\nTalk of geese and turkeys will not resonate with such folk. A pheasant might make for a suitably modest little \nChristmas, a truffled chicken would be a fine extravagance but I think the simple joy of a roast duck - not modishly \n\n\n\nrare but gently cooked through - is just as appropriate. With a rich stuffing, some robust Alsace red cabbage and a \ntart apple sauce this should be a better balanced but no less sybaritic feast.\n\nWhatever one cooks and eats this Christmas, I cannot help thinking that the actual cooking process should be one \nof the chief pleasures. I am reminded of Bill Baker, a much-missed wine merchant of heroic proportions and \ngenerosity, who always did the cooking on Christmas day. Straight after breakfast he would nobly dispatch his \ncherished family to attend the morning ceremony at Wells Cathedral and, on their departure, open a bottle of Louis \nRoederer Cristal champagne. He generally reckoned to have finished the bottle by the time he had roasted the \npotatoes and before his family returned - whereupon he would open a more modest bottle and toast everyone's \nhealth.

A very generous portion for two - but could stretch to four with the gammon \nfrom the cabbage side dish.\n\n1 Aylesbury style duck, approximately 2kg in weight, with giblets, and with the neck flab intact\n\n200g good pork sausage or sausage meat\n\n1 lemon\n\n12 stoned soft prunes\n\n\u00bd Cox's apple\n\nNutmeg\n\n6 clove heads\n\n6 sage leaves\n\n2 Bramley apples\n\nPiece of cinnamon\n\n6 cloves\n\n1 large shallot\n\n1 dsp sugar\n\n2 tbs sherry vinegar\n\n1 glass red wine\n\n150ml chicken stock (or a cube and water)\n\n- Chop the wings off the duck at the first joint, remove the giblets and carefully lift up the neck flap. Scrape the \nwishbone clean and then remove it by detaching it at the bottom and twisting it free (this helps greatly with the \ncarving). Chop the neck, gizzard and wings into smaller pieces and distribute them around the perimeter of a large \nroasting pan. Preheat the oven to 200C.\n\n- Remove the sausage meat from its casings and place in a bowl. Finely grate the zest of the lemon over the meat. \nChop the prunes coarsely and add to the mix. Peel and dice the apple, macerate in a little lemon juice and add in \nturn.\n\n- Chop the liver and heart of the duck quite finely and season with salt and pepper. Grate a little nutmeg into the mix \nand crush in the clove heads. Finish with the finely chopped fresh sage leaves. Knead this mixture very well with \nyour hand and then place a third in the neck cavity of the duck. Draw the neck flap over and then stitch up the skin \nwith a trussing needle or close it with a fine skewer. Roll the remaining stuffing into a sausage shape in a piece of \nfoil and place it to steam in the red cabbage (see below).\n\n- Place the duck on a trivet in the roasting pan and cook for 20 minutes on the high heat before turning the oven \ndown to 170C and cooking for a further hour (protect the skin with a piece of foil if it colours too much). Pour out any \nrendered fat after 45 minutes for roasting some potatoes.\n\n- Peel and core the Bramley apples, slice them roughly and toss them in lemon juice. Place them in a bowl with a \ncouple of tablespoons of water, the cinnamon, cloves and a little more grated nutmeg and microwave for six \n\n\n\nminutes (traditionalists can simply cook the sauce on top of the stove). Whisk this mixture to a smooth apple sauce. \nI like my apple sauce to be sharp and tart; others may choose to add a little sugar.\n\n&lt;  &gt; - Once the duck is cooked remove it on its trivet from the roasting tray and leave, covered, in a warm \nplace. Add the shallot, thinly sliced, to the pan and set on a good heat on top of the stove. Once the shallot is \ncoloured, add the sugar and let it caramelise before pouring in the vinegar. Let this boil and reduce to a syrup \nbefore pouring in the wine and scraping up all the juices in the pan. Add the stock and let this gravy gently reduce \nfor 10 minutes.\n\n- Serve the duck on a bed of red cabbage with the apple sauce, some roast potatoes and the gravy strained into a \nlittle jug. To carve, remove the legs first and then carve long, thin strips with some stuffing attached at one end.\n\nAs a side\n\nRed cabbage with smoked gammon\n\nA robust and earthy treatment of red cabbage from Alsace. Normally a fatty, smoked bacon hock would be used. I \ncould not source one in time and used a rather standard piece of smoked gammon joint which proved serendipitous \nwith the slightly fatty duck.\n\n1 red cabbage\n\n2 tbs duck fat or oil\n\n1 onion, studded with 8 cloves\n\n150g smoked bacon\n\nBouquet garni of parsley, thyme and bay leaf\n\n100ml chicken stock\n\n3 tbs red wine vinegar\n\n- Cut the cabbage in half, cut out the central core and then slice into thin ribbons. Heat the fat in a heavy casserole \nand add the cabbage on a high heat, turning it regularly and sealing it well, after adding plenty of milled black \npepper and a small pinch of salt. Remove two-thirds of the cabbage and place the cloved onion and the gammon \njoint in the middle of the remaining layer, pushing them down towards the bottom together with the bouquet garni.\n\n- Cover with the remaining cabbage, pour in the stock and vinegar and cover the casserole. Bring to the boil on top \nof the stove and then cook gently on top of the stove (or a slow oven, if available) for two hours. The cabbage is \ndelicious when reheated.\n\n&lt;  &gt;\n\nTo finish\n\nHot chestnut cake with pears and chocolate sauce\n\nThe cake will subside a little after cooking but will have a moist, buttery interior. It will serve six comfortably but it is \nnot worth making in a smaller quantity. It won't hang around for long.\n\nThe cake:\n\n1 vanilla pod\n\n200ml milk\n\n\n\n200g peeled chestnuts\n\n30g caster sugar\n\n350g unsalted butter\n\n350g caster sugar\n\n6 egg yolks\n\n50g plain flour\n\n- Butter and flour a 22cm springform cake tin and preheat the oven to 180C.\n\n- Split the vanilla pod and add it to the milk in a saucepan with the sugar. Add the chestnuts and simmer very gently \nuntil the milk has been absorbed. Blend the chestnuts to a pur\u00e9e in a food processor, adding a tablespoon or two of \nmilk to help make it completely smooth.\n\n- Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer until very pale and fluffy and then gradually beat in the egg \nyolks. Fold in the flour and then add the chestnut pur\u00e9e, mixing very thoroughly to form a stiff batter. Pour into the \ncake tin and smooth out roughly with a spatula.\n\n- Bake the cake for 45 minutes. It will rise a little as it cooks and will spring back to the touch in the centre when \ndone. Allow the cake to rest in its mould for 15 minutes before turning out on to a plate. Keep warm in a low oven.\n\n2 good pears\n\n1 lemon\n\n375ml dry white wine\n\n50g caster sugar\n\n1 vanilla pod\n\n- Peel the pears, split them in half and remove the cores. Roll them in a little lemon juice. Bring the wine, sugar and \nvanilla to the boil, add the pears and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Leave to cool in their liquor.\n\n100ml milk\n\n150g extra bitter chocolate\n\n50ml double cream\n\n- Bring the milk to the boil. Add the chocolate in small pieces and stir in off the heat. Whisk in the cream and heat \ngently. To serve, warm the pears in their liquor, pour a little chocolate on to two plates and add a slice of the cake \nand a pear (without the liquor, which will make a very good base for a punch).\n\nRowley Leigh is the chef at Le Caf\u00e9 Anglais\n\nrowley.leigh@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Everything here is a champagne unless another \nappellation is cited after the vintage or \"NV\" for non-vintage. Wines are listed in ascending order of lowest known \nprice in the UK. They are all likely to be 12-12.5 per cent alcohol unless otherwise noted.\n\nGobin, Perles de l'Angelier NV France\n\nThis is recognisably made from Muscadet with nutty, fresh, ripe distinctive fruit. Something a bit different. 11.5%\n\n\u00a310.99, Amps of Oundle and other independents\n\nJ Laurens, Le Moulin Brut NV Blanquette de Limoux\n\nThere's an attractive bit of development on the nose. Very fresh and really quite special for the money. Delicate on \nthe palate. Look out for other bargains from this Languedoc producer.\n\n\u00a312.10, Ditton (sold by the six-bottle case)\n\nDom de Montbourgeau NV Cr\u00e9mant du Jura\n\nThis has a pretty, retro label. Good tang - recognisably Jura - Chardonnay with bite. Clean and revitalising. Less \naggressive than a cheap champagne.\n\n\u00a312.50, The Wine Society\n\nTeo Costa, Madre Natura Ros\u00e9 NV Vino Frizzante\n\nThe combination of 100 per cent Nebbiolo and 0 per cent sulphites produces a very gentle, unusual, rose-scented \nPiemontese fizz that would make a most distinctive aperitif. 10.5%\n\n\u00a316.50, Vini Italiani of London\n\nForget-Brimont, Brut Premier Cru NV\n\nFrom the village of Ludes. Open and relatively simple but proper stuff. A tiny bit sweet but reasonably delicate and a \nlot more refined and fun than the average own-label champagne selling at this price. Nicely balanced even if on the \nappetising end of the spectrum. Tiny bead. Neat finish.\n\n\u00a321.57, Justerini & Brooks\n\nBarnaut, Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru NV Champagne\n\nBig and brawny. Not that complex but not expensive, especially at the special offer price that lasts until Christmas.\n\n\u00a323.95 (price per bottle for case of six; \u00a327.95 individually), Lea & Sandeman\n\nPascal Doquet, Horizon Blanc de Blancs Brut NV\n\nThis organically certified growers' champagne has a lightly nutty nose and is chock full of flavour. A steal \nconsidering J&B's margins. I don't think I would guess it were all Chardonnay; seems slightly richer than many \nBlanc de Blancs.\n\n\u00a324.07, Justerini & Brooks\n\n\n\nRidgeview, Bloomsbury Merret 2010 England\n\nSignature wine from the estimable Ridgeview. Very frothy. Edgy in terms of acidity. Very clean but pretty tart.\n\n\u00a324.99, Waitrose\n\nChartogne-Taillet, Ste-Anne Brut NV\n\nVery racy, direct, clean and breezy. Really neat and concentrated. The flagship blend from this champagne grower \nin Merfy is a great bargain.\n\n\u00a325, The Wine Society, Fine Wine Direct\n\nHuet Petillant Brut 2007 Vouvray\n\nBased on Chenin Blanc and one of the most welcome variations on the fizz theme: richer and more complex than \nmany champagnes. Pale straw with a steady bead. Young, fresh, floral apple juice. Delicate and rapier-like acidity. \nVery vibrant.\n\n\u00a325, Berry Bros\n\nPierre Gimonnet, Cuis Blanc de Blancs Brut Premier Cru NV\n\nDelicate texture but some autolysis on the nose. Real savour and refreshment. Beginning, middle and end to this \nproper wine - much more interesting than many champagnes at the same price.\n\n\u00a325, The Wine Society\n\nGusbourne Brut Reserve 2008 England\n\nOne of the most toothsome English fizzes with some real depth to it.\n\n\u00a326.45, Berry Bros\n\nPol Roger NV\n\nA banker of a family-owned champagne. Price will go up once this retailer has sold all the bottles in this batch, \nwhich suggests it may have some bottle age.\n\n\u00a329.95, Lea & Sandeman, while stocks last\n\nAgrapart et Fils, Les 7 Crus Blanc de Blancs Brut NV\n\nFrom the seven villages where Agrapart owns vines, initially aged in old oak barrels. Complex, well-settled nose. \nGrapefruit peel on the finish after much throat-warming.\n\n\u00a331, The Wine Society\n\nCharles Heidsieck Brut R\u00e9serve NV\n\nThe spearhead of a campaign by the new owner of this house to reposition it firmly upmarket. This cuv\u00e9e, based on \n2007, is very good, with 40 per cent reserve wines up to 10 years old.\n\n\u00a331.95, Berry Bros and other independents\n\nRuinart, R de Ruinart Brut NV\n\nBready nose with real interest. Something to get your teeth into. Very clean and neat and tastes as if it had quite a \nbit of age on lees.\n\n\n\n\u00a337.50, Lea & Sandeman, Jeroboams\n\nDelamotte, Blanc de Blancs NV\n\nGrand Cru Chardonnay from le Mesnil, Oger, Avize with a full 48 months on yeast. Signature bottling of this house, \na sister to Salon, based on 2006. Quite a bit of age on the nose. Racy and quite delicate on the palate. Well made - \njust the right quality of fizz.\n\n\u00a337.95, Corney & Barrow\n\nLarmandier-Bernier Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Premier Cru NV\n\nStill one of the finest non-vintage champagnes from a fine, biodynamic grower. Very broad and rich compared with \nmany other handcrafted growers' champagnes. Quite incredible to think that this is an extra brut in view of the \nrichness on the palate. Clean, refreshing, fabulous! Very persistent.\n\n\u00a339.95, Berry Bros and others\n\nDeutz NV Ros\u00e9\n\nOne of the most impressive non-vintage pink champagnes I have tasted recently. Good dry finish. Solid matter on \nthe palate.\n\n\u00a343.95, Vagabond Wines and others\n\nLouis Roederer 2006\n\nVery firm, savoury and dense, with lively acidity and a fine bead. Not massively intense or bone dry but very \ncompetent.\n\n\u00a344, Berry Bros; \u00a345, The Wine Society\n\nBollinger, La Grande Ann\u00e9e 2004\n\nHint of oak on the nose. Very winning and interesting. Extremely savoury but with flirtatious lift on the finish. Very \npersistent.\n\n\u00a365, Noel Young; \u00a380, Berry Bros and others\n\nNyetimber, Tillington Single Vineyard 2009 England\n\nWinemaker Cherie Spriggs offers record pricing with this all-Pinot bottling from an unusually ripe vintage. Quite \ndeep bronze/pale gold. Heady nose. Lightly apple-y and more interesting than most English fizz. Not the driest but it \nhas some autolysis and interest on the nose. Delicate bead.\n\n\u00a375, Philglas & Swiggot\n\nFor stockist details, go to www.ft.com/fizzes. More stockists at wine-searcher.com.

With average salaries for first-time buyer households in London at about \u00a353,000 a year, young \nBritish professionals are finding it tough to buy.\n\n\"There are plenty of young professionals in London earning good salaries who still can't afford to buy their own \nhomes,\" says Susan Emmett of Savills. \"Many simply can't save enough of a deposit to satisfy mortgage lender's \ncriteria, especially when they are having to spend about a quarter of their income on rent.\"\n\n\n\nThose who decide to buy outside London and commute face high train fares - latest prices from Network Rail show \nan annual season ticket to central London costs \u00a33,960 from Reading; \u00a34,400 from Cambridge; and \u00a34,556 from \nColchester.\n\nHere are the stories of three young British couples who have had a difficult time trying to get a foot on the capital's \nproperty ladder.\n\n1) Clapham Park\n\nPaul Oesten Creasey, 28, and Enas Refaei, 27\n\nTotal combined income: \u00a350,000 - \u00a360,000\n\nBudget: \u00a3250,000\n\nBought for: \u00a3215,000\n\nPaul and Enas first started looking to buy a flat in Brixton, south London, in April this year, but found that their \nbudget wouldn't stretch that far. \"We started looking in Tulse Hill and Streatham Hill once Brixton seemed too \nexpensive,\" says Enas. The couple finally found a two-bedroom flat in Clapham Park for \u00a3215,000, paying a \n\u00a330,000 deposit and opting for a five-year fixed rate mortgage with Santander. But, as with many of their \ngeneration, Enas says the only reason that buying became an option for them was when Paul inherited \u00a340,000 \nfrom his grandparents.\n\n\"We found saving for a deposit in London practically impossible,\" says Enas. \"With house prices being on the \nsteady rise, we didn't want to get kicked out of London.\"\n\nPaul and Enas say they are coping well with their mortgage repayments so far. \"It's only early days yet,\" says Enas. \nBut if things don't go to plan longer term, they have a contingency: \"If times get too tough, there is a spare room for \na lodger,\" she says.\n\n. . .\n\n2) London Fields\n\nSarah Waterson, 27, and Stuart Lerman, 30\n\nTotal combined income: \u00a390,000 - \u00a3100,000\n\nBudget: \u00a3355,000\n\nBought for: \u00a3353,000\n\nHaving rented in east London for several years, Sarah and Stuart began looking locally to buy their own flat in 2012. \n\"We really wanted a two-bed flat near London Fields, but found that on every property we put an offer on, we were \noutbid - people were bidding at least 10 per cent over the asking price,\" says Sarah.\n\nAfter looking for more than a year, they found the cost of a two-bedroom flat in the area they wanted had increased \nso much it was now out of their reach. \"We started looking in north London and the southeast but just couldn't find \nwhat we were looking for,\" she says. \"The options were either a large one-bedroom flat or a smaller two bedroom \nflat. In the end we settled for a one-bedroom flat in the area we wanted to stay in.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Sarah and Stuart bought a one-bedroom garden flat near London Fields for \u00a3353,000, using a 15 \nper cent deposit and a mortgage from Santander.\n\nDespite the difficulties they faced in finding somewhere to buy, the couple say they never considered moving to \nsomewhere outside the capital. \"It's great to be close to work and the cost of commuting from outside of London is \n\n\n\nalso huge,\" says Sarah. \"We also felt that property prices in London would be more secure than outside, which is a \nbig factor. Being first-time buyers, we felt security for our money and location were more important than size.\"\n\n. . .\n\n3) Stoke Newington\n\nAlex Unitt, 27, and Rebecca Drewry, 27\n\nTotal combined income: \u00a3100,000+\n\nBudget: \u00a3475,000 - \u00a3500,000\n\nAfter renting in Finsbury Park, north London, Alex and Rebecca started looking to buy a property in the summer of \nthis year, hoping ideally to find a two-bedroom flat in neighbouring Stoke Newington with some outside space. \nHowever, having put offers in for three different places - all above the asking price - they are yet to secure a sale.\n\nRebecca says buying in the capital has been much harder than she anticipated. \"As buyers you think you're unique \nuntil you come across your carbon copy; they have the same budget, but actually more deposit, so they outbid \nyou.\" she says.\n\nTheir plight has not been aided by some of the estate agents they have used. \"They haven't really done us any \nfavours,\" says Rebecca. Alex agrees: \"One guy sat on a radiator in an open-neck denim shirt for the whole time we \nwere there - he didn't have a care in the world.\"\n\nAlex and Rebecca are still keen to buy because they think signing up for a mortgage will actually reduce their \noutgoings. \"The irony is that when we do [get a mortgage], we expect it will be the same as our rent, which is a real \ndriver for why we want to make sure we secure somewhere quickly,\" says Rebecca.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

A close cousin of porridge, it was an \neveryday staple in the early medieval period. It became less commonplace over the centuries but was still fed to the \npoor in workhouses through the Victorian period. Though almost unheard of today, frumenty has provided \ninspiration for a new dish on the Christmas menu at Heston Blumenthal's restaurant Dinner in Knightsbridge.\n\nOne of the first documented recipes for frumenty can be found in the 1390 manuscript The Forme of Cury. Written \nby a master cook from the court of Richard II (1377-1399), this is one of the oldest known cookery manuscripts in \nthe English language. A British Library conservator helped me view it, carefully unrolling it and holding it steady with \npurpose-made lead \"snakes\". As a physical object it's impressive - made of calfskin vellum stitched together at \n30cm intervals, it's more than 12ft long and contains 196 recipes. It's in amazingly good nick considering it's more \nthan 600 years old.\n\nThe preamble to the manuscript explains that The Forme of Cury contains recipes for \"common pottages and \ncommon meats for the household, as they should be made, craftily and wholesomely\", as well as food designed to \nimpress at royal banquets. Frumenty falls into both these camps - there's a basic recipe for cooking the dish with \nbroth but there's also frumenty with porpoise, a dish fit for kings. Apt then that Ashley Palmer-Watts, head chef at \nDinner, has chosen frumenty to be part of the Christmas menu: \"Our approach to Christmas is about the ultimate \nluxury - that's what Christmas is about.\"\n\nStanding in the kitchen of the restaurant watching Palmer-Watts cook his version of the dish is a surreal experience. \nThe state of the art kitchen is located in the middle of the restaurant. Floor-to-ceiling glass walls turn diners into \nspectators and chefs into entertainers, a reminder that high-end cooking has always been a form of theatre. Inside \nthe kitchen there are futuristic, bespoke work units with refrigerated drawers, incorporated grill plates and \nhypersensitive electric hobs. But the heat coming off a pulley-turned-spit, slowly roasting caramelised pineapples, \n\n\n\nthe flash of flame and embers visible when the smoking Josper oven is stoked and the scrubbed-faced chefs \nworking intently at their stations could be straight out of a medieval kitchen.\n\nHistoric British gastronomy serves as a muse for Palmer-Watts and Blumenthal, inspiring their acclaimed \ncontemporary cooking - Dinner has just been awarded a second Michelin star. Historical recipes, unearthed in old \ncookery books and manuscripts (some of which I help to research at the British Library), are the reference points for \nnew recipe development. As Palmer-Watts explains, \"What we're doing are never exact replicas.\"\n\nThe journey a recipe takes from a historical manuscript on to the menu at Dinner is often long and convoluted. This \ndish is a case in point. \"Frumenty had been simmering away as a possible idea for a long time but we hadn't got \nround to developing it,\" explains Palmer-Watts. At first it was the name that attracted his attention. \"It's just funny, \nisn't it? But then digging into the history, well the story was so good and the ingredients so intriguing we just had to \ndo something with it.\"\n\nUsually made to accompany meat or fish, frumenty was served hot with a porridge-like consistency, or was \nthickened, left to cool and then sliced, rather like polenta. \"We found out that frumenty was often cooked with some \nsort of dried fruit,\" says Palmer-Watts. \"The cracked wheat, the broth and fruit. That was interesting. And because \nfrumenty often accompanied fish, it was a chance to develop a fish starter inspired by the medieval period.\"\n\nOver a number of months the dish was developed. \"The only sticking point for frumenty was the fruit. We were \ntrying to shoehorn in fruit and it wasn't working.\" Some weeks before, Palmer-Watts had been given a Buddha's \nhand fruit - a fantastical-looking citrus with protruding fingers, no flesh but a highly perfumed flavour. \"I didn't know \nhow we'd use this,\" he explains, \"but I was grabbing a moment with Heston and he mentioned they'd been pickling \nsome Buddha's hand in the development kitchen lab. It was perfect - lovely and sherbety. It worked so well with the \nfrumenty.\"\n\nFinally, a frumenty starter of grilled octopus, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse seaweed and lovage was ready for \nthe menu. \"With the toasted spelt cooked with vegetable stock to accompany the octopus, then we have something \nthat's not miles away from the original. It's been one of our most popular dishes and I think it's one of our strongest,\" \nPalmer-Watts says.\n\nKnowing that frumenty was often given as a gift during the festive period in medieval times, Palmer-Watts decided \nto incorporate it into his Christmas menu: \"If we could meld lobster into the frumenty octopus dish, using seaweed \navailable in December, we'd have something really special.\"\n\nLaid out ready for Palmer-Watts on stainless steel trays are the prepped ingredients: pickled dulse, luminescent \nrounds of pickled Buddha's hand fruit, a tiny mound of spelt that's been cooked in vegetable stock, a pile of bright \ngreen salty fingers and one of samphire, and three lobster tails. A small pan of smoked mussel stock and another of \nlobster emulsion simmer gently while Palmer-Watts cooks the lobster three different ways. He selects the one that \nhas the perfect, just-cooked silky texture for the final dish. Then, applying the same degree of care and \nconcentration as the library conservator who handled The Forme of Cury, he assembles the first trial serving of \nlobster frumenty.\n\nThe finished result looks like a perfect, sparklingly clear rock pool, or a dish made for a mer king. And it doesn't \ndisappoint in the eating - there's smoky broth, rich, gelatinous lobster, crunchy salty fingers, salt-sweet pickled \nseaweed and a creamy herb emulsion that somehow tastes like the very essence of an English garden. The result \nis intense and complex but not tricksy. Palmer-Watts seems pleased. \"There's so much in it but it's so pure. The \nnext time Heston's here for dinner I'll get a couple of lobster tails in and see what he thinks. He loves the octopus so \nI think he'll love this too.\"\n\nConceding that most home cooks would struggle to reproduce the restaurant recipe for lobster frumenty, Palmer-\nWatts sets about making a home-proof version. With all the ingredients prepped, it's ready in less than 10 minutes, \na one-pot frumenty made with cockles, scallops, spelt, vegetable stock, samphire, pickled seaweed and Buddha's \nhand fruit. It's more relaxed and less refined than its restaurant sibling but it's still impressive. \"This is a stick-it-in-\nthe-middle-of-the-table-type dish,\" Palmer-Watts enthuses. \"A sharing dish.\"\n\n\n\nSix hundred years have passed and porpoise isn't on the menu any more but Palmer-Watts's versions of frumenty - \nalbeit translated, interpreted and distilled - are still good enough for a king.\n\nPolly Russell is a curator at the British Library.

Aside from the ingredients specified here, there are an infinite number of variations that \nwould work, depending on availability and preference. Sea aster or sea rosemary could be used to replace the \nseaweeds listed here and quantities could be varied if necessary - add more samphire if you can't locate sea beet \nor double the sea purslane if sea beet isn't available, for example. Razor clams, mussels, cuttlefish or squid would \nmake good alternatives to the scallops and clams. And if you cannot find a Buddha's hand fruit then use a pickled \nAmalfi lemon or, if you don't have time to pickle, use grated zest and lemon juice instead.\n\nServes 4\n\nIngredients\n\n8 scallops\n\n500g clams\n\n10g chopped garlic\n\n160ml vegetable stock\n\n200g cooked spelt\n\n20g sea purslane\n\n40g samphire\n\n20g sea beet leaves\n\n30g pickled Buddha's hand fruit sliced from the \"fingers\"\n\n8 pieces of pickled Buddha's hand fruit, centre slices\n\n40g pickled dulse plus a couple of pieces for finishing\n\n10g chopped coriander\n\n30ml pickle liquid from the dulse\n\n20ml pickled lemon juice\n\nIngredients for the pickled Buddha's hand fruit\n\n100g water\n\n75ml Chardonnay vinegar\n\n40g caster sugar\n\n1 Buddha's hand fruit\n\nmailto:magazineletters@ft.com\n\n\nIngredients for the pickled dulse\n\n360ml water\n\n72ml Chardonnay vinegar\n\n35ml white soy\n\n5g sugar\n\n4g salt\n\n20g dried dulse\n\nIngredients for the vegetable stock\n\n250g leeks, white part only, sliced\n\n200g carrots, grated\n\n175g onions, sliced\n\n175g button mushrooms, grated\n\n85g fennel, grated\n\n85g celery, sliced\n\n40ml olive oil\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n4 thyme sprigs\n\n1.5 litres cold water\n\n25g flat leaf parsley\n\nIngredients for the cooked spelt\n\n50g spelt\n\n10ml olive oil\n\n300ml vegetable stock\n\nMethod\n\nThree days before you want to cook the frumenty, prepare the pickled Buddha's hand fruit as follows.\n\nTo make the pickled Buddha's hand fruit\n\nHeat the water and Chardonnay vinegar in a pan. Add the sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Remove from \nthe heat and allow to cool. Cut off all the \"fingers\" on the Buddha's hand fruit, using a knife, then slice into 1.5mm-\nthick slices, using a mandolin. Slice across the \"fingers\" to create circular slices. Using an electric slicer, cut the \nbase section of the Buddha's hand fruit into 1.5mm slices. Put the sliced \"fingers\" and base section into a jar or \ncontainer, cover with the pickling liquid and place in the fridge for at least three days. As long as the fruit is \nsubmerged in the pickling liquid and is refrigerated it will last up to three weeks.\n\n\n\n24 hours before you want to cook the frumenty, prepare the pickled dulse.\n\nTo make the pickled dulse\n\nHeat the water, Chardonnay vinegar and white soy in a pan. Add the sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. \nRemove from the heat and allow to cool. Wash the dried dulse thoroughly in cold running water to remove any \nsand. Cover with water and leave to soak for 10 minutes. Drain well then add to the cooled pickling liquid. Place in \nan airtight container in the fridge for 24 hours before using.\n\nAt least two hours before cooking the frumenty, prepare the vegetable stock and cook the spelt.\n\nTo make the vegetable stock\n\nPeel and prepare the vegetables. Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add all the vegetables and sweat for five minutes \nwithout allowing to colour. Add the bay, thyme and water and bring to the boil. Skim off any froth or impurities that \nrise to the surface and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the parsley and allow to infuse for \n20 minutes. Pass the stock through a fine sieve and discard the vegetables. Remove any fat from the surface of the \nstock. Refrigerate until required.\n\nTo cook the spelt\n\nHeat the olive oil in a pan and lightly toast the spelt, stirring continuously until light brown in colour. Add 300ml of \nthe vegetable stock and simmer until the spelt is tender but still has a little bite and almost all the stock has been \nabsorbed. Pour the spelt out on to a tray and cool in the fridge and reserve.\n\nTen minutes before you wish to eat, start assembling the frumenty.\n\nSeason the scallops with salt and pepper. Heat a frying pan until very hot then fry the scallops on either side until \nlight, golden brown. Remove and set aside in a warm place to complete cooking and rest. Heat a generous splash \nof olive oil in a large frying pan with a lid. When the oil is smoking add the clams and cook on a high heat for a \nminute. Add the chopped garlic and cook for a further minute then add the vegetable stock, cooked spelt and sea \npurslane. Cover with a lid and bring to a simmer. Once simmering remove the lid then add the samphire, sea beet \nleaves, Buddha's hand rings and most but not all of the pickled dulse. Cook for another minute until the clams open \nthen add the chopped coriander and both pickle liquids. Divide the broth and clam mixture between two large bowls, \nmaking sure the scallops are clearly visible. Place a couple of larger pieces of pickled dulse and large pieces of \nBuddha's hand fruit in and around the dish and then serve.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

What fresh outrage would he concoct this time? \nDylan goes ukulele? The great man turning to his band amid howls of indignation: \"Strum it loud ... \"\n\nThe old tease kicked off Wednesday's show with \"Things Have Changed\". \"Standing on the gallows with my head in \nthe noose,\" he rasped: \"Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.\" But unlike 1966, nothing had really \nchanged. From his black frock coat and raffish two-tone shoes to the road-tested touring band, Dylan, 72, was in \nthe role he has been playing since 1997's Time out of Mind - that of the itinerant troubadour, the mythic American \nwanderer who, as he later sang, \"ain't seen my family in 20 years\".\n\nHe and his five-strong band were illuminated by muted sepia lighting on a darkened stage in the round. There were \nno spotlights to focus attention on individual players. They played as a unit, like an antique roadhouse band \ntransported by some odd wormhole to the plush setting of the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nMost of the set was drawn from Dylan's post-1997 work, with his latest album Tempest predominating. Charlie \nSexton delivered deft but unshowy solos on guitar while steel guitarist Donnie Herron added a western twang. \n\n\n\nDrummer George Recile and bassist-bandleader Tony Garnier drove the tempo forward immaculately, from \n\"Beyond Here Lies Nothin's\"'s Latin shuffle to the boom-chicka-boom railway beat of \"Duquesne Whistle\".\n\nDylan alternated between a microphone stand in the centre and a grand piano at the side where he stood playing \nrudimentary chords, often one-handed. The rumoured arthritis appeared to be confirmed by the other hand dangling \nby his side; he seemed uncertain what to do with it, often propping it awkwardly against his hip. But his harmonica-\nplaying was lusty - it replaced the accordion parts that Los Lobos's David Hidalgo contributed to recent albums - \nwhile his ruined voice struck me as unusually vigorous.\n\nTempest's \"Pay in Blood\" found him hissing the line \"I pay in blood - but not my own\" with B-movie relish. And \n\"Forgetful Heart\", a rootsy ballad from 2009's Together Through Life, was outstanding, Dylan contorting his \ngroaning tones into genuine tenderness. With his frizzy grey hair in a quiff that had failed to defy the laws of gravity, \nhe resembled a ghostly satire of a 1950s showman; the way he looked at the audience after kerplunking the piano \nkeys - as if to say \"Top that!\" - was straight from the Jerry Lee Lewis school of stagecraft, with a hefty dose of irony.\n\nHe ended with two classics: \"All Along the Watchtower\" and a neatly countrified \"Blowin' in the Wind\", the latter \npunctuated by a swaggering harmonica solo. A young man pushed past me to throw something on stage, a \n\"personal letter to Bob Dylan\". Dylan, standing taking his bow, did a cartoonish double take as the package skidded \npast his feet. It wasn't addressed to \"Judas\".\n\nbobdylan.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

I would add that, in a city where inadequate, score-bruising \nchoreography abounds, we see in Morris's work the triumph of an art of subtlest creation and sensibilities, \nmovement an organic and radiant development of its music. Strong words? Of course, and necessarily so when \nactivities that have lately occupied this same stage (notably with Hofesh Shechter and Rambert) have tarnished the \ngood name of choreography.\n\nMorris, who has genius, offers us - in this first of two programmes - dances that are the most seemingly natural and \nfelicitous realisations of their score. Design? A bare stage, discreet costuming, good lighting. Music? The refined \nresources of Morris's own ensemble - a septet comprising gifted singers and musicians - performing Beethoven's \nsettings of British folk songs, Weber's Grand Duo Concertant for clarinet and piano, Satie's Socrate. The result? An \nevening of dance penetrating of its music, both beguiling and uncompromising, a vivid image of what the composer \ncreated.\n\nThe Muir takes Beethoven's delightful songs, shows us their charm, their world, and in a final heart-tearing \nsequence, their soul. Crosswalk is a joyous realisation of Weber's virtuosities and ingenuities of craft for the \nclarinet, its every least feat of bravura explored by 10 buoyant men and three flame-garbed women, running (and \nwalking) across the stage, springing delightedly over their music, its forms their forms, its happy rhythms theirs. \nSocrate offers a prodigious visualisation of Satie's austere masterpiece concerning the philosopher's final days. \nThis most unemphatic music (idiomatically given by the tenor Zach Finkelstein and the pianist Colin Fowler) is \nexplained, respected, as Morris's dancers, clad in pale-hued tunics and chitons and kilts move through \nchoreography that probes with every restraint the heart of Satie's score. I think it a masterpiece and, like so many of \nMorris's dances, amazing in power, eloquence, clarity of vision. And lit by a radiant humanity. Choreography \nunalloyed, life-enhancing. Vast gratitude to Morris and his artists.\n\nmarkmorrisdancegroup.org\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Grosman was on a mission to recruit exciting contemporary artists to make original lithographs, and she had \nbecome enamoured with a Johns painting of a coat hanger, an audaciously banal subject in that era, that she had \nseen at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nNot long afterwards, Johns recalls, \"she delivered several heavy stones to my Front Street door\". They were \nlithographic stones, on which he could draw. \"I quickly decided that it was easier to make the trip to West Islip [on \nLong Island, New York, where ULAE was based] than to carry the stones up several flights to my studio. Once I \nbegan, it was clear that there were things to learn and to play with.\"\n\nJohns is typically understated in describing his ongoing 53-year odyssey that has not only heavily influenced the \ndirection of his practice but also helped alter the very definition of what a print could be: not a reproduction or a \nstep-sibling to painting, but a work of art in itself, of equal importance to any other medium.\n\nOne artist brought another, and soon Grosman had lured a virtual who's who of the era - from Robert \nRauschenberg and Cy Twombly to Helen Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell - to her cottage with the promise of \nlunch and the freedom to experiment. In the process, ULAE became a storied force in contemporary art.\n\n\"You get the sense there were all these young people with nothing to lose,\" says Iwona Blazwick, director of the \nWhitechapel Gallery in London. \"They had no money, just ideas. They would get fed, watered and the materials \nthey needed. It was almost utopian.\"\n\nNow Blazwick and Bill Goldston, who succeeded Grosman at ULAE after her death in 1982, are mounting an \nexhibition of Johns' prints at the Gallery at Windsor, in Hilary and Galen Weston's exclusive Vero Beach, Florida, \ndevelopment. It is the third annual collaboration in the Whitechapel at Windsor series, mounted to chime with Art \nBasel Miami Beach. The show focuses on Johns' body imagery, including recurring figures of a man and a boy as \nwell as renderings of hands doing sign language and a family portrait made when Johns' father was a baby. \"He \nuses the body as a kind of language,\" Blazwick says.\n\nWhile many might speculate that Johns' imagery is deeply autobiographical, Goldston notes, \"I don't think anyone \nknows the meaning it has for Jasper. I was more interested in the repetition of the image - you know, how he says: \n'Take an image, do something with it, do something else with it.' It has more to do for me with how the image \nchanges from one print to another.\"\n\nGrosman's role as printmaking's catalyst began when she was already in midlife. Before then, she had been \nbuffeted round the world by the 20th century's calamities. As a child, she and her family escaped the Russian \nRevolution, settling in Japan, then Germany. With that country's embrace of Nazism, she and her artist husband \nMaurice moved to Paris. After the Germans marched in, the couple fled to Spain, then Portugal and finally to New \nYork in 1943.\n\nFaced with her husband's failing health and the need to earn a living, Grosman turned to printmaking. Their friends \nwere artists and the language of the printing press was not entirely foreign, since her father had owned a \nnewspaper in Siberia. Still, no one expected ULAE to elevate prints to such an art form that MoMA would acquire \none of every single ULAE edition, as it has for half a century.\n\n\"Tanya was attentive and encouraging, as I think she was to any artist she trusted to work at ULAE,\" Johns says. \n\"Her European, old-world background seemed to strengthen, or stabilise, her interest in experimentation and \nnovelty.\"\n\nGrosman was not a master printer herself; for expert knowhow she turned to people like Goldston, who first came to \nULAE in 1969 to work with Rauschenberg, and who, like his good friend Johns, had embraced printmaking as \ncentral to his artistic practice. \"He and I sort of became brothers,\" Goldston says.\n\n\n\nInitially, Goldston thought ULAE would be a temporary gig. \"All I wanted to do was be an artist,\" he recalls. \nGrosman, though, persuaded him to stay.\n\nOn a sunny autumn day, Goldston, 70 and elegant in a navy blazer and grey trousers and sweater, begins his tour \nof ULAE at the one-time gardener's cottage, which now houses a lithographic press on the main floor and an \netching studio in the basement. Upstairs is a viewing room.\n\nWell into his employment with Grosman, he recalls, \"every night I had to lock the cabinets and give her the keys\". \nHer insistence, he says, was not for lack of trust. \"It was out of respect for the artists and their work.\"\n\nULAE's main operation is now a few miles away, in Bay Shore. There, the staff of 10 still cooks and eats lunch \ntogether daily around a square wood table, along with whichever artist or collector happens to be visiting. Prints by \nLee Bontecou and Larry Rivers hang on the walls, along with ULAE's \"birth certificate\". A drawing Goldston made in \nart school - the only piece of his not in the bin, he says - sits over the sink, placed there, he notes, as a staff joke.\n\nGoldston, who grew up on a farm in Oklahoma, first worked with Johns in 1971. He'd been assigned to print images \nfor a planned Johns catalogue raisonn\u00e9 on an offset printer, a device then considered acceptable for high-end \nbooks but artistically inferior to a lithographic press. Much to Grosman's horror, he consented to Johns' request to \nshow him the press, which was housed at another location. \"I came close to losing my job that day,\" Goldston says.\n\nJohns, as Grosman feared, became enthralled with the new technology. One morning Grosman stopped by while \nthe two men were hard at work. \"Jasper was drawing on a plate,\" Goldston recalls. \"As fast as he could paint them, \nI could get them ready. She came in. I saw her standing in the door. Four or five minutes, she did not say anything. \nShe closed the door and left.\" At lunch back at the house, Grosman told him, \"The energy in that studio was so \nelectrifying I was afraid to interrupt it.\"\n\nThat spirit of experimentation has guided Goldston and ULAE into the digital age. \"Ideas are ideas,\" he says. \"You \nthink Giotto wouldn't have loved the possibilities of what we're using today? It's all another method to get the idea \nout of the brain.\"\n\nArtists who've worked with Goldston say that he is a master at getting out their ideas. \"It's always done very gently, \nsometimes without your knowledge,\" says Terry Winters, whom Goldston first brought out in 1982.\n\nLisa Yuskavage, who had made a mental note of ULAE as a student studying Johns, compares Goldston to Fred \nAstaire: \"He lets you move, but he guides you at the same time.\n\n\"He pushes me,\" she continues. \"He disobeys me.\"\n\nYuskavage recalls how she resisted his suggestions to try digital. \"I'm like, 'Digital blah blah blah,'\" she says. \nAgainst her wishes, he scanned the image they had printed, printed it digitally extra-large and then, using the keys \nshe had given him to her studio, snuck in and pinned prints all over. First Yuskavage was annoyed. Then she took \nout her pastels and went to work drawing on the prints, several of which have since been acquired by museums. \n\"Bill is not just a printer,\" she says. \"It was his leap. It was not my leap.\"\n\nSays Goldston of their collaboration: \"We're having a heck of a good time.\"\n\nThat the business is not always profitable is beside the point. Though Goldston considers it a \"blessing\" that 15 or \n20 collectors can enjoy the finished product, \"it's not about making multiples. It's about something creative.\"\n\n'Jasper Johns: Shadow and Substance', December 8-April 30 2014\n\nwindsorflorida.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Never does the city of Miami feel \nmore a part of the south of the great American landmass as when the art crowd hits town for the powerhouse fair \nArt Basel Miami Beach. And not only for the mothership, as ABMB has now become, but also for the plethora of her \nacolytes: at least a dozen satellite fairs will pop up in Miami next week to take advantage of the fairground \natmosphere that visits the city each December.\n\nThe influx of both talent and commercial acumen from central and South America is greater this year than ever, \naccording to Latitude: Platform for Brazilian Art Galleries Abroad, a project supported by the Brazilian government \nand the Association of Brazilian Art Galleries. No fewer than 22 galleries from Brazil alone, they report, are showing \nacross six fairs: 13 at Art Basel Miami Beach and nine others at Context, Scope, Art Miami, Art Untitled and the \nBrazil Art Fair, including some that have never before ventured beyond their own borders.\n\nThe Brazilian art scene amounts virtually to a craze at the moment. It is also, incidentally - interpret this how you will \n- the only national art market in which all the bestsellers are female: viz Lygia Clark, whose \"Bicho Invertebrado\" \n(1960) fetched $1.9m at Phillips New York this month. Numbers like this should put a gleam in the eye of her \ngalleries at Miami - DAN, from S\u00e3o Paulo, and London-based Alison Jacques.\n\nOther recent Brazilian sales also imply good news. Two works by the late Brazilian S\u00e9rgio de Camargo sold for over \n$1m at Sotheby's New York last week, including a record for the artist brought home by \"Untitled (Relief No 21/52)\" \n(1964) at $2.2m, almost quadruple its estimate. New York's Mary-Anne Martin gallery should also have high hopes \nfor the Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo, whose \"Women reaching for the Moon\" (1946), recently went for $1.4m. And \nresults from last month's ArtBo fair in Bogot\u00e1 were cheering too.\n\nThe wealth of Latin American talent assembled in Miami has a geographical rationale, of course - the city sits at a \nsignificant crossroads. And, despite their tigerish economies, there is still in the southern countries of the continent \na cultural insecurity: coming to the US to buy and sell, to see and be seen, is still an important validation for dealers, \nartists and collectors alike. Miami has its magic. Now celebrating its 11th edition, ABMB is no longer seen as the \nbaby sister of its European senior sibling, but as a distinctive phenomenon - in fact, the two are utterly different in \nfeel and mood.\n\nAnd, as grown-up fairs do, it has had a powerful effect on its hinterland. Not only the eager satellites but also some \nsuperb public shows are in prospect: Tracey Emin at the excellent Miami MoCA, Ai Weiwei at the new P\u00e9rez \nMuseum, fine displays at the Rubell Family Collection and other privately funded venues. Not to mention \ninstallations on the beach, the obligatory art bar, and much more.\n\nWhich goes to show that, despite the chatter of Spanish and Portuguese voices among the artworks on display in \nMiami next week, the rest of the world is hardly under-represented. Among the grand total of 253 galleries showing \nacross six sections at ABMB, newcomers and regulars include Asian and European galleries as counterpoint to the \n(roughly) 50 per cent from the Americas.\n\nThe linguistic bridges lure galleries from Barcelona and Madrid, taking advantage of the Hispanic mood. Others \nsimply do what they are good at - Galerie 1900-2000 from Paris brings Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia; Chemould \nfrom Mumbai brings Shilpa Gupta and Jitish Kallat. From as far afield as Oslo and Beijing, Athens and Buenos \nAires, geography goes into the great melting pot of the art souk.\n\nTom Wolfe's 2012 novel Back to Blood, which mirrors \"class, family, wealth, race, crime, sex, corruption and \nambition in Miami, the city where America's future has arrived first\", contains a hilarious-but-vicious portrait of the \nsuper-rich vying for first entry to the city's premier art fair. It's hardly a pretty picture, but it's an unforgettable insight \ninto the passion and madness that drives this burgeoning phenomenon. According to a recent article by my \ncolleague Georgina Adam, in 1970 there were three main art fairs in existence (Basel, Art Actuel and Cologne). By \n2005 there were 68 and in 2011 there were 189. Who knows what 2014 will bring.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nArt Basel Miami Beach runs December 5-8, artbasel.com\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Her outfit, men's \nblack tie on top and tiny leather shorts by Dsquared2 on the bottom, amid a sea of long dresses and buttoned-up \ntuxedos, struck exactly the right tone for a glamorous night with a risqu\u00e9 undercurrent.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly for a party for this very Italian brand, most guests were dressed in homegrown Italian labels: \nGiorgio Armani, Fendi, Alberta Ferretti, Ermenegildo Zegna, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana all featured. Afef Jnifen, \nmodel and wife of Pirelli chairman and chief executive Marco Tronchetti Provera, wore a form-hugging, floor-\nskimming azure-blue velvet gown by Alberta Ferretti. Elisa Sednaoui, the Karl Lagerfeld muse-turned-actress, was \nin red velvet by Fendi, again fitting from breastbone to ankles.\n\nBut, interestingly, given that this was a Pirelli calendar party, most revellers had chosen not to reveal too much \nflesh. Perhaps this was not to distract fellow party-goers from posters above their heads - many of which showed \nportraits of the very same women wearing little more than either loincloths (in the 1994 calendar \"In Praise of \nWomen\", which featured Kate Moss) or leaves (in photographer Richard Avedon's 1995 calendar \"Seasons\"). It \nwas a contrast that played well at Pirelli, a brand that has, after all, excelled at using pin-ups to sell tyres for half a \ncentury.\n\nFor the men, as ever the choice was easier, with tuxes the theme of the night; albeit with a few notable exceptions. \nLapo Elkann, billionaire Fiat heir and society-circuit fl\u00e2neur, wore a checkerboard suit by Lapo's Wardrobe for \nGucci, plus \"a vintage Mickey Mouse Rolex\", which he was keen to point out. Elkann also slipped off his patent \nblack dress-shoes, complete with bow, to show that they were tailor-made on Savile Row. Among the \nphotographers the swinging 1960s appeared still in vogue: with many sporting baggy linen suits, sneakers and \nSebagos. Although this was a rainy night in Milan, their look was reminiscent of the calendar's first photo shoot, by \nRobert Freeman on a Caribbean island in 1964.\n\nThe star of the night was Sophia Loren, who was regal in body-skimming silver Giorgio Armani. What was it like, I \nasked, to pose for Pirelli in the 2007 calendar? \"For me, it was surprising doing that for the first time at a later age,\" \nthe 79-year-old replied. \"For Pirelli, it was a scoop to have me.\"\n\nStill, the last word went to Kevin Spacey, who comp\u00e8red the evening in a midnight-blue tuxedo by Burberry, and \nwas the only one to address the elephant in the room. \"I think I know the secret of your success,\" he commented, \nwhen partygoers had just watched a 20-minute film of 50 years' worth of Pirelli calendar images during the interval \nbetween their risotto entr\u00e9e and veal main course. \"Did you count the breasts? That was a lot of breasts.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

I buy almost all my suits from this company and a number of \nthem are seven years old or more, so I know they last. This suit is about a year old. As I'm a private banker my suits \n\n\n\nare conservative but they'll always have little touches of personality, such as the lining - which on this one is deep \nburgundy. But nothing crazy: I meet so many different sorts of people and you want to make everyone feel at ease. \nIt shows respect to some and instils comfort in others: there's a professionalism to people wearing suits.\n\ndress2kill.com\n\n. . .\n\nShirt by Dress 2 Kill\n\nI'm tall and I have long arms so I get shirts made to fit.

While eating toast, they gathered \nup clothing and equipment for the day, to the swooshing of nylon salopettes. Their outfits were simple and tailored, \nlight and slim-fitting. And then there was me: Bambi in a sumo suit.\n\nAs someone who is 5ft 2in and a holiday skier, outerwear can be a disaster. The above scenario took place during \nan Easter trip. I had struggled to find a decent outfit at the last minute: hence my very puffy purple jacket and black \ntrousers cut for a portly giant. I vowed that the next time I went skiing I would have snow gear that was not just \nprotective, but fit for off-piste viewing too. Earlier this month, that \"next time\" arrived: a coaching clinic at the ski \ndome in Hemel Hempstead. Enter Moncler.\n\nNow famous as the puffer jacket of choice for ladies everywhere from Chelsea to Courchevel, Moncler in fact has \nroots deep in the world of mountain climbing and skiing. Originally known for making quilted jackets and sleeping \nbags for mountain expeditions, it was the official supplier of the French national downhill ski team at the Grenoble \nWinter Olympics in 1968 and in the past 40 years has broadened its horizons even further. Its current ski label, \nnamed Grenoble, represents only about 10 per cent of its total product range, which also includes Gamme Rouge, \nthe haute couture line by designer Giambattista Valli. Grenoble sports the Moncler signature: the use of non-\ntraditional performance fabrics - think wool tweed - to create garments that work on and off piste.\n\nMy test case was an Irrenberg jacket. This is standard Moncler: black quilted nylon, cockerel logo on the shoulder, \nwaist nipped in by an elasticated belt. At \u00a3780, it is at the low end of the price range for this line, which can go over \n\u00a32,000 for jackets embellished with fur and wool. From the outside, it looks like a simple everyday winter weather \njacket for the city. (At the office there was much envy among even non-skiing colleagues, who simply wanted to \nwear it to work.) But it comes with frills: a traditional powder skirt inside; a double zip so you can close the jacket \njust as far as your waist, rather than all the way from hip to neck; fleece-lined pockets; a hood big enough to cover a \nhelmet and a turtleneck for added warmth. Plus waterproof pockets inside and in the sleeve for phones and keys. \nMissing were a few features of more technical jackets, such as clips that hook on to your trousers to give you extra \nprotection from powder snow (and some Grenoble jackets have an internal gaiter that zips on to trousers).\n\nStill, given that I wasn't waist-deep in powder, this was not a big issue, and on the slopes the jacket was both warm \nand movement-friendly. Watching myself on playback (the clinic insists you see your own mistakes) I was delighted \nto note that no matter how messy my skiing, I still looked sharp. In fact, I was so delighted that back in London I \nmade a beeline for the Moncler shop to try on more jackets, including the Reidberger (\u00a31,180) and the Skilbrum \n(\u00a31,085). Made with bi-stretch technical nylon over feather down, they were both beautiful, with a body-conscious \nshape, and unlike the Irrenberg they come in colours other than black: the Reidberger in a chic blue, and the \nSkilbrum in light or steel grey or dark green. The Skilbrum, which also has a removable fur-lined hood, is belted, \nwith quilting on the back and slim-fit arms.\n\nStill, there's no getting away from the fact that this is an Italian luxury garment, thanks to the sizing. Which is, to be \nblunt, on the small side. Be prepared to go up a number, and be comforted by the fact no one looking at you will be \nable to tell.\n\nmoncler.com\n\nAnousha Sakoui is the FT's M&A correspondent\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Unlike the drive from JFK into Manhattan - it never seems to \nimprove and I'm convinced it's uglier than it was a decade ago - memory lane is a place that can fill you with joy, \nmake you instantly depressed, inspire you to pick up the phone and call a long-lost classmate or quietly pull on your \ncoat and beat a silent retreat to the nearest fire exit.\n\n\n\nFollowing an intense birthday weekend in Tokyo that involved dinners, drinks and singing at all my favourite \nvenues, I touched down in London early on Tuesday morning ready to take on the day. While I normally make my \nway between Europe and Japan on ANA, Finnair or Swiss, it's hard to beat the 6pm departure on BA from Tokyo \nHaneda (much closer to the city centre) to Heathrow. You are almost guaranteed to pass out before the aircraft \ngains altitude over Tokyo Bay and, with a bit of luck, not to wake up until you're over the English Channel.\n\nArmed with 11 hours of solid sleep, a day of meetings wasn't a problem until the 3pm dip, when I was struggling to \npay attention to a presentation from colleagues. A flat white and small sugar hit from our caf\u00e9 down the street soon \nput things right and by 5pm I was back in the game.\n\nNormally I wouldn't plan an evening out after a 10-day trip but an invitation to a friend's farewell party was too \nimportant to miss, so I jumped into the car and made my way to Canada House on Trafalgar Square.\n\nAfter a painfully slow tour through the West End, we pulled up in front of Canada's recently renovated digs and \nwere greeted by some burly security guards who struggled to find names on their clipboards. (National branding tip \nnumber one: get some Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in full red get-ups to look after this task as this is \nyour first encounter on Canadian territory.) We then went up the stairs and into an elegant reception room, where I \nwas greeted by our jolly high commissioner to the UK, before making my way through the crowd to find the guest of \nhonour.\n\nWith a glass of bubbles in hand (national branding tip number two: was it Canadian? Was it Australian? French? \nWould have been good to know), I surveyed the room and was surprised by the number of faces I recognised - \nBBC correspondent Lyse Doucet chattering away, Channel 4's Jon Snow shaking hands and looking concerned, \nand sometime radio host (and current lavender farmer) Nancy Durham, looking mildly naughty among a group of \nmore sedate guests.\n\n. . .\n\nAfter slaloming around clusters of animated well-wishers, I found Ann MacMillan - the Canadian Broadcasting \nCorporation's retiring London bureau chief, and the star of the evening.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, MacMillan has been a reassuring figure on TV screens across Canada - first for commercial \nnetwork CTV and, since the early 1980s, for state broadcaster CBC. She's also a familiar face for anyone who \nspends much time in and around Fitzrovia - the one-time international TV news hub of London that's seeing a bit of \na renaissance. In the golden days of TV and radio newsgathering, the CBC occupied an entire semi-modernist \nbuilding on the west side of Great Titchfield Street, a stone's throw from the BBC's Broadcasting House. At CBC a \nstaff of 60-plus from the network's English and French TV and radio networks fanned out across the region to cover \ndisasters, state visits, conflicts and no shortage of royal stories. Over the years since then, the bureau has been the \nvictim of various cuts.\n\nThroughout the period, MacMillan has covered the political landscape of the UK and also managed the far trickier \npolitics of a network that's been trying to figure out its place and redefine its mission in Canada, one of the world's \nbiggest English language markets.\n\nWhen I arrived in London in 1990, the CBC was one of the first places I applied for a job. Ann was away at the time \nand I was interviewed by someone filling in for her during the summer break and I didn't get hired for the position. A \nfew weeks later, I landed a job up the street, in US network ABC's massive London bureau (140 people back then). \nI recall Pierre Salinger padding around his corner office entertaining various ambassadors and Peter Jennings used \nto fly in on Concorde to read the news \"live\" from London.\n\nAll over Fitzrovia you could spot the most famous faces, or hear the most famous voices, in broadcast journalism. A \nfew of them are still around but Ann's will most definitely be missed from both street and screen.\n\nTyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is editor-in-chief of Monocle magazine\n\n\n\ntyler.brule@ft.com\n\nMore columns at ft.com/brule\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The dollar rose \nabout 1 per cent over the week to Y102.24 and about 4 per cent over the month, .\n\n\"We expect dollar/yen to keep the pressure on the upside as the composition of portfolio flows appears consistent \nwith renewed investor confidence in 'Abenomics',\" said Hans Redeker, head of global FX strategy at Morgan \nStanley.\n\n\"We believe the way is now open for gains to target the Y103.75 May high.\"\n\nAnalysts at Danske Bank noted Japan was one of the few leading world economies to see consumer prices \naccelerating - and that this was the first time since 1998 that Japan has had higher inflation than the eurozone.\n\n\"It shows what to do if you want inflation to go higher: print a lot of money,\" Danske said.\n\nIndeed, while the latest eurozone consumer price data showed the year-on-year rate of inflation increasing slightly \nin November after the previous month's worryingly soft outcome, money supply and lending figures released earlier \nin the week ratcheted up pressure on the European Central Bank to be even more accommodative.\n\n\"The ECB will probably hold fire on taking any further action at its 5 December policy meeting given that it only cut \nits refinancing rate in November and inflation has moved up from its October low,\" said Howard Archer, economist \nat IHS Global Insight.\n\n\"However, we expect the ECB will take further action before long, most likely in the form of another Longer-Term \nRefinancing Operation, especially given latest data showing a further and deeper fall in bank lending to businesses \nin October.\"\n\nmailto:tyler.brule@ft.com\n\n\nIn spite of such expectations, the euro remained resilient, rising 0.4 per cent against the dollar over the week to a \none-month high above $1.36. The single currency also hit a five-year peak against the yen.\n\nSterling also put in a strong performance amid growing optimism about the UK economic recovery, touching a two-\nyear high against the dollar within a whisker of $1.64.\n\nThe Bank of England unveiled an overhaul of its Funding for Lending scheme that would scale back stimulus to the \nhousing sector, a move seen by many as paving the way for a shift away from ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nBut there was no getting away from the fact that the Fed's policy stance will be the biggest influence on global \nmarkets. While US data releases this week were mostly encouraging, the key is likely to be next week's November \njobs report.\n\n\"We anticipate a gain of 180,000 in payrolls, which could just be enough to persuade the Fed to begin tapering its \nasset purchases later in December,\" said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.\n\nBut government bonds showed relatively little concern about such a prospect at this stage, with US and German \ndebt holding within well-established ranges. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 1 basis point on Friday at \n2.74 per cent, down just 1bp over the week.

The \nphone call came last year from the restorers of Kenwood House, Robert Adam's masterly neoclassical villa on the \nedge of London's Hampstead Heath, which was freshly reopened to the public on Thursday after a \u00a35.95m \nrefurbishment.\n\nThe restorers had been working on the gilding in the house's library, long regarded as one of the jewels of 18th-\ncentury English architecture. There was \"bucket loads\" of it, recalls Ashbee, all over the column capitals and \nelegant reliefs, giving the room its distinguished and distinctive character. The only problem was that it didn't seem \nto be original.\n\nThe call that caused Ashbee such distress informed him they had found a layer of white lead paint under the \ngilding. More importantly, there was a thin film of dirt between paint and gilding. This showed that the extra layer of \ndecoration had been added decades after Adam's original room had been unveiled, to great acclaim, in front of \nKenwood's owner William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, in the 1760s.\n\n\"We have got to have a meeting,\" Ashbee remembers telling his caller. If you are head curator of historic properties \nfor English Heritage, such discoveries entail difficult decisions - in this case, one that would determine how \n\n\n\nKenwood would be perceived by future generations of visitors. The technical challenge of restoring one of London's \nmost notable interiors had just acquired the sharpest of ethical dimensions.\n\nHere was the dilemma: whether to make a radical change in the appearance of the library, in an attempt to evoke \nits original appearance; or to respect the added decoration that was added soon afterwards (\"the late 18th century \nhas a certain sacredness in its own right,\" says Ashbee softly) and leave things as they were.\n\nThe debate that followed, with strong opinions on either side, according to Ashbee, reflected a longstanding \ncontroversy over restoration in Britain. Cack-handed attempts to restore things to an imagined pristine condition \nwere sharply criticised by the likes of William Morris in the 19th century, who believed that the layers of amendment \nevidenced in a place or object were more important than the reproduction of its alleged original state.\n\nI have my own views to declare here. I am one of the very few people - we are widely derided as nutters - who think \nthat the restoration of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel in the Vatican in the 1980s and 1990s, the most important \nsuch project in recent history, proved to be a crushing disappointment, and am happy to be old enough to \nremember it in its previous state, when the artist's frescoes looked more real, more subtle, and more moving. I am \nwell aware of the arguments that were presented to justify the restoration. But they have been rebutted, with no little \nferocity. In the end it comes down to taste.\n\nWhich is why one of the most important principles of restoration today is that of reversibility. When Ashbee finally \nmade the decision to go with the plain white version of Adam's library, there was never any question of stripping \naway the gilding. Instead, yet another layer of white paint was added to it, which could comfortably be removed by \nfuture historians, who may decide that the gilding did better justice to the room after all.\n\nAshbee says the clinching argument was that the room as seen today is a plausible version of what it looked like \nwhen Adam first unveiled it to his delighted client. This is partly a technical triumph but also a testament to a greater \nprofessional scrupulousness on the part of the restorers.\n\nThe very acknowledgment of the decision's difficulty shows an awareness that these issues live and breathe \naccording to the air of the times. Whatever we think, contemporary taste shapes the debate every time it is played \nout. It is no coincidence that the 1960s restoration of the library provided it with a thick carpet, of the kind that was \nin our homes of the time too. The carpet has now gone. The bare-wooded floor that we saw this week is an original \nfeature - but it also happens to accord with fashions in interior design.\n\nThe result of all the agonising makes a fresh visit to Kenwood essential (for those not in the know, it also houses \nsome extraordinary paintings, among them one of Rembrandt's greatest self-portraits). The library looks lighter, in \nevery sense. Sit in it for a few minutes, and you can hear the ghosts of all those heated domestic discussions, \nreplaying endlessly over the decades: \"Darling, I'm not saying I don't like it. But don't you think it is a little too white? \nI've thought of a new colour scheme  . . . \" The beholders of beauty, each and every one of them, will always have \ntheir say.\n\npeter.aspden@ft.com, @peteraspden\n\nMore columns at ft.com/aspden\n\nTo listen to culture columns, go to ft.com/culturecast\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

They have been scouring green and \nsocial levies looking for a way to restrain price rises, in response to Ed Miliband's promise to freeze energy bills. \nThe Labour leader set the tone of the Westminster agenda this autumn with his pledge.\n\nThe main changes will affect Eco - the energy company obligation - a government scheme to insulate homes that is \npaid for through household bills, and which is expected to cost each dual-fuel customer nearly \u00a3100 a year in 2014.\n\nThe deadline for the companies to meet their obligations under Eco will be extended from 2015 to 2017, although \nother targets may be increased.\n\nThe Eco will also be \"rebalanced\" towards cheaper insulation products.\n\nThe energy companies' obligation to deal with \"hard-to-treat homes\" - such as those without cavity walls - would be \neased, while targets for replacing or repairing boilers, or carrying out loft insulation in low-income households would \nbe raised.\n\nAlso, the Warm Home Discount, which helps the elderly and some \"vulnerable\" people, will be moved from \ncustomer bills into general taxation to save about \u00a312 a year from the typical bill.\n\nCompanies have long complained about the obligation to carry out solid wall insulation, which can cost about \n\u00a310,000 a house.\n\nOne industry executive denied that the government had asked companies to freeze prices until 2015.\n\n\"It's more like they're saying to us: if we promise not to put your costs up, will you promise not to put your prices up \nagain?\" he said. \"But at this stage, it's unclear whether we will be able to make that kind of commitment.\"\n\nEDF Energy recently put up prices by less than its rivals, but only on the condition of changes to the Eco.\n\nIf the government's alterations are more modest than the company was hoping for, it could be in the awkward \nposition of having to lift its prices again. \"It's a critical question,\" said a person close to the company. \"And it's one \nwe won't be able to answer until we've seen what the cost savings from the changes to Eco are.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Photographs containing relevant words often \nfall short in visual mystery. Viewers naturally decipher a kind of internal caption, and then leave the picture - since \nthey have every reason to think that having \"got\" the sense through the words, they've \"got\" the picture.\n\nAm\u00e9rica Latina: 1960-2013\n\nAm\u00e9rica Latina 1960-2013 is a magnificent, eye-opening and deeply moving exhibition but it never resolves that \nproblem. There are more words in it than in any exhibition of photographs I have ever seen. Not in captions or \naccompanying texts, but within the pictures. Almost every body of work included is actively wordy.\n\n\n\nThere are some images made with other things than words in which the photographic elements are really only \nillustration (the map-based works of Claudio Perna, for example). There are some texts written directly on the \nimages (as the magnificent calligraphic screams of Le\u00f3n Ferrari). There are far more texts found in the \nenvironment: graffiti and posters on urban walls, advertising, packaging. There are numbers of \"extreme\" words: a \nset of pictures by Ros\u00e2ngela Renn\u00f3 mining a prison archive for studies of crude tattoos or an extraordinary 1970s \nvideo piece in which Let\u00edcia Parente made her comment on the commercialisation beginning then to gather pace in \nher country by stitching the words \"Made in Brasil\" into her own foot in black thread.\n\nThe curators don't identify words-within-the-image as a specifically Latin American style of picture-making, but it is \nplainly the central current of the exhibition. This imposes a noticeable skew: in an exhibition of dozens of artists \nworking across a very wide register (from performance to interventions in the landscape, to documentary and \nrepurposing existing photographs and so on), made over 50 years across a huge geographical territory, we are \ninvited to see only works in which overtly political or socio-political messages are dominant.\n\nBy extension, these are works in which the magical complexity of possible reactions to a photograph is diminished. \nThere are many treatments of photographs here, but in few of them is the photograph itself the locus of wonder or \ndelight. There is no place, for example, for the deeply non-verbal, almost mystical, religious imagery of the \nGuatemalan artist Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Palma. Nor, at the other end of the scale, is there any room for Enrique Metinides, \nthe \"Mexican Weegee\", whose cataloguing of death and disaster was non-judgmental and non-political.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; The real subject of the exhibition is violence. The start date chosen for the show - 1960 - is not coincidental. \nThe Cuban revolution against Batista took place in 1959, and Cuba has been the yardstick of a certain kind of \nradicalism ever since. A frightening map showing revolutions and counter-revolutions accompanies the show.\n\nBut violence is not only the overt political violence that seems to drive regime change in Latin America. There is \nalso the violence of need, of the favelas and all the rough conditions associated with them. Or the violence of drugs, \nor of landholding and landowning abuses. Or the violence of race. There are many varieties of violence in Latin \nAmerica, and even now, as many of its countries show faster growth and greater prosperity than many in Europe or \nAsia, that violence still seems close to the lives of the people.\n\nMany of the stories told in this show are horrible. Take the series Gloria Evaporada, by Eduardo Villanes, which \nironises savagely on the fact that the Peruvian authorities returned the ashes of the victims of the 1992 Cantuta \nmassacre to their families in cardboard boxes which had contained Gloria evaporated milk. You don't need to speak \nSpanish to understand the terrible pun. And it is not the pictures which tell the story. A man with his head in a \ncardboard box labelled Gloria means nothing until we read the facts behind it.\n\nThis is a good example of that word-leading element which occurs again and again in this exhibition. The pictures \nare rarely complete visual communications. They are elements of something else, either powerfully direct like a \nposter or a headline, or sometimes a more complex amalgam that can only be deciphered with contextual help or a \nglossary.\n\nIt turns out that the Argentine death squads who flew political opponents over the River Plate (during the military \ndictatorship 1976-83) to dump them alive out at sea consulted ecclesiastical authority to seek confirmation that their \nmethod of killing was Christian and non-violent. This is the subject of Le\u00f3n Ferrari's work. It's madness, the very \nstuff of a certain kind of art. In the hands of a Zola or a Balzac, it would make a searing novel. It is in literature that \nsuch deep traumas of the continent have been most consistently explored, and a catalogue of stories of this kind \nmake up the exhibition. They burn into the mind even in the comfortable surroundings of a contemporary art space \nin Paris's 14th arrondissement. Only occasionally, though, are they told in a way rich in photography itself.\n\n\n\nA heavily laden family group moves along a pavement in a suburban district. It's not hard to imagine that everything \nthey own is in their hands. They might be peasants, moving into the city as so many millions have done. We see \nthem through the windshield of a police motorcycle, its lettering clearly legible even in reverse. We have, for a \nmoment, authority's point of view. A child of the family turns apprehensively; he knows that he is being watched.\n\nThis powerful little picture is less of a poster than many of the works in the show; it's by Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, a \nhighly distinguished photographer, and it really is a photograph, complete within itself. Yet even so, we could not \nunderstand it without the seven letters of POLICIA that take up nearly a quarter of the frame.\n\nThere's a ton of thinking and reflection and history in this exhibition, which is thoughtfully divided into four meaty \nand helpful categories (Territory; The City; Informing/Resisting; and Memory & Identity). Some of the artists are very \nwell known (Francis Al\u00ffs, disappointing here, in a few reworked sketches of some of his walking pieces; Graciela \nIturbide, not at all disappointing in her gut-wrenching revelation of the daily torture undergone by Frida Kahlo in the \ncorsets and prostheses she had to wear after a road crash in 1925). Yet the general tenor is rough-and-ready: \ncollage, handwritten messages, stencilling, photocopying. It's like a huge student show, with the terrible urgency of \nthe issues getting in the way of coolness. But the driving heat is formidably impressive.\n\nIt is a very odd thing, this: a photography exhibition in which photography is itself pretty consistently a secondary \nelement. It takes time to see this show, time spent above all reading. But you come out of it profoundly moved by all \nthose artists, raging in pictures.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAm\u00e9rica Latina 1960-2013, Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, Paris, until April 6 2014\n\nfondation.cartier.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It was part of a case that my parents had shipped up to the remote village of Applecross in \nnorthwest Scotland for essential evening first aid after August days spent tramping over boggy hills in pouring rain \nand getting eaten alive on a midge-infested river.\n\n\n\nMy association of port with extreme weather remains strong. In southeast England I only drink the stuff during that \ntesting period when the light drains out of the sky in mid-afternoon, the cold begins to grip and, in the worst cases, \nthe tennis courts freeze over.\n\nAs this British winter sets in, I'm faced with both a dangerous opportunity and an intriguing dilemma. The emptying \nof the cellar in our former family home at Coleshill means that my small stock of port is lying vulnerably above \nground, rather than snugly under it, needing to be consumed sooner rather than later. But which port to drink first?\n\nThe choice is first of all between tawny and vintage. To be more technical, this is a choice between wood-matured \nand bottle-matured port, between wine that has spent most of its life in the slender barrels called pipes, in one of \nthe warehouses or lodges that line the south bank of the river Douro at Gaia opposite the old city of Oporto, and \nport that has been bottled young and left to age much more slowly under northern skies.\n\nThis choice has cultural, historical and sociopolitical dimensions as well as purely aesthetic ones. It could be \nexpressed as a question: is port a Portuguese or a British wine? Port is one of those wines, like red Bordeaux, in \nwhose development British merchants played a key role. Wars with France in the late 17th and early 18th centuries \nled enterprising British (and Dutch) merchants to search for acceptable wines from their old ally Portugal to replace \nembargoed French sources. The Methuen treaty of 1703 enshrined low rates of duty on Portuguese wine in return \nfor free entry of English cloth to Portugal.\n\nAlmost by chance, the British hit on the sun-baked upper reaches of the Douro as a better source than the sodden \nMinho, whose wines have always been acid. They were not always at all scrupulous in their dealings with local \nfarmers, as Hugh Johnson relates in his excellent The Story of Wine, sometimes requiring a farmer's daughter in \npart-exchange for the wine. In 1727, the British merchants founded their association in Oporto at the Factory \nHouse, which became a quasi-colonial club. A year after the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the Marqu\u00eas \nde Pombal, as part of his salvage plan for the country, part-nationalised the industry, citing British abuses. The \nBritish merchants were infuriated and put up prices. Following the Tipplers' Riots of 1757, 26 members of the \nFactory House were executed. It turned out to be a temporary setback. British merchants prospered for most of the \n19th century, though they had a choppier time in the 20th.\n\nTo express this long cultural history in stylistic terms, you could say that firm, masculine, long-lasting vintage, the \nproduct of a single exceptional year, was the classic style invented by the British, whereas tawny, more gentle, less \naggressive, perhaps more subtle, and usually blended from many different vintages, was the style preferred in \nPortugal. I love both but on a recent visit to Oporto found myself veering towards a third style. This is colheita, or \nsingle-vintage tawny; wine from a single year matured for decades in wood.\n\nThe occasion was a charity dinner culminating in the auction of special lots of Graham's colheita 1982, a wine \nbottled in honour of last month's christening of Prince George, with proceeds to the charity Bagos d'Ouro, which \npromotes education for disadvantaged children in a region that has remained poor. Wealth has always flown \ndownriver towards Oporto and beyond rather than trickling back to where the grapes grow on steep slopes above \nthe river, needing to be picked by hand and sometimes, even now, trodden by foot.\n\nBefore the dinner, at the Graham's lodge in Gaia, which now incorporates a smart restaurant and shop (unthinkable \n25 years ago, when the lodges looked unchanged from the 19th century) I tasted a comprehensive range of the \ncompany's ports. Though I loved the still youthful, bramble and violet- scented 2007 vintage, the star wine for me \nwas the 1952 colheita, with its concentrated raisiny richness and astonishing freshness and finesse.\n\nOnce again cultural reflections mingled with aesthetic ones. Graham's is a company of Scottish heritage, founded \nby one family of Scots entrepreneurs, then bought by another, the dynamic Symingtons, who now control almost a \nthird of the port business. But the guests and speeches at the dinner, which might once have been Anglo-Saxon in \ninflection, were almost all Portuguese, and the wine chosen to honour a British prince was in a Portuguese style.\n\nharry.eyres@ft.com, @sloweyres\n\nMore columns at ft.com/eyres\n\nmailto:harry.eyres@ft.com\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Cognac maker Roger Prisset stands in his \nstorehouse next to a barrel promisingly chalked up \"1962\", and lifts off the wooden stopper with one hand - a tenth \nof the effort you'd need to uncork a weeknight wine.\n\nHe sticks his nose as far as it will go into the barrel, then encourages our little party of cognac tourists, shivering in \nthe damp November chill, to do the same. An instantly warming vapour of sweet, deep honey and cigars shoots into \nthe head.\n\nPrisset does not want an airtight seal: cognac needs to breathe through its oak cask to take on the colour and \nflavour of the wood. The 1962 smells good but then, he admits, it was an uncommonly good year, and anyway not \nsomething he can take credit for. This vintage was made by his father, who like his grandfather, was a cognac \nmaster. For really good cognac, you have to wait.\n\nIn all there are about 4,000 producers of France's famous spirit but more than 90 per cent of what they make is \ntankered away for blending at the \"big four\" cognac houses - R\u00e9my Martin, Hennessy, Courvoisier and Martell. \nThese powerful businesses have successfully chased new markets in the Americas, Singapore and China, pushing \nglobal sales of cognac to around EUR2.35bn last year, according to the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du \nCognac. What the independents keep behind, they sell under their own labels, taking a tiny 2 per cent of the \nmarket.\n\nI'm here to try a new weekend tour of independent cognac makers such as Prisset, something started this month by \nNick Brimblecombe, an Englishman who runs the Logis du Paradis, a boutique hotel 20km south of the town of \nCognac. It's surrounded by Grande Champagne, an area of villages and valleys that is the premier cru, the most \nprestigious, in the Cognac region.\n\nThe trip begins on Friday evening at Bordeaux airport, where a 7ft claret bottle by the luggage carousel announces \nthe good life just as clearly as Brimblecombe's generous frame. Over the next two days we will taste more than 20 \ncognacs, attend a workshop on blending and visit four independent producers.\n\nBrimblecombe (he books as \"Monsieur Nicholas\" at local restaurants to spare the French pronunciation) and his \nwife Sally moved here from the UK in 2005 when they bought a then crumbling heap of 18th-century buildings in the \nhamlet of La Magdeleine. Set around a large courtyard, the estate includes an old cognac distillery (its copper stills \nnow polished up around a bar), cellar-turned-garage for his vintage cars, three cottages and a main house shaded \nprettily by lime trees. The Brimblecombes' spaniel, Bramble, keeps watch in the courtyard for something to happen, \nthough as in so many French provincial outposts, nothing much does.\n\nWinter is the ideal time to visit, and not simply to stock up on Christmas supplies or to test the drink's warming \nproperties. With the grape harvest complete, the copper stills in the distilleries are lit (with gas these days, rather \nthan coke) in November and kept alight until March, meaning visitors can see cognac production in process. It \n\n\n\nbegins with the simple, low alcohol white wine (largely made of ugni blanc grapes), which is distilled in solid, \nhandmade copper stills to make \"brouillis\". A second distillation, called la bonne chauffe, is when the floral notes of \nthe terroir are supposed to be coaxed forward, and the clear eau de vie that results is transferred to French oak \nbarrels for ageing.\n\nOn Saturday morning in sleepy Jarnac, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's birthplace on the banks of La Charente, we visit the \nTiffon/Braastad distillery (it uses the latter name in Scandinavian markets), where 10 stills are at work, a medium-\nsized operation. We begin in a warehouse by the riverfront next to a giant cask holding cognac more than 100 years \nold. It is left untouched - it can only increase in value.\n\nAfter propping up the bar in the tasting room, where a succession of ever darker, ever older cognacs is poured, we \ndrive on upstream, through the rolling valleys to lunch in Saint-Simon. We pass ch\u00e2teaux, fields of sunflowers and \nstaves of Limousin oak drying in the sunshine (only particular forests can be used for cognac coopering). It's a \npretty, pastoral scene but soon we begin to notice the pale Charentais brick walls and terracotta roofs of many of \nthe cognac storehouses, or chais, are stained sooty black, making them look burnt and abandoned.\n\nIn fact, the black marks are proud signs of the cognac makers' industry: as the drink ages, some evaporates - la \npart des anges or the angels' share - which feeds a fungus that thrives on the walls and turns them black.\n\nSaint-Simon is the village where the gabarres, the flat-bottomed barges that used to transport the cognac barrels, \nwere manufactured.\n\nAfter a simple lunch at the local caf\u00e9 (much-needed after the standing tasting at Tiffon), we move on to visit Patrick \nand Maria Brillet's Domaine Breuil de Segonzac, an estate that holds a rare \"bio organic\" certification. Seemingly \nevery cognac producer in the Grande Champagne has an elderly dog guarding their property; here an old Spanish \nmastiff patrols the beautiful grounds, set around a gorgeous 18th-century house.\n\nThe Brillets spent almost a decade turning their cognac and wine fully organic but, even so, still sell most of it to the \nbig four. They also make the classic Cognac aperitif, pineau, a rather syrupy-sweet mix of unfermented grape juice \nand cognac eau de vie, but nicely done here.\n\nAt the back of their modern distillery is its disused 19th-century counterpart: a tiny room crammed with tarnished \ncopper stills with a brick lean-to in the corner, where the distiller would have slept through the night, keeping the \nfires going.\n\nCelebrity endorsements and the marketing efforts of the big four have given cognac associations of excess and \nconspicuous consumption. Jay-Z celebrated his recent Grammy award by drinking D'Uss\u00e9 cognac from the trophy. \nMeanwhile, prices have soared - two years ago, a single bottle of Croizet cognac sold for Rmb1m (\u00a3101,000) in \nShanghai.\n\n\"The past four years have been the most prolific in 40 years,\" says Jacques Denis, another nearby producer. \"Small \nguys are buying nice cars and getting their roofs mended.\"\n\nNevertheless, as the afternoon cools and the autumn mists roll in through the woods, the antics of high-rolling \nrappers seem a long way away, the marketing hype stilled by the sense of centuries-old tradition. It's dark by the \ntime we leave Domaine Breuil de Segonzac, exiting through another cellar that smells of damp earth, mixed with \nthe scent of coffee and honey.\n\nNatalie Whittle was a guest of Grape Escapes (grapeescapes.net), which offers two-night cognac tours at the Logis \ndu Paradis on several dates during the year, from \u00a3499 per person, or from \u00a3365 per person staying at the Ch\u00e2teau \nde l'Yeuse\n\nSee Christmas Food & Drink special, FT Weekend Magazine\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It's a school photograph, and the background is sky \nblue; the red is deep and slightly faded, maybe a tiny bit Vel\u00e1zquez-y. I have a wry expression, a bit jolly, a bit \nreserved. I'm six-ish. Life is complicated but not unpleasant.\n\nIf I were a dress, I think I would be that dress. It sums up something important about me. It was on the invitation to \nmy 30th birthday with the words \"THWACK! Susie hits Thirty.\" It was reproduced in a memoir I wrote some years \nago, next to a picture of Dorothy relaxing between takes, with Toto, on the set of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nIt is one of three important childhood dresses, the other two being a 1950s cotton summer dress printed with \npictures of gift-wrapped parcels, and a dark green wool dress with embroidered lazy daisies at the neck that my \nmother made me to receive my cycling proficiency certificate at Islington town hall.\n\n\n\nBut the red dress is the main event. It's dignified. It tries to show a polished front. It tells a story.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I went to give a talk at a local girls' school today and was told by the \nlibrarian, who had invited me, that she used to live next door to us when I was small and that my mother had once \ngiven her a red velvet dress which I had grown out of, for her own daughter. It had become a firm friend, this hand-\nme-down. They have a favourite family photograph of her daughter wearing it, she told me.\n\nIt was a strange piece of information to receive. Did it make this important, era-defining dress less mine, somehow? \nWas there a precious doubling evident in this coincidence or was it what Phillip Larkin would have termed a \n\"dilution\"? It was a bit like the feeling I had two weeks ago when a woman walked into a party wearing the same \ndark teal (which reads as navy) shift, printed with white squares (that read as polka dots), as I was wearing. It didn't \nfeel ideal, but there was nothing to be done but to shrug and grin. (Grug or shrin).\n\nI phoned my mother later on about the red dress, but she did not remember any more details.\n\n\"Where did you find that dress anyway?\" I asked, with a nose for a good tale.\n\n\"I don't know. In a jumble sale, probably.\" She was using the brisk telephone manner of someone who is trying to \ncomplete a painting of the last leaves glimpsed from her window before they crisp and blow off the trees, so I did \nnot press her further.\n\nThe schoolgirls I talked to were fresh and lovely and engaged. It was only halfway through the event that I realised I \nwas unwittingly sporting 80 per cent of their school uniform: a navy kilted skirt and a navy cardigan. My navy mac \nwas folded neatly over the back of my chair. Add a pale yellow shirt, and might I have almost passed as a sixth \nformer? It was a thrilling thought. \"Well, perhaps to someone with severely limited vision,\" I answered myself tartly. \n(Of course, the sixth formers wear their own clothes anyway, just to make the matter utterly clear.)\n\nPerhaps my unconscious uniform matching could be seen as an attempt at courtesy. My godmother often used to \ntake on the accent of the person she was speaking to, very, very, subtly, and this always struck me as the height of \npoliteness. It was considered charming but it was a risky strategy.\n\nI talked to the schoolgirls about my life and my work. We touched on fashion writing, a subject that interested some \nof them greatly. I said that my thinking about fashion hinged on the fact that I liked my own clothes to communicate \nquite clearly that anything that has ever gone wrong in my life - well, none of it was my fault.\n\nLater on, I mentioned my early love of the stage and everything to do with it, and how happy I am that a book I \nwrote some years ago will soon be a play. \"You must be in it!' they said, which went down very well with me.\n\nIt was a day of outfits twinned and recreated, for in the evening on the way to a friend's book launch, still in my \nuniform, I caused some mirth in the Dover Street Acne store. I went upstairs and tried on a slightly A-line wool \nknee-length skirt and a matching, single-breasted A-line wool coat. Putting on something so reminiscent of a district \nnurse in this temple of cool was a strange sensation. The outfit worked well, and I did feel a little stab of delight, so \nit's not surprising that it took about a minute for it to sink in that in almost every respect it was exactly the same as \nthe one I was wearing.\n\n\"Well, you know what you like,\" the assistant said approvingly.\n\nWe agreed their coat would be fractionally warmer than the one I had on, being made of a medium-weight felt \nrather than wool gaberdine, but we both knew we were splitting fashion hairs.\n\nsusie.boyt@ft.com; Twitter: @SusieBoyt\n\nMore columns atft.com/boyt\n\nVanessa Friedman's column returns on December 14\n\nmailto:susie.boyt@ft.com\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

From December 15, direct high-speed trains will link Paris and \nBarcelona. They will travel at up to 320kph (199mph), completing the trip to the Catalan capital in six hours 17 \nminutes - the existing direct train takes almost 12 hours.\n\nThere have been several false starts along the way. Rumours that TGVs (trains \u00e0 grande vitesse) would reach \nBarcelona in April, and then in October, came and went, amid suggestions that the delay was as much political as \ntechnical. The Paris-Barcelona service will be run jointly by SNCF (France's state-owned operator) and Renfe \n(Spain's equivalent) but both sides have been suspicious of the other's ambitions to extend services and \ncompetition on their home soil.\n\nBut with political concerns set aside and technical problems solved, from mid-December a sleek double-deck TGV \nDuplex will leave Gare de Lyon for Barcelona initially twice a day at 7.15am and 2.07pm, with fares likely to start at \nEUR59 each way. From March 31 next year, two more departures (at 10.07am and 4.07pm) will be added.\n\nThe link makes the concept of an airline-rivalling European high-speed rail network seem increasingly realistic. \nIncluding transport from city centre to airport, and allowing time for check-in and security, flying from Paris to \nBarcelona takes about five hours. From 2017, the case for rail with be strengthened further when a new section of \nhigh-speed line from N\u00eemes to Montpellier cuts the journey to about five hours 45 minutes.\n\nAs of next month, British travellers will be able to leave London by Eurostar at 9.17am to connect with the afternoon \nTGV from Paris, although an earlier Eurostar at 7.55am allows for a leisurely lunch at Gare de Lyon's celebrated \nTrain Bleu restaurant. You can down the half bottle of red included with the set lunch (plus the liberal quantity of \nMartinique rum in which the rum baba is doused), safe in the knowledge that your train leaves from a platform 100 \nmetres from the table.\n\nThere is no check-in; passengers can wait until a minute or two before departure before stepping on board. Choose \nan upper-deck seat for the best views; there are tables for four for families while a first class table for two is ideal \nfor couples. After easing out of Gare de Lyon and threading its way through the Paris suburbs, the train will gather \npace, taking the Rhone Valley high-speed line, bypassing Lyon and gliding past pretty French villages. The \nmaximum speed here is 300kph (186mph) - not too fast to appreciate rural France.\n\nThe train will stop briefly at Valence and then turn west near Avignon, slowing to call at N\u00eemes and Montpellier. \nBetween Narbonne and Perpignan it will flirt with the Mediterranean coastline, crossing causeways over several \nlakes, where vast flocks of flamingos seem unperturbed by the passing trains. Beyond Perpignan the TGV will join \nthe new high-speed line and you will feel a slight push back into your seat - though not enough to spill your vin \nrouge - as it accelerates to maximum speed. It will call briefly at Figueres Vilafant (a short walk from the fabulous \nSalvador Dal\u00ed museum), then continue to Girona before rolling into Barcelona's bright and modern Sants station just \nafter 8.30pm.

His most recent project is Librer\u00eda Donceles, a Spanish-language used \nbookstore that will be on show at CIFO (Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation) in Miami from December 4.\n\nHow did the Librer\u00eda Donceles come about?\n\n\n\nIt began from the realisation that in New York City there are 2m Spanish speakers, nearly a quarter of the entire \npopulation, and there are no Spanish-only bookstores in Manhattan and no used Spanish bookstores anywhere in \nNew York.\n\nWhy is it important to have such a bookshop?\n\nBooks are critical in cultural mobility and education. A used book is also a powerful vessel because of its ownership \nhistory. Each book in the bookstore has an Ex-Libris with the name of the previous owner to create a connection \nwith the next reader.\n\nHow did you go about it?\n\nWe went to Mexico City, where I promised a small piece of my work in exchange for every 60 books. Soon we had \n25,000!\n\nOriginally, you set up the bookstore in your gallery in Manhattan. How was it received?\n\nThe idea of the bookstore is that it is itinerant; while we were in that location we also went to book fairs like the \nLatino book fair in Harlem. We generated interest from a wide spectrum of people - from literature students to \nDominican poets. I organised weekly social gatherings, or tertulias: readings, discussions, music, and many other \nkinds of programmes.\n\nAfter Miami, you take it to downtown Phoenix, Arizona. Why there?\n\nArizona is perhaps the place where the conservative, anti-immigration push is felt strongest in the US. A third of the \npopulation of Arizona is Latino; there is a pushback to repress the presence of the culture that comes with it. In \nTucson, for example, the state threatened to defund the school system if it continued teaching ethnic studies - \nthanks to pressure from the Tea Party.\n\nWe are going to open in a location that used to be a Borders bookstore. It is very important for us to be on a street-\nlevel storefront, as Librer\u00eda Donceles must allow full public access to anyone in the city.\n\nThe Librer\u00eda Donceles is an example of the socially engaged art which is increasingly practised by contemporary \nartists today. What do you think is behind this phenomenon?\n\nIn part, it is a pushback against the incredible growth in the power of the art market over the past two decades. I \nbelieve that a lot of artists today are rejecting the idea that one must depend exclusively on the market. Additionally, \nthere is great interest in making work that has relevance in social spheres outside museums, biennials and \ngalleries.\n\nDecember 4-February 23 2014, cifo.org\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But an interview with Shawky at 10am makes the viewing \nessential.\n\nGrumpily, I press \"play\", and the Nile glides across the screen in monochrome. The scene cuts to a dark chamber \npeopled by children dressed as men. As one digs a hole in the floor, the others tell the story of a community who, \non the advice of their dying leaders, devote themselves to the worship of various animals until they mutate into \nhybrids. A parable warning us of the perils of blind faith, it enraptures through the musical voices (which are adult); \nthe solemn conviction on the children's faces; and the equilibrium of the images as they shift between the airless \ncave and the ancient river.\n\n\n\nThe fact that, by the end, my imagination feels renewed owes much to Shawky's gifts as a storyteller. Nevertheless, \nthat is just the tip of a far more complex vision. \"You are watching one story but you are hearing another story. You \nare watching a kid but you are hearing a man, so you are focusing on two systems simultaneously,\" he tells me as \nwe sit in the lobby of his Marylebone hotel, sipping coffee from paper cups.\n\nThe tale of the hybrid villagers was originally a story by the late Egyptian writer Mohamed Mustagab. It is typical of \nShawky to layer one imaginative gesture on to another so the spectator is left enlightened yet giddy by the pyramid \nof shifting expressions.\n\nThis vertiginous vision has propelled him to the peak of the contemporary art world. The recipient of numerous \nawards, including the Sharjah Biennial prize this year, he has had solo shows at the KW Contemporary Art Institute \nin Berlin and the Walker Art Centre, Minneapolis. Now it is London's turn: his new exhibition, Wael Shawky: al-\nQurban, opened this week at the Serpentine Gallery.\n\nShawky was born in Alexandria, Egypt, but spent his youth in Mecca, where his father worked as an engineer. \"I \nthink I was making all the drawings for every activity in the whole school,\" he remembers, laughing. Now 42, today \ndressed in a casual blue T-shirt and jeans, his easygoing manner and ready smile ensure that he retains a light-\nhearted, youthful air.\n\nFrom the first, he possessed a subtlety of mind. Traumatised by his return to Alexandria when he was 13, he \nentered a \"very turbulent\" adolescent crisis. Solace came at 17, when he enrolled at the city's Academy of Fine \nArts. \"From that moment, I don't think I was thinking of anything else [except art].\"\n\nLessons at the academy were \"mainly drawing and painting\", he recalls. Other than the groundbreaking work being \ndone at Cairo's non-profit Townhouse Gallery - which gave Shawky several early solo shows - Egypt had almost no \ncontemporary art scene. His awakening occurred on a trip to Madrid, where he saw Bill Viola's videos at the Reina \nSofia museum. \"It was really, really great.\" He pauses. \"I hadn't seen anything like that in Egypt at all.\"\n\nHe started to visit New York every summer. Soon, a crucial influence was Joseph Beuys. \"Oh my God, yes. That \nwas the man,\" he breathes. \"The idea that the material itself became a vehicle for human belief was very important \nfor me,\" he continues, citing Beuys' custom of making installations out of fat which, according to his own self-\nmythology, had saved him when he was shot down as a pilot in the second world war.\n\n\"In order for you to receive any information from this cube of fat, for example, you had to believe in its chemical \ncontent. For me this is a bit religious. It is [similar] to when you look at the Koran or the Bible. It's a book which is \nsacred as it is, even if you don't open it, because you believe in its chemical content.\"\n\nA flair for expressing the flawed, contradictory processes by which we arrive at faith and knowledge is the bedrock \nof Shawky's vision. As a young artist, he made installations out of asphalt to reflect his childhood in Mecca - to \n\"understand the relationship between me and my family and Saudi Arabia, which had discovered oil and the British \nand American oil companies were arriving. All the modernity that I lived in the 1970s in Saudi Arabia [was] based on \nthis western arrival. The asphalt was a metaphor for oil, of course.\"\n\nParadoxically, his gift for deconstruction hinges on his feeling for old-fashioned narrative. The work that catapulted \nhim to the world's attention was Cabaret Crusades, a two-part film in which marionettes act out the medieval \nstruggle for control over the Middle East. A spine-tingling anti-epic, it leaves viewers appalled by the carnage yet \nriveted by Shawky's meticulous mapping of the era's Byzantine twists and turns. \"I had to do a lot of research,\" he \nagrees. A crucial source was The Crusades Through Arab Eyes (1984), a history of the period by the Lebanese-\nFrench writer Amin Maalouf. \"It shows you that history can be told from a different angle ... from the Arab side.\"\n\nHis new two-part film, Al Araba Al Madfuna, is also grounded in his fascination with the way that the stories we tell \nourselves - uncertain, mutable, contingent - evolve into unquestioned beliefs. Its seeds were sown more than 10 \nyears ago when a friend invited Shawky to witness a ritual in a village in upper Egypt. There, he explains, there is a \nritual of digging through the floors of homes in the hope of discovering buried Pharaonic treasure. \"But it is \nimpossible to discover a tomb unless you break the spells of the Pharoahs that act as protection on the door of the \n\n\n\nchamber.\" Night after night he watched as his friend, who works as a medium, engaged in his dialogue \"with \nsomething like ghosts\".\n\nWhat fascinated him was the dichotomy between the means and the end. \"They use a metaphysical system, magic \nessentially, to reach a material, physical system: gold.\"\n\nThe second part of the film, which premieres this week at the Serpentine, turns on a rumour. \"It's set outdoors and \nyou see one group of kids going to another group of kids spreading this story.\"\n\nLike the first film, the tale the children are telling was written by Mustagab. Entitled The Offering, it centres on a \nvillage of traders who, suddenly afflicted by muteness, transform themselves into entertainers who clap at parties. \nWhen a man comes to restore their voices, he disappears mysteriously. \"Perhaps the villagers killed them because \nthey didn't want to lose the clapping.\"\n\nGiven the tortuous history of Shawky's own region and the nature of his interests - social transformation, the nature \nof faith, power and communication, the way our collective fantasies can tip into psychosis - how does he succeed in \nmaking work which is profoundly relevant to its political moment yet also sufficient unto itself?\n\n\"I try as much as I can not to react to current political events,\" he says. \"You can't expect a revolution to happen \ntoday. I [may] be making a film about the revolution [tomorrow]: that's changeable. Yes, the revolution will happen \nand we will support the army now, and the second day the army will cheat on you. You will change your mind after \nyou made the film; this is not art, it is just reactionary activity. Art must be much bigger than this.\"\n\nWe have been talking for two hours and Shawky has a plane to catch, yet he never glances at his watch or mobile \nphone. That lucid, scrupulous commitment to presence is the key to his art's power. It is what compelled him to, for \nexample, track down a particular radood - a Shia religious singer - to play the part of Ibn al-Khashshab, an \nimportant Shia leader with a role in Cabaret Crusades. \"I did think: why am I being that precise? Perhaps nobody \nwill notice the radood.\" He pauses. \"But it's internal.\"\n\nSerpentine Gallery, London, to February 9. serpentinegalleries.org Lisson Gallery, London, January 31-March 8 \n2014. lissongallery.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

When it comes to \nchocolate, the boasting metric is the percentage of cocoa solids. Reasonable milk chocolate should come in above \n40 per cent. Dark, plain chocolate wants to be comfortably higher than 60 per cent.\n\nBut to get your Christmas kicks from the cocoa bean this year you might be looking for something more darkly \nchallenging, even plain aggressive. In this sampling of eight chocolate hampers there were some individual \nproducts to feed even the most extreme habit. Mast Brothers' Madagascar Dark Chocolate (72 per cent) was adult \nand complex; Duffy's Panama Dark Chocolate (also 72 per cent) was smoothly assertive; and topping these was \nThe Grenada Chocolate Company Organic Dark Chocolate at 82 per cent. Its flavour can best be likened to \nchewing tobacco that's been soaked in barrel-proof rum. And, as we shall discover, it was sourced for the winning \nhamper.\n\nThree of our regulars were up for this task. The Discerning Litigator (DL), the Gourmet Celeb (GC) and the \nGluttonous Pig (GP), who prudently prepared himself for the ordeal by taking an antacid tablet before he started. \nWe also wanted a certified chocoholic - in all, we had to try about 85 products, from chocolate figs to salted \ncaramels and from popcorn to cinnamon-sugared drinking chocolate. The FT found the perfect candidate: Jennifer \nEarle (JE) - the proprietor of London's Chocolate Ecstasy Tours, co-founder of worldchocolateguide.com and chief \ntaster for Cocoa Runners, which sources artisan chocolate bars from around the world. She has an encyclopedic \nknowledge of chocolate products and has been an addict of the dark stuff since her early teens. When asked why, \nher answer is disarmingly simple: \"It makes me happy.\"\n\nIt emerged fairly swiftly that three of the hampers were out in front in terms of variety and quality. But first, some \nother highlights. Melt's Brown Hamper (\u00a370, meltchocolates.com) included an attractive hot-chocolate kit: one \ncylinder of dark-chocolate buttons (70 per cent cocoa solids) and another of cinnamon sugar.\n\nThe two together produced an agreeable cup of drinking chocolate: \"seductively mulled\" (GP). Its raspberry and \ntarragon-flavoured white chocolate was enterprising but more of an acquired taste.\n\nBrindisa assembled El Azucar, a box of \"sweet Spanish delights\" (\u00a349.95, brindisa.com), the high point of which \nwas a box of chocolate-covered dried figs - Rabitos Royale Bomb\u00f3n de Higo: \"good for sharing but a pity the \nchocolate casing is only 54 per cent\"(JE). It also threw in a bottle of Don Jos\u00e9 Oloroso sherry. A darker, richer \nversion would have matched the confectionery even better - this one was bordering on the lighter Palo Cortado \nstyle.\n\n\n\nHarrods sent a traditionally packaged Celebration of Chocolate (\u00a3125, harrods.com), which we enjoyed but found a \ntrifle conservative. Oaks Hampers' Chocolate Box (\u00a335, oakshampers.com) included two imaginative ideas: Joe & \nSeph's Gourmet Popcorn with Caramel and Belgian Chocolate - \"like crunchy, creamy bubbles\"(DL) - and Love \nJam, a raspberry and chocolate emulsion with a number of implied uses - \"sharp fruit tang with rich chocolatey \nflavour . . . for sharing and spreading\"(GP). Finally, Partridges' Chocolate Hamper (\u00a3110, partridges.co.uk) included \na bottle of own-label champagne and a tin of Huntley & Palmers Chocolate Olivers, which, it emerged, the panel \nhad a collective weakness for.\n\nNow, for the two runners-up. Paul A Young's Ultimate Chocolate Lovers Hamper (\u00a3142, paulayoung.co.uk) offered \nthe 72 per cent Madagascar Dark Chocolate bar already mentioned (\"bliss\" - GC). There were also Mixed Pav\u00e9s - \nsquares of white, milk and plain chocolate impregnated with lovely spices (\"for the connoisseur\" - JE), a chocolate \nbar with Marmite in the centre (\"salted caramel with attitude\" - GP) and a jar of pure salted caramel. The other \nrecommended box, a Deluxe Christmas Hamper from William Curley (\u00a3150, williamcurley.com), contained delicious \nif slightly leaky salted caramel chocolates and classy truffles (\"serious, X-rated\" - GC; \"sophisticated\" - DL).\n\nOur winning Christmas hamper, though, in front for appeal, choice, flair and indulgence, came from Chococo - the \nPurbeck Chocolate Company. Its box of chocolates caused a sharp intake of breath when opened. As well as being \neaten, it could well be mounted in an art gallery, with its riot of colour and design, from vivid green pistachio to gold \nfretwork to floral transfers. These visuals were allied to precise flavours and A1 cocoa: \"a beautiful, fantastic \nassortment\" (JE). There was also a Mini Marble Cake Yule Log with chewy cherries and raisins and some shrewd \nofferings for younger scoffers: a conical Christmas tree, a honeycombed chocolate star on a stick and a \nVenezuelan chocolate penguin: \"mouth-watering kids' treats, definitely not to be eaten all in one go\" (GC). \nChococo's distinctive, colourful \"Battenburg\" packaging also appealed to the aesthetes among us - \"superb-looking \nproduct\" (DL). And the selection was full of wit (small chocolates designed like Xmas puds with sugar holly) and \nvigour (that Grenadian 82 percenter lying like an unexploded bomb at the bottom). Congratulations to Chococo.\n\nWe asked our panel one more question: of the 85 products offered up, which single one is your must-have \nfavourite? The Gluttonous Pig, wiping his ample, choco-stained jowls, opted for Chococo's Dark Chocolate-Covered \nColombian Roasted Coffee Beans: \"sensationally well-roasted beans for a crunchy mocha explosion in the mouth\". \nThe Gourmet Celeb chose the Mast Brothers' 72 per cent Madagascar Dark Chocolate (also offered by Paul A \nYoung). And both the Discerning Litigator and Jennifer Earle fingered Chococo's stunning chocolate selection.\n\nA happy choco-Xmas to you all.\n\nJennifer Earle's Chocolate Ecstasy Tours; chocolateecstasytours.com\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe winner\n\nLuxury Festive Hamper by Chococo - \"out in front for appeal, choice, flair, indulgence\"; \u00a399, chococo.co.uk\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

A few miles from Brumadinho in the \nsouthwestern state of Minas Gerais, the mining tycoon Bernardo Paz has spent the past 15 years building an art \npark and nature reserve called Inhotim in 3,000 acres of forest and farmland. There are career-defining works here \nby some of the greatest artists of our age, from the Americans Matthew Barney and Chris Burden to the Canadian \nduo Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, the Colombian sculptor Doris Salcedo, the Japanese artist Yayoi \nKusama, the Italian Giuseppe Penone, and many others.\n\nWhat Paz and his team of curators have created here must rank among the most ambitious and original \ncontemporary art museums ever conceived. There is no single, monolithic building designed by a famous architect \n\n\n\nof the kind favoured by most institutions across the world. Instead there are 22 galleries scattered in the vast, \nimmaculately manicured landscape, which are connected via stone paths meandering through lush vegetation.\n\nSome of these buildings are perched on the edge of emerald-green artificial lakes, others are hidden in the forest or \npositioned on top of steep hills with imposing views of the surrounding region. A further 22 outdoor sculptures are \ndotted throughout the site. So a visit to Inhotim is part gallery visit and part nature hike, a combination that is \nsurprisingly successful.\n\n\"Most museums are places where people go for an hour or two before reaching a state of fatigue,\" says Allan \nSchwartzman, the New York-based art adviser who serves as chief curator at Inhotim. \"Most people come to \nInhotim for a full day and tend to leave refreshed rather than exhausted.\"\n\nSo who is the man behind this radically new approach to showing art? I meet Bernardo Paz in a discreet office \nbuilding at the heart of the immense site. With his shoulder-length grey hair, white beard and flowing linen clothing, \nPaz, 63, looks like an ageing hippy. He speaks quickly in broken English, chain-smoking menthol cigarettes as he \ntalks. Inhotim, he says, is \"for the future, for eternity. It will be here 1,000 years.\"\n\nSince stepping down from active management of his mining company, Itaminas, more than a decade ago, Paz has \nlived with a singular obsession: to create a place that will become known throughout the world for the excellence of \nits displays and programming. Although Inhotim is already enormous - altogether its pavilions contain about \n115,000 sq ft of exhibition space, making them roughly one-third larger than the galleries at Tate Modern in London \n- it is going to get much bigger, and fast. Paz hopes there will eventually be 40 pavilions and galleries on the site, as \nwell as many new outdoor sculptures. A hotel with 80 bedrooms and a luxury spa is under construction and will \nopen next summer, the first of several at various price levels Paz wants to build here. When the site reaches its full \nexpansion \"it will take 10 or 12 days for you to see everything,\" he says.\n\nPaz talks of launching theatre and film festivals and plans for a biennial think-tank devoted to tackling the global \nchallenges of our day, such as climate change. \"My goal is to bring here every two years the 10 best thinkers in the \nworld,\" he says. These initiatives are all part of a scheme to make Inhotim financially sustainable for the future - it \ncurrently takes $18m a year just to keep it running, and this excludes the cost of new building. Much of this money \ncomes from Paz, who is worth some $817m, according to Forbes, a fortune made by selling iron ore to China. He \nintends to spend all of it on Inhotim. \"I don't believe in giving money to children after you die,\" explains Paz, who \nhas seven children, scattered throughout the world from Germany to Hawaii, from six marriages. \"I told them [when] \nI die, they will have nothing . . . They understand, they know this is my life and my vision.\"\n\nHe first became interested in art through his friendships with Brazilian artists such as Tunga and Cildo Meireles, \nwho both have pavilions showing their work at Inhotim. A recently opened 30,000 sq ft gallery devoted to Tunga \nincludes several signature pieces from throughout his career and amounts to a permanent retrospective exhibition \nthat is unlikely ever to be bettered. Meireles too is represented here by some of his most important works, such as \n\"Red Shift\", conceived in 1967 and consisting of a series of interlinked rooms where all the furniture, fittings and \ndecorations are red. A version of this installation was the centrepiece of Tate Modern's 2008 Meireles exhibition.\n\nThe premise behind these displays is simple: in every instance the curators aim either to choose an artist's best \nexisting work, to commission him or her to create a new, site-specific project, or to realise a project that has hitherto \nbeen impossible to create. \"We want the most amazing works to be realised there,\" says Schwartzmann. The \nAmerican artist Doug Aitken is a case in point. He is represented at Inhotim by his \"Sonic Pavilion\", which was \ncompleted in 2009 and consists of a circular building on top of a hill with a well at its centre. At its bottom, \nmicrophones capture the sounds of the earth, which are then amplified and played live in the gallery above. It was a \nwork the artist had thought about for years before Schwartzmann encouraged him to build it at Inhotim.\n\nNew projects currently in the planning or construction phase include the installation of four major pieces by Anish \nKapoor. The first of these to open next year, \"Shooting into the Corner\", will be housed in its own building. It \nconsists of a cannon that fires balls of red wax against a gallery wall, and was included in the artist's exhibition at \nthe Royal Academy in London in 2009. Another work by Kapoor, to be sited outdoors, will be a \"slash in the \nlandscape that will extend for a quarter of a mile or longer so it looks like the earth has been cracked open\", \n\n\n\nexplains Schwartzmann. \"It will be a spatial void that you can't gauge the depth of [and will have] enormous visual \nimpact.\"\n\nThe Scandinavian artist Olafur Eliasson is also working on new projects at Inhotim: one is a building with a lateral \nslat cutting through it at eye level that shows the horizon, and the other is described by Schwartzmann as a \n\"sculptural version of a sundial\", an outdoor installation consisting of a sphere cut into the earth. \"As you descend \ndown into it, you look up to see the top of the piece track the sun as it moves in the sky.\"\n\nOther galleries opening soon will include one devoted to hundreds of photographs of Brazil's indigenous Yanomami \ntribes taken by the Swiss-born, Brazilian-based Claudia Andujar over the past 50 years, pavilions to house major \nworks by Doris Salcedo, who already has one gallery devoted to her work at Inhotim, and the American land artist \nMichael Heizer. Meanwhile Robert Irwin is realising a new outdoor sculpture.\n\nSince opening to the public in 2006, Inhotim has welcomed more than 1m visitors, the majority from the surrounding \narea. Paz is particularly proud of this, as he is of employing about 1,000 staff on the site, many of them locals. \"All \nthe poor [young people] from here who before had the dream of becoming a truck driver [now have greater \nambitions],\" he says. \"Inhotim is for all the people.\"\n\ninhotim.org.br\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The project's \ninitial director Terence Riley, previously chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in \nNew York, had already left by 2009. The full $220m budget was tricky to procure in spite of the $100m given to the \nproject by Miami-Dade County with voter approval (Miami's well-established band of local collectors, including the \nRubell family and the Margolies, were already happy running their own prestigious private foundations).\n\nAnd when a particularly large investor - developer Jorge P\u00e9rez - ended up with his name over the door in 2011 \nfollowing a cash-plus-collection donation valued at a reported $35m-$40m, a furious group of trustees saw fit to \nresign.\n\nMeanwhile, as the horizontal building began to peep above MacArthur Causeway, locals wondered about the \nsuitability of the site: it was perceived to be hunkering down beside the highway (rather than gazing out over \nBiscayne Bay, which it also does rather well). When Michael E Miller, of the Miami New Times, described the \nbuilding as \"a spaceship from an Orson Welles movie\" in August this year, you could feel the fear mounting.\n\nIn fact, the elegant, flat-roofed and rather modernist structure would make a lousy spaceship. But if the architects - \nthe Swiss firm of Herzog & de Meuron - have delivered a \"futuristic building perched atop concrete stilts\" (that's the \nanxious Mr Miller again), there's probably a good reason for it.\n\n\"Hurricanes are a fact in Miami,\" says senior partner Christine Binswanger when we meet in Herzog & de Meuron's \nBasel office to talk about the building, whose design and progress she has overseen. \"Which is why the building is \nlifted off the ground. The hot climate and the heavy storms have informed the entire architectural concept.\"\n\nParking is neatly hidden away beneath the entry-level 360-degree platform that balances on slender pilotis; the \nplatform is reached, on the bay side, by a lavish flight of steps where visitors can sit and linger, admiring the view \nacross the water. Beneath the canopy, the building is set back to create a generous wrap-around terrace of shade, \nand from the canopy dangle dense columns of tangling tropical plants. There is nothing here to make you nervous \nabout extraterrestrials.\n\nBinswanger joined Herzog & de Meuron in 1991, and though she would never take the credit for a building - all work \nis done under the Herzog & de Meuron name - those projects on which she is named as senior architect are \nnoticeably light on their feet. There's the expansive Rehab in Basel, for example, a spinal injury clinic in wood and \n\n\n\nglass that was completed in 2002. At the Basel Museum of Culture, which reopened in 2010, a complex roof \nfinished in glittering blue/black tiles has just the right amount of joie de vivre to fit in and not fight with its \nsurrounding medieval antecedents. And, back in Miami, there's a mixed-use development based around a parking \ngarage at 1111 Lincoln Road whose open floors have proved so seductive that people have used them for yoga \nclasses and even weddings.\n\nThe city's new museum, in spite of its concrete structure, has a surprisingly delicate air. \"I was always hoping we \ncould do a building there, with plants and natural ventilation,\" says Jacques Herzog, who has been visiting Miami \nsince the early 1990s.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;\n\nInside, there is no traditional enfilade: instead, the main galleries are staggered in \"a different kind of linear story\", \nsays Binswanger, and the continuous windows keep the outside world looking in. Single-subject project galleries \nare tightly enclosed boxes, whose oak floors and natural concrete walls make a connection with the building's \nconcrete exterior. \"You still feel the main structure,\" says Binswanger. \"We wanted to avoid any sense of cladding. \nThe mix of materials is the same, inside and out.\" The main galleries will open with an Ai Weiwei retrospective, an \ninstallation by British artist Hew Locke and, in deference to its location, a survey of the Cuban artist Amelia Pel\u00e1ez, \nwho died in 1968.\n\nIf the building avoids \"white cube\" clich\u00e9s, that is in part thanks to Riley, Binswanger says. A trained architect \nhimself, he signed off on the design before his departure and was, she says, \"a dream to work with\". \"He couldn't \ncare less for an icon,\" she adds. \"He wanted something specific - not another neutral space but one that would \nrelate to this city and the particular location.\"\n\n\"Specific\" is a word that could sum up the work of Herzog & de Meuron. The practice is responsible for structures \nas diverse as the Beijing National Stadium (the Bird's Nest), where the massive concrete bowl of the stadium is \nslung inside an impressive steel superstructure, and Minneapolis's Walker Art Center, where a crystalline box twists \nthrough an axis to link the old and the new seamlessly. The firm's repertoire of moves and tools - stacked spaces, \norganic materials, creative ways with screening, acute observation of what is already there, and long periods of \nclient consultation - leads to a seemingly infinite variety of solutions.\n\n\"It's like being a cook,\" Herzog declares, as he guides me through the firm's headquarters, a cluster of buildings \ngathered around a couple of courtyards that the architects have occupied since 1984. So artfully distributed are the \n300 staff as to make this global enterprise feel cottage-industry cosy. For the record, there are a further 100 in \noffices around the world. \"If you only like to cook one thing, you are lost,\" says Herzog.\n\nBinswanger is far from lost, though architecture is not the career one might have predicted for her. She grew up in a \nfamily-run psychiatric hospital at Kreuzlingen, Switzerland, where her father was director. It had been founded by \nher grandfather's grandfather. \"It was a family business since 1857, way before Freud,\" she says. \"Some people \nwere afraid of the place - Kreuzlingen was a small town.\" Her grandfather Ludwig was a pioneer of \nphenomenological psychology (his Dreams and Existence was translated from the German by Michel Foucault). \nUnenthused by psychiatry or science, she decided to study architecture but with no extended game plan. \"It wasn't \na career, things happened. That's the biggest beauty, when things evolve,\" she says.\n\nBinswanger, who will be 50 in July, is one of only two female partners at Herzog & de Meuron (the other, Esther \nZumsteg, heads the communications arm). Architecture is still notoriously short of senior women practitioners, \nespecially in the top international firms. \"More women finish their architectural studies than men,\" she says, \"but \nthen we lose them. Things seem to have changed in society. They want to marry early, they want to have kids. I \nwas all for the idea of the free woman but you don't find that among the 30- to 40-year-olds.\"\n\n\n\nShe herself still lives in the apartment she moved into 25 years ago - \"that ugly brick tower with concrete balconies\", \nshe says, pointing to a building across the river in Klein Basel that's clearly visible from the office. And her \nunfettered status, it seems, has not just benefited her career. \"You have better friendships if you have no family,\" \nshe says. \"You have more time.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nP\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami opens on December 8, pamm.org\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Not that Mom and \nPop seem to be noticing. Last week, the video games company Take-Two Interactive Software and the home \nsecurity company ADT arranged to repurchase shares held by activist investors - Carl Icahn at the former and Keith \nMeister of hedge fund Corvex Management at the latter. Dan Loeb negotiated the same type of deal at Yahoo \nearlier this year.\n\nShares in all three companies dropped at least 4 per cent on the news of the buybacks. What is nice for the \nactivists, though, is that these transactions were carried out at the closing price from the previous trading day. Cue \nhowls of protest about preferential treatment. But lost amid the recriminations is the fact that the companies quickly \nretired large blocks of stock at prices that are likely to have been favourable - an event that will boost earnings per \nshare and so should also help remaining shareholders.\n\nThe three companies had hefty buyback programmes already in place. The press releases for ADT and Yahoo \nindicated that the repurchase of the activists' stock would fall into those authorisations. Perhaps the market had \nalready accounted for the elimination of those shares. However, by taking the activists' investments in a single \ntransaction, the companies probably got a lower price than waiting to buy in the open market, since the prices could \nbe expected to move up over time. Put another way, more stock could be retired for the same dollar cost.\n\nThe 12m shares Take-Two - the company behind the Grand Theft Auto series - acquired from Mr Icahn represented \na whopping 13 per cent of its stock outstanding. It will be distinct from its existing repurchase programme, which is \njust 7.5m shares. Yet its price fell 5 per cent anyway. Will management slacken off with Mr Icahn and his three \nrepresentatives on the board gone? Or perhaps Mr Icahn saw no more low-hanging fruit left to pluck so he jumped \nship? Each is a plausible explanation. Still, it is a perverse reaction when Take-Two's forward earnings per share \nestimate has jumped 11 per cent.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Until recently, the government was \nconfident that its Banking Reform Bill - as approved by the House of Commons last summer - struck a reasonable \ncompromise between these two objectives.\n\nHowever, a burst of scandals has reignited fears that the draft approved in Britain's lower house lacked teeth. The \nimplosion of the Co-operative Bank has raised new questions over how much capital lenders should be asked to \nhold. Revelations about the troubling conduct of the Reverend Paul Flowers, Co-op's former chairman, have \nprompted calls for stricter controls of senior bankers.\n\nWhen the legislation reached the Lords last week, a group of peers, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, \nmanaged to change the regime on both fronts. The government was forced to anticipate a review on whether the \nBank of England should have powers to impose a leverage ratio. This is a blunt but important regulatory instrument, \n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nwhich measures how many assets a bank can accumulate on a sliver of equity, irrespective of their riskiness. The \nLords also voted to create a \"licensing\" regime for senior bankers.\n\nBoth proposals are sensible. Leverage ratios are an essential companion to other measures of capital requirements \nwhich let lenders discount assets they perceive as safer. Even the plainest financial products, such as mortgages, \nhave the potential to bring a bank to its knees. Co-op did not have an investment banking arm, but still suffered \nfrom a \u00a31.5bn capital hole.\n\nAny licensing regime should be fair on those vetted. The administrative procedures must not be too burdensome. \nBut an annual review by the regulator will increase the chances of spotting incompetent or reckless professionals \nbefore they do damage. Rescuing a bank is expensive. The cost of this scheme would be small change compared \nto the benefits it could bring.\n\nThe Banking Reform Bill returns to the Commons next year for the final imprimatur. It would be wrong to assume \nthe new rules will make Britain resilient to any future shocks. Large chunks of the financial sector - for example \nshadow banking - are not covered by the bill and will need to be dealt with separately. But for once, MPs and peers \ndeserve praise. Provided it stays in its current form, the new law will go some way in making British banking safer.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Few are more rewarding - or challenging - than the remarkable small-scale bronzes that offer such a \ntantalising glimpse into the intellectual life of the Renaissance.\n\nThe Frick Collection in New York has made a specialism of staging highly focused exhibitions of these works. \nWhether big monographic retrospectives or displays of superlative private collections, they allow the public the \nopportunity, previously afforded only to their privileged owners, of getting up close and seeing them outside a \nvitrine.\n\nAt the end of January, the museum will be host to the Renaissance and Baroque bronzes of Janine and J Tomilson \nHill. Its core is an exceptional group of statuettes produced by the greatest of all mannerist masters, Giambologna, \nand his circle, and its 32 pieces extend from Renaissance Italy to embrace the Netherlandish, German and French \nbronze-casting traditions. What visitors will not see, however, is the extraordinary counterpoint of their setting in the \nHills' home against the titans of postwar painting and sculpture. If ever proof were needed that power and \nmonumentality are not dependent on scale, it is here. These bronzes more than hold their own, even against great \nde Koonings, Bacons and Warhols.\n\nIn 1995, when the couple bought the first of their nine Warhols, most from the 1960s - \"Campbell's Soup Can (Beef \nConsomm\u00e9)\" - they also acquired their inaugural bronze: a Hubert Le Sueur \"Venus\" (c1640) that once belonged to \nLouis XIV.\n\nThe two are not obvious bedfellows, yet the Hills' Manhattan apartment abounds in arresting juxtapositions and \nunexpected dialogues. Who would expect to find, say, de Kooning's massive and lumpen dehumanised bronze \n\"Clamdigger\" confronting a large Bacchic fountain figure by Adriaen de Vries, its face distorted by an exuberantly \ncompelling grotesque mask? On the top of a Louis XVI commode stands the earliest known cast of Giambologna's \nelegant female personification of \"Astronomy\" (c1570), the curve of her voluptuous naked thigh playfully echoing \nthe calligraphic chalk doodles of the Cy Twombly \"Blackboard\" behind. Under Warhol's \"Mao\" sits Barth\u00e9lemy \nPrieur's \"Lion Devouring a Doe\" (c1583).\n\nIn the dining room, a row of six mostly heroic, muscular male nudes, some struggling in mortal combat, are \nsilhouetted against Ed Ruscha's epic, ominous \"Seventeenth Century\". As Hill writes in his preface to the Frick \ncatalogue, bronze \"captures action, tension, emotion. It immortalises a moment.\" Over the fireplace in the library is \na Bacon Pope; inside a niche is the \"Hercules and Antaeus\" attributed to the 15th-century Florentine Maso \n\n\n\nFiniguerra, where the mouth of the vanquished Antaeus is \"formed like the scream from a Pollaiuolo painting\", as \nHill puts it. This is not a comment one could imagine being uttered by many of today's billionaire buyers of Warhols.\n\nHill takes pains to point out that when he and his wife began buying postwar art, the \"entry point\" for a Warhol was \n5-10 per cent of what it is now. Yet it has been a highly successful career on Wall Street that has funded his pursuit \nof quality (he is president and chief executive of Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, and a vice-chairman of \nthe Blackstone Group). He is evidently the driving force behind the acquisitions but it is, he insists, \"a total \ncollaboration\". \"I have not bought a single thing without talking through the idea with Janine, and us thinking how it \nfits into the collection,\" he says.\n\nWhat drew him to the rather rarefied world of bronze? He cites countless visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art \nand to the Frick - he grew up a few blocks away on Fifth Avenue - and the fact that his mother, Dorothy, 96, is an \nabstract painter and sculptor in bronze. For Janine Hill, who grew up haunting the museums and galleries not of \nNew York but of Paris, bronzes were familiar territory. Another factor was their friendship with the architect, \ndesigner and bronze collector Peter Marino. Hill also liked the fact that these small-scale works had always been \nthe very private preserve of the connoisseur-collectors who acquired them for their studioli or studies: what could be \nmore appropriate for a collection in a family home formed purely for the pleasure of its owners?\n\nPerhaps part of this pleasure also lies in the challenges of this notoriously complex field. Few collectors could \nmatch the focus, steely rigour and exacting standards of Tom Hill. He has clearly enjoyed every opportunity to \nhandle and compare different casts and comparable models, sometimes even taking a bronze to a museum or \nanother collector's house for a \"play date\".\n\nHe praises the expertise of Pat Wengraf, who has been his adviser in putting together this collection, yet Hill himself \nalso has the courage - and confidence - to rely on his own eye. \"We have never been hung up about buying a \nbronze because we did not know who made it,\" says Hill. This skill has paid off: a particular coup was the spirited \n\"Nude Striding Warrior\" that turned up in South America and was subsequently identified as being by Willem \nDanielsz van Tetrode, who had worked with Benvenuto Cellini in Florence and, after his return to the Netherlands, \ninitiated a passion for collecting small bronzes in northern Europe.\n\nSuch tours de force as this and Riccio's \"Strigil Bearer\" (c1515-20) are among the earliest examples here of the \n\"multiples\" - at first as few as two or three - that sculptors began to produce after they realised they could fabricate \nreusable piece-moulds for their sculptures, either of independent works or reductions of monumental pieces. This \nwas commercially appealing, not least as a means of promoting a wider diffusion of their reputation and ideas. \nWarhol's soup cans, self-portraits, Marilyns, Mao, Lenin and \"Electric Chair\" are perhaps not so very different after \nall.\n\n'Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes from the Hill Collection', Frick Collection, New York, January 28-June 15 2014. \nfrick.org\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The total cost of these pensions - at E6.5bn to E8bn annually - would be E130bn by 2030, \nhe said, speaking to the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nThat was more than the savings coming from the earlier hard-fought decision to raise the general retirement age \nover the next few years to 67, he said.\n\nMr Kramer also blasted as a \"serious mistake\" a move pushed by the centre-left SPD to allow workers with 45 \nyears' service to retire early, at 63. These measures, he claimed, would raise labour costs and cut the take-home \npay of workers paying social security.\n\nThe pensions increases are a key element of the coalition agreement reached on Wednesday. Ms Merkel went into \nthe talks in a commanding position having triumphed in the September election with 41 per cent of the vote.\n\nBut SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel, whose party won just 26 per cent, strengthened his hand by promising in advance \nthat any coalition deal would be put to the vote of the SPD's 473,000 members.\n\nThe coalition agreement seems to have gone down well with the public. According to a ZDF television poll, 82 per \ncent of voters approve of the planned minimum wage of E8.50 an hour, while 90 per cent back retirement at 63 for \nthe long-serving and 86 per cent the boost to mothers' pensions.\n\nOnly 16 per cent think these plans can be financed without higher debts and taxes - but with unemployment low \nand the export-driven economy doing well, voters seem ready to take a chance.\n\nWolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, finance minister, defended the coalition plans in an interview with Die Welt newspaper, saying \nthat the burden of the pensions increases was \"very limited\".\n\nBut business leaders are furious that the welfare and labour reforms of the past decade may be compromised.\n\nEric Schweitzer, president of DIHK, the German chambers of commerce, was quoted in the media on Friday as \nsaying that retirement at 63 sent the wrong signals at a time when \"we all must work longer\". He added: \"The \ncoalition partners are gambling with their projects that high economic growth will lead to record new tax revenues. \nBut this is not a foregone conclusion.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Ulrich Grillo, president of the BDI, the largest German employers' organisation, delivered an even \ntougher rebuke to Ms Merkel. \"The coalition agreement is a wasted opportunity for Germany's future. It is not a \nmaster plan for our country. The signal is stop instead of start.\"\n\nMr Grillo said the deal imposed \"new stress tests\" on business and added that the minimum wage alone threatened \n\"hundreds of thousands of jobs\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The aggregate 6m barrels heading to the Asian country will be the most since at least July \n2012, according to several market participants.\n\nThe South Korean government has put in place incentive schemes to encourage its refiners not to rely on the \nMiddle East for supplies. A free trade agreement limits tax on shipments from Europe, although the terms of that \nagreement were tightened earlier this year. But under a second scheme introduced more recently, the government \nreimburses refiners most of the extra cost of shipping crude from sources beyond the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n\nMany traders argue that these incentives raise the price of Brent, a blend of four North Sea crude oils, increasing \ncosts for European refiners.\n\n\"The Korean arbitrage is back, and that is supporting Brent,\" said one trader.\n\nBrent is also the international oil benchmark against which many other crudes are priced. On Friday ICE January \nBrent was up 0.5 per cent at $110 per barrel.\n\nThe shipments to Asia have also been encouraged by a shrinking spread between the prices of high quality North \nSea oil and heavier Middle Eastern crudes. The premium of Brent to Dubai crude has shrunk to as little as $2.60 \nper barrel this month from as much as $7.10 per barrel in the late summer, as strong demand from Asia has pushed \nup Middle Eastern crude prices.\n\nChinese buyers have also been active in the North Sea market as a result this month.\n\n\"The South Korean buying reflects very strong Asian fundamentals,\" said Amrita Sen, head of the Energy Aspects \nconsultancy. \"Product markets [such as diesel and gasoline] in Asia are strong, giving refiners there an incentive to \npurchase crude,\" she added.\n\nTwo Suezmax tankers, with capacity for carrying 1m barrels each have also been booked to take North Sea crude \nto Chile this month, according to two trading sources. And one trader said three Suezmax tankers would take \ncargoes to eastern Canada.\n\nThe shipments to far flung markets have been encouraged by weak demand in Europe, where refineries are \nstruggling to generate profits amid lacklustre local demand and competition from US refiners that have access to \ncheap domestic shale crudes.\n\n\"European refiners have been off the market, and shy to step up to buy prompt cargoes,\" said Miswin Mahesh, an \nanalyst at Barclays in London. \"These other refiners have taken the opportunity to step in and get cargoes away.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In the rest of the UK, it is only protected through 2015 - and many observers think it \nwill be abandoned after the next election.\n\nThe SNP has also said it would introduce a flat-rate state pension of \u00a3160 a week in 2016 - \u00a31.10 a week higher \nthan the expected figure in the rest of the UK. - and abandon the planned increase in the state pension age to 67 \nafter 2020. The expected rise to 66 for men and women in 2020 would remain.\n\nIn most other respects, state pension policy is to remain unchanged, with those who have accrued rights in the UK \nreceiving them in full, but paid by the Scottish administration instead of the Department of Work and Pensions.\n\nThe SNP stressed that it sees no need to alter taxation to pay for its spending pledges, but added it would set out \ndetailed policies ahead of elections to the Scottish parliament in 2016. Its priorities would include linking the \npersonal allowance and tax credits to inflation, and ending the Conservatives' proposal for a transferable tax \nallowance for some married couples.\n\n\n\nThe SNP has already established a Fiscal Commission to make recommendations for post-independence fiscal \npolicy.\n\nPensions experts at Hargreaves Lansdown estimate that the superior state pension will cost \u00a352m a year, while the \ncost of abandoning the planned increase in state pension age would come in at a heftier \u00a31bn a year.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; The SNP argues that its pension pledges are affordable (and appropriate) because statistically, Scots tend to \ndie earlier than other Britons - something the SNP described as a \"human tragedy\". Data from the 2008-2010 \nperiod show a UK-wide life expectancy for men at age 65 of 18.03 years, while in Scotland that was 16.76 years.\n\nBut looking more closely at Scottish data suggests a portion of that shorter life expectancy is due to the \"Glasgow \nEffect\", an effect which has epidemiologists puzzled. Research shows that when Glasgow - where male life \nexpectancy at 65 is a mere 14.3 years - is compared with cities such as Manchester and Liverpool which have \nsimilar concentrations of poverty, Glaswegians still do worse.\n\nWhen Glasgow is stripped out, average life expectancy in Scotland rises to 17.05 years at age 65, still below the \nUK average, but by a smaller margin. But data also show widespread inequality, as measured by life expectancy, \nwithin Scotland itself. A 65-year old man from East Dunbartonshire can expect to live a further 18.9 years while one \nin West Dunbartonshire only has another 15.6 years to go.\n\nThe manifesto also pledges to create a separate system of financial regulation for Scotland, prompting some to \nwarn that the cost of financial products would have to rise. \"Every bank, insurance company, financial adviser and \ninvestment manager will have to run duplicate systems and train their employees to deal with two different \nregimes,\" warned Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He and the government have insisted that the funds were only used for security upgrades necessitated \nby his position as head of state.\n\nBut an investigation into the affair, dubbed \"Nkandlagate,\" by the Office of the Public Protector, or ombudsman, has \nfound that a swimming pool, visitors' centre, amphitheatre, cattle corral and new houses for the president's relatives \nwere included in the upgrade at \"enormous cost\" to the taxpayer, the Mail & Guardian reported.\n\nThe newspaper - which said it had obtained a leaked copy of the provisional report - said Thuli Madonsela, the \npublic protector, recommended that Mr Zuma repay a \"reasonable\" amount to the state based on the cost of non-\nsecurity items.\n\nShe also recommended that parliament call him to account for failing to protect state resources and misleading the \nlegislature.\n\nLast year, Mr Zuma staunchly defended the project during a parliamentary debate, insisting that he and his family \nhad paid for Nkandla and that state funds were only used on security measures. The provisional report, titled \n\n\n\n\"Opulence on a Grand Scale,\" said the cost of the Nkandla project had soared from an initial R27m to R215m, with \na further R31m in works outstanding, the Mail & Guardian said.\n\nThe Office of the Public Protector said it did not comment on provisional reports, which require responses from the \ninvolved parties and could change before a final version is released. It added that it was \"unethical and unlawful\" to \npublish details of a provisional report.\n\nBut the leaking of the information will heap more embarrassment on Mr Zuma and his ruling African National \nCongress party as they gear up for elections next year. Mr Zuma has been plagued by controversies amid the \nperception that corruption, patronage and cronyism in the government and ANC have been on the rise since he \ntook office in 2009.\n\nLindiwe Mazibuko, parliamentary leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said that if the provisional findings \nwere accurate they \"would warrant the most severe sanction\" of Mr Zuma's conduct.\n\n\"As more and more details surrounding Nkandlagate emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that President Zuma \nis at the centre of one of the biggest corruption scandals in democratic South Africa,\" she said. \"He must be \naccordingly held accountable by parliament for his actions.\"\n\nThe ANC urged South Africans \"to exercise restraint and caution until the Public Protector releases her [final] \nreport\".\n\n\"Failure to do so will prejudice the process,\" it said. \"As the ANC, we continue to have confidence in our president \nand we believe and know that he is not responsible for any wrongdoing.\"\n\nThe presidency did not comment.\n\nNkandla was in the headlines last week when cabinet ministers suggested that media publishing photographs of the \nhomestead could be prosecuted.\n\nAfter a public backlash, the government later said the ministers' comments were misinterpreted.\n\nEarlier in the month, ministers briefly went to court in a bid to delay the publication of the public protector's final \nreport. The case was withdrawn but not before Ms Madonsela revealed in court documents that her year-long \ninvestigation had met \"very strong\" resistance from a number of ministers.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But on many questions \n- such as whether to take military action against the Assad regime after its use of chemical weapons - he has often \nappeared indecisive.\n\nThis week, however, the president responded firmly and speedily to events in the East China Sea. Last Saturday, \nChina announced it was setting up an \"air defence identification zone\" around a group of islands that Japan \nadministers, but which China claims. On Tuesday, the US promptly responded by sending two B-52 bombers into \nthe contested area without notifying the Chinese authorities. The US message was clear: America will resist any \nattempt to change the status quo over the islands by force.\n\nNobody doubts that a conflict involving China, Japan and the US over these uninhabited rocks would be disastrous. \nThe stand-off is certainly alarming. On Friday, China scrambled combat jets as Japanese fighter aircraft entered the \nair defence zone. There is a growing sense of a storm gathering over the western Pacific.\n\n\n\nBut the US was right to respond to China's initial move in the way it did. The US-Japanese security treaty obliges \nWashington to defend Japan's territorial integrity, a guarantee that extends to the disputed islands. At a moment \nsuch as this, the US must demonstrate to China that the treaty is robust.\n\nMr Obama's move also sends a broader message to US allies in Asia. Many are anxious about Beijing's \naggression. They are also alarmed by Mr Obama's vacillation on security issues in general. Last week's intervention \nby the US was an important signal to them that America, the overwhelming naval power in the region, is engaged.\n\nFor the US to sustain this stance against China will be challenging. In the cold war, the US could confront the Soviet \nUnion without fear of economic consequences. The US had no dependence whatsoever on the Soviet economy. \nBut today the US and China are economically intertwined. This makes all US security calculations in Asia much \nmore difficult.\n\nThe hope must be that in the next few days a way can be found to de-escalate the tension in the East China Sea. \nBut the fundamental point is that the US needs to stand firmly by Japan. If it fails to do so, it will send a signal to \nevery other nation in the region that the US has become an unreliable ally.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

I must now decide whether to start an income drawdown plan, or buy an annuity.\n\nMy house is worth \u00a3800,000, with no mortgage, and I am single with no dependants. I also have \u00a350,000 in an \nequity portfolio.\n\nHow can I achieve an income of \u00a330,000 per year with some inflation proofing? Even if I amalgamate my three \npension pots into one self-invested personal pension and start income drawdown this will not achieve my desired \nincome. Could I use a further \u00a3200,000, released by downsizing my home, to boost my income?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPaul Taylor, managing director of McCarthy Taylor, says in general he does not consider drawdown where a client \nis risk averse, requires stable reliable income and where the drawdown fund is less than \u00a3100,000.\n\nDrawdown is expensive to maintain as you need to manage the portfolio effectively to avoid loss of capital. The \nincome needs to be reviewed every three years under current rules. It is generally worth taking the lump sum, \nusually 25 per cent of the fund value, as this is tax-free. However, this does mean reduced pension income, so \nunless the funds are needed immediately it is worth investing the money, using the annual individual savings \naccount (Isa) allowance of \u00a311,520 and capital gains tax allowances of \u00a310,900 to minimise tax.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; These days you do not need to use a Sipp to take drawdown and you may want to consider a platform-based \npension to see if the costs can be reduced. If your adviser is independent they ought to be able to demonstrate the \nlowest cost option for you.\n\nThe amount of pension you take from drawdown is determined by the government actuarial tables and for a man \naged 60 the current rate is about \u00a353 per \u00a31,000 of fund value based, on current 15-year gilt rates, which suggests \na pension of \u00a39,720 per annum. An insurance company annuity may give you slightly more if you have serious \nhealth problems, but while rates are low you may well want to avoid locking in. Annuities are expensive when you \ntry to provide for inflation.\n\n\n\nA drawdown fund should keep pace with inflation, although this is by no means certain. If interest rates rise, you \ncould always buy an annuity later. If you want certainty then you need to buy an annuity and consider inflation \nlinking. Such an annuity would give you about \u00a36,000 per year guaranteed.\n\nYour portfolio of \u00a350,000 is too small to be adequately diverse to minimise risk and cost. We normally recommend \nat least \u00a3100,000 to be cost effective. With \u00a3200,000 from downsizing and \u00a350,000 from your pension lump sum \nyou would have \u00a3300,000 invested.\n\n&lt;  &gt; Using a spread of investments including low-cost ETFs and trackers as core holdings, with a few \nspecialists, with a medium risk profile, we would recommend about 70 per cent in equities and 10-15 per cent in \nfixed interest. Around 10 per cent could be in property and 5 per cent into infrastructure. This portfolio could yield \nabout 3-5 per cent, which would add, say, \u00a312,000 per year to the drawdown pension income. But that would still \nleave you short by about \u00a38,000 a year.\n\nThis could be met by taking gains which could be achieved at 4 per cent per year, until state pension kicks in at age \n65. At that point, your pension will be \u00a35,720 per year, assuming you have adequate contributions.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

But then we make the opposite mistake, especially if things drag on for a while, and assume \nthat the bad times will go on forever. Happily, we've now moved away from that depressed state but I would argue \nwe are still not nearly optimistic enough.\n\nTo be more optimistic is not to be unrealistic. I was just looking at the independent forecasts for the economy that \nthe Treasury collates; the fastest forecast for next year is still 3 per cent.\n\nTo think that is the highest rate we can expect assumes that we will struggle to put this crisis behind us, that we will \nhave more permanent damage and find more loss of output irrecoverable then at any time in history.\n\nWhether it's the world wars, the great depression, the 1920s, Opec - none of these things prevented us from getting \nback to previous trend growth and getting back the output we lost.\n\nWe always talk about when we get back to where we were, but what matters is where we would have been if we \nhad carried on growing at the trend rate. That gap is 16-17 per cent at the moment.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Most of the estimates suggest we've lost 12-13 percentage points of that permanently, and that we will not have \nthe catch-up growth we have had in the past. It may sound deeply plausible that \"this time is different\" but we \nshould understand the strength of that assumption.\n\nI can't see something that has metaphorically meant we all woke up in January 2009 with one hand missing, which \nis effectively what you have to assume if you think that all this productivity and output is gone for good.\n\nEven if you assume that half that output has disappeared permanently, which would be worse than anything that's \nhappened in modern history, you could still expect to achieve strong growth in the next five years. We can go off \ntrend for a long time, but there has never been a time in the past 60 years when we have ended up on a completely \ndifferent path.\n\n\n\nStephanie Flanders is chief European market strategist at JPMorgan, and was formerly the BBC's economics editor\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

If we \nlook at cross-border position data, if we look at advanced economies they were about 60 per cent of GDP. By 2007 \nthey were up to 450 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nTrillions of dollars have crossed borders and yet despite our best efforts and hundreds of studies, it has been \nextraordinarily difficult for economists to identify any benefits from these flows.\n\nOf course it is entirely possible that parts of the financial sector reaped large benefits, but for everyone else these \nflows were not risk sharing but risk creating. When they disappear, usually as quickly as they appear, they create \nhavoc, huge swings in exchange rates. Sometimes it ends badly in a banking crisis and when that happens, the \ncost can be around 20 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nThink about Latin America in the 1980s, Mexico in 1994/5, the Asian crisis in 1997, think about Iceland, Ireland, \nSpain - it is pretty clear that the cost of these hot money flows can be huge.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Just as Paul Volcker found it difficult to see what innovations the financial industry had come up with aside from \nthe ATM, so economists find hard to see what international capital flows - apart from good old-fashioned foreign \ndirect investment - have actually brought.\n\nSo if these international capital flows didn't do much good, then we have to restrict them, which we can do through \nmacroprudential policy or through capital controls, and I support the idea that everyone would be better off, except \nmaybe some parts of the financial sector.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

They are essentially saying that \neveryone is so frightened of the consequences of leaving this masochists' paradise that they will stick with it for 10 \nor 20 years and feel very grateful.\n\nExtraordinary complacency has broken out since Mario Draghi did the clever and completely necessary thing of \nindicating that he would intervene, albeit with a programme that is entirely incoherent and no-one knows if it would \nactually work if it were ever called upon.\n\nWe have catastrophic depressions in a whole host of countries, with unemployment rates in many cases higher \nthan in the Great Depression. All of them have very high public debt ratios and knife-edge debt dynamics. The \npolicy of the creditor countries has been to provide just enough to prevent total implosion and promise just enough \nto keep people interested.\n\nThe best we can hope for is a very slow recovery. Demand growth is feeble and unlikely to improve. They're very \ndependent on improvements in the external account as the eurozone is now the biggest current account surplus \nregion in the world. It's likely the euro will become very strong, thus crowding out net exports from those countries \n\n\n\nstarting to do quite well. The result will be 20-30 per cent unemployment in places like Greece and Spain for years \nto come.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;What are the ways out? One is that the eurozone could become a genuine transfer union. It's absolutely clear \nthat won't happen. Another is that it becomes an adjustment union, with wages and prices rising in the creditor \ncountries. That won't happen either; Jens Weidmann (Bundesbank president) has told me that if he sees any sign \nof price growth in Germany, he's going to kill it.\n\nOut of sheer terror of the consequences, the eurozone could remain the masochists' paradise it is today, or we \ncould see some event - a government pushed into default, an election result - that prompts a serious country like \nSpain or Italy to say \"enough's enough\" and end it.\n\nMartin Wolf is the FT's chief economic commentator\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

My \ncontention is that, essentially because of China but also because of other places that I've been roaming around \nrecently, the world will grow by more than that in the current decade (2010-20).\n\nYou could say that 2007/8/9 crisis was essentially about the US consuming too much and saving nothing, while \nChina consumed very little and saved too much. It would be good if, in the current decade, they swapped places a \nbit and from what I can see they are doing just that.\n\nThe US current account deficit will probably be less than 3 per cent of GDP this year and China's surplus will \nprobably be 3 per cent too. Before the crisis the figures were a 6 per cent deficit and a 10 per cent surplus.\n\nWhat China is doing is so important. If China were to grow 7.5 per cent during the current decade, that would have \nthe same global impact as the US growing by 4 per cent - and that has never happened in my lifetime. In contrast to \nthe other three Bric countries, China is actually growing by more than that so far this decade.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Unless China really slows down a lot more than consensus, its contribution to the world is just going to get \nbigger and bigger. It has created another India just since 2010.\n\nSo it's quite easy for the world to do better unless the places that have been really weak get even weaker. It's \nconceivable with the Eurozone, but from what I have seen the other places in the world, such as the US, Japan and \neven here, are actually doing better. The US is a very different place to six years ago; it's far more competitive, \nmultinationals are moving back to the US.

The pub company cut capital investment by \u00a319m, too, but it looks like a Christmas season \nthat falls in the optimal midweek slot is the key to building short-term momentum.\n\nM&B's estate is increasingly weighted towards food and like-for-like food sales increased by 0.8 per cent, reflecting \nprice increases rather than volume growth.\n\n\"Wet\" sales continued their long-term downward trend with a 0.2 per cent drop, although excellent weather in the \nsecond half helped moderate the fall.\n\nDeutsche Bank forecasts adjusted pre-tax profit of \u00a3191m for 2014, giving adjusted earnings per share of 35.8p, up \nfrom \u00a3184m and 34.7p this time.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSell: SAB Miller (SAB)\n\nSABMiller seems well-placed to benefit from global consumption growth, although earnings growth will be held back \nby currency weakness and rising raw material costs, writes Julia Bradshaw. Yet the shares are highly rated given \nthe risks.\n\nDeclines in the South African rand, Colombian peso and Peruvian nuevo sol held back growth for beverage giant \nSABMiller, which makes about four-fifths of its profits in emerging markets.\n\nThe maker of Grolsch and Peroni saw decent progress across all markets apart from Europe and North America, \nwhere lager volumes fell, leaving underlying lager volumes just 1 per cent higher.\n\nThe picture in emerging markets was much rosier. Profit in Latin America grew by 10 per cent to $972m, helped by \nfavourable pricing, higher volumes and a good performance from premium brands. Thirst for beer continued in \nAfrica, where profit was up 16 per cent to $408m, while Asia Pacific also had another good year, with profits 12 per \ncent higher at $540m.\n\nBroker Numis Securities expects pre-tax profit of $5.1bn for the full year, giving earnings per share of 244\u00a2 (up from \n$4.7bn and 237\u00a2 in 2013).\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHold: Compass (CPG)\n\nProfit margins are improving and there is a huge pipeline of business, but a forward price/earnings ratio in excess of \n18 - near a 10-year high - looks up with events, writes Lee Wild.\n\nFeeding hungry Americans, and a growing appetite for its services in emerging markets, helped boost organic \nrevenue at catering heavyweight Compass by over 4 per cent last year. Operating profit before hefty write-downs \nand restructuring costs rose 8 per cent to \u00a31.27bn, and a larger than expected \u00a3500m share buy-back for 2014 \npushed the shares to a record high.\n\nThat's the reward for getting the operating profit margin above 7 per cent for the first time. North America, which \nnow accounts for over 46 per cent of sales, grew organic revenue by 8 per cent, while emerging markets grew 7 per \ncent.\n\n\n\nEven in Europe and Japan, operating margins grew by 60 basis points as cost-cutting offset another fall in like-for-\nlike volumes.\n\nBroker Numis Securities expects adjusted pre-tax profit of \u00a31.26bn in 2014, giving adjusted earnings per share of \n51.9p (from \u00a31.19bn/47.7p in 2013).\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSector focus: tech is back with a bang\n\nLondon's so-called Tech City has been getting a lot of favourable press recently, writes Matthew Allan. There's a \nreal buzz around the epicentre in gritty Shoreditch, reminiscent perhaps of the heady optimism that fuelled the \ndotcom bubble in the late 1990s.\n\nBut is the current surge in merger and acquisition activity, number of initial public offerings (IPOs) and rocketing \nshare prices a sign of future growth, or a warning cry that the sector is beginning to overheat?\n\nAlready this year, the Aim technology index has risen by nearly half and has almost doubled in the past two years. \nIt recently breached a level last seen at the back end of the internet boom, in December 2001. Nor are the gains \nconfined to tiddlers; the FTSE 350 technology index is up four-fold since the darkest days of the financial crisis at \nthe end of 2008.\n\nRecent takeover bids for Andor Technology, a high-tech camera maker, and Delcam, which develops advanced \nsoftware for the manufacturing industry, suggest better times ahead. Andor's suitor, Oxford Instruments, has made \nan indicative offer of 500p per share in cash. Sales are recovering and Andor has negotiated hard, yet Oxford \nclearly sees value in the business even at these levels.\n\nDelcam, meanwhile, is being bought by US-based rival Autodesk for \u00a3172.5m in cash, a deserved premium as \nrecord demand for its software translates into soaring revenue and profit.\n\nThere has been an abundance of smaller M&A activity among London-listed tech stocks during these past few \nmonths, too, most recently at managed service provider Redcentric, which said this week it will pay \u00a365m for peer \nInTechnology. The deal, classified as a reverse takeover, will be funded largely by institutional money.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; It is the IPO market, however, that has really captured the imagination of investors this year as companies and \nspeculators alike capitalise on the robust capital market environment. Shares in microblogging site Twittersoared as \nmuch as 70 per cent on their first day of trading after the loss-making company raised $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn) this month. \nAnd more than a few eyebrows were raised when Evan Spiegel, the 23-year-old founder of photo messaging app \nfirm Snapchat, turned down a $3bn offer from Facebook.\n\nLondon, however, is popular, too. Servelec, a provider of software and services to the healthcare and power \nindustries, is set to complete the largest fundraising for a UK-listed software company since 2000 when its shares \nlist on the main market on  December 2. A heavily oversubscribed IPO - also billed as the largest UK tech IPO by \nmarket value since March 2010 - will raise \u00a3122m.\n\nServelec isn't an isolated example, either. Another 18 technology companies have tapped the London market so \nfar this year, double the number in 2012 and 2011. \"The market is improving such a lot now, there is a completely \ndifferent appetite for raising money,\" notes Sam Smith, chief executive of broker finnCap. \"The small-cap \nenvironment is definitely seen as less risky than it has been for a long while. There's so much interest in initial \npublic offerings... it's now a viable option for a lot of businesses.\"\n\n\n\nIt certainly helps that shares in many of the tech floats have rocketed following their debut. In 2013 alone, you \nwould have made an average gain of nearly 17 per cent had you invested in all 18 tech IPOs on their first day of \ntrading, based on exclusive research from Investors Chronicle and S&P Capital IQ.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

A journeyman of the telecoms industry, Mr Breith sold his business to Daisy Group two years before and \nhas attracted a series of new contracts at Coms as well as completing a \u00a39.5m acquisition in the last month.\n\nNews of the completion failed to stimulate the share price above its July peak so Mr Breith improved his stake on \nTuesday, acquiring five times as many shares than when he and a colleague invested a similar sum before the \ngains took hold in February.\n\nIn the software sector, Mark Wells became the third director to buy into Kofax during November, making his fourth \ntrade in five years with each at a higher share price than the last.\n\nThe shares have been on an upward trajectory since 2011, and the company recently announced the biggest deal \nin its history.

Recent weakness did not deter newcomer Celia Baxter, an executive at support \nservices firm Bunzl, from gaining a foothold having joined three months ago.\n\nSimilar gains at Judges Scientific tempted two non-executive directors to cash in some of their stake on Tuesday as \nthe shares traded close to their all-time high.

This is just such rot. \nWhy would they fear rising long-term rates? Higher rates are supply-side monetary stimulus - which is just what the \nworld needs now, after five years of the evil twin, demand-side monetary stimulus.\n\nSo what's the difference and why does it matter?\n\nIt's all about how central banks manipulate money supply - the fuel for economic growth. Central banks create the \nmonetary base - notes, coins and reserves. But banks create the bulk of M4 money supply. Through the fractional \nreserve banking model, they lend their reserves many times over, and this loan growth is what drives broad money \ngrowth.\n\nSo if you want more lending, you either you make banks more eager to lend - boost supply - or you make borrowers \nmore eager to borrow - boost demand.\n\nThroughout modern history, central banks have used supply-side policy. They've adjusted reserve requirements \nand nudged overnight lending rates to make banks more or less eager to lend as need be. Since 2008, they've \nused demand-side policy. They've bought huge amounts of long-term gilts and US treasuries to push down long-\nterm rates and make folks more eager to borrow. The infamous quantitative easing.\n\nThe problem is that supply-side factors matter more than demand-side. Don't believe it? Imagine long rates were \nzero. Everyone in the world would want to borrow. But banks wouldn't lend a penny, ever. Low long-term rates \nmight make borrowers more eager but make banks less so.\n\nBanks' core business is borrowing from depositors at short-term (lower) rates and lending at long-term (higher) \nrates. The spread is their profit. When short rates are fixed near zero and long rates are held down, profits shrink \nand banks don't lend. They're not charities.\n\nThis is why QE fails. Banks won't take risk for no reward. When yield spreads are as small as they have been, \nbanks lend only to the most solvent borrowers. Hence why small business lending spent the whole of British QE in \nfree fall and M4 fell two straight years. When yield spreads widen, the risk/reward trade-off improves, and banks are \nkeener to lend to iffier prospects.\n\nBorrowers are still keen, too. Pretend you want a home and have good credit, so you can get a 10-year fixed-rate \nmortgage for 4.5 per cent. That home is \u00a3240,000 - your monthly principal and interest payment is \u00a32,487. If rates \nrise half a point, your monthly payment rises by \u00a358. Do you back off? No! You love that house! Besides, cost is just \none variable. Is your income good? Your job? Do you expect your life to improve or worsen?\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Or pretend you run a high street shop. You need a loan for a long-term project. Your return on investment is 7 \nper cent, and you have good credit, so you can borrow at 5 per cent, or 3 per cent post-tax.\n\nIf rates rise to 3.5 per cent, your profit is still 50 per cent (3.5 divided by 7) if revenues continue. So you look \nforward. Do you have confidence in the economy? Expect strong demand? Are your order books already bursting? \nIf so, you'll still take the loan. If not, you won't and probably wouldn't have done so at lower rates either.\n\nBorrowers like low rates, but most don't actually need them. You know this - UK borrowing costs have risen all year, \nbut so has loan demand, according to the Bank of England's credit conditions survey. Demand now is stronger than \nduring the UK's QE nightmare! Growth is speeding on all fronts, so businesses and homebuyers are more \nconfident, more eager to borrow. With profits up, banks are more eager to lend. M4 is finally growing apace.\n\n\n\nExpect the same in the US when their idiotic QE ends. QE hurt the US, just like it did Britain. Loan growth slowed \nand M4 is up only 2.8 per cent since QE began - and it fell for a year and a half along the way. Banks lent less, \ncreated less money. The economy had less fuel. That it grew anyway is a marvel.\n\nThe fog is already clearing. Markets are discounting QE's end. At the end of May, the yield on 10-year Treasuries \nwas 1.68 per cent. By the end of September, that had risen to 2.54 per cent. Bank lending rates rose too. Yet \nhousehold borrowing rose 1.1 per cent during the third quarter - the first rise this year. Consumers knew it was OK \nto borrow even as rates rose. Businesses did too - business lending grew 1.2 per cent. M4 is growing faster.\n\n&lt;  &gt; Once QE stops, the party will really start. Wider spreads will make banks more eager. Long shutout \nbusiness owners will finally get what they need - money to invest in new technology, equipment, R&D, facilities, \ninventory and employees. Five years of pent-up demand will be unleashed to work its magic throughout the world's \nbiggest economy.\n\nAnd the best part? No one is expecting it! Everyone thinks higher rates will cause lending to crumble and GDP to \ngo into free fall. They're in for a colossal shock - just what stocks love.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and chief executive of Fisher Investments\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

We deleted the tweets as soon as we realised what had happened, but they had already \nbeen retweeted a number of times. I'm worried that we could face legal action as a result of the intern's actions. \nCan you advise?\n\nNothing \"borders on being libellous\" - it either is or it isn't. For an action in libel, something is published about a \nperson and \"the reader\" thinks less of them. The courts consider that \"the sting is not so much in the words \nthemselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them and that is also regarded as a part of their natural and \nordinary meaning\".\n\nThe reader is someone not avid for scandal and who does not read too much into the words. As the tweet \ncontained personal comments even if not defamatory, it may be a misuse of personal information under article eight \nof the Human Rights Act, protecting private life.\n\nIf the words are libellous, as they have been published and the person named, a claim in libel will exist and the \nimportant thing is for the sportswear company to minimise the damage. They have already deleted the tweet but are \naware that it has been retweeted.\n\nEach tweet and retweet is separately actionable. It is the initial publisher who will carry responsibility for retweets, \nas it is to be presumed that tweets will be republished. Your company should issue a prompt apology and retraction. \nAs the recent Lord McAlpine case demonstrated, he took a far more lenient attitude towards those who apologised \npromptly than to Sally Bercow, who defended the claim on the basis that the tweet was not defamatory.\n\nYour company could make proposals to the sportswoman to turn what could be a PR disaster for them into \nsomething positive.\n\nSarah Webb is a partner specialising in defamation and reputation management at Payne Hicks Beach solicitors, a \nlaw firm\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nGood money after bad?\n\n\n\nI am setting up a retail business and am in the process of arranging premises. I have found a suitable property and \nintend to purchase the freehold. However, the property requires several thousand pounds worth of exterior \nrenovations. The current freeholder has agreed to carry these out, but has asked that I transfer funds in advance \namounting to the cost of the renovations, as a gesture of goodwill and to demonstrate my commitment to the sale. \nHe is widely known to be heavily in debt and the proceeds of the sale will go straight to the bank. I am concerned \nthat if I transfer the funds as he requests I will expose myself to a claim from the bank in the future?\n\nDon't do it. There is no need to go down this high-risk route. The funds you pay to the bank will be absorbed into \nthe freeholder's accounts and set off against his debts, so you would lose them if things go wrong and in any event \nhe will not have the money available to carry out the renovations unless the bank agrees to provide it. You could \ninstead agree a reduction in the purchase price equivalent to at least the cost of the work.\n\nAlternatively, a relatively simple document can protect you in this situation. Agree to exchange a contract to \npurchase the freehold, conditional upon the seller carrying out the works and with a provision that you will pay for \nthe works against invoices direct to the contractor, such sums being treated as part payment of the price.\n\nIt would also be helpful if provision were made for the condition to be waived if the seller does not perform - so you \ncan complete the contract at the price less the outstanding cost of the works and take over the works yourself.\n\nGlenda Miller is a partner at Knights Solicitors, a law firm\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFrom Russia with . . . doubts\n\nI own a marketing agency that is doing well and is increasingly working with UK-based Russian companies.

Despite its seemingly idyllic location, it \nis, like many areas in Chile, prone to earthquakes - hence the strict building code that was introduced following a \ndevastating 9.5 magnitude quake in 1960. The code is credited with protecting many Chileans when an 8.8 \nmagnitude quake struck off the coast of central Chile in 2010.\n\nEarthquake-protection techniques are just one reason why greater Santiago, which has a population of 6.3m, is \nrevelling in confidence these days. A strong economy and stable political system have also helped. The most visible \nresult is the Gran Torre (Big Tower) of the Costanera Center in the Providencia district, a 300-metre office block in \nSantiago's gleaming new business and financial centre - the tallest building in South America. The $1bn centre also \ncontains South America's largest shopping mall.\n\nIn spite of the global financial crisis, the average price of a home in Santiago rose by 15 per cent in real terms \nbetween the second quarter of 2008 and the same period in 2012, according to BBVA Research, which describes \nthe city's housing market as \"dynamic\".\n\nHowever, according to estate agent Carolina Lippi, some high-end homes in the affluent, eastern comunas, or city \ndistricts, of Vitacura and Las Condes increased in value by 25 to 30 per cent in the past two years (Providencia and \nLo Barnechea are the two other upmarket districts in the city).\n\n\"There are hardly any limits on getting home loans these days and property is seen as a safe investment. Building \nplots in the most coveted areas are getting so scarce that people are buying old buildings, tearing them down and \nbuilding something higher,\" says Lippi.\n\nOne property on sale in Vitacura at present is a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom detached house built in 1995, with \nan infinity pool, a separate apartment for guests and mountain views. The property is being marketed by \nInmobiliaria Poseid\u00f3n for 65,000 UF ($2.92m). There is little residential property advertised publicly in Chile above \nthis price level.\n\nThe Unidad de Fomento is a separate unit of value linked to the Chilean peso and which constantly adjusts with \ninflation. It is used to price most real estate (and loans, too).\n\nAnother example is a four-bedroom, four-bathroom penthouse apartment overlooking Los Leones golf club in Las \nCondes, with a heated pool and five parking places, on sale for 63,500 UF ($2.85m) via 3C Propiedades.\n\nBeyond Vitacura - and a 45-minute drive from the business and financial centre - a recently built, hacienda-style \nmansion in the Array\u00e1n sector of Lo Barnechea, with 500 sq metres of living space on a 5,600 sq metre plot is \n\n\n\nbeing offered by Lippi Propiedades for 25,000 UF ($1.12m). The house has an outdoor pool and accommodation \nfor staff.\n\nHalf a century ago, land in Vitacura was mainly given over to grazing cattle; now it is the epicentre of fashionable \nSantiago, with restaurants like the minimalist Borag\u00f3, where diners can eat dishes flavoured with foraged herbs and \nedible flowers, or shrimp dangling from a bonsai tree.\n\nChile's rigid class system has its own impact on the local high-end property market: extended families tend to stay \nin the same district, and a lot of property is passed on within families, or pushed discreetly at country clubs or the \ndriving range (or, indeed, advertised less discreetly on Facebook and other social media sites). As a result, up-and-\ncoming neighbourhoods derive much of their buzz from incomers. Good examples include the bohemian district of \nBellavista, with its eclectic dining scene, and Bellas Artes, a central district of trendy bars, caf\u00e9s and markets.\n\nSantiago's historical downtown, meanwhile, has some attractive French-style neoclassical buildings but it is rather \nscruffy: in September the authorities introduced new rules to clamp down on the many unauthorised street vendors \nthere.\n\nA renovated three-bedroom, two-bathroom 98 sq metre apartment in Bellas Artes is on sale for 4,500 UF \n($202,500) through the Procasa agency.\n\nNathan Lustig, 28, is an entrepreneur from Milwaukee, US, who came to Santiago in 2010 under the government's \nStart-Up Chile programme, which offers grants to promising new businesses, both foreign and Chilean, who set up \nin the country. Many are in the ecommerce, biotechnology and finance sectors. \"Santiago is the most livable city in \nLatin America and there is wonderful hiking on your doorstep,\" says Lustig. \"Business-wise, there may be some \nextra bureaucracy here [compared with the US], but the rules are understandable and you feel confident that they \nare not going to change suddenly.\"\n\nOver the past four years, Start-Up Chile has brought between 800 and 900 overseas entrepreneurs to Santiago, \naccording to the programme's communications manager, Maite Larraechea.\n\n\"There is now a real cluster of young foreign entrepreneurs in Bellas Artes,\" says Lustig, who has opened Andes \nProperty, a company offering furnished units to the steady stream of expat arrivals in Santiago.\n\nLustig's main gripes are air pollution and petty crime, while the distance from home is also a drawback: \"It takes 14 \nor 15 hours to get to Wisconsin. On the other hand, if you are doing business with New York, or just watching sports \nor talking with friends there, there is no time difference in the southern winter, and only two hours difference in the \nsummer.\"\n\n\"Santiago couldn't be more different from Buenos Aires,\" says David Chevalier, 30, an engineer from Nantes, \nFrance, who moved to Santiago three months ago. \"Superficially, there are streets in the [trendy and gentrifying \nBuenos Aires] district of Palermo which look like streets in Bellas Artes and Bellavista. But the big difference is the \nforeigners who come to Santiago are not here to spend money, they are here to make it.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n- Estate agents' commission is usually 2 per cent of the sale price, paid by both the buyer and seller\n\n- Smog is a problem in the city, especially during the winter\n\n- Violent crime in downtown Santiago fell by 17 per cent during 2012, according to the country's interior ministry\n\n- Flights from New York to Santiago take about 11 hours from New York and 15 hours from London\n\n- Average temperatures range from about 9C in July to 20C in January\n\nWhat you can buy for . . .\n\n\n\n$100,000 A one-bedroom apartment in Bellas Artes or Bellavista\n\n$1m A three-bedroom new-build apartment in Las Condes\n\n$3m A modern five-bedroom house on 3,500 sq metre plot in a prime location in Vitacura\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But \nCardozo, 48, wanted to make Switzerland, rather than Britain, her home. \"We could have just stayed put,\" she says. \n\"But we decided that Switzerland had mountains, lakes and no crime. Whereas in London, I just seemed to be \nspending hours on the road in traffic [on the way to] Dorset.\"\n\nFifteen years after making the move, Cardozo's decision has helped to widen the appeal of her sculpture. Today, \ngalleries and hotels all over Europe exhibit her work. Yet, importantly, she is still recognised as a British artist when \nit counts - such as during the London 2012 Olympic Games, when her bronze sculpture of a gymnast was placed \noutside Westminster Abbey.\n\nSetting up in Switzerland with three young children was hard work, however. \"The usual expat trappings that a bank \nlays on [such as] a car, home and schools weren't there,\" she says. \"Bank Sarasin [for whom her husband, Rupert \nFryer, 53, is a director] is from Basel, so we were treated very much as locals and left to our own devices to settle \nin. I was surprised to find that the Swiss Germans didn't really speak English.\"\n\nFamily life in Switzerland proved to be a success. \"In London we were terribly social,\" she says. \"But here it was \njust us as a family, so we took lessons to get our motorboat licence, took the children skiing in Klosters, Zermatt \nand Davos - and it was all rather peaceful really.\"\n\nCardozo's decision to put down roots in Switzerland is in contrast with her peripatetic childhood. The daughter of a \nmilitary attach\u00e9, she was the eldest girl of 10 children. \"We all fought like crazy, but we were a chaotic, happy \nfamily,\" she says. Postings abroad took the family to Malaysia, Malawi, Ghana, Cyprus, Germany and Gibraltar \nduring her early childhood and school years. She attended St Mary's School in Shaftesbury with five of her sisters.\n\n\"All our holidays were spent without a television, making and doing things - sewing, painting, dress designing or \nplaying music,\" says Cardozo. Art and music also played a big part in the household, with her mother teaching \nviolin and piano to all the children from the age of four. \"I remember arriving in Malawi airport with my brothers and \nsisters, each of us carrying a violin case, until customs officials stopped us, suspicious we were carrying guns.\"\n\nHer own three children - Cosima, 22, Danny, 21, and Henry, 20 - began their education in Switzerland, before \nattending British boarding schools. \"I wanted them to feel some Englishness,\" says Cardozo. \"I was nervous of \nthem becoming too 'Euro'. This place can be too small and too rich - with talk about the next Prada handbag or \nDaddy's new car, versus piano, drama [lessons] and team spirit.\"\n\nWhen Cardozo was the age her children are now she completed her studies at City and Guilds of London Art \nSchool, and then spent a year in Florence, at the Studio Cecil-Graves.\n\nAfter renting for five years in the suburb of Cologny, on Lake Geneva, the family sold their five-bedroom house in \nFulham in 2002, took the plunge and bought a property in Geneva. Cardozo, however, didn't want to live in \nCologny. \"I wanted something flatter, with more space,\" she says, \"and without halos of midges in the summer\".\n\nCardozo and her husband found a three-bedroom Spanish-style hacienda, built in the 1970s and owned by \nPeruvians, in another smart suburb of Geneva - Vand uvres. The layout is unusual. There is a single-storey above \nground with a courtyard at the front and a terrace surrounding the pool at the back, while three of the seven \nbedrooms are downstairs in the former cellar. \"It took seven months of building work to carve out the [legally \nrequired] nuclear bunker and make the rooms,\" says Cardozo. \"Coming from London, we were used to making the \n\n\n\nmost of underground space.\" The couple bought just under four acres, and used the footprint of the house to \nobviate strict planning laws and create 6,000 sq ft of comfortable family home.\n\nOn the other side of the courtyard is Cardozo's studio, a modest and well-ordered area with plenty of light from \nglass doors facing the lawn. Life-sized figures of gymnasts and dancers compete for space with half-finished \nsmaller figurines - the bronzes are fired at the Swissart foundry in Jussy, just down the road. Small figures are often \nprivate commissions for Russian yachts or Asian clients, while a larger three-quarter size study in the corner was \nmodelled on the British-Croatian socialite Petra Ecclestone. \"It took me eight weeks to complete, from drawings to \nfinish, and I took it out to her mansion in Los Angeles this January,\" says Cardozo, referring to Ecclestone's 56,000 \nsq ft estate in Bel Air, which she bought for $85m in 2011. Such bronzes start at about \u00a350,000 for a half life-size \nand reach more than \u00a3100,000 for the large-scale monuments that Cardozo has completed for public buildings.\n\nIt was during her exhibition at the Beau-Rivage Palace hotel in Lausanne in 2010, next door to the Olympic \nMuseum, that she first had the idea of including her work at the London 2012 Olympics. After being approached to \nsupply sculptures of gymnasts in the Olympic Museum, she wrote to Lord Coe, who headed London's bid to host \nthe Games, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson and David Cameron, the British prime minister, only to have her \nideas rejected.\n\nThen she was approached by a charity, Youth With A Mission, and asked to make a four-metre public monument \nfor display outside Westminster Abbey. A three-metre gymnast by Cardozo was also installed at Heathrow's T5 \nGallery during the Games, which now sits outside Wellington Barracks near Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe project gave her a taste for bigger sculptures in public places, something she plans to do more of in the future. \n\"I do feel if you are given a talent, then it should be used for the good of others,\" says Cardozo. \"And I want to make \nsculptures where people can enjoy them for free. Beauty and art enhance people's lives and I'm in a fortunate \nposition to donate occasionally.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBuying guide\n\nPros\n\n- Access to other European cities from Geneva is easy for business day trips and weekends away\n\n- It is possible to live in the countryside and still be only 10 minutes from the city centre\n\n- A large international community with English widely spoken\n\nCons\n\n- Very little culture; it might be rather quiet for some people\n\n- Limited shopping compared with the UK, particularly supermarkets\n\n- High cost of living compared with many other European cities\n\nWhat you can buy for . . .\n\nEUR100,000: A very small studio in an inexpensive area, such as Meyrin, Russin or Aire\n\nEUR1m: A two-bedroom, two-bathroom, 150 sq metre property in an upmarket suburban area\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

While many have vanished completely and others are still firmly behind closed, private doors, there are a \nsmattering that live on as great hotels, making them the perfect getaway for garden lovers.\n\nBarnsley House hotel and spa in Gloucestershire was the home of Rosemary Verey, one of the most influential \ngardeners and garden writers of the second half of the 20th century. Verey was arguably better known in the US \nthan Britain, although the Prince of Wales was a disciple and regular visitor to Barnsley House. The gardens are \nundergoing sympathetic restoration and the potager - an old idea that Verey resurrected and popularised - now \nsupplies the kitchen of the hotel's superb restaurant.\n\n. . .\n\nWawa folding rocking chair\n\nFrom \u00a3300.00\n\nwawa.co.uk\n\nDesigned 20 years ago by former sculptor Richard Ward, the Wawa folding rocking chair has been relaunched this \nyear with fabrics from some of the best established and most exciting up-and-coming designers. The rocker's \nfolding mechanism is beautifully simple, superficially like a deckchair and with similar portability thanks to its very \nlight weight, making it ideal for conservatories and gardens. The fabrics for the relaunched range are from \ndesigners such as Eleanor Pritchard, whose work has a strong mid-century aesthetic, and Margo Selby, known for \nher popular handloom designs.\n\n. . .\n\nCapricorn mohair welly boot socks\n\n\u00a311.95 a pair\n\ncapricornsocks.co.uk\n\nChristmas socks may be the ultimate clich\u00e9 gift, but as any gardener knows there is no less inviting place on a \nfreezing winter day than a cold, dank wellington boot. So if you intend to buy foot knitwear this Christmas, you may \nas well go for a sock that does the job. Capricorn Socks are British made, using mohair from Angora goats. Mohair \nin a sock makes it hard-wearing, warm, comfortable and machine-washable. Those of a delicate olfactory nature \nwill appreciate one of mohair's most remarkable qualities - the socks don't smell after being worn.\n\n. . .\n\nMoonlight design garden lighting scheme\n\nFrom \u00a35,000\n\nmoonlightdesign.co.uk\n\nGardens don't sleep when the sun goes down, but they are much harder to enjoy after dark; especially in winter. \nLighting makes a garden more accessible at night and can have a genuinely transformative effect - a carefully lit \ntree trunk can have the presence of a Corinthian column at night, becoming just a plain old tree trunk when the sun \nrises again. Well-placed lighting can create almost theatrical effects; light washes, highlights and shadow patterns. \nThe result extends the garden's usable time during the summer months, and in winter creates an illuminated \noutdoor picture to enjoy from the warmth of indoors.\n\n\n\n. . .\n\nFloral arrangements\n\nFrom \u00a350\n\nphilippacraddock.com\n\nFormer marketing and advertising executive Philippa Craddock retrained as a florist, quit London and set about \ndesigning innovative and distinctive floral arrangements from her studio in Pheasants Hatch, East Sussex.

Poor quality secateurs are not only a false economy but a health risk too; blunt blades are far more \nlikely to result in an injury. These Tobisho secateurs are hand forged in Japan, using the same blue paper steel \ntechnique employed in the manufacture of Samurai swords. Because the blade and handle are formed from one \npiece of steel they are exceptionally strong, and feel beautifully balanced in the hand. Most importantly, they have a \nrefined cutting action and smooth, precision cut.

The idea is simple; take the engine and driveshaft from a brush cutter and split the shaft halfway along its \nlength so that multiple heads with different functions can be plugged in, like a piston-powered Swiss Army knife. \nHonda's Versatool uses a powerful four-stroke engine promising less noise than a two-stroke and no fiddling \naround with oil/petrol mixtures. It has seven attachments, including a soil cultivator, a pruner, an edge cutter for \ntidying lawn edges, and hedge trimmers.

A slim-fit, blazer-style waxed jacket in olive \ndrab, it has neat touches like leather-bound cuff edges, and classic Barbour tartan lining. Slim-fit jackets are ideal \nfor gardening as there are no loose flaps of cloth to get caught in machinery or tools, while the waxed cloth repels \nthorns and rain with ease.

For boat owners it is near Falmouth and \nMylor, two of southern Cornwall's sailing havens, while gastronomes are no more than 15 minutes' drive from \nseveral Good Food Guide restaurants, such as the Michelin-starred Driftwood in Portscatho and Tabb's in Truro, as \nwell as many old-fashioned country pubs.\n\nHouses in St Mawes are unusually large by Cornish standards. Whereas most high-end parts of the far southwest \nof England are dominated by elaborately modernised fishermen's cottages with little outside space - Port Isaac, \nPadstow and Fowey, for example - St Mawes has a significant proportion of large, modern and detached houses in \nsubstantial grounds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the village's housing market is strong. The average price of property sold there over the \npast five years is \u00a3607,000, while in Cornwall as a whole it is just \u00a3236,000, according to the website Zoopla. And, \nalthough average prices across Cornwall are still falling (down 3.8 per cent over the past year, according to the \nLand Registry's October figures), local estate agents say St Mawes is now over the worst.\n\n\n\n\"It was affected between 2009 and 2012 as the recession restricted second-home buyers,\" says Ben Standen of \nJackson-Stops & Staff. \"But in 2013 there have definitely been more buyers than sellers, hence prices have stayed \nstrong.\"\n\n\"It's our view that early 2012 saw the bottom of the market when we saw two sales concluded at over \u00a32.5m each \n[despite] one of these selling at a much higher level in 2007,\" says Jonathan Cunliffe of Savills. But the typical St \nMawes buyer now seems to be returning, he adds: a mixture of wealthy retirees and second-home buyers from \nLondon.\n\nThere has been an increase in international interest, too. The village had its first Russian purchaser in 2010 and \nSavills has sold two homes to German buyers this year, while other agents report interest from Hong Kong and \nAustralia. On top of that, there are returning British expats, \"who start looking five years before they move back, \ngiving time to have work carried out and to visit on holidays,\" says Nicola Oddy of Stacks Property Search, a buying \nagency.\n\nOne major driver for consistently strong prices is St Mawes' sailing tradition. Knight Frank says the village is one of \nthe top seven locations in southern England with the highest premiums on properties with water views, especially if \nthey are accompanied by direct river frontages and moorings. The agency claims a private slipway can boost the \nprice of a property in St Mawes by more than 100 per cent, while private access to a jetty will add 80 per cent.\n\nHowever, buyers inevitably have a limited choice of homes in such a small location. This winter there are some 25 \nSt Mawes homes on the open market, just four of which are on for more than \u00a31m. A similar number are for sale in \nnearby villages Portscatho, Tregony and Veryan.\n\nSavills is selling a new three-storey house in St Mawes with 6,300 sq ft of space. The property has five bedrooms \nand a galleried hall, plus extensive outdoor terracing - all designed to optimise water views. It is on the market for \n\u00a32.35m.\n\nNearby, a colonial-style house, built in the 1930s and frequently remodelled, has four bedrooms, 2,800 sq ft of \nspace and is being marketed by agent H Tiddy for \u00a31.85m.\n\nFor those with long-term plans for a customised house, a plot on the edge of St Mawes is being sold with consent to \nbuild a 6,100 sq ft home for \u00a31.39m through Carter Jonas. Its unusually large 48-acre grounds come with 1,500ft of \ncreek frontage. A more modest three-bedroom Georgian semi-detached house - still with views across St Mawes \nharbour and the village itself - is on sale for \u00a3850,000 through Miller Countrywide.\n\nThese high prices persist despite what some prospective buyers may regard as significant disadvantages.\n\nNot only is St Mawes 290 miles southwest of London - a six-hour drive not including breaks - but the final 20 miles \nleading to the village are on narrow lanes. To travel from St Mawes to the nearest town centres of Falmouth and \nTruro you must either drive a dog-leg route to the head of a river or use undeniably charming but slow ferries.\n\nSt Mawes is only 30 miles from Newquay airport but easyJet has recently closed its Newquay-Gatwick service \nciting insufficient demand, while Gatwick and Heathrow are both about 280 miles away.\n\nEven the mobile telephone signal can be patchy - \"which frustrates holiday makers and business people alike,\" \nsays Nicola Oddy. But perhaps it is the peacefulness of the area that appeals to its better-known residents and \ntourists.\n\nSir Frank Williams, owner of the Williams Formula One team, has a property in the village, as does David Richards, \nformer F1 team principal and now chairman of Aston Martin. This year, Richards opened a 20-room boutique hotel \ncalled Idle Rocks in St Mawes. It is aimed at young families and is a rival to the Hotel Tresanton, a 1940s yacht club \ntransformed by the Forte family's Olga Polizzi in 1997 and frequented by Tony Blair, the Prince of Wales and a host \nof celebrities.\n\n\n\nSt Mawes clearly still has pulling power, despite Cornwall's economic landscape not yet enjoying the green shoots \nof recovery seen elsewhere. A powerful combination of natural beauty, water views and spacious housing has been \nits recipe for staying strong, even in a downturn.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n- In August - at the height of the holiday season - there were just two reported crimes in St Mawes: one for \nantisocial behaviour, the other for burglary\n\n- A significantly higher-than-average 39 per cent of residents are pensioners.

In the 20 years up to the end of 2011, median property prices rose 582 per cent, according to \nfigures supplied by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (Reinz). In the past year alone, prices have risen by \nabout 10 per cent, says Brad Roebuck of real estate firm Bayleys.\n\nIt is easy to understand the appeal. Waiheke lies 11 miles off the coast of North Island and is just a 40-minute ferry \nride from Auckland, the nation's financial hub, making it increasingly popular with commuters and owners of second \nhomes. Indeed, it is sometimes referred to as the city's \"island suburb\" - although this is not a term favoured by \nlocals.\n\n\n\nWaiheke has stunning scenery (lush vegetation, rocky sea coves, translucent waters and breathtaking hilltop \nviews), more than 30 vineyards producing some of the country's best wines (the local Syrah is a favourite) and an \nattractive microclimate. Add to that the growing numbers of boutique shops, bars and restaurants, including the \naward-winning Mudbrick in Oneroa, and it is no great surprise that while Waiheke has just 8,000 permanent \nresidents, its population swells to more than 30,000 during the holiday months.\n\n\"Ten to 15 years ago, Waiheke became a place for the trendy Aucklanders to go to,\" says Peter Thompson, \nmanaging director of Auckland estate agents Barfoot & Thompson. \"Predominantly, the buyers today are local \nAucklanders who look at Waiheke as a lifestyle change, either on a permanent basis, or as a place for a holiday \nhome.\" Its infrastructure has improved, he adds, but it has retained its community-oriented feel.\n\nThe west coast of the island draws the most punters, in particular the beaches near the island's main town Oneroa \nand at Onetangi, its largest and arguably most beautiful beach. \"Typically [house] prices range from NZ$500,000 \n(\u00a3260,000) to NZ$1.2m - though some more palatial places in excess of NZ$5m are not uncommon,\" says \nThompson.\n\nBarfoot & Thompson is selling a Mediterranean-style villa at Onetangi, at a guide price of NZ$1.95m with four \nbedrooms, olive groves, a small vineyard and a small orchard producing many fruits including the local feijoa or \npineapple guava. A little farther afield, Savills is selling a modern, glass-fronted villa with four bedrooms and a 4.27-\nhectare estate with award-winning olive groves, at a guide price of NZ$4.5m. Modern properties have become \nincreasingly popular, agents say, slowly replacing old-fashioned bachs, the more modest timber holiday homes \nonce synonymous with New Zealand's coastline.\n\nThe eastern side of the island, around areas such as Man O'War Bay, is far more remote, has worse road access \n(some properties have helicopter pads) and is sparsely populated. It is less popular with commuters, but conversely \nappeals to a niche set of super wealthy buyers for whom privacy is a priority. It is here that some of the most \nimpressive houses are to be found, says Thompson. \"Properties here tend to range from between NZ$5m up to as \nhigh as NZ$15m.\"\n\nThe most expensive house for sale on Waiheke at present is a NZ$7.5m four-bedroom modern property, with a \nsolar-heated infinity pool, at Oneroa on the island's northwest coast.\n\nWhere Waiheke has the edge over other New Zealand holiday hotspots is not just its island feel and boutique-filled \nvillages, but also its proximity to Auckland. \"The other similar area that purchasers are looking at would be Omaha \nBeach [on the mainland], about one-and-a-half hours north of Auckland,\" says Roebuck. \"The prime minister [John \nKey] has his holiday home there and it is quite an exclusive and expensive area. However for many, Waiheke has \nthe edge because of its vineyards, choice of beaches, schools and, of course, accessibility.\"\n\nIn the past, Roebuck adds, property price rises had as much to do with mid-range family buyers moving to the \nisland for reasons of cost as well as lifestyle reasons. A three-bedroom home 10 years ago would have been \nsignificantly cheaper on Waiheke than in Auckland. Now, however, that price difference is negligible.\n\nThe NZ Property Report for April 2013 states that the average asking price for property in Auckland has reached a \nrecord high of NZ$612,167, compared with the national average of NZ$447,275. The average asking price on \nWaiheke is just over NZ$600,000. Overseas buyers, some of whom spent time here during the 2011 Rugby World \nCup, are beginning to take note, agents say. Roebuck has recently seen prospective buyers from Australia, \nSwitzerland and the US.\n\nPaul Tostevin, an associate in residential research at property specialists Savills, attributes Waiheke's success with \nlocal buyers to the growing wealth across the bay. \"Waiheke Island's rising property market has been fed by the \ngrowing wealth in Auckland, where prices are now 26 per cent above their 2007 peak, compared with 11 per cent \nnationally,\" he says. Savills recently included Waiheke in its report for Candy & Candy on the global prime sector as \nan example of a luxury enclave dependent on domestic wealth.\n\n\n\n\"Inevitably, when wealth is created,\" says Tostevin, \"playgrounds for the wealthy spring up nearby. International \ninterest is the likely offshoot in the long term, despite the remoteness of Waiheke.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBuying guide\n\n- The main hourly ferry from downtown Auckland to Matiatia Wharf on Waiheke takes 40 minutes.

Inside the 1970s-style \nduplex, which Wantchekon, 57, shares with his wife, Catherine, a university financial manager, the rooms are \ndecorated in calm, neutral colours and are filled with artefacts and family photographs.\n\nHe has just one complaint: \"It's too quiet for me - I like student energy on campus.\" Even on football weekends? \n(Princeton's football stadium is visible directly across from the house) \"American football is surprisingly quiet,\" he \nsays.\n\nAlthough he teaches full-time at Princeton, Wantchekon has recently embarked on a parallel mission in his native \nBenin: to create a first-rate university from scratch, complete with a new campus. Named the African School of \nEconomics (ASE), it has grown out of a research institute that Wantchekon founded in Benin in 2004. ASE, which \nwill partner with Princeton, will officially open in the autumn of 2014. \"We'll start with 300 graduate students and rent \na location while we build the new campus,\" he says.\n\nAt home in Princeton, Wantchekon has turned his window desk, with its neat piles of papers, into a virtual planning \nsite. \"This house is five minutes from my office. But when I'm home, I'm on Skype two to three hours a day with \ncolleagues in Benin. This is where I sit, think and work.\" He opens his laptop to show off architectural designs for \nstriking concrete and glass-sided buildings. Time is also being spent devising courses. \"Mathematics and statistics \nwill be the core,\" he says.\n\n\n\nA top maths student himself, Wantchekon began organising protests while still at school. \"I became a pro-\ndemocracy leader,\" he says. And his activism got him expelled from the National University of Benin in 1979. \"I \nlived in hiding, organising students, writing for the underground newspaper.\" During a brief amnesty in 1985, he re-\nenrolled as a student only to mobilise a larger protest and the rallies that led to his arrest.\n\nIt was only after he had settled in Canada that Wantchekon finished his degree, before moving to Northwestern \nUniversity in Illinois, where he completed a PhD in economics. Then in 1995, he was hired by Yale and, after a stint \nat New York University, he accepted the post at Princeton in 2011.\n\nWantchekon's attention turns to objects in his sitting room. \"I bought this in Cotonou,\" he says, pointing to an \nAfrican mask on the wall. \"It's an ancestor's mask. You have street vendors who sell you masks and they're very, \nvery talented,\" he says, adding that, although not religious, the masks are thought to protect the home. \"Masks are \nbelieved to capture the spirit of the ancestor looking out for us. They're popular throughout Africa.\"\n\nOn another wall hangs a colourful painting of a waterfall. \"It's a watercolour from South Africa,\" he says, \"but I think \nof this [simply] as an African landscape.\"\n\nThe idea of a pan-African identity, a concept that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s during the struggle for African \nindependence, has inspired Wantchekon's vision for ASE. \"We will draw the best students from across Africa and \nteach them to become future economists, political leaders, CEOs,\" he says. \"The research centres are [already] \nopen. We have one masters programme in economics and statistics. Next year, we'll be upgrading to economics, \nmathematics and statistics, then we're adding an MBA [and] an MPA.\" A humanities programme, he says, \"is on the \nbooks for 2016\".\n\nSo how does he respond to those who, citing trade restrictions and regional instability, among other issues, dismiss \nthe notion of an African identity? \"I strongly disagree,\" says Wantchekon. \"In academia, there are more pan-African \ninstitutions than ever: African Economic Research Consortium, Afrobarometer, African University of Science and \nTechnology,\" he says. \"And now our applicants are coming in from 25 African countries.\n\nWantchekon envisages a future Africa of tightening economic and political integration along the lines of the EU. \n\"Market fragmentation is inefficient, [it] reinforces division and [allows] limited development . . . Eventually, we need \nan African central bank,\" he says. \"Now the francophone countries have their central bank based in Dakar and it's \nstill led by the Banque de France. Former British colonies have their central banks.\"\n\nHis hope is that ASE will help to sow democracy across the region. His own Benin-based research, published in the \nOctober issue of the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, compares town hall meetings with rallies in \ncampaigns. \"We've found that town hall meetings are much more effective in reinforcing issue-based voting.\" \nAfrica's most valuable resource, he adds, is its young people. \"We have a very young, dynamic, ambitious \npopulation. We just need to train them.\"\n\nStudents from ASE have already impressed their counterparts at Princeton. \"I brought 14 grad students from \nPrinceton to Benin and they realised some students there were even stronger. They didn't expect that,\" says \nWantchekon.\n\nArranged on the shelves of a large bookcase to the right of the eating area are photos of his two grown-up children, \nTravis and Kristia. \"I put pictures of my children everywhere. I have my son here playing football,\" he says. \nMeanwhile, he credits Catherine for giving him balance. \"I met her when I was running, in hiding. She isn't an \nactivist. She gave me a sense of reality,\" he says. Still, Wantchekon sees building his school as an extension of his \nearly struggle. \"Now Benin is a democracy. But we fought for it. I remember when it seemed impossible.\"\n\nWantchekon has secured the land for the ASE campus in the city of Akassato in southern Benin and is currently \nraising construction funds, but his plans will not stop there. \"We'll eventually have a museum of social history,\" he \nsays, \"a botanical garden, even a football stadium.\"\n\n\n\nContinuing his tour of the house, Wantchekon walks out to a shared back terrace with iron-grate furniture. The \ncouple have recently bought another house nearby, which they will co-own with the university. Wantchekon is \nlooking forward to more space and says he is pleased they will remain close to the activity and bustle of student life, \nadding, \"I get inspiration from my interactions on campus.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe first object Wantchekon selects is an old book from school. \"I still have my sixth-grade African history book, Les \nPeuples Noirs,\" he says, retrieving a tattered textbook from Benin. \"It's rigorous and nicely written,\" he says, \"I'm \npuzzled how, over four centuries of slave trade, African families and culture survived. You had migration, people \npermanently on the run to escape slave trade, war, disease. They didn't have homes.\" The second object is his \ncertificate from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \"It was moving,\" says Wantchekon, of his election in \nOctober as the first African voted into the academy. \"I was touched by messages from across Africa: Cameroon, \nMali, Congo, Malawi. I was congratulated not as a person from Benin, but as an African; for representing Africa.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

On one hand, I've always considered letting a meal go \ncold to be the greatest disservice one can pay to the animal that died to make it and to the cook. On the other, I see \nthere is value in reminding myself that I am lucky to have food and good friends to eat it with. Also, when my wife \ninvites over friends from church should I adopt their gracing ways or they mine?\n\nSo let me get this right: you don't believe in God, but you believe in being considerate to a dead animal and a cook? \nI must confess I find this slightly bizarre. In any event, any cooks worth their salt should be able to time their \ncooking to arrive after grace is said. But of course if you were to have plated food already on the table before you sit \ndown, then you are beyond social redemption.\n\nOn the point of others wishing to exercise their convictions, you would do well to respect them in an open and \ntolerant society. After all, you would not mind taking your shoes off when visiting a mosque, or doing a hongi to a \nMaori? So why irk over a few seconds in which others might like to say grace? If friends of your wife were involved, \nall the more reason to be accommodating and score a few brownie points with her.\n\n. . .\n\nYou have mentioned Belgian detective Hercule Poirot twice in the recent months. Though he wasn't originally from \nBrussels, he reminds me of the city during the heydays of art nouveau, with fantastic architecture such as Stoclet \nPalace. As a seasoned traveller, you surely have been to Brussels. However, and despite its cultural gems, I fear \nyou may have left as fast as you could.\n\nI have always been suspicious about Belgium. OK, it produced Magritte, but he never made it to the big league. The \ncountry also produced Sax, who invented the saxophone, but it is hardly an indispensable instrument. There is, of \ncourse, Tin Tin, but he was fictional. But worst of all, the name \"Brussels\" evokes, other than sprouts, the tyranny of \nthe EU, with its countless greedy and bureaucratic members savouring their lunches and dinners in Michelin-starred \nrestaurants washed down with fine wines on expense accounts. This is a country of self-indulgence by foreigners \nand for the Belgians, I hesitate to think what happens beyond all of their net curtains. Its veneer of respectability \ngives me the creeps.\n\nIf I were to pass through this country, I would scarper with speed. Maybe the only point of interest is the site of the \nBattle of Waterloo where Bonaparte, who was already short, was cut down to an even smaller size. This \ngeographical coincidence seems to be the greatest contribution Belgium has made to European peace.\n\n\n\n. . .\n\nWhat do you do if you were host at a dinner at which your guests start arguing with each other? Do you let them \nfight or do you intercede and try to make peace? Would you react differently if your guests were eminent people \nand you selfishly wished to hear them?\n\nThe best thing to do is allow your guests to carry on arguing. I always like some firm disagreements over the dinner \ntable to liven up the food and beverage, or some interesting anecdotes, which, if told with proper embellishments, \nare far superior to jokes. I once had Freddie Ayer, the brilliant philosopher, and Roald Dahl, the great children's \nwriter, come for dinner. They both boasted about their squeezes like a game of call-my-bluff. To claim decisive \nvictory, at least in quality, Dahl told a story about sleeping one night in the bunker of The Dorchester hotel, and how \nhe saw Ernest Hemingway two beds away, separated by a woman in between them. Of course what Dahl recalled \nfrom that night might well have been one of his vintage \"Tales of the Unexpected\". I simply couldn't tell. Ayer, \narguably the world's most authoritative empiricist by virtue of his logical positivism, was naturally sceptical about \nDahl's anecdote. But for me, the two fossils bantering for the higher status of virility was faintly sad but also quaint. \nThat's the kind of dinner I like.\n\n. . .\n\nIs black tie for funerals?\n\nYes, if you mean wearing a tie that is black. But not \"black tie\" as an ensemble, which nowadays is regarded as \nformal wear, usually with ghastly bows already knotted, irregular lapels, dubious waistcoats and unacceptable \ncolour handkerchiefs over the top pocket.\n\nEmail questions to david.tang@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Over the past 50 years, figures from the Halifax show Greater London house prices \nrising relative to those in the rest of the UK by a modest but cumulatively significant 0.5 per cent per year.\n\nBut people plainly can afford to buy houses in London. House prices can be high and rising if - and only if - people \ncan afford to pay these prices. Some people who used to be able to afford central London house prices are now \nunable to do so, while others who used not to be able to afford them - or chose not to afford them - can now do so. \nIf prices are rising, it is because the latter group outnumber the former. What has changed is not housing but the \nbackgrounds of the people who live in these homes and their sources of wealth.\n\nCarlton House Terrace is possibly the most desirable address in London. The street overlooks The Mall, the \napproach road to Buckingham Palace. A house in Carlton House Terrace is at present on the market with a \nreported asking price of \u00a3250m. If that price is achieved, the house would be the UK's most expensive property. \nThe current owner is thought to be a Middle Eastern prince.\n\nTwo doors away is the London residence of the Hinduja brothers, scions of the family-owned, Indian-based \nindustrial and financial conglomerate. They have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the most opulent of \nrestorations. Most of the rest of the street is occupied by bodies which benefit from the favour of the freeholder, the \nCrown Estate. The British Academy and the Royal Society are on opposite sides of the steps leading down to The \nMall. In a glorious, if incongruous, conjunction the Turf Club sits next to the Royal Society.\n\nIn the 19th century, all properties in the street were private residences. Some occupants were politicians - Lord \nPalmerston and William Gladstone both lived in Carlton House Terrace. So did Baron Stockmar, the shadowy \ncounsellor to the young Queen Victoria. But the majority of residents were aristocrats whose names have faded into \nobscurity.\n\nmailto:david.tang@ft.com\n\n\nDemocracy chose a different type of politician, and the power and wealth of the British aristocracy waned. In the \n20th century Carlton House Terrace took on a more commercial tone. One resident was Weetman Pearson, 1st \nViscount Cowdray, the architect of the Pearson Group - the company which today owns the Financial Times, but \nwas then a global infrastructure business which built the rail tracks under New York's East River. His neighbours \nincluded George Stephen, the Scots-Canadian financier of the Canadian Pacific Railway; Harry Gordon Selfridge, \nwho established the eponymous department store; and Lord Revelstoke, of the Baring banking family. George \nNathaniel Curzon, the grandest of India's viceroys, returned from the subcontinent to become the terrace's most \nsuperior resident, although he never accomplished his real property ambition - a move to 10 Downing Street.\n\nA home in Carlton House Terrace is the ultimate \"positional good\". This is a term coined by Fred Hirsch in an \ninsightful work titled Social Limits to Growth (1976). Economic growth is associated with increased availability of \nmost commodities, but for some the absolute supply is fixed. Beautiful landscapes, paintings by Rembrandt. \nProperties in Carlton House Terrace and other prize London locations such as Belgravia's Eaton Square, \nKensington's Pelham Crescent, and Hampstead's Bishops Avenue. The staff needed to service grand properties \nare also positional goods. The positional good is one which by its nature can only be available to a few people.\n\nThe price of positional goods will normally rise faster than incomes. People aim to spend more of their income on \npositional goods as they become richer, but only a few can ever realise these ambitions. So such goods will always \nheld by the people who are at that time the richest, but who these people are may vary from time to time. The range \nof house prices - and the availability of servants - will reflect the underlying inequality of incomes. The price of prime \nproperty in central London will be a direct function of the levels of income and wealth of the most affluent people \nwho want to live in London.\n\nThe story of subprime central London property is more complex. The invention of motorised transport in the 19th \ncentury made possible the development of large cities, with large populations. In 1801, 1m people lived in London: \nin 1901, there were 6.5m. The first underground railways allowed the geographical expansion of London's inner \ncore - the grand houses of Earls Court were a direct result. But the attractions of these houses proved shortlived. \nWith the growth of a suburban rail network, a new word - commuter - entered the English language to describe the \nholder of a season ticket. The expansion of London continued as the transport network grew. In the 1950s, John \nBetjeman would celebrate \"Metroland\" - the developments to the northwest of the city made possible by the building \nof the Metropolitan Railway.\n\nThe street of terraced houses in which I live is considerably more modest than Carlton House Terrace but was built \nat about the same time, though for artisans and tradespeople rather than aristocrats and statesmen. The first \noccupant of my house was a carpenter who occupied the lower floors with his wife and family while their two \nservants huddled in attic rooms. But as the character of London changed to become a commuter city, this type of \ncentrally located property entered a long and steady decline.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the house was in multiple occupation: a house painter and his family occupied the \nground floor, with three rooms let to lodgers. When the architectural historian, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner surveyed \nLondon's architecture in the 1950s, he would describe the area as slummy. But not for much longer. Expansion of \nLondon's boundaries had reached its limits: a \"greenbelt\" constricted further expansion. The improvement in \ntransport links came to an end; commuting to London is generally no easier or quicker today than in 1939. The \nsupply of London houses was once more a fixed number, and London property as a whole - not just its trophy \nresidences - became a positional good. The composition of employment in London was also changing. \nManufacturing and wholesale distribution now suffered rather than benefited from a London location and moved \nout. For much of the postwar period, official policies encouraged that relocation. In their place, financial and \nbusiness services expanded and clustered in the capital.\n\nAnother new word - gentrification - was invented to describe the resulting changes, as kitchen stoves gave way to \nGaggenau appliances. The skips have long gone from my street - they have moved steadily outward from the \ncentre, as Hackney and Stoke Newington take on a new identity as Islington East, and Kilburn becomes West \nHampstead. Where gentrification has a longer history, you can identify successive layers of incomers, as on an \narchaeological site: most houses are occupied by people who could not now afford to buy them. Most residents now \n\n\n\nwork in business services, but, in a further turn of the wheel of fortune, many of these people now struggle to afford \nproperty in central London; they are squeezed by those who acquire positions, or the money that goes with \npositions, from their parents. Thus, the historic rise in house prices aids the transmission of inequality through the \ngenerations. There is a certain irony in noting that now my most famous neighbour is the son of Tony Blair, the \nformer UK prime minister.\n\nIn Carlton House Terrace, British politicians and aristocrats gave way to British businessmen and financiers. Briefly, \nat about the time of the second world war, reduced inequality diminished the attractions of these properties and \nlimited the ability to find the staff to keep them going. But, as inequality again increased, and an improvement in \ninternational communications made world, rather than domestic, inequality relevant, these prime properties became \nhavens for a global elite, and London the world's most desirable - and hence the most cosmopolitan - city. The \npositional good of a prime London property became a universal aspiration. A terraced house in Marylebone was a \npositional good when it was built in the early 19th century, and 200 years later it would be a positional good again.\n\nThe monetary rewards attached to different occupations and social positions change from one period of history to \nanother. The houses remain, the backgrounds of their occupants change. Central London houses are always \naffordable. The economic and political climate determine who can afford them at any particular point in time, and \nthat in turn determines the social complexion of the capital.\n\nJohn Kay is a columnist for the Financial Times\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Perennials are lifted and moved - they rarely get big or established enough to need \ndividing - every year, sometimes twice a year. Shrubs are not immune to her restless eye either, provided they \nhaven't attained a size that makes them impossible to shift. The object of this exercise isn't simply to resolve any \nshortcomings in planting combinations. It is more a constant reinvention of the garden, to the point where it is \nalmost unrecognisable from one year to the next, which for Mrs X is entirely the point.\n\nRegular reinvention on such an unequivocal scale may be unusual - and potentially hazardous to one's sanity - but \na desire to keep gardens fresh, dynamic and changing is not uncommon, regardless of plot size. This is where \nannuals and specifically \"direct sown\" annuals have an invaluable role to play.\n\nThe term refers to hardy annual plants that can be grown from seed sown directly into a prepared seedbed \noutdoors, where they are free to grow and flower, rather than sown into trays or pots in a glasshouse and then \nslowly hardened off ready for transplanting. The benefits are easy to measure: no specialist kit is required, no \nglasshouse or cold frames, no pots, trays or potting compost. After sowing there is no need for the close monitoring \nassociated with a glasshouse environment, and limited aftercare is required apart from a little thinning out of \nseedlings. Watering is usually only needed at the vulnerable germination and seedling stage, and then only if the \nweather turns very dry. Because these are hardy annuals the risk of weather damage from late frosts is reduced \ntoo, so there is less of the anxious weather-watching associated with the planting out of pot-grown annuals.\n\nThere are also aesthetic advantages to direct sowing: scattering seed around through established plants often \nresults in happy accidents. Just as in the wild, seeds seem to find a way of germinating in the least auspicious \nplaces, with plants emerging from patches where it would be impossible to plant a pot-grown plant.\n\nThere are two main seasons for sowing. Traditionally, late spring has been touted as the optimum time to sow, just \nas the soil is beginning to warm and day length is increasing. In the wild, however, the annuals from which almost \n\n\n\nall our garden varieties are derived will have set and shed their seed in late summer or early autumn. Sowing \nacross both seasons seems to be the optimum for some annuals: an autumn sowing takes advantage of the warm \nsoil to encourage germination by late autumn. The resulting seedlings are surprisingly robust and will make it \nthrough even cold and snowy winters, resulting in a mid-spring show of flowers - by when it is time to sow again for \na midsummer display. Sowing through spring and early summer in succession keeps things bubbling along nicely \nuntil late summer. Before sowing, the soil should be dug over and raked to a fine tilth, but if this is impossible - such \nas when sowing between established plants - make a seed bed by applying a layer of loam and sand to the surface \nof the soil.\n\nThe umbellifers make a useful contribution to the hardy annual tribe. There are several to recommend for their airy \nflower heads. Ammi majus, from the Nile river valley, is a classy cow parsley, about 120cm tall topped with white, \nlacy flowers. It prefers full sun or partial light shade. The variety \"Graceland\" is a good one, with larger heads and \nstrong stems that make it good for cutting. Technically a biennial or shortlived perennial, the \"true\" cow parsley, \nAnthriscus sylvestris, has a handsome purple foliage form, \"Ravenswing\". It gets a mention here because once \nestablished it will seed around and form a colony that will ensure a succession of flowering plants, suitable for a wild \ngarden or meadow. Perhaps the most beautiful of the umbellifers is Orlaya grandiflora, the Minoan lace flower. At \n60cm it prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and given those conditions will flower freely, producing flat clusters of \nlong-lasting flowers that look like miniature lace-cap hydrangeas, that cut and keep well in a vase. In colder \nclimates this is probably best left to a late spring sowing. Any of these white flowered umbellifers would make a \nclassy counterpoint to silver-leaved foliage plants, dark-flowered salvia or metallic purple alliums.\n\nGarden favourites such as Love-in-a-mist (Nigella damascena), Pot marigold (Calendula officinalis) and Plains \ncoreopsis (Coreopsis tinctoria) are reliable colonisers too. Once sown they will usually reappear year after year, \nalthough it is important not to rely on their self-sowing capacities alone. Without regular topping up through a \nsuccession of sowings over a number of weeks the self-colonisers will flower and go over all too soon. Nigella is a \nplant that is as attractive in seed as in flower, and a succession of pale blue flowers alongside the papery, bladder-\nlike seed heads should be the aim. Perhaps the best of all the colonisers is Eschscholzia californica, the Californian \npoppy. Behaving either as a perennial or annual, it will spread its filigree glaucous foliage and sunny orange flowers \nwherever there is sharply drained, gritty soil and plenty of sunshine. Once established, the need to resow \ndiminishes, and the trick to keeping it flowering over a long period rests instead in dead heading, cutting back the \nspent flowers before they get a chance to form the distinctive, narrow seed pods. But let at least 25 per cent of the \nflowers go to seed if you want the colony to continue to thrive and regenerate. A broad sweep of Eschscholzia looks \nwonderful alongside the squirrel tail grass, Hordeum jubatum - another direct sown annual. Even the \"common\" \ncornfield weeds are worthy of consideration. The cornflower, Centaurea cyanus, has been heavily hybridised in \nrecent years resulting in interesting colour breaks, dark purples and pinks, and a longer flowering season. This, \nalong with varieties of Coreopsis and Tagetes, featured heavily in the annual meadows at the London 2012 Olympic \nPark.\n\nAbove all, direct sown annuals bring with them a somewhat haphazard aesthetic, a floral joie de vivre. In part, this \nmust be because it is impossible to sow them in straight lines, unless one is spectacularly anal about such things, \nand so instead they pop up all over the place. And as so many are genuinely wild plants - or if not, first cousins of \nwild plants - there is something about them that touches a part of the soul other plants may not reach. They add \nvibrancy and movement to established planting schemes, fill empty nooks and crannies and refresh tired plantings \nwith an injection of colour.

One of the jets, a Hawker 800, flies between the UK and central Europe, and also within central Europe.\n\nA fourth aircraft, operated through a management company in Asia, is based in Hong Kong, and is used for travel \nbetween Tesco's businesses in the region.\n\nThe London office, which is not above a store, is used by the chairman and Tesco board members. Before it \nopened, Tesco directors had always made the journey to Tesco's 1960s offices in Cheshunt, north of London, to \nmeet.\n\nThe company said: \"Tesco is a FTSE-listed multinational business with 7,000 stores in 12 markets. We use only the \ntools which allow us to work efficiently and effectively. Aircraft allow our executive team to use their time efficiently \nas they travel between and within the 12 markets we operate in and the more than 70 we source from. Our \nheadquarters is based outside London because it is more cost-effective, and we rent a small office for meetings in \ncentral London.\"\n\nThe developments come ahead of Tesco's third-quarter trading statement on Wednesday. Underlying UK sales are \nforecast by Tesco's own brokers to fall up to 1.8 per cent.\n\nThis is expected despite Mr Clarke pledging to invest \u00a31bn to reinvigorate the domestic business after Tesco's first \nprofit warning in decades in January 2012. Sales from stores open at least a year are also forecast to fall in Asia \nand central Europe.\n\nSome senior investors are concerned that Tesco will be forced to issue another profit warning because it cannot \nmaintain its operating margin in the face of weak sales.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He \ncautioned against discussing: tales of kings, robbers and ministers of state; war, terrors and battles; food and drink; \nclothes, beds, garlands and perfumes; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities and countries; women and heroes; \ngossip; tales of the dead; idle chat; legends about the creation of the land and the sea; and speculation about \nexistence and non-existence.\n\nIn case you're worrying that your own conversation may turn out to be less than edifying, bear in mind that the \nBuddha was talking to and about monks, not giving general advice for lay people.\n\n\n\nOne of the items on the Buddha's list was gossip. But hasn't gossip been rescued from its bad reputation and \nrehabilitated? According to this view, gossip has evolved as a mechanism for social lubrication and bonding, \nsomewhat like primate grooming. Recent research has also showed that it comes in handy as a way of warning \npeople about dishonest others. Still, no one would deny that malicious gossip is real, harmful and to be avoided.\n\nThe Buddha's list is clearly not a viable prescription of allowed topics for conversation, otherwise we would all have \nto fall silent. But it could be food for thought. There's little escape from words nowadays, and even less with the \nadvent of social media. All this talking can make you giddy. And it's hard not to feel a pressure to add your own \nwords to the mix, to keep chatting, almost as if by not joining in you'd risk dropping out of existence.\n\nPerhaps that's what we could question - that it's always \"good to talk\", as the old BT slogan would have it. \nSometimes it's better to create a bit of quiet instead. To help you do this, you could pay attention to what you talk \nabout and how you talk about it. And do remember that there's no need to feel awkward if you have nothing to \ncontribute to a conversation not worth having.\n\n. . .\n\nThe Sage\n\nIt's easy - and let's admit it, quite fun - to sneer at the trivia discussed by hoi polloi. However, there is at least one \nadvantage that talking about celebrity sex scandals has over topics such as whether free will is an illusion or artistic \ntaste purely subjective: at least there is reasonable chance of agreeing on the right answer.\n\nIntellectuals have always been mocked for their endless discourse on matters that more practical minds find \npointless. Aristophanes sent Socrates to the clouds nearly two-and-a-half millennia ago, and that's where many \nhave kept him and his ilk ever since.\n\nIt's not just the improbability, if not impossibility, of reaching a conclusion that makes many dismissive of theoretical \nquestions. There's also a sense of vanity about the whole enterprise. Isn't the very definition of hubris unduly \nsolemn adults pretending that they can even begin to fathom the deepest mysteries of existence? From this \nperspective, much theology looks like blasphemy - \"For who has known the mind of the Lord?\" as the Bible puts it.\n\nFaced with this scepticism, some defend more academic pursuits by claiming they are more useful than they \nappear: philosophy, history, literary theory and the like enable us to live better lives by contributing to our \nunderstanding of self and others. True - but only up to a point. You would be hard-pressed to make this claim stand \nup for most work in modal logic, for example.\n\nA better strategy might be a kind of intellectual judo, in which the force of the objection to academic inquiry is turned \nagainst the attacker. We need to embrace its lack of utility, as Wittgenstein did when he rejected Bertrand Russell's \nclaim that philosophy expands the mind and provides a kind of liberation: \"People who like philosophy will pursue it, \nand others won't and there is an end of it.\"\n\nThe value of apparently useless intellectual problems sometimes lies precisely in the fact that we do not discuss \nthem for any other sake than their own. Like all the most precious things in life, we love them for what they are, not \nwhat they can do for us.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe Shrink & the Sage live together in southwest England.

But to be honest, I don't think there are any \nother collections of pizza boxes. People just don't do this - most boxes end up in the trash. They're not collectors' \nitems - it's like saving used tissue. But because my life revolves around pizza, to me it's a priceless collection.\n\nI own 597 boxes and store most of them at home.\n\nMy obsession with pizza boxes grew out of my obsession with pizza. I got really into it as a kid, growing up in New \nJersey. I ate your standard, suburban, New York-style pie, with low-moisture mozzarella and a tomato-based \nsauce. Nothing fancy. The absolute average pizza but I loved it. It was always takeout, so it always came in a box.\n\nIn college I played guitar in a rock band and I even booked our tours based on where there was good pizza. \"Hmm, \nI've never been to Chicago. I hear they have great pizza. Let's go there.\" Back home, I became the go-to person \nwhenever anyone had a question about a pizzeria. On weekends, I'd take my friends and family to pizzerias in New \nYork, Philadelphia, Boston. Everyone wanted to go. It got to be so many people I rented a bus. After about six \nmonths of this, I decided to make it my job. I took out my savings, got a tour-guide licence and, in 2008, launched \nScott's Pizza Tours.\n\nA few years ago I went to Israel. Much of pizza and flatbread history comes from the Middle East, so it was a pizza \nresearch trip. While I was there I saw a yellow pizza box, and it blew my mind. Growing up, we had these thin \npaperboard boxes, white with a red drawing, maybe of a pizza or an Italian flag. That was it. When I saw this box in \nIsrael - bright yellow with blue writing - I thought, \"This is insane. They're breaking all the rules!\" It was like listening \nto punk rock for the first time. I saw how amazing pizza boxes were and how powerful they could be as an art form. \nI became a serious collector. I went to Italy and brought back a ton of boxes in my suitcase. I travelled to the west \ncoast of the US and went to 52 pizzerias in 14 days. I felt like an animal.\n\nOne of my favourite boxes was designed by the artist Ed Hardy, who did a limited edition for a pizzeria in San \nFrancisco. It's a tattoo of a bald eagle sitting on top of a pizza with a tiger on one side and a dragon on the other. I \nhave a box that's perforated so that the pizza actually pops out of the top. You can make the box into a plane or a \ndinosaur, and the lid becomes an 80-piece jigsaw puzzle. On another box, the pizza maker in its centre looks \nexactly like George Clooney.\n\nI hope the US is about to enter a golden age of pizza boxes. My book, Viva La Pizza: The Art of the Pizza Box, \nshows more than 100 box designs from around the world, and I'm hoping it'll open people's eyes to what's possible. \nItaly is already having its golden age - the best pizza boxes are being made there. Japan is a close second.\n\nNew York has some of the worst pizza boxes. They're almost all generic. They don't value the art here because it's \nnot a delivery-focused market - it's more of a single-slice culture. The best boxes in the US are on the west coast.\n\nI actually dislike eating pizza out of boxes. I love the boxes for what they represent but for transporting pizza, \nthey're terrible. The box traps the pizza in steam, which breaks down the cardboard, which you then end up tasting. \nNew pizza box technology exists but if a box costs a pizzeria even one cent more, it won't go for it.\n\nI realise it's goofy to know so much about pizza boxes. It might look childish to some. But if you talk to a dentist, you \nwant them to know everything there is to know about teeth. I treat pizza boxes the same way. They're the most \nunder-appreciated medium of our time.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n'Viva La Pizza: The Art of the Pizza Box' is published by Melville House, \u00a316.99\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The moral arguments around killing and eating \nanimals are complex but I've made a sort of peace with them. I believe humans have evolved as omnivores and \ncan and should eat other creatures; I also believe that as a species we are civilised enough that we should reduce \nsuffering wherever possible and, once we've killed an animal, respect it by cooking it well and eating it all, without \nwaste.\n\nLike many food lovers with this kind of approach to meat, I want to experience hunting the animal I eat yet I'm \ntroubled by its social ramifications in the UK. Most shooting here is \"driven\", where reared birds are startled by \nbeaters into flight over or past a line of guns. It requires skill, it's expensive, it has overtones of Downton-like \nprivilege and I find this difficult. Many writers and chefs have taken the other route of deer stalking. This is more \nchallenging than driven shooting, with long hikes and difficult manoeuvring into position for a shot but it's more \nexpensive and, arguably, even more elitist.\n\nWhat I have been looking for is a model of shooting more like that practised in the rural US and the rest of Europe. \nNo tweed, no beaters, just a walk with a gun to shoot something delicious for the pot. It sounds so simple but the \ncombination of land ownership, gun and game laws in the UK means that such a connection with food is an \nopportunity open to very few - those with land or gamekeepers. The lore and skills of this kind of shooting - the \nmarksmanship, the tracking, the fieldcraft, the understanding of weather, animal behaviour and field butchery - are \ntraditionally passed down and, unless you are part of that small community, difficult to get involved in.\n\nGame shooting Chris Wheatley-Hubbard is one of the lucky ones. He grew up on a 2,500-acre estate in Wiltshire. \nHe has had guns and animals about him all his life - apart from a stint as a graphic designer in London. Initially he \nlearnt his craft from an older keeper and latterly trained as an APSI-certified (Association of Professional Shooting \nInstructors) advanced shooting instructor. Today Chris also runs bespoke courses for small groups and individuals, \nso I arranged to spend a couple of days with him at Boyton, the family seat. We discussed my requirements at \nsome length: unlike a driven shoot there would be no guarantees of a kill. Instead I'd build up enough skills to go \nout and, if I was lucky enough to spot game, dispatch it well and responsibly.\n\nI began by learning to walk. Chris showed me how to place my huge boots carefully so as to make minimum noise \nwhen moving through undergrowth and then led me on a half-hour silent walk along the edges of a field. It seemed \nodd at first, embarrassing for someone who had probably not spent 10 waking minutes in silence in 20 years, but \nwithin a short time I was adjusting to \"the baseline\": the sights, sounds and smells of the environment. The art of \ntracking is less in being able to identify a species from its footprint and more in allowing the brain's natural, deep-\nburied pattern-recognition software to alert you to subtle variations on the normal.\n\n\n\nNext came a surprise. I'd expected a shotgun - the most common weapon for hunting in the UK, with a close \neffective range and a wide lethal spread. Instead, Chris took me to a range set up in a valley and produced a .22 \nrifle with a crosshair scope (telescopic sight). There are many things for which I owe thanks to my old-fashioned \ngrammar school but I never imagined my Cadet Marksman badge would be one of them. I managed creditably, \ngrouping five shots within 6cm at 75m range, pretty good for an out-of-practice urban hack, but then Chris turned \nmy attention to a second target, a paper deer standing 25m further back. This time there was no convenient aiming \npoint, just, as Chris described it, an imaginary vertical line behind the front leg, which I was to bisect halfway up the \nbody.\n\nI managed to get a cluster of shots in roughly the right place and we walked across the valley to examine the target. \nI was congratulating myself until Chris lifted the target sheet to reveal a diagram of the deer's vital organs. As a \ncook, my understanding of animal physiology is pretty good but this was a great deal more immediate. \"A little high. \nYou'd have damaged the lungs and possibly the spine. You really need to clear the ribs here ... and hit this area \nnear the heart. That way the hydrostatic shock from the impact bursts blood vessels in the brain and the animal \ndrops where it stands.\" To my total relief it's a clean kill but, he adds, \"it could be better\".\n\nLunch is brief and conversation revolves around \"terminal ballistics\" - what happens when the bullet enters the \nanimal, how it deforms, expands and damages internal organs. It's not exactly what I'd choose to discuss over a \npork pie but I'm beginning to realise that the process of preparing to pull the trigger is a lot more involved than a half \nhour on a range.\n\nAs the afternoon light mellows it's time for the \"deer run\". With Chris at my shoulder I have to walk silently a route \nthrough woods and field where there will be deer-shaped targets. I am to identify each imagined animal, establish \nthat it's safe to shoot, then, staying out of what would be its sightline, get myself and the rifle into a position to take \na single shot. The first target glimpsed between trees appears to be a mother with her calf so I move on. The \nsecond is a suitable animal but, against a background of brush, I can't be sure where my shot will go if it passes \nthrough or misses; another no go. Finally, through binoculars, I spot two deer close together, both suitable targets \nand one with a clear shot.\n\nAs Chris quietly instructs, I drop to my knees behind a rise and crawl what feels like 100m or so then drop flat on to \nmy stomach for the final 50m, dragging myself forward on my elbows, pushing the rifle ahead of me. I am \nmomentarily fazed as my chin narrowly avoids a crisp mound of sheep droppings but at Chris's urging I push \nthrough. My breathing is now strained, my heart thundering and my brain racing as we crest the ridge to see the \ntarget straight ahead.\n\nAs I push the rifle into position and Chris slips in the magazine I realise that everything I managed to do on the \nrange now feels almost impossible. I can't get the scope into position to see through it; sweat is pouring into my \neye. As I finally see light through the scope I can't find the damn deer. I breathe deeper and try to calm my nerves. \nThe shape comes into view more by luck than judgment and I begin the procedure of cocking the rifle, placing my \nfinger correctly on the trigger and counting breaths. There's a suppressed crack and the job is done.\n\nWe stand next to the target and examine the shot. Chris is pleased that it was clean, though a little high and left for \nperfection - a result of misjudged range and too sudden a pull at the trigger. I, on the other hand, am suddenly \nshaking.\n\nThe target, about the size of a large dog, has been accurately hit - I remembered most of what I'd been taught - but \nit felt like I'd taken a couple of minutes to sort myself out before pulling the trigger. A plywood shape is hard enough \nto hit but a real animal moves unpredictably and suddenly, and all the gory conversation over lunch comes into \nsobering perspective. Missing an animal would be humiliating and frustrating but an inaccurate hit would be \ncatastrophic. The responsibility of making that single shot count has become very real. I talk to Chris about my \nworries.\n\n\"I'm really glad you're getting it,\" he says. \"It's a huge responsibility and there are lots of unpredictable factors. \nEveryone who hunts will take a bad shot at some point but you train so you minimise that chance. A good shooter \n\n\n\nwho makes a bad shot will go straight back to the range and practise for hours before they consider going out \nagain.\"\n\nAs the sun begins to sink we set off in search of real game. I am secretly relieved at the absence of deer. I might \nhave the philosophy squared away to my satisfaction but I'm not sure my technical skills are up to the job. The \nresponsibility for taking a bad shot while under stress is beginning to weigh heavily then, quite suddenly, Chris \nspots rabbit at a distance I can barely perceive. You, like me, may have seen them in glorious abundance on \nmotorway verges, oblivious to us, but this is not how they behave in their natural environment. Unused to cars and \npeople and wary of predators from foxes to red kites, they occasionally pop up from their warrens but will bolt back \nunderground at the sight or smell of a human.\n\nThe choice of the rifle suddenly makes sense - you'd never get close enough with a shotgun. For this reason I'm \nunprepared for a half-kilometre speed-hike, uphill and upwind of the two rabbits, the long and agonising crawl over \nwet, thistly, broken ground and a final slither downwards, amply lubricated by more sheep droppings, on to a ridge \nabove the rabbits.\n\nAgain, it takes a while to settle myself and this time the targets are smaller and moving. Chris is at my shoulder, \nwhispering quietly. \"Left hand one. Wait till it turns sideways on. Brace the stock with your free hand.\"\n\n\"I've lost it.\"\n\n\"Breathe ... and find it again. Wait ... wait ... \"\n\nAs I squeeze the shot, I blink. The bullet makes an odd, drum-like sound but I can see nothing through the scope.\n\n\"Reload. Move right,\" says Chris. \"Take the second one.\"\n\nThe second rabbit is clear in the sight now and I feel suddenly confident - too confident. The shot kicks up dust an \ninch behind its tail. The rabbit seems unperturbed.\n\n\"Reload ... \"\n\nI reload and fire the four rounds remaining in the magazine, unerringly grouping them an inch behind the rabbit's \ntail. Once again the incorrect positioning of my trigger finger is dragging the rifle far enough offline to make a \ndifference. At this range and on a small target, it's enough to spare the rabbit, which looks calmly around and \ndisappears down its burrow before we can consider reloading.\n\nAs we scramble down the bank I'm surprised to find the first rabbit. A mercifully accurate shot. It's lying entirely \nplacid with eyes wide open. There's a tiny entry wound exactly on the line and a slightly larger exit on the opposite \nside of its neck. \"That noise [was] the shockwave as the bullet hits,\" says Chris. \"An instant kill.\"\n\nWe gut and skin in the field, the messy yet oddly intimate process that somehow translates the rabbit from creature \nto meat. We head home and soon I'm back on more familiar territory, the butchery at the farm shop where we bone \nthe rabbit and wrap the saddle around the chopped and seasoned leg meat to make a simple ballotine. It is literally \na handful of meat and obtaining it from a live animal has been a two-day process - probably the most labour-\nintensive method imaginable. Yet, as I had hoped, every step has made me think more about what my decision to \neat meat has meant.

He poured a can of \nCoca-Cola into a glass of cumin, black pepper and lemon juice to make an Indian masala coke. \"Can you start to \nimagine what that tastes like?\" he asked.\n\nMr McMillon, head of Walmart's international business, needed a guinea pig: \"Where is Mike Duke?\" he asked. \n\"Mike, c'mere.\" Mr Duke, his boss and Walmart's chief executive, came forward, took a long slurp, and declared \n\"fantastic\" - unconvincingly. As he returned to his seat, Mr McMillon said: \"You know that taste you have in your \nmouth right now? That taste is gonna be there for about 48 hours.\" The audience of Walmart employees burst into \nlaughter.\n\nThe moment was typical of Mr McMillon, who is renowned as a soft-spoken southern charmer - but one with a hard \nedge. That day he came across like a precocious teenager having fun at the expense of his ponderous father. Now \nit is time for him to take over the family shop. Walmart said this week that Mr McMillon would become its chief \nexecutive on February 1.\n\nThe 47-year-old is very much a child of Walmart, where he has worked for nearly three decades, schooled in the \nfolksy yet ruthless ways of its founder Sam Walton. He grew up in Walmart's home state of Arkansas and is a \nfavourite of the children of \"Mr Sam\". Their near 50 per cent stake in Walmart gives them the final say on big \ndecisions at head office in Bentonville, as well as a $130bn fortune.\n\nMr McMillon will be taking over a business that, with sales of $469bn last year, ranks as the world's biggest \ncompany, but he will inherit a raft of challenges. Walmart has been too slow to change in the US, where its sales \nare falling, and too hasty overseas, where he has increased annual revenues by nearly $37bn but made mistakes in \na rush to expand in China and Brazil. He is also likely to be in charge at the conclusion of a corruption probe that \nbegan with bribery allegations in Mexico but has extended to Brazil, China and India.\n\nMr McMillon first worked for Walmart as a teenage warehouse hand in the summer of 1984. He met his wife Shelley \nat another summer job at the Bank of Bentonville. In 1990, while he was studying for his MBA at the University of \nTulsa in Oklahoma, he rejoined Walmart as a trainee buyer at store 894.\n\nRobert Morris, a friend at the time, recalls winning a church basketball tournament with Mr McMillon. \"He was \nliterally one of those guys everyone liked. He had it all. He was good looking, good at sports, he was smart, he had \ngreat work ethic,\" he says. \"All the guys loved him and all the girls loved him too.\"\n\nMr McMillon moved to Walmart headquarters in 1991. Arriving then, the year before Mr Walton died when he was \nstill chairman, gave him first-hand Mr Sam stories that Mr Duke, a later arrival, never had. On his first day, Mr \nMcMillon found a note on his desk complaining that fishing line at Kmart was cheaper than Walmart's. He handed it \nto his boss, who reacted with horror: \"This is from Sam Walton. Have you fixed it?\" The lesson, according to Mr \nMcMillon, was to pay attention to detail and act with urgency.\n\nHe rose through the ranks mostly as a merchant picking Walmart products. Then in 2006 he took charge of Sam's \nClub, Walmart's buy-in-bulk warehouse store, before becoming chief of its international business in 2009.\n\nMike Cockrell, a former executive who worked for him in India, says that Mr McMillon set about visiting the most \nimportant markets - and brought his wife and two sons. \"It sort of humanised him in all of the countries. And it gave \nhis family a good understanding of what his job was. The reason he's going to be gone a lot.\"\n\nOn the job Mr McMillon is deliberate and decisive, Mr Cockrell adds. \"He's got high standards for people that work \nwith him or around him. He's got a very low tolerance for people who make errors - and that is a Walmart thing. He'll \nallow you to fail once. You don't want to make the same mistake twice.\"\n\nWalmart's critics say it underpays its staff, a charge the retailer rejects. John Marshall of the United Food and \nCommercial Workers union says: \"The jury is out on Doug McMillon.\" The optimistic view is that he will do things \n\n\n\ndifferently. \"The cynical view is that the choice of McMillon, who has been the heir apparent for many years, \nrepresents a continuation of Bentonville's rigidly anti-worker philosophy.\"\n\nCameron Smith, a Bentonville headhunter who works with Walmart and its suppliers, says Mr McMillon is one of the \nfew genuine \"keepers of the culture\". That moniker is often applied to Don Soderquist, an executive who became \nMr Walton's standard bearer (and wrote that he founded the company on \"principles found in the Bible\"). When Mr \nSmith shared a table with both men this year, he says, \"I reached over and snapped a picture because I thought, \nwow, this is past and future\".\n\nLeslie Dach, who stepped down this year as a Walmart executive, says you can believe in the culture and also push \nfor modernisation. He stresses that Mr McMillon has done both. Analysts say Walmart needs to change in the US \nbecause its giant Supercenters are getting old as shoppers turn to convenience stores and ecommerce. In several \nemerging markets, Walmart is yet to crack the right combination of pricing, products, store design and location.\n\nAt this year's annual meeting, Mr McMillon had his boss performing again. Calling Mr Duke on stage, he said: \n\"We've never seen him demonstrate his athletic ability.\" He had brought a set of football goalposts guarded by a \nBrazilian keeper and wanted Mr Duke to take a penalty kick. Mr Duke had other ideas, bringing in a ringer to take \nthe shot. \"That's not right,\" Mr McMillon complained. Mr Duke's stand-in missed the goal, blazing the ball high over \nthe bar (he was English). Sam Walton's children need Mr McMillon to be a surer shot.\n\nThe writer is US retail correspondent\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Last year I agreed to \nhumiliate myself beyond belief by appearing on Christmas University Challenge. This year, surely, it would not be \npossible to show myself up still further. But indeed it was. My manager, a Prominent Theatrical Agent, suggested \nthat I participate in the Christmas series of Come Dine with Me. Why ever not?, I thought.\n\nA confession. When I agreed to do the programme, I had never seen it. I still hadn't seen it when we started filming. \nFor those of you similarly unacquainted with the show, the format is a competition that runs over five nights. \nContestants take turns to dine at each other's homes. Each evening is then scored, taking in the food, the \nhospitality and any entertainment. The prize is a \u00a31,000 donation to charity, which seems to me worthy of effort.\n\nBesides, how difficult could it be? A few evenings - albeit ones requiring a different camera-friendly outfit each night \n- of going to people's houses for dinner plus a day at home cooking, followed by an evening entertaining people I \nmight otherwise never have met.\n\nOnce I had signed up, I started to reflect on what I had taken on. You do not learn who your fellow guests are until \nthe first dinner. I knew that the others would be drawn from the world of entertainment and sport and that there was \na good chance that I - someone who would always choose The Economist over Hello! - might not recognise some \nof them. I also knew that guests usually arrive with a gift for the host. But what to give someone you have never \nmet?\n\nMy first concern when I embarked on the project was that four total strangers and a TV crew were going to be \nvisiting my house. Naturally, we started Operation Clean-up: how is it that I have accumulated so much stuff? \n\"Stuff\" just appears everywhere - it seems almost to breed. I really admire people who manage not only clean-desk \npolicies but clean-house policies; alas, I am not one of them.\n\nMy second concern was what I was going to cook. I almost never don an apron these days: Mr M is the Chef \nLaureate. Could I possibly outsource the cooking to him or to the pub next door? No, I could not.\n\nMy fellow contestants were Rebecca Adlington, the Olympic gold medallist swimmer, Jennifer Ellison, the actress \nand singer, Alex Carter, the soap actor and radio presenter, and the very handsome Rav Wilding, a former \npoliceman in Peckham who now presents crime and action shows.\n\n\n\nAt times, I felt like I had landed from Mars. Four out of five of us had Wikipedia entries; I was not one of them. Four \nout of five of us left school at 16; I was not one of them. Four out of five of us did not have a PAYE job; I was not \none of them. Three out of five of us had a tattoo; I was not one of them.\n\nThe others were also very familiar with celebrity reality shows: Ellison had won Hell's Kitchen in 2004 and made the \nquarter finals of last year's Dancing On Ice; Wilding was in Strictly Come Dancing in 2009 and won 71 Degrees \nNorth in 2011; and Adlington went almost straight from my dining room to Australia to take part in I'm a Celebrity . . . \nGet Me Out of Here! I am old enough to be the mother of every one of them, just. But we all got on really well and in \nmy companions I recognised the energy, work ethic and enthusiasm for life that I have myself.\n\nI cooked venison, a seasonal favourite of mine. Who won? You will have to tune in to find out; the show will \nprobably go out the week before Christmas. But I won't be watching: our family will be in Australia, celebrating my \nmother-in-law's 80th birthday. This will be just as scary as Come Dine with Me, presenting yet another occasion for \nwhich one must buy a special present and dress up for a dinner. I may well be in for another humiliation - but at \nleast it won't be on national TV.\n\nmrsmoneypenny@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The $270m IceCube facility at the South Pole has started to detect high-energy \ncosmic neutrinos - subatomic particles that reach Earth from deep space.\n\nOrdinary telescopes look at incoming photons (light particles) at various wavelengths, from radio through visible to \nX-rays and gamma rays. IceCube, however, sees neutrinos, which stream across the universe in unimaginable \nquantities but are extremely hard to detect because, unlike photons, they hardly ever interact with ordinary matter. \nThey carry no electric charge and very little mass.\n\nThe US-led IceCube consortium chose the inhospitable polar location to maximise the chance of observing cosmic \nneutrinos. They melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and \n2,000m beneath the surface.\n\nAlthough trillions of neutrinos travel unscathed through the observatory every second, a precious few arrive at \nexactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. This collision generates electrically charged particles which radiate \nlight that is picked up by the detectors. Then computers calculate the energy and incoming direction of the neutrino \nfrom the pattern and intensity of the light emitted.\n\n(A similar method, with detectors buried in deep mines rather than Antarctic ice, is being used - so far without \nsuccess - to identify the more elusive particles of \"dark matter\" that pervade the universe, according to \ncosmologists' confident predictions.)\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt; In a paper in Science last week, the IceCube team said that they had detected 28 high-energy neutrinos \ncoming from beyond the solar system over two years. Lower-energy neutrinos reach us in vast numbers from the \nsun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth's upper atmosphere.\n\nThese 28 neutrinos are too small a sample to derive any conclusions about what produced them, but whatever it is \nmust generate staggeringly high energies. Two of the detected neutrinos had more energy than a fly in flight, \npacked into a single subatomic particle.Likely sources include supernovae - exploding stars - and material being \nsucked into huge black holes.\n\nmailto:mrsmoneypenny@ft.com\n\n\nThe great advantage of neutrinos as astronomers' probes is that they travel in absolutely straight lines from their \nsource without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. They escape more readily than photons \nfrom, say, the core of a supernova.\n\n\"It is gratifying to finally see what we have been looking for,\" says Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin and \nIceCube principal investigator. \"This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy.\"\n\n. . .\n\nResurrection plants: designed to survive\n\nThe plant-breeding industry is making a big effort to develop crop varieties that are more tolerant of drought - \nthrough both conventional techniques and genetic manipulation. Few modifications would do more to extend world \nagriculture than enabling crops to grow in really dry conditions.\n\nFor Jill Farrant, professor of plant physiology at the University of Cape Town, the answer lies in \"resurrection \nplants\". Most plants die when they lose 10 to 45 per cent of the water in their tissues; resurrection plants can \nsurvive for years with 95 per cent water loss and then spring back to life within a day or two of rehydration.\n\n\"Only about 350 plants - 0.1 per cent of the total number of species in the world - can tolerate extreme water loss \nand then revive on rehydration, and 90 per cent of them occur in southern Africa,\" says Farrant.\n\nResurrection plants are not edible, however. \"Their leaves are very bitter,\" says Farrant. \"No animals will eat them.\" \nSo she is investigating the molecular and systems biology of resurrection plants with a view to using them as a \nsource of genes to transfer to staple crops such as maize.\n\nResurrection plants switch on a series of specific genes to protect their tissues as they dry out. Normal plants have \nsome similar genes but these are only active in their seeds, which can often survive desiccation for many years.\n\n\"Resurrection plants shut down photosynthesis and curl up their leaves to minimise exposure to light,\" Farrant says. \n\"They also make sunblocking pigments to protect themselves. With maize, I want to increase the amount of \nsunblock pigments in the leaves, but it would not be feasible to make maize fold its leaves in drought.\"\n\n. . .\n\nNew light on Michelangelo\n\nThe five million tourists who crowd into the Sistine Chapel every year to see Michelangelo's ceiling will have a far \nbetter view from next February - the 450th anniversary of the artist's death - when the Vatican switches on a new \nlighting system to match the illumination to the paintings.\n\nThe current lighting system, based on 1980s technology, has conventional spotlights and halogen projectors fitted \nwith plastic covers to absorb ultraviolet light that might damage the paint. This bathes much of the ceiling in a low-\ncontrast twilight that fails to bring out the colours in Michelangelo's masterpiece.\n\nThe replacement LED (light emitting diode) system will enable visitors \"to experience the art in a completely new \ndiversity of colour\", says Osram, the German lighting company that developed it in collaboration with European \nuniversities and with EU research funding. Light levels will be 10 times higher than today - 50-100 lux rather than 5-\n10 lux - while both energy consumption and ultraviolet radiation levels will be cut.\n\nThe 7,000 individual LEDs have a spectrum that is tuned to suit Michelangelo's paint pigments, which were \nanalysed by colour experts at Pannonian University in Hungary. The artist is believed to have mixed his colours in \ndaylight rather than by candlelight or torchlight.\n\n. . .\n\nPredicting height through DNA\n\n\n\nForensic scientists are gradually gathering data to help determine the physical appearance of unknown criminals \nfrom genetic material left behind at a crime scene. A study in the Netherlands shows that scientists can now predict \nwith reasonable accuracy whether someone is tall on the basis of DNA alone.\n\nThe researchers looked at 180 DNA variants associated with height in a Dutch population sample including 770 \nvery tall people and 9,000 normal controls. Predicting height on the basis of these genes gave an accuracy of 0.75 \non a scale from 0.5 (random prediction) to 1.0 (complete accuracy).\n\n\"The achieved accuracy is approaching practical relevance   in paediatrics and forensics,\" the scientists conclude in \na paper in the journal Human Genetics. Although forensics may be the main application of the work, paediatricians \nwould also benefit from a genetic test that would predict the adult height of infants with parents of abnormal stature, \nto help decide whether to administer hormone treatment.\n\nManfred Kayser of Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the study leader, says: \"Although the achieved \nDNA-based prediction accuracy for tall stature is still somewhat lower than we previously established for eye colour, \nhair colour and age, I expect that upcoming new knowledge on height genetics will further increase the accuracy in \npredicting tall stature, and eventually the full range of body height, from DNA.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The men, who are being tried by a jury at the Old Bailey, deny the charges against \nthem.\n\nProsecutor Richard Whittam QC, opening the case, told the court that \"the circumstances of his death are \nshocking\".\n\nThe court was shown graphic CCTV footage of the moment the men's car allegedly mowed down the soldier. It was \nlater shown clips of his body in the middle of the road. Some of Rigby's relatives left the courtroom close to tears as \nthe footage was played.\n\nThe jury was told that on May 22, the two defendants drove a Vauxhall Tigra car straight at Rigby as he walked \nacross the road in civilian clothes, wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie top and carrying a camouflage backpack.\n\nMr Whittam told the jury the two men then got out of the car armed with a meat cleaver and knives and attacked the \nmotionless body of the soldier. He was \"repeatedly stabbed\" and the prosecutor claimed it appeared that \"Michael \nAdebolajo made a serious and almost successful attempt to decapitate him with multiple blows to his neck made \nwith the meat cleaver\".\n\nAt the same time as Mr Adebolajo used the meat cleaver, Mr Adebowale was using a knife to stab and cut at \nRigby's body, Mr Whittam alleged.\n\nThe prosecutor told the court that one witness, Gary Perkins, had described the actions as being \"like a butcher \nattacking a joint of meat\".\n\nAnother witness, Thomas Seymour, described that he believed one man \"was trying to cut the victim's head off\", Mr \nWhittam recounted.\n\nHe added that Amanda Bailey, another witness, had told how the driver of the car \"repeatedly hacked at the right \nside of his neck just below the jaw line\".\n\nThe court heard that the two men dragged Rigby's body into the road because they wanted members of the public \nto see what they had done.\n\nThe jury was also shown footage of Mr Adebolajo with bloodied hands, who could be heard saying: \"The only \nreason why we've killed this man today, is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.\"\n\nA letter containing religious references was also handed by Mr Adebolajo to one woman at the scene.\n\n\n\nThe jury was told that members of the public behaved with \"bravery and decency\" and one woman tried to stroke \nthe lifeless body of the soldier \"to provide some comfort and humanity to what had unfolded\".\n\nThe suspects then moved towards a police car as it arrived at the scene, which was within yards of a primary \nschool, prosecutors said.\n\nMr Adebolajo and Mr Adebowale both deny one count of murder and one of conspiracy to murder a police officer. \nThey also face a charge of attempted murder of a police officer, which they also deny.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

I should be clear at this point that \nthere is nothing wrong with Uncle Cyril or any of the sundry \"aunts and uncles\" that comprised the key members of \nthat universally recognisable group, the old friends of your parents.\n\nThese so-called aunts and uncles were probably no more than 40 when I became aware of them but they were \nunarguably part of a different era. Naturally they were all at my wedding, where they sat with the other oldies at the \noldies' table, until halfway through the evening the band struck up some oldies' music and all of them suddenly got \nup and danced in an oldie way.\n\nAnyway, last weekend marked my evolution as I enjoyed my first wedding as an oldie - the precise definition being \nsomeone about whose presence the happy couple are utterly indifferent, part of the crowd that at least one of them \nrefers to as the \"hangers-on\". To be fair, there is a second cousin-ish bond between the bride and my wife but, \nfundamentally, we were in the \"friends of my parents\" cohort. It was, I should say, a lovely, warm, joyful affair but \nwe were distinctly aware that, as people began to coalesce into groups, we were in the one that knew none of the \ncouple's friends. As to the groom, I'm fairly sure that he would still struggle to pick me out in a police line-up.\n\nAdmittedly the boundaries between the generations have slipped enough for the divide to be less marked than it \nwas at my own wedding. For one thing, a key facet of being in the oldie crowd is demonstrating that you are still \nyoung enough not to be. In fact, now that I think about it, showing you are still young enough has been a feature of \na number of recent parties. You have the 50th birthday parties where everyone pretends they are still 40, and 40th \nbirthday parties where everyone pretends they are still 20. The latter are often themed evenings - Seventies or \nEighties nights, where everyone tries to squeeze into the kind of clothes they were wearing 20 years earlier. (Who \nknew flares were so comfortable?) Happily, I can still attend fancy-dress parties as one of the Blues Brothers; it's \njust that there is no longer any pretending I'm the Dan Aykroyd character.\n\nBut at least at these events we are all in the same boat. It is different at weddings. The cool kids do not want to be \nin the way when a herd of middle-aged relatives stampede on to the floor to dance Gangnam-style. You see the \nteens and twentysomethings melting away to smirk by the bar. At least the oldies of my youth could dance. They \nknew how to jive and swing. We only know comedy dances and how to make the letters of the YMCA. On the \nupside, however, it clearly alarms the spawn; the boy has already begun asking us to refuse invitations to \nreceptions that he is attending.\n\nStill, the hosts at the wedding were nothing if not considerate and did their best to cater for us. There can surely be \nno other explanation for why the band suddenly launched into Dire Straits' \"Walk of Life\" - a fine song but not one \nyou expect to find on any self-respecting millennial's playlist.\n\nThere are worse fates at weddings, however. At least we were not on the miscellaneous table, among the disparate \ngroup of guests who are not part of any particular crowd and who open all conversations with \"So how do you know \n?\"\n\nOf course, there will be weddings of closer relatives where we are on less of an outer ring. But standing at the bar \non Sunday night happily singing along to a song recorded before either of the couple was even born, I recognised \n\n\n\nthat I had indisputably passed one more milestone on the journey towards decrepitude. I have hit the level at which \nyou remain until you are so old that your mere presence is a minor miracle and you are singled out in the groom's \nspeech for a special mention just by dint of not yet being dead. You may be ancient, wheelchair-bound and afflicted \nwith umpteen complaints but at least you are relevant.

And I'm going to miss it. \nAnd then she will go off somewhere and kill herself.\" My colleague used to be a surgeon. \"I could sit on an \nabdominal pain [ie wait and see], and feel confident I was right: this was appendicitis, this probably wasn't, this \nneeded a little more time to evolve. And if you were in doubt, you could always give them a Swann-Morton scan \n[Swann-Morton is a Sheffield manufacturer of surgical tools: this is local slang for performing an operation]. But with \nmental health I just can't get a feel for how much danger they're in.\"\n\nThere are obvious pathways to diagnosis: history, examination, investigation. But softer skills are also vital. You \nmust be able to recognise when something is serious. This apparently intuitive gift is often just the ability to \nsummarise the facts and apply them to the appearance of the patient: the so-called \"end of the bed test\". You can \ntell your colleagues \"he doesn't look right\" and everyone knows exactly what you mean. With experience you learn \nto identify the sick, or those in danger of becoming sicker. But what kind of informed glance can we give our \ndepressed patients at an appointment lasting just a few minutes?\n\nIn Britain, GPs train by rotating through a mixture of jobs in general practice and hospital specialities. There is no \nset roster of posts; and the hospitals must meet their staffing needs, which influences the jobs you are given. You \nmay or may not do a rotation in obstetrics, or paediatrics, or ENT. And it is easily possible to qualify without ever \nhaving held a psychiatric post - your experience of serious psychiatric illness may well be limited to a few weeks' \ninternship at medical school. Nice states that one in three GP consultations has a mental-health element and 90 \nper cent of mental-health problems are treated in primary care. When you start consulting in this unfamiliar field you \ncan feel like a cat without whiskers.\n\nWhich is why you need to become comfortable with the tools, even if some of them are blunt. You need to know \nwhat to ask, and how to phrase it, and how to react to the reply. And you must find out if your patient is thinking of \nhurting himself or herself, by saying something like, \"Do you have any thoughts about harming yourself?\"\n\nThe first time you ask this, the question seems to hang between you. \"I shouldn't have said that,\" your non-medical \nbrain thinks. You feel sick with nerves. Not only have you infringed a taboo, the private space of someone's \nanguish, but also you worry that you've given them an idea. After a few years of consultation, it becomes \ninconceivable that you wouldn't ask. Where else can someone confide? And how can they tell you anything - \nespecially something so painful - if you don't give them the explicit space in which to do it, or take away the stigma \nby offering the thought first? The question is there in the PHQ-9 (the questionnaire GPs use to monitor the severity \nof depression - usually unfeelingly administered by handing the patient a printout and asking them to tick off their \nresponses). Avoiding painful topics is bad practice, not to mention medicolegally indefensible. Making things better \nis a whole other subject.\n\nSophie Harrison is a hospital doctor in South Yorkshire\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The \nexperience of giving a speech is radically different from the experience of listening to one. An adrenalin-drenched \n\nmailto:robert.shrimsley@ft.com\n\n\nemotional rollercoaster for a nervous speaker may nevertheless be unbearably tedious for the listeners. A superbly \nhoned performance may produce a sense of suspense, surprise and delight for the audience; the result of many \nhours of rehearsal and repetition for the speaker. Yet it can be very hard indeed for the speaker to know what \nworked and what didn't.\n\nAudience comments aren't much help, either. People are polite, and they know that giving a speech is difficult, so a \nhandshake and a \"well done\" could mean anything from \"you moved me to tears\" to \"you bored me to tears\". A \nspeaker can float through talk after talk in a warm bath of gently encouraging remarks.\n\nOn this particular day, though, I was in for less of a warm bath, more of a bracing shower. The Geoffrey Boycott of \npersonal financial advisers was in the audience - a tall Yorkshireman with lots of unvarnished opinions that he felt \nduty-bound to share with me in the lobby afterwards.\n\n\"For a start, I kept wanting to offer you my tie. Next time, wear one. And your shoes - I notice things like that.\" He \ngestured towards my evidently-slightly-too-comfortable footwear.\n\n\"But that's not what I wanted to tell you,\" he continued. I waited, a little bemused. \"Your first slide, instead of just \ntelling us that it was John Maynard Keynes, you could have asked, 'Does anyone know who this is? Anyone?' It just \ngets your audience a bit more involved. I teach public speaking, you see.\"\n\nI nodded and thanked him for the suggestion but the flow of comments was relentless. \"Don't get me wrong, I liked \nit. But then, what you could have done, was   \"\n\nAs a piece of rhetorical advice, it was too much \"public speaking for beginners\" to take entirely seriously. But the \nconversation was an absolute masterclass in how to give feedback: arresting, friendly, frank - and above all \nspecific. My self-appointed speaking coach had identified a set of particular points he wanted done differently, and \nlisted them clearly, with reasons, examples and the occasional word of encouragement.\n\nSuch feedback is standard in certain environments - Olympic coaches, editors on deadline and school teachers all \nprovide focused constructive feedback if they're any good. But it is rare for criticism to be quite so practical: it's \nusually vague and verging on flattery or cruelty.\n\nAn alternative is the \"praise sandwich\", a thin but chewy sliver of specific feedback, squeezed between two thick, \ndoughy slabs of praise. This seems like a common sense way to combine criticism with kindness, but it is not \nalways helpful. The economist Richard Thaler once posited the idea that we practise \"hedonic editing\" - lumping \ntogether good and bad news to make ourselves feel better. (An example: why fret that I lost my wallet, when my \nhouse gained thousands of pounds in value just this month?) Hedonic editing allows us to take the rough with the \nsmooth; but that makes it a dangerous way to process critical comments. It helps us feel better but it doesn't help \nus perform better.\n\nYet there's no use blaming the critics for being too vague: they're vague because they know that specific criticism is \nnot always welcome. I have taken to seeking out specific suggestions for improvement, when I can muster the \ncourage.\n\nIt's draining to ask for such comments. It is also difficult to provide them: if you ask people to think hard about \nsomething you should have done differently, they will often be lost for words. But there are certain, glorious \nexceptions. If they don't buttonhole you in the lobby, they're worth seeking out.\n\n'The Undercover Economist Strikes Back', by Tim Harford, is published by Little, Brown\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

What are your plans to revive the economy and were you shocked by the state of economy when you \ntook office?\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani: This government has inherited serious economic problems. Although we witness both \n[economic] stagnation and inflation in the country, we are very hopeful about the future of the country's economy. \nThis is not only my view. My economic team holds a similar view that we can tackle economic problems within a \nshort period of time.\n\nThe reason for our hope is that we have been able to curb the fast growth of inflation to some extent over the past \nthree months. I think [point-to-point] inflation has gone down from 43 per cent to 36 per cent. This is a good sign \nand we will continue this path through two ways of curbing liquidity and improving the business atmosphere.\n\nOn the recession, the economic growth rate in 1391 [the Iranian year that ended on March 20 2013] was minus 5.8 \nper cent, which we will try to pull up to zero by the end of Esfand [the Iranian month that ends on March 20 2014]. In \nthe next [Iranian] year, the economic team has predicted positive growth. Meanwhile, the Geneva [nuclear] \nagreement has created a positive atmosphere in the economic field and this atmosphere will further improve with \nthe implementation of the agreement.\n\nFT: Does your forecast depend on the lifting of economic sanctions and how important is it for the Iranian economy \nfor sanctions to be lifted?\n\nHR: No. If you go through my [economic] report, you see that under the existing sanctions we have managed to \nlower inflation. Under the existing sanctions, we have predicted that our economic growth rate will be positive next \n[Iranian] year. But at the same time if sanctions are lifted or eased, we can naturally see its impacts on the \neconomy.\n\nFT: The interim nuclear deal is very important for mutual trust between Iran and the rest of the world. What can Iran \ndo to reassure people in Washington and Congress that you really want a deal, you don't want to build nuclear \nweapons? And do you have a red line when it comes to the size of the low-level uranium enrichment programme?\n\nHR: The nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran as has been repeatedly said will be purely for peaceful \npurposes. The reason is that all our nuclear activities are under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. As you know, all our nuclear sites are being constantly inspected with IAEA cameras. And as a matter of \nprinciple, our doctrine has no room for weapons of mass destruction. How much we will expand [uranium] \nenrichment or as you put it how big the size is going to be will depend on our needs for nuclear fuel.\n\n\n\nYou know that we have completed other parts in Iran to make fuel rods and with the plan that we have given to the \nIAEA, almost from now on whatever [uranium] is enriched will be converted into fuel rods for the [Tehran Research] \nReactor.\n\nFT: Is dismantling nuclear facilities in Iran a red line for your government?\n\nHR: 100 per cent.\n\nFT: Obviously this will depend on the future agreement but can you envisage a resumption of bilateral relations with \nAmerica? Is Iran politically and psychologically ready for such a move? And we shouldn't forget Britain, the smaller \nfish.\n\nHR: Regarding the US, we need to decrease tensions at this stage and create mutual trust step by step. The \nproblems created over 35 years cannot be resolved over a limited time. The best test to see whether we are \ncapable of building trust or not is this nuclear issue.\n\nIf the first steps taken in Geneva are implemented carefully and precisely, it would mean that we have taken one \nstep forwards towards trust. What I witnessed in New York was a bit of change in the atmosphere compared with \nthe past. I felt in my meetings with intellectuals, university professors and [members of] think-tanks that the \n[presidential] election has had a lot of impacts.\n\nBut as for \"the small fish\" you mentioned, the situation is very different. We have had relations with the British \ngovernment that were hugely downgraded under certain conditions.\n\nAfter [Iran's presidential] election, some steps to improve ties have been taken. In my telephone conversation with \nMr [David] Cameron last week, I had a feeling that the two sides were willing to move step by step towards better \nrelations.\n\nFT: Are you ready perhaps in the future to invite President Obama to Tehran? What do you make of him in terms of \na political reformer figure?\n\nHR: In our telephone conversation [in September], I found him to be someone with very polite and smart language. \nAs I said earlier, Iran-US problems are very complicated and cannot be resolved over a short period of time. \nDespite the complications, there has been an opening over the past 100 days, which can later widen.\n\nFT: The nuclear talks are a touchstone and mutual trust is building. Also, your election signalled a change. But \nthere are sceptics in countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia and conservatives in Washington and in Congress \nwho say we are still very worried about Iran's presence in Syria, its support of Hizbollah. How far can you build trust \nwhen you still have those problems, when there is mistrust over Iran's foreign policy?\n\nHR: On Syria, a major concern is the presence of terrorist groups on Syrian soil. This should worry all [countries]. I \nbasically consider the continuation of the bloodshed and civil war in Syria to be against the region's stability. For \nthis reason, I am currently in negotiations with regional and western countries over the future of Syria. We are doing \nour best to help put an end to the civil war in Syria and for all terrorists to leave Syria. This will depend on the \nnegotiations between the Syrian government and the opposition to pave the way for holding free elections. \nWhatever the Syrian people wish for in the election, we all have to surrender to.\n\nFT: Are you involved quietly in negotiations with the Americans and with western powers regarding Syria?\n\nHR: Not with the US. But [we are in talks] with Europeans. If Iran participates in the Geneva II talks [a forthcoming \npeace conference on Syria], it will naturally talk to all members who will be present there.\n\nFT: You are said to be a natural optimist. But you have to be pretty optimistic if you think Bashar al-Assad is going \nto step down from power in a free and fair election.\n\n\n\nHR: I am not an optimist, but I am not a pessimist, either. I cannot predict the future of Syria. But the ground should \nbe prepared for the people's decision. If people do not vote for Mr Assad, it is fine. Whoever people choose, we will \nbow to people's choice.\n\nFT: Are you talking to Saudi Arabia regarding Syria in order to contain this conflict and prepare the ground for a \nsettlement?\n\nHR: We are not in negotiations now. But we have no problem to negotiate with Saudi Arabia or any other country. \nWe have had various and close negotiations with the UN special envoy [on Syria], Lakhdar Brahimi. He was in \nTehran a couple of days ago and we met. We have close relations and hold negotiations with the UN over the \nfuture of Syria.\n\nFT: You won a decisive victory in June partly with the support of reformists. Do you share their view that it needs to \nbe political reform in Iran or are you merely focused on economic efficiency and better relations with the west and \nyour neighbours?\n\nHR: Obviously economic problems and foreign policy are important but these would not stop us from thinking about \ncultural issues and domestic politics. As I promised during the election [campaign], I am seeking to devise a civil \nrights charter. With the end of 100 days in office, I put up a draft of the charter on the [president's official] website \nyesterday so experts can comment on it. I will complete this charter after receiving the views of intellectuals and \nexperts and will present it to the society and will pursue its enforcement. So, this government cannot be bound only \nto economic and foreign policies.\n\nFT: There's a lot of relief over the nuclear deal and also impatience for change, impatience also at why some \npolitical leaders are in jail. Do you feel strong enough in the near future to release [Mir-Hossein] Moussavi and \n[Mehdi] Karroubi?\n\nHR: Some issues in the country need consensus of other branches and officials. My government is trying to \nimplement its duties in this regard. Of course not within 100 days. More time is needed for such consensus. You \ncalled me an optimist. At least in this case, I am optimistic.\n\nFT: When?\n\nHR: I said I am not a forecaster but I am optimistic.\n\nFT: Can the FT assume that on its next visit to Tehran, it can tweet like you and the supreme leader and other very \nimportant people in this country?\n\nHR: You can do it even now.\n\nIt should be no problem. It will be resolved sooner than your previous question.\n\nFT: Where do you want to see the country at the end of your first term?\n\nHR: The Islamic Republic of Iran at the end of these four years will be in much better condition economically, with \nregard to regional influence, culturally and politically at home. We have already seen the signs of progress in all \nthese fields during the past 100 days.\n\nFT: One Iranian says it is wonderful that Iran has moved from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance in three months.\n\nHR: I do not agree with such terms. But people's dynamism and cheerfulness during this period have been rising \nsignificantly.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

But when he spoke to the Financial Times this week, Mr \nRouhani had capped his 100 days in office with the first signs of improvement in an economy ravaged by sanctions \nand the monumental mismanagement of the outgoing administration led by the populist Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad.\n\nMost significant was his 99th day, when he delivered the six-month nuclear agreement with world powers, the first \neasing of tensions with the west in a decade. The deal offered modest relief from punishing international sanctions \nin return for Iran's suspension of the most controversial parts of its nuclear programme.\n\nMr Rouhani, an experienced technocrat with a doctoral degree from Glasgow Caledonian University, is breathing a \nsigh of relief. So is a beleaguered nation of 75m people, weary from the bellicose authoritarianism of its leadership \nand the pressures from western powers suspicious that Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear programme is intended \nto produce nuclear weapons.\n\nOne of Mr Rouhani's most troubling discoveries upon taking office was to find the treasury empty. Astonishingly, \nIran earned $600bn in oil revenues over the past eight years, more than its total accumulation since oil was \ndiscovered more than a century ago. The economy, however, was on the verge of collapse.\n\n\"This government has inherited serious economic problems,\" begins the president, seated under a picture of the \ntwo Ayatollahs who cast a long shadow over Iran - the late Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the 1979 Islamic \nRevolution, and Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader to whom Mr Rouhani answers. \"But we are very hopeful about \nthe future of the country's economy . . . The nuclear deal has created a positive atmosphere.\"\n\nSince his June election, Mr Rouhani's emphasis on the economy and engagement with the world has begun to \nchange international perceptions of Iran and shift the mood at home.\n\nHe has moved quickly to bring back veteran professionals and experienced diplomats, many of whom were \nmarginalised or purged by the previous Ahmadi-Nejad administration.\n\nYet in Tehran and capitals around the world, Mr Rouhani's intentions are still being tested. The verdict has yet to be \ndelivered on whether his charm offensive is an attempt by Iran to secure temporary relief from international \npressure or a signal of a strategic shift in the behaviour of the Islamic regime.\n\nThe question on everyone's lips: is Hassan Rouhani for real?\n\nThe man\n\nMr Rouhani comes across as personable and engaging, a man who appears to understand the depth and scope of \nchange required in Iran but also mindful of making promises that are beyond his ability to deliver.\n\nHe is forceful and resolute when he speaks of Iran's red lines in negotiations that will now proceed to find a \npermanent solution to the nuclear programme. Demands in Israel and the US Congress for Iran to dismantle its \nnuclear facilities meet with firm and swift rejection. No, \"100 per cent,\" he says.\n\nAsked how he could have a Twitter account (and a very active one) when the site is one of many that are blocked in \nIran, he deflects the question with humour.\n\n\"You can do it even now,\" he tells his visitors, as the hall packed with aides erupts into laughter. Then, shifting to a \nserious tone, he suggests that this is the kind of problem that he should be able to resolve soon.\n\n\n\nA regime insider whose experience has largely been in the security and diplomatic establishments, Mr Rouhani is \nmore technocrat than cleric. He makes little reference to religion and is said to be particularly fond of studying \nstatistics tables.\n\nHe belongs to the conservatives' pragmatic wing that considers diplomatic engagement rather than confrontation \nessential to the survival of the Islamic Republic.\n\nHe is, however, something of an accidental president. Some people who know him suspect he ran in the June \nelection to raise his political profile, rather than because he believed he would win.\n\nIt was only after his mentor and ally, the influential Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was barred from the race that he \nbecame a serious contender.\n\nThe reformist opposition, determined to claim back the presidency it was denied in 2009,  allied with Mr Rafsanjani \nand threw its weight behind the centrist Mr Rouhani in the final days of the campaign. He won an outright victory in \nthe first round.\n\nSo surprising was the Rouhani triumph that a story making the rounds in Tehran (though it is not clear if it is fact or \nlegend) has it that at 2am after the election, hundreds of Revolutionary Guards surrounded Mr Rouhani's residence \nin northern Tehran. He stepped out to meet them unsure whether their presence was designed as protection or a \nprelude to his arrest.\n\nPart religious authoritarianism, part democracy, Iran's political system needs elections to shore up its legitimacy. \nBut as Iranians discovered in the 2009 flawed presidential vote, even this limited democratic participation is not \nguaranteed to reflect the people's choice.\n\nThe pressures\n\nMr Rouhani faces a delicate balancing act to fulfil the social and economic expectations of Iranians and satisfy the \ndemands of the outside world. He is conscious that he must tread carefully at home, referring obliquely more than \nonce during the interview to other centres of power.\n\nIf Mr Rouhani has put so much emphasis during his first three months on foreign policy, it is probably because \nsuccess can help him consolidate the authority of the presidency and, most importantly, revive the economy.\n\nFor now, the president has secured the support of the supreme leader, the most powerful figure in Iran's theocracy. \nAyatollah Khamenei is backing the nuclear negotiations and the economic reforms. Perpetuating this consensus \nbetween the two men, however, depends on whether Mr Rouhani can deliver an acceptable final nuclear deal and \nbring an end to sanctions.\n\nObtaining a lifting of sanctions, however, requires satisfying a very different constituency - western powers whose \nrestrictions have shut Iran out of the global financial system (between $50bn and $100bn of Iran's foreign exchange \nholdings are frozen) and slashed its oil exports by more than half.\n\nOne of the toughest elements in the negotiations will be the size of the low-level uranium enrichment programme \nIran will maintain. The west will want it small; Iran will want it to be as large as possible.\n\nThe president says the size should be determined by Iran's domestic needs for nuclear power - a remark that \nsuggests scale but still leaves some room for negotiation.\n\nMr Rouhani, however, is not waiting for the end of sanctions to wage economic battle. The government, he says, \nhas started to restrict the money supply, reduce inflation and reverse the economic decline.\n\nAmong its most egregious actions, the Ahmadi-Nejad administration used Iran's central bank as a piggy bank, \nordering it to dole out loans that had little chance of being repaid. Now the central bank has been freed from political \n\n\n\npressure, and half-completed provincial projects - another hallmark of the former president's misguided populism - \nare being cancelled.\n\nMr Rouhani's team predicts Iran will emerge from recession in the next fiscal year beginning in April.\n\nThe hope\n\nNuclear talks have served another important purpose: to pave the way for a potential historic shift in relations \nbetween the US and Iran after decades of hostility.\n\n\"Death to America\" graffiti is still prominently splashed on facades in the Iranian capital and the slogan is chanted at \nrallies. But perhaps because of the resolutely anti-American attitude of the regime, the Iranian public is ready, if not \neager, to mend ties with America.\n\nSo are Washington and Tehran tiptoeing towards a resumption of bilateral relations? Mr Rouhani chooses his \nwords cautiously. The nuclear negotiations, he says, are allowing the two sides to \"test\" whether they are capable \nof having a different relationship.\n\n\"Problems of 35 years cannot be resolved in a short period of time. We need to decrease tensions at this stage and \ncreate mutual trust step by step,\" he says. \"If the steps taken in [the interim nuclear deal agreed in] Geneva are \nimplemented carefully and precisely, it would mean that we have taken one step forward towards trust.\"\n\nHe dodges a question on whether he might invite Barack Obama to Tehran at some stage, but does not dismiss the \nsuggestion outright. He tells the FT about his impressions of the US president, based on the now famous telephone \nexchange during Mr Rouhani's recent trip to the UN in New York.\n\n\"I found him someone with very polite and smart language,\" he says. \"The problems with the US are very \ncomplicated . . . but despite the complexities there has been an opening over the past 100 days which can later \nwiden.\"\n\nThe suspicion\n\nAs Mr Rouhani engages in a confidence-building exercise with western powers, however, Iran's aggressive regional \npolicies continue to fuel suspicions, particularly with Arab neighbours. Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two regional \nheavyweights, are fighting a proxy war in Syria, backing opposing sides in the civil war financially and militarily.\n\nAs president, Mr Rouhani can influence regional policy. But far more powerful are the hardline military elements in \nthe regime, especially the elite Revolutionary Guard and its al-Quds force.\n\nMr Rouhani says he is talking to European governments about Syria and is willing to hold broader negotiations if his \ncountry takes part in a peace conference scheduled for January (whether Iran will be invited to the talks in Geneva \nis still unclear).\n\nHe points to common concerns with the west in Syria, not least the growing strength of Sunni extremists among the \nrebels. Iran's solution, he says, is free and fair elections. \"Whatever Syrian people wish for in the election, we all \nhave to surrender to.\"\n\nWhen the FT suggests that the president must be very optimistic to believe that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad \nwould abandon power, Mr Rouhani says he is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, acknowledging that he cannot \npredict the future of Syria.\n\nThe difficult balance\n\nMr Rouhani is seen as a leader in search of economic efficiency rather than the vastly more controversial political \nchange sought by reformists.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the president rejects this assumption, insisting that economic and political reform must be pursued with \nequal vigour. \"Obviously economic problems and foreign policy are important but these would not stop us from \nthinking about cultural issues and domestic politics,\" he says.\n\nIranians sceptical of his promise for change, however, point to the continued imprisonment of the leaders of the \nopposition Green movement, Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Moussavi. The movement was brutally repressed \nfollowing the 2009 unrest sparked by the alleged rigging of the presidential vote against Mr Moussavi.\n\nMr Rouhani says his government is trying to \"implement its duties\" towards the two men, but cannot resolve the \nproblem within 100 days. \"Some issues in this country need consensus of other branches and officials. More time is \nneeded for such consensus. But in this case I am optimistic.\"\n\nMr Rouhani appears to have a strategy and - so far at least - the critical support of Ayatollah Khamenei who is \nmuting hardline factions' criticism of nuclear diplomacy.\n\nBut just as he desperately needed an interim deal to strengthen his hand at home, Mr Rouhani also needs western \nreassurance of the benefits of confidence building. His aides warn that another burst of US Congressional \nsanctions, for example, would not only destroy Mr Rouhani's efforts to restore trust with America, but damage his \ncredibility at home.\n\nThe past week has produced a rare moment of hope. It has also highlighted that, within Iran and without, many now \nhave a stake in keeping a smile on Mr Rouhani's face.\n\nThe prize of a nuclear weapons-free and prosperous Iran and a more stable Middle East is enormous - but the \nprocess of getting there is also exceedingly fragile.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He said the negotiations were \"the best test\" of whether trust could be restored between the \nUS and Iran.\n\nRecalling his telephone conversation with President Barack Obama during Mr Rouhani's recent visit to the UN in \nNew York, he said: \"I found him someone with very polite and smart language\".\n\n\"Iran-US problems are very complicated and cannot be resolved over a short period of time. Despite the \ncomplications, there has been an opening over the past 100 days, which can widen later,\" he said.\n\nThe US and Iran broke diplomatic relations after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nThe nuclear deal has started to shift the mood of despair in Iran, where an oil-rich economy has been ruined by the \npopulist policies of the predecessor administration of Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, as well as by crippling US and \nEuropean financial and oil sanctions.\n\n\n\nMr Rouhani's comments contrast with the views of many in the US Congress who believe that a final-stage deal \nwould need to include the closure of the Fordow enrichment facility, built beneath a mountain, and the Arak heavy \nwater reactor, which could be used to manufacture plutonium.\n\nA US Senate aide said of the Iranian president's remarks: \"This is precisely the sort of comment that is going to \nmake some people in Congress very nervous.\"\n\nAlthough the interim agreement says the US will not impose new nuclear-related sanctions during the next stage of \ntalks, there is strong support in Congress for the introduction of further measures that would take effect if the \nnegotiations collapsed.\n\nRobert Menendez, a senior Democrat and chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, said on Thursday \nthat such an approach would allow the Obama administration to say to Tehran: \"Hey look, this is what's coming if \nyou don't strike a deal.\"\n\nIn the interview at his presidential palace, Mr Rouhani said the removal of sanctions would help his team's \neconomic efforts, but much could be achieved before a lifting of the restrictions through more efficient management.\n\n\"If you go through my programme, you will see that under the existing sanctions we have managed to lower the \ninflation. Under the existing sanctions we have predicted that our economic growth rate will be positive [in the next \nIranian fiscal year],\" he said. \"But, at the same time, if sanctions are lifted or eased, we can naturally see its impact \non the economy.\"\n\nThe interim nuclear deal freezes Tehran's atomic advances in return for a modest relief in sanctions. Iran and world \npowers are seeking to complete a comprehensive agreement in the next six months. The deal is expected to \ninclude further and more permanent curbs on Iran's programme and tough monitoring to ensure that no nuclear \nmaterial is diverted to weapons use.\n\nAmong the most contentious issues will be the size of any low-level uranium enrichment facilities that Iran will be \nallowed to keep, and the fate of some of the plants that pose the greatest worry. Mr Rouhani said the size of the \nnuclear programme should be determined by his country's energy needs.\n\nIn the US, Mr Menendez has been openly critical of the interim agreement. \"We basically have the Iranians running \nin place,\" he told the NPR network. \"We are going to roll back some of our sanctions, but they are rolling back \nnothing.\"\n\nHe said the White House had been guilty of \"fear-mongering\" when it suggested that those who supported new \nsanctions were engaging in a \"march to war\".\n\nHarry Reid, the Senate majority leader, has said the chamber will \"take a look\" at the proposal for new sanctions \nwhen Congress returns on December 9. But he has been vague about whether he will allow sanctions legislation to \nproceed.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

These two DVDs underline the shift.\n\nCelibidache had a deeper philosophy of life: he thought more about music, was less interested in worldly wealth \nand placed greater emphasis on sharing his knowledge. Bus\u00e9's film probes Celibidache's background, career and \nideas, drawing on documentary evidence as well as interviews with family, students and admirers, including Daniel \n\n\n\nBarenboim. It is the best attempt yet to explain who this mysterious, uncompromising, guru-like figure was, and why \nhe had such an influence on those with whom he came into contact.\n\nCatapulted in 1945 from obscurity to the principal conductorship of the Berlin Philharmonic, \"Celi\" was later passed \nover in favour of Karajan, and spent much of his time thereafter conducting radio orchestras - the only ones that \nwould put up with his stubbornness and extravagant rehearsal demands.\n\nWhereas Schmidt-Garre focuses exclusively on the conductor in his dotage, with footage from a single rehearsal \nsequence in 1991, Bus\u00e9's documentary is sprinkled with clips from all periods of Celi's life, capturing his \nphenomenal knowledge, charisma and obsession with musical detail. It also communicates the belief, central to \nCeli's nomadic life and work, that music is about the relationship between end and beginning, now and eternity. \"At \nthe end I am where I was at the start, but at the same time I have undergone a transformation.\"\n\nSergiu Celibidache\n\nFirebrand and philosopher\n\nA film by Norbert Bus\u00e9\n\n(Arthaus Musik)\n\nCelibidache rehearses\n\nBruckner's Ninth Symphony\n\nDirected by Jan Schmidt-Garre\n\n(Arthaus Musik)\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But the city was growing tense as anger mounted over President Viktor \nYanukovich's failure to sign an integration deal with the EU at a summit in Lithuania.\n\nHeavyset, allegedly pro-government youths - some armed with steel bars - had also appeared in the city centre. \nWitnesses said some youths had beaten up two journalists, and clashed with anti-government protesters.\n\n\n\nThese demonstrations differ in important respects from the 2004 uprising, when as many as 1m thronged downtown \nKiev. The biggest crowd this time has been the more than 100,000 last Sunday.\n\nUnlike the well-planned 2004 protests over a rigged ballot, which had initially handed victory to Mr Yanukovich, \nthese rallies have been largely spontaneous, sparked by social media, and have caught Ukraine's political \nopposition unprepared.\n\n\"Many people came with high hopes but it's not clear what to do now,\" said Halyna Oliynyk, a 50-year-old Kiev \nmuseum employee. \"There is a void in organisation and leadership. The politicians were sidelined by grassroots \nactivists and students, but in my view they now need to lead the people forward.\"\n\nAs the Vilnius summit ended on Friday, EU leaders sought to turn up the pressure by rebuking Russia in unusually \nblunt terms for pressurising Mr Yanukovich.\n\n\"Actions taken by Russia [towards] Eastern Partnership countries are incompatible with how international relations \nshould function on our continent in the 21st century,\" said Herman Van Rompuy, European Council president, \nadding that Moscow's actions breached international treaties giving sovereign countries the right to \"freely define \nrelations\" with other states.\n\nMr Yanukovich, meanwhile, said that Brussels had failed to take \"decisive steps\" to deliver a \"programme of \nfinancial-economic aid\" to help Kiev deal with a severe cash crunch and offset Russian trade retaliation.\n\nIn Kiev, the protests have been hampered by the fact that Ukraine's political opposition is fragmented and lacking \nfigures with the popularity of Viktor Yushchenko and charisma of Yulia Tymoshenko, the Orange Revolution \nleaders.\n\nMr Yushchenko, who became president after the revolution, is no longer a political player after a presidency that \nfailed to deliver on protesters' hopes. Ms Tymoshenko, who lost to Mr Yanukovich in 2010 presidential elections \ndeemed to be generally fair, was imprisoned in 2011 on abuse of office charges that many Ukrainians and EU \nleaders believe were politically motivated.\n\nThere are fears Mr Yanukovich's government may be more prepared to crush mass protests than the administration \nof departing president Leonid Kuchma was in 2004. Presidential allies have bussed in supporters for rival pro-\ngovernment rallies, including one earlier on Friday at which many participants openly admitted they had been paid \nto attend.\n\nAnti-government protesters were on Friday uncertain of how to go forward. Gathering in street underpasses, caf\u00e9s \nor huddling around oil barrels used as heaters to keep warm amid freezing rain and sleet, they sang Ukrainian folk \nand patriotic songs to lift spirits.\n\n\"There are two views,\" said one protest organiser, who asked to remain anonymous. \"To dissolve the protests for \nnow, coming back later in larger numbers, or the radical scenario - to stay on the streets, putting more pressure on \nMr Yanukovich, calling for snap presidential and parliamentary elections, blocking government buildings or even - in \ntheory - toppling his regime . . . If we muster crowds of 300,000, some think we can achieve this.\"\n\nA decision this week by university students to strike has kindled hopes that large numbers could be mustered.\n\nThere were also nascent signs that anger at Mr Yanukovich was bringing together one-time opponents. Vitali \nKlitschko, the world heavyweight boxing champion who is now Ukraine's most popular politician, and Arseny \nYatseniuk, leader of Ms Tymoshenko's party, sat with others at a joint news conference in Vilnius earlier on Friday \nand declared they were united.\n\nLeading opposition figures have suggested, however, their main focus is to try and force Mr Yanukovich from power \nnot in the streets but at the ballot box in a presidential election due in spring 2015.\n\n\n\nValentyn Strasser, a 50-year-old programmer taking part in the protests, said young Ukrainians needed time to \norganise before the presidential poll.\n\n\"The president is a bandit and it is clear his ruling regime will not give up power democratically,\" he said. \"We need \na revolution to push his ruling regime aside.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

No, not the December holiday season, but the rainy season in Iraq, which lasts \nfrom about now until March, during which the dust storms that plague low altitude air operations, and any other \nrotating precision machinery, are at least partly dampened.\n\nFrom Tel Nof to Tehran, young people are looking intently at the bright lights of their battle management system \ndisplays.\n\nWhile the world's diplomats and headline writers are celebrating the possibility of peace among men, or at least \nbetween the western allies and Iran, not every person in the financial markets seems to be quite so optimistic.\n\nYou will recall how interested we've been in Alliant Techsystems (ATK), the monopoly supplier of various high \ntechnology munitions to the US military and certain of its allies. With stagnant or even declining sales, indifferent \nearnings, and threats of government shutdowns, ATK wouldn't look like a high growth stock, and yet there it is: up \nfrom $49 or so a bit over a year ago to more than $120 today, just as if they'd invented a new social network. I think \nit is more likely some believe ATK could benefit from reorders of its products to destroy certain social networks.\n\nStill, the diplomats say peace with Iran is on the way. And the six months that temporary sanctions relief has bought \nfor the slowdown of the country's nuclear programme overlap not coincidentally with the rainy season. After March, \nany sustained attack on Iran through Iraqi airspace would be far more problematic. Yet, as if in rebuke to the \noptimistic headlines, ATK's stock hit new highs this past month.\n\nThere is also another season coming up: the renewal of reinsurance contracts that starts at the beginning of \nJanuary. The reinsurance companies have had the prices of coverage for catastrophic risks pushed down by what \ndid not happen this year past: any major hurricanes hitting the US coast, or earthquakes shaking California or \nJapan.\n\nAlso, the capital bases of the reinsurers and their parent companies had very few losses on the credit product in \ntheir books, and liquidity that continued to be underwritten by the Bernanke/Yellen Fed.\n\nWhen the new coverage year begins next month, the reinsurers can expect weak pricing. The question is how \nmuch of the market share of the $250bn world catastrophe market will be skimmed off by \"nontraditional\" capital, \nsuch as buyers of three- to five-year catastrophe bonds issued to the market, or one-year privately placed fully \ncollateralised catastrophe contracts placed more discreetly with private holders.\n\nAt this point, the nontraditional suppliers of catastrophe coverage have taken about a $45bn share of the trade, and \nthose who track the market's progress, such as Swiss Re, believe that cut will grow at a sustainable, though not \nhyperbolic, pace.\n\nEven for next year, the alternative reinsurance providers are expected to continue to be concentrated on \nprospectively underinsured perils such as \"US wind\", or hurricanes from the Hamptons to the Florida Keys. The \nquestion is how far beyond these \"modelable\" risks the nontraditional reinsurers will venture.\n\nSome of us think the alternative providers are the thin end of a wedge that will transform the bureaucratised and \ningrown global insurance business. John Seo, with his brother, manages Fermat, a Connecticut-managed but Irish-\ndomiciled Ucits cat bond fund, which, along with other accounts, adds up to more than $4bn in assets.\n\n\n\nMr Seo has not just money, but a theory. \"The global reinsurance industry has acted a lot like AT&T [the US \ntelephone company] before its 1984 break-up. It was a so-called natural monopoly to provide universal coverage \nand service. That meant implicitly the good business subsidises the bad. The underwriting profit has been coming \nfrom the catastrophe business, just like AT&T made all their money from long distance calls. The insurance industry \ndoesn't realise how their industry is being restructured by insurance-linked securities.\"\n\nThe securitised, cash or Treasury-collateralised coverage offered by the ILS market, is really limited to risks that are \n\"modelable\" and \"granular\". If you want coverage for movie stars' failing to show up, or Godzilla attacks, or drugs \nthat work the wrong way, you have to go back to the specialists at Lloyds. But models and measures improve over \ntime. When I first used a mobile phone in 1982, no one thought there would be more than two providers in any \nAmerican market.\n\n\"It's a Marmite strategy, ILS,\" says Alasdair MacDonald, of pension consultants Towers Watson. \"You either like it \nor loathe it. Since the risks are not correlated with other markets, it really does add diversification.\" One problem, he \nsays, is that \"You can really struggle with measuring alpha [investment managers' skill] in this area, since it is so \nleft-tailed [all the risks are to the unlikely downside].\"\n\nHas the tsunami of alternative capital that has flooded the reinsurance business compressed returns to an \nunattractive point? \"It's a good question,\" says Ryan Bisch, the head of Mercer's alternatives advisory business in \nCanada. \"On an absolute basis, yes, spreads have come down, but the returns still look better than for, say, some \ncredit classes.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He has served almost half his life in parliament \nand is regarded in trade circles as an unpredictable and occasionally charmless opponent.\n\nAnother failure for the WTO in Bali could put India in the uncomfortable position of repeat offender. Mr Nath was \nblamed by many for scuppering talks in Geneva in 2008 and an earlier attempt to reach a deal in Hong Kong in \n2005.\n\nMr Sharma appears to have neither the political clout at home nor the wiliness in negotiations abroad to match Mr \nNath. EU officials, for example, have been baffled by his stop-start attempts to negotiate an EU-India trade \nagreement, which has failed to materialise after six years of discussions.\n\nBut he has built a record as a sharp-tongued spokesman for the government on economic matters.\n\nEarlier this month he accused Goldman Sachs of interfering in Indian politics after it upgraded its assessment of the \neconomy on expectations that Narendra Modi, the opposition leader, would win next year's general election.\n\n\"Goldman is parading its ignorance about the basic facts of the Indian economy, and it also exposes its eagerness \nto mess around with India's domestic politics,\" he told The Economic Times.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Mr Sharma acknowledged there was a \"stalemate\" in trade talks in advance of the Bali meeting. But he \ninsisted that India had been \"seriously and sincerely engaged in the negotiations\" and enjoyed the support of other \ndeveloping nations on key issues at stake.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Chief among those is India's demand - affirmed at a cabinet meeting in New Delhi on Thursday - for a \"peace \nclause\", intended to give another four years to negotiators to come up with new WTO rules for farm subsidies and \nthe prices paid for staples bought as part of government programmes to supply food to the poor.\n\nOther participants have accused India of backing down from an agreement struck earlier in November over that \npeace clause and thereby putting at risk a broader deal that would set about removing red tape at borders around \nthe world and, advocates claim, add as must as $1tn to international trade.\n\nThe food security issue is of particular concern to India. The parliament in New Delhi last summer passed a bill \npushed by the Congress-led government that expanded cheap food programmes for the poor to cover 70 per cent \nof India's 1.3bn population.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Sharma rejected the accusations that India had misled anyone by initially accepting and then \nrejecting the \"peace clause\". The government was now seeking a ceasefire that would automatically be extended \nuntil a permanent solution to the issue was crafted.\n\n\"India's final position\" would become clear in Bali, he said. But India was \"very clear\" that any interim solution would \nhave to last \"until a permanent solution is put in place\", and that it expected everyone \"to commit to negotiate all \nissues for a permanent solution\".\n\n&lt;&gt;The embattled Congress party is due to face national elections by May and state ballots in Delhi and \nRajasthan next week, and Mr Sharma has in recent weeks couched his stand in the WTO as a matter of national \nsovereignty. \"As far as what we give to our poor people that is our right,\" he said on Friday. \"That is a sovereign \nspace and for India it is sacrosanct and non-negotiable.\"\n\nFarm groups and leftwing parties have urged Mr Sharma to take a tough stand.\n\nBut there are also fears elsewhere within India that, were it to block a deal in Bali, the government would be \nshooting itself in the foot. Many in the trade world and in Indian business see next week's meeting as a last-ditch \nattempt to restore credibility to the WTO in the face of growing US interest in regional agreements over multilateral \nones.\n\n\"Anand Sharma is under a lot of political pressure at home,\" said Pradeep Mehta of the Consumer Unity and Trust \nSociety think-tank. But \"a No deal in Bali will be terribly sad and India is walking into a trap\", he said. \"India needs \nthe WTO - as do a lot of developing countries.\"\n\nIn a carefully worded statement, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said that it \nrecognised the importance of food security as an issue for the country. But \"if Bali fails to deliver, then it will weaken \nthe multilateralism and the credibility of the WTO as an institution\", said Naina Lal Kidwai, its president. \"Failure in \nBali would be very disappointing.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Her former husband has now saved her the trouble.\n\nYou \"poisoned your child with drugs and trashed your life\", Charles Saatchi wrote in a now-public email, accusing \nher of being \"off her head\" for much of their 10-year marriage.\n\nIt is rare for someone who, like Mr Saatchi, has spent three decades in advertising to be \"completely astonished\" by \ncocaine use.\n\nIt is even more remarkable given that he and Ms Lawson are witnesses for the same side in the criminal \nprosecution of their personal assistants for fraud totalling \u00a3685,000.\n\nThe lasting impact of his words may be to add his ex-wife to the list of celebrities who floated close to perfection, \nonly to find themselves in need of redemption.\n\n\"Nigella is having a Kate Moss moment,\" says Hamish Pringle, author of Celebrity Sells, referring to the supermodel \nonce photographed snorting cocaine.\n\n\"[She] will come out the other side even more in demand, but only if she's not convicted of a crime.\"\n\nMs Lawson has yet to comment on the allegations, other than to tweet a Holiday Hotcake recipe to thank her \ngrowing number of Twitter followers (a few responded with jokes about cold turkey this Christmas).\n\nIn her favour is her continuing popularity; even Mr Saatchi told the court on Friday that he still \"adore[s]\" her.\n\nThere are also the stories of Ms Moss, US television personality Martha Stewart, footballer David Beckham and \ngolfer Tiger Woods, all of whom have recovered from indiscretions to restore at least part of their commercial \npulling power.\n\n\"If a brand's been around for a long time, the public has quite a large amount of forgiveness,\" said Vince Mitchell, a \nprofessor at Cass Business School. \"It can afford to cock up.\"\n\nThe difference with Ms Lawson is that her brand is relatively narrow.\n\nUnlike Kate Moss and Tiger Woods, she has no sponsors to offend. In the past year her commercial activities have \nbeen limited to filming The Taste, a reality TV show in the UK and US, and selling her own range of kitchenware.\n\nBy comparison, fellow chef Jamie Oliver has invested in his own YouTube channel, signed licensing deals with \nsupermarkets in Australia and Canada, and opened half a dozen restaurants from St Petersburg to Perth.\n\nNigella has no book in the pipeline; Jamie has a contract to write four.\n\nThe other distinguishing feature is that her image as a domestic goddess - which she once described as \"obviously \nironic\" - is built around indulgence.\n\n\"She's not Delia Smith. The brand is not a religious Christian who's also a demon cook,\" said Andrew Franklin, the \nfounder of publishers Profile Books.\n\n\"But she can only come back it if she can make it on television.\"\n\nOf immediate concern is the US, which Ms Lawson has struggled to crack over the past decade, and where The \nTaste's first series on ABC garnered meagre ratings.\n\nShe is thought to earn more from a single series of the programme than the \u00a3650,000 sum her personal assistants \nallegedly stole from her and Mr Saatchi in four years. They deny the charges.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear whether she will continue to remain silent, like Mr Woods who initially ignored allegations about his \nprivate life before an orchestrated, teary apology.\n\n\"That silence was very damaging to him,\" says Mr Pringle. \"In the absence of a mea culpa, the rumour mill \ncontinues to churn.\"\n\nFor the once reclusive Mr Saatchi, who was cautioned after a domestic violence incident in June, redemption may \nbe less of a concern.\n\n\"I don't think he cares what people think,\" says Mr Pringle. \"He never has.\"\n\nMartha Stewart\n\n\"This is a victory for the little guys,\" said one juror, after convicting Martha Stewart of obstructing justice in 2004. Yet \nMs Stewart kept up her domestic goddess persona in jail - \"That place was sparkling when I left\" - then launched a \nTV comeback. She is now back chairing the company she founded.\n\nKate Moss\n\nThe supermodel went from heroin chic to cocaine rehab in 2005, after incriminating photos appeared. She was \ndropped by sponsors H&M - whose chairman supports an anti-drug charity - but the publicity meant she soon \nearned twice as much from other brands. She will receive a special award at next week's British Fashion Awards.\n\nTiger Woods\n\nMr Woods has not won a major golf title since driving into a fire hydrant in 2009 and confessing to multiple affairs. \nYet he is the world number one, and has new sponsors including Rolex. \"His brand is about excellence,\" says Vince \nMitchell of Cass Business School. \"Being faithful is not core to that job.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Americans are in the middle of the annual process of counting their blessings \nas the year begins to wind down.\n\nFollowing tradition, President Barack Obama wrote a proclamation calling on his compatriots to give thanks. There \nis irony in this, after 12 bad political months for him. After winning an election in which inequality was a decisive \nissue, it has been a great year for the wealth of those Americans who were already wealthy, and particularly those \namong the richest \"1 per cent\".\n\nThose invested in US stocks, up more than 30 per cent in 12 months, should be thankful. And what can they thank \nfor their good fortune? Here is a list of happy surprises from the last 12 months:\n\n- The US did not fall over the fiscal cliff 2013 started amid Washington intrigue over looming automatic tax rises and \nspending cuts. In the end, swingeing automatic cuts were administered through the \"sequester\", while tax rises for \nthe wealthy went through - but it did not feel like falling off a cliff.\n\n- The US did not default on its debt Nine months into the year there was another case of political brinkmanship, \nwhich ended with a decisive defeat for the Tea Party-backed Republicans who had pushed it. The president is \nunpopular, but there was no public support for the use of a threat to force a default on US sovereign debt as a \npolitical weapon.\n\n- The eurozone avoided another crisis And it did so despite ample opportunity. The response to the Cyprus crisis in \nMarch, when an attempt was made to impose losses on insured bank deposits, was badly botched. There is \nongoing political turmoil in Italy. Yet sovereign debt markets remain calm, and there are even signs that the region's \neconomy is moving towards a (weak) recovery.\n\n\n\n- China's economy kept on the rails The bubble in China's real estate did not burst. Growth, according to official \ndata, stayed on track. And this month, the Communist party even surprised with a more ambitious reform agenda \nthan most had anticipated.\n\n- The west did not escalate its involvement in the Middle East Many Syrians might not feel very thankful for this, but \nfor markets, it was a bullet dodged. Broad-based western intervention in the region would, as always, have been \npacked with risk and uncertainty.\n\n- Iran's relations with the rest of the world improved Iran and the risk that either it successfully built a nuclear bomb, \nor Israel were provoked into attacking it to avert this, has been at the top of \"risk lists\" for a decade. The negotiated \nagreement to freeze Iran's nuclear programme, while controversial, is great news for geopolitical risk. Oil, as \nmeasured by Brent Crude, is the same price now as it was last Thanksgiving, almost to the penny.\n\n- Japan opted for Abenomics Japan's incredibly aggressive monetary policy sank the yen, but did wonders for the \nstock market (up 70 per cent since last Thanksgiving, and now at a closing high for the year). A resurgent \nJapanese economy would have a big impact on the rest of the world.\n\n- Inflation stayed under control Expectations for US inflation, after a brief move upwards, are now comfortably lower \nthan they were last Thanksgiving. Low inflation is almost always reason for savers to be thankful - although in this \ncase it implies the risk of deflation (note significant falls for industrial metals and agricultural goods in the last year), \nso the good news is not unadulterated. Gold investors, who have lost almost 30 per cent over the past year as \ninflation fears eased, may not be too thankful either.\n\n- Emerging markets averted a crisis In August, there appeared to be a real risk of an old-fashioned emerging \nmarkets crisis as the currencies of countries with significant current account deficits tumbled in the wake of higher \nrates in the US. But the Fed stepped back from reducing its stimulus to markets, and there was a partial recovery. \nIndia's rupee shed 21 per cent against the dollar at one point; now it is off only 13 per cent over 12 months.\n\n- Turkey Appropriately on Thanksgiving, Turkey has reason for thanks. Its currency has been hit in the last year, \nand the yield on its bonds has risen, reflecting international concern. Yet its stocks are up almost 10 per cent in \nlocal currency terms.\n\nThis is quite a list. But the fear remains that investors are most thankful for the Fed, and its decision to keep up its \nQE bond purchases. From last Thanksgiving until the Fed started talking of tapering off QE in May, the S&P 500 \nrose 22 per cent. Since the Fed opted not to taper in September, it is up 6 per cent. It was flat from May to \nSeptember.\n\nWe should be thankful for much genuine good fortune. But the valuations on offer in the current dizzying US stock \nmarket suggest that this has turned into a justification for misplaced optimism.\n\nWe should count the blessings of the last year. But there is reason to worry about the future.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

London house prices fell 31 per cent between 1989 and 1992; and \nwhile prices did not fall in the early 2000s, a much bigger boom elsewhere narrowed the gap with the capital.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, the capital's house prices recovered much faster than elsewhere, led by the prime central \nLondon market that had the advantages of foreign demand and cash buyers who do not need mortgages.\n\nBetting against London prices has proved a mug's game for most of the past 40 years, with the exception of the \ncrash in the early 1990s recession. It is after all, a vibrant capital city with severe limits on new home building.\n\nBut with the prime market slowing down and capital gains tax about to be levied on foreign owners, the Bank of \nEngland withdrawing some supports from the mortgage market and the gap with the rest of the country so large, an \nimportant question is what could set the London property market back in the style of the 1990s.\n\nSentiment turns\n\nBubbles burst. To the extent that home buyers in London have been rushing to purchase, for fear of further price \nrises, a change in expectation of future gains would have a radical effect. Those wanting to purchase property \nwould be willing to wait, while owners would want to offload their stock as quickly as possible. With a change in \nsentiment, prices can turn very quickly.\n\nAlthough there are straws in the wind in prime central London and in properties over \u00a32m, prices in the rest of the \ncapital are still rising fast, but Liam Bailey, head of global residential research at Knight Frank, says there are \nnatural limits even for the plushest homes. \"In the long term, price growth above earnings growth isn't sustainable \nand even central London can't expect the performance [of the past four years] to continue\".\n\nThe City becomes unattractive\n\nAsk bankers in the City of London what keeps them up at night and withdrawal from the EU will be high on the list.\n\nGiven a referendum on membership may happen after the 2015 election, it is worth asking what a serious setback \nto the City's status as Europe's financial capital would do to house prices.\n\nThe last financial crash took its toll on prime central London property, with residential values dropping 24 per cent \nbetween March 2008 and 2009 before staging a comeback.\n\nAnother reason foreign investors might tire of London is if the city starts to burst at the seams. Dick Sorabji, director \nof policy at London Councils, the umbrella group for the city's 33 boroughs, said: \"If we fail to keep up with the \ninfrastructure needs of 100,000 more Londoners every year, as the projections suggest . . . that will slow the \ngrowth and damage the city. But I think investors will keep coming.\"\n\nGovernment policies\n\nEstate agents operating at the most expensive end of the London market have noticed the weakest area is now for \nso-called \"mansions\" above \u00a32m, which have been subject to 7 per cent stamp duty since April 2012.\n\nIf that tax on transactions is having an effect, there are many other threats from government policies that could \ncause prices to slip.\n\nAn annual \"mansion tax\" would exacerbate that effect, reducing prices without making London's prime homes any \nmore affordable.\n\n\n\nFor the bulk of London property, what is happening in the prime market is largely irrelevant, but a revaluation of \nCouncil Tax bands, the imposition of capital gains tax on foreign ownership of property, further action from the BoE, \nor a revolution in house building could pull the rug out from under the whole market.\n\nA sterling crisis\n\nLondon property has been described as the new reserve currency for a global elite - but like any cross border \ninvestment, it is at the mercy of exchange rates.\n\nWere the pound to fall rapidly, the values of foreign property purchases in London could be hit, which could cause a \nstampede for the exit.\n\nBut a currency crisis is a double-edged sword.\n\nThe pound's slide from 2007 to 2009 - combined with falling house prices - enabled foreigners to snap up \n\"bargains\" in London: 50 per cent cheaper in dollar terms in the space of a year and as much as 60 per cent less to \nsomeone financing a purchase in yen.\n\nThis prompted a surge in overseas buyers in the prime central London market.\n\nExperts say the risks of foreign capital flight require vigilance. Andrew Heywood, consultant and editor of Housing \nFinance International said: \"We need to shape that [foreign] investment but avoid doing so in a way that causes an \nabrupt collapse, which would feed into falling house prices, negative equity, collapse of development and damage \nto the affordable homes programme through the potential impact on cross subsidy of affordable housing.\"\n\nAffordability\n\nUltimately, living in London could become too expensive for \"ordinary\" families and companies, particularly if the \nBoE raises interest rates causing a sudden reversal in London property prices.\n\nEvidence is mounting that the high cost of living in the capital is causing more residents to slide into poverty, \ndefined as having an income less than 60 per cent of the national median.\n\nThis is particularly marked for London's working poor. Over the ten years to 2011-12, the number of people in in-\nwork poverty increased by 440,000, according to data from the Trust for London, a charity.\n\nForeign money pouring into the capital has exacerbated that trend by raising the cost of living and any sudden \nwithdrawal could also be highly damaging.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Money would be scarce, and prices would fall \ndramatically. Authorities might try to lift prices but they would lack one of their most powerful tools. Central bankers \ncan create money at will, by printing notes or creating deposits. Bitcoin is based on digital tokens, which are \ngenerated at an unalterable rate by cryptographic algorithms running on the computers of volunteers, making it \nimpossible to match supply to demand.\n\nThis is an improbable fantasy. But Bitcoin's undulating value makes it unsuitable for all but the most limited \npurposes. Speculators are the keenest acquirers of the currency. For some, it is a way of stashing wealth where \nauthorities cannot find it. Others want to make purchases without leaving an obvious trace. Silk Road, the online \ncontraband emporium that was closed by authorities last month, was one of the few businesses to insist on \npayment in Bitcoin. But many prices were pegged to the dollar; the virtual money served merely as a way of \ndisguising the flow of hard currency.\n\n\n\nStill, if Bitcoin's applications are limited, its emergence as a workable means of exchange nonetheless reveals \nsomething surprising. Friedrich Hayek argued that the government should cede its monopoly over the money \nsupply, leaving consumers free to choose between competing currencies. It turns out that they were already freer \nthan they thought. Authorities have so far tolerated the virtual currency. Yet the product of the state-owned \nincumbent has proved more attractive than Hayek expected.\n\nThe experiment is an indication of how monetary systems might change in future. Many believed it impossible to \ncreate a form of electronic cash that did not rely on a bank to keep tabs on account balances. Bitcoin proved them \nwrong. But many are uneasy about reversing the technological accident that has made financial transactions more \ntraceable in the era of electronic banking.\n\nSome see tamper-proof virtual currencies as preferable to physical ones that central bankers can easily debase. \nThe island of Alderney has gone so far as to mint physical coins that are backed by Bitcoins in its electronic vault. \nBut enthusiasts should be careful what they wish for. An unstable price level is dangerous. Removing the steering-\nwheel is the wrong way to prevent central bankers from driving the economy off the road.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Alderney balances its \nbooks, while its neighbour has seen its deficit increase - fuelling the island's desire for financial independence.\n\nMeanwhile, the phenomenon of Bitcoin has rapidly taken off.\n\nThe popularity of the decentralised digital currency - a form of electronic cash - has mushroomed from its original \nbase of tech fans to investors, businesses and speculators. Businesses and entrepreneurs have lobbied hard to \ngovernments to recognise the currency as legitimate, the main stumbling block being its association with fears of \nmoney laundering and buying drugs online.\n\nBut its ties with the Silk Road website, shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and various hacking \nscandals have not stopped its value taking off.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;In January its price hovered around $15; on Friday, it hit a peak of $1,242.\n\n\n\nRobert McDowall, Alderney's finance minister, over the summer was put in touch with Michael Parsons, a banker \nand adviser on Bitcoin. Over a meal at City restaurant Sweetings, they discussed the potential of Bitcoin and the \nidea of bringing it to Alderney with a physical coin was born.\n\nThe Royal Mint, which had a longstanding relationship with Alderney, was brought on board and proposals were \ndrafted over the following weeks. The plan had \"top level support\", a Mint official said in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, the Treasury, which oversees the Mint, invited the Alderney team for talks on how a licensing regime \ncould work, according to correspondence seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe Bitcoin financial services hub would include exchanges, paymentsservices and physical storage for coins for \nwealthy clients - and would diversify the island's revenues from gambling alone.\n\nThe plan would need to be voted through by the island's parliament and then legislation could be passed to finalise \nthe project. If passed, it will become the first jurisdiction to introduce a regulated environment for the coin.\n\nAdvocates of the scheme hope it will help enduncertainty over the virtual currency's status.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It would have a gold content - a figure of \u00a3500-worth has been \nproposed - so that holders could conceivably melt and sell the metal if the exchange value of the currency were to \ncollapse.\n\nThe hype surrounding Bitcoin has escalated in recent months and its market value has rocketed; the price of a \nsingle Bitcoin hit a new peak of $1,242 on Friday on the Mt Gox exchange, established in Tokyo in 2009 as a \ntrading card exchange.\n\nCritics warn of a speculative bubble although its proponents believe that the currency could be widely adopted as a \nmethod of making payments outside the traditional banking system. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal \nReserve, and other government officials around the world have said virtual currencies could have benefits if they \ncan be regulated to prevent money laundering.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Holders of the Alderney Bitcoin would not be able to spend it in stores but would be able to exchange it for a \nvirtual Bitcoin by travelling to the island.\n\nAlderney hopes that by minting the first physical Bitcoin it will raise its profile as the \"go-to\" destination for the virtual \ncurrency, as it seeks to expand its offshore credentials beyond the online gambling sector.\n\n\n\nDavid Janczewski, head of new business at the Royal Mint confirmed it had been approached by the finance \nminister of Alderney to \"explore the possibility of manufacturing a physical commemorative coin with a Bitcoin \ntheme\".\n\n\"Discussions have not progressed further and at this stage it remains nothing more than a concept,\" he added.\n\nBut the controversy around Bitcoin has made the Alderney plan a sensitive subject. The Treasury, which owns the \nRoyal Mint, declined to comment on the plans. George Osborne, the British chancellor, also holds the title of Master \nof the Mint.\n\nThe plans have been steered by chairman of the island's finance committee, and are understood to have the \nsupport of Alderney's president, although they still need to be approved by the island's 10-member parliament.\n\nA number of private companies have produced physical Bitcoins, although they are not backed by an official mint. \nInstead they feature a holographic strip, which is peeled off to reveal the private key then redeemed online.\n\nHow would Alderney's plan work?\n\nAn independent company will provide the Bitcoins. If the price plunged, neither Alderney nor the Royal Mint would \nlose anything.\n\nThe company would put the Bitcoins in an escrow account at an agreed price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Mint would take customers' orders for its minted Bitcoins and receive money from those coin \nsales.\n\nThe virtual Bitcoins backing the physical coins would be held in digital storage facilities by Alderney.\n\nThe Mint would issue the commemorative Bitcoin, paying for the value of the gold content itself. Alderney would \nreceive royalties from sales of the coins.\n\nCoins could be redeemed for sterling at any point in Alderney for the price of a Bitcoin on that day.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Hire Station and Groundforce - the \nbiggest parts of the business - benefited from improving market conditions in the housebuilding and construction \nindustries.\n\nVP's shares, which are up 60 per cent in the year to date, jumped about 8 per cent on the day of the results \nannouncement.\n\nTalvivaara gains ground in fight to stave off bankruptcy\n\nShareholders in Talvivaara, the London-listed Finnish miner, find themselves between a nickel-rich rock and a hard \nplace after its warning this month that it faced possible bankruptcy if it fails to gain extra financing, writes Michael \nKavanagh.\n\nThat warning, which came six months after its last fundraising, compounded a fall in Talvivaara's shares that had \nalready lost more than nine-tenths of their value so far this year.\n\nOn Friday, however, the withdrawal of support for an application for corporate reorganisation by creditor Nystar \nappeared to give the company more breathing space.\n\nShares in the company, which owns large deposits of low-grade ore that can only be mined profitably when nickel \nprices are high, jumped 40 per cent to 4.61p on news of possible respite in its crisis.\n\nBut they remain bombed out compared to highs of almost 170p reached in 2011 amid hopes that clever leaching \ntechnology combined with growing demand for industrial metals could deliver fortunes to investors in a business \nbought from Outokumpu for a EUR1 coin in 2004.\n\nWith shares so low, eternal optimists who still hold stock can at least be content that remaining risk is predominantly \non the upside.\n\nManroy sets course to abandon quote on Aim\n\nManroy, the Sandhurst-headquartered maker of machine guns and weapons systems, seems set to abandon its \nquote on the Alternative Investment Market, writes Kate Burgess.\n\nOn Tuesday, Manroy announced it was in talks with three potential bidders - US Ordnance, Beretta and Herstal - \nwho had until Christmas Eve to make a bid. Then, on Thursday, it announced that the talks with US Ordnance had \n\n\n\nended and talks with Beretta were not active. However, talks with Herstal are. Manroy's shares closed the week up \n15p to 74p, valuing the company, at \u00a314m.\n\nThat was the price at which the business was floated on Aim in 2010 - valuing the company at about \u00a310m. Manroy \ncame to the market to fund expansion into the US and to diversify its product range. A year later, its shares had \nrisen above 120p, but profits have since been hit by delays to big contracts. Manroy reported a \u00a32m pre-tax loss to \nthe end of September 2012.\n\nPeople familiar with the company said the management felt its lumpy revenue stream made it ill-suited to the public \nmarket.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Instead he asked the board to find him a piano.\n\nThe assembled directors at Edinburgh's swish Prestonfield hotel - plus a coterie of passing guests who crowded \naround the doorway - were treated to a mini-recital of Schubert and Chopin. \"It was concert pianist quality,\" says \nStandard Life's longtime chairman, Gerry Grimstone. \"Norman really is the archetypal renaissance man.\"\n\nIt is just as well. Lord Blackwell, 61, is set next week to be reborn as the next chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, \ntaking on the highest profile role of his career, as Britain's biggest high-street bank prepares to return to full private \nsector ownership, after the humiliating part-nationalisation of 2008.\n\nThe appointment, revealed by the Financial Times on Thursday, is expected to be rubber-stamped by the board on \nMonday, paving the way for Lord Blackwell to take over the Lloyds' chairmanship from incumbent Sir Win Bischoff \nearly next year.\n\nOn paper at least, the former banker-cum government adviser-cum career non-executive, is the perfect choice. \nLord Blackwell's early career flip-flopped between stints advising government and at McKinsey, the consultancy, \nbefore he moved to NatWest bank, where he became head of strategy to then chief executive Derek Wanless. \nSince 2000, he has held a succession of company directorships, and chairs construction business Interserve.\n\nThose who have worked with Lord Blackwell admit he has been an understated figure for much of his career. \"He is \nlow-key to the point of being boring in some people's eyes,\" says one former colleague. But most praise his style \nand his substance. \"He's old-fashioned in the best kind of way,\" says Mr Grimstone - a trait that will mesh with the \nimage Lloyds seeks to exude: a traditional lender that has spurned some of the racier investment banking strategies \nundertaken by many rivals.\n\n\n\nDespite being a life peer, associates say Lord Blackwell - married with five grown-up children - is very down-to-\nearth, living with his family in an unremarkable Victorian villa in Epsom.\n\nAll those who have worked with him praise twin skills in the prospective Lloyds chairman - a keen intellect and a \ngreat diligence. \"He's assiduous in keeping up to date with changes in rules and regulations,\" says one former \ncolleague at KPMG. \"He comes to all our seminars on international accounting standards.\"\n\nLord Blackwell's style will contrast with the ebullient ways of the outgoing Sir Win. But he is expected nonetheless \nto jell well with Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive. \"He will be quite a good foil to Ant\u00f3nio,\" says one adviser. \n\"He might be understated but he is such a detail man that he won't be fobbed off. He will be a serious challenger to \nthe bank's executives.\"\n\nThat prospective dynamic is understood to have played a vital role in Lord Blackwell's selection for the job ahead of \nother candidates, including rival board member David Roberts. \"Some people thought David still had CEO \nambitions and would have rivalled Ant\u00f3nio rather than complementing him,\" says one person involved in the \nprocess.\n\nCapping Lord Blackwell's suitability for the job, in the board's eyes, was his deep political connections. Though he \nhas not been directly involved in government since heading former prime minister John Major's policy unit in the \nmid-1990s, he remains close to the current leadership and sits on the board of the Centre for Policy Studies think-\ntank.\n\nLloyds remains 33 per cent government owned, and liaising with the Treasury, as that stake is sold to private sector \ninvestors over the next couple of years, may be the most crucial part of Lord Blackwell's job.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Of those that did, 99.91 per cent supported the recapitalisation, the Co-op said.\n\nThe result will be welcome news for the Co-op, which has had a rocky few weeks since it announced the \nrestructuring deal with bondholders on November 4.\n\nThe bank was thrown into crisis shortly after, as its former chairman, Reverend Paul Flowers was filmed allegedly \ntrying to buy illegal drugs. The Co-op has admitted that the events have damaged its reputation and contributed to a \nloss of current account customers in recent weeks.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday night, the Co-op said the bank and its parent group were \"delighted at the \noverwhelming levels of support for the liability management exercise at this critical juncture . . . We are now highly \nconfident that our \u00a31.5bn recapitalisation plan for The Co-operative Bank can be achieved.\"\n\nThe bank is being forced to raise the fresh capital after being hit by large losses on bad debts, and charges relating \nto mis-sold payment protection insurance and a mishandled IT upgrade.\n\nThe outcome of the vote will also be a relief for a group that represented holders of the Co-op Bank's lower tier two \nbonds, LT2, and its advisers - Moelis, the investment bank, and Shearman & Sterling, the law firm - which together \nled the bank recapitalisation talks with the Co-op.\n\nThe LT2 group consisted of several hedge funds, which built a blocking stake in the lower tier two bonds and used it \nto negotiate a better deal for creditors than the Co-op had proposed. Aurelius - the biggest hedge fund in the \nconsortium, and one that was central to the recapitalisation talks - sold almost its entire holding days after the plan \nwas announced.\n\n\n\nThe Co-op and the LT2 group had some concerns that they may not receive sufficient numbers of votes from retail \ninvestors to approve the recapitalisation. Many of the retail investors are pensioners in their 80s and 90s.\n\nIf the bank had failed to secure support from investors, its recapitalisation plan would have collapsed and it would \nlikely have been put into resolution.\n\nThe final deadline for votes is December 6 and the Co-op will announce the full result midway through next month.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Among such articles and the one that stayed with him \nthe longest was two-time Pulitzer Prize winner John Updike's New Yorker magazine profile of Boston Red Sox star \nplayer Ted Williams, still renowned for being the only modern baseball player to record a seasonal batting average \nover .400. The essay is evaluated by Mr Kuper as better than \"any sports writing I ever encountered growing up in \nEurope\".\n\nBut as a life-long baseball fan, I wish he had read the baseball essays of another American writer who, to my \nknowledge, never wrote fiction - Stephen Jay Gould, the polymath scientist. His essay about New York Yankees \nbaseball icon Joe DiMaggio, \"The Streak of Streaks\", whose hitting streak of 56 straight games in 1941, the same \nyear as Williams' unique achievement, still brings tears to my eyes at age 86.\n\nAfter quoting the poets Omar Khayyam and Alexander Pope and determining the near impossibility of such a run of \nhits, Gould concludes his essay: \"DiMaggio's hitting streak is the finest of legitimate legends because it embodies \nthe essence of the battle that truly defines our lives. DiMaggio activated the greatest and most unattainable dream \nof all humanity, the hope and chimera of all sages and shamans: he cheated death, at least for a while\".

As an individual who truly wants to become a zhengyou (friend who speaks the \ntruth) to the Chinese people, I sincerely thank the FT for overlooking this Freudian slip, which only reflects my \nfervent wish to see the advent of such a party or parties; this would signal the beginning of transforming China into \na multi-party society where diverse and multivocal ideological and political forces vie peacefully to accommodate a \ngovernance structure that serves the entire 1.3bn-strong Chinese community.\n\nYeomin Yoon, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ, US\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

His departure comes after the resignation in June of Ahmed Reda Halawani, \nthe company's director of private equity.\n\nKingdom has been in the spotlight this year after Prince Alwaleed became embroiled in a public dispute with Forbes \nmagazine over a detailed investigation into his wealth.\n\nThe dispute with Forbes emerged ahead of an article which said the value of Prince Alwaleed's stake in Kingdom \nwas much lower than its share price suggested. Kingdom responded with a firm rejection, and described allegations \nof share-price manipulation as \"completely unsupported and biased\".\n\nMr Sanbar's deputy, Mohammed Fahmy Soliman, may be promoted as part of the transition and Mr Sanbar will \nremain an adviser to the Prince, the people said. Mr Soliman is already more involved in meetings with bankers, \nthey added.\n\nMr Sanbar became Kingdom's chief financial officer in 2007 and has acted as a special adviser to Prince Alwaleed \nsince 2005. People familiar with the company saidthat working there was demanding, with long hours to match the \npacked schedule of Prince Alwaleed.\n\nA person familiar with Mr Sanbar said: \"He wanted to leave for some time and I am not sure it will have a significant \nimpact on the company.\" He added that Mr Sanbar planned to retire and to spend more time with his family.\n\nKingdom Holding did not respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg first reported the move on Friday.\n\nAn accounting professional, Mr Sanbar started his working life at the Los Angeles office of Arthur Andersen in the \n1970s after studying in the US. He worked at the firm for decades, and stayed on after its integration with Ernst & \nYoung.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has also caused great anger among minority shareholders around \nthe world.\n\n\n\nThe moderate fuel price increases announced on Friday should help limit losses but investors had been hoping for \nmore after the company had promised greater transparency on fuel subsidies.\n\nPetrobras said in a surprise announcement last month that it had prepared a methodology that would help match \ndomestic prices to international prices. However, the move needed the approval of the board, led by Finance \nMinister Guido Mantega.\n\nIn its statement on Friday, Petrobras said the price increases were part of the \"implementation of its diesel and \npetrol price policy\". However, it said the policy would remain private, prompting criticisms that the company had, in \nfact, made no significant changes to its practices at all.\n\nBrazil's ethanol industry body, Unica, said on Friday that the announcement would not help as it gave no clarity on \nfuture fuel prices.\n\nProducers of the biofuel have suffered widespread losses over the past few years as they are unable to compete \nwith subsidised petrol prices. In Brazil, almost all cars are built to run on ethanol or petrol, leaving drivers to choose \ndepending on which fuel is cheaper at the pump.\n\n\"We continue without any system, without a formula with clear and stable parameters, which would make it possible \nto understand the basis on which petrol prices are maintained or adjusted,\" Unica said in a statement on Friday.\n\nWhile Petrobras's management have been keen to push through a transparent methodology, the government is \nconcerned it would boost fuel already high inflation and decided to block the move, according to local media.\n\nAnnual inflation in Brazil was last recorded at about 5.8 per cent - below the 6.5 per cent ceiling of the tolerance \nrange but above the 4.5 per cent target.\n\nOn Wednesday, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 10 per cent, adding to \nwhat has become the world's biggest tightening cycle this year.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.
