{"title": "Immigration overreaction", "body": "\nWhen Washington doesn't deal with the nation's problems, local officials tend to take things into their own hands. \nThat's the case with immigration. With legislation stalled in Congress, a Philadelphia restaurant owner has posted \nthreatening \"English only\" signs on his storefront to chase away immigrants. In Butler County, Ohio, the sheriff has \nmade it his mission to scare off illegal immigrants with intimidating road signs. Now that sort of frustration has \nspread to Avon Park in Florida, where officials are considering an approach that is just as heavy-handed and short-\nsighted.\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Relief Act Ordinance, awaiting final approval by the City Council on July 10, would create a \n$1,000 fine for anyone who rents property to illegal immigrants or knowingly hires them. It also would declare \nEnglish as the city's official language, meaning city business would be solely conducted and written in English - no \nifs, ands or peros. Oops, buts.\n\nThese aren't solutions. They are emotional reactions to Washington's failure to effectively deal with immigration. \nAvon Park's proposals already have begun inflaming emotions. If enacted into law they will encourage racial \nprofiling and discrimination. They might move the problem, but they won't come close to solving it.\n\nThe frustrations of local politicians and business people about illegal immigration are understandable. But the \napproaches by Avon Park and many other local governments do more harm than good to their own communities. \nImmigration issues cannot be solved city by city. They require a thoughtful, national approach. If only Congress \nwere up to the challenge.\n"}
