{"title": "Smuggling ship testing U.S. access", "body": "\nImmigration officials say America's ability to control its borders is being  tested by an international smuggling \noperation responsible for sneaking a ship  into San Francisco Bay and dropping more than 180 Chinese near the \nGolden Gate  Bridge.\n\n\"They're feeling out the soft spots,\" said Joseph Brandon of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nCompiled from Times WiresSHIPS(SH)\"It's a very lucrative business. . .  . They are trying to find the routes of least \nresistance.\"\n\nDavid Ilchert of the INS said passengers who arrived Monday on the Pai  Chang paid $ 1,000 down and were \nexpected to pay a total of $ 20,000 for their  passage to America. That means the human cargo was worth more \nthan  $ 3.5-million to those who recruited and smuggled it in.\n\nOfficials arrested 184 passengers and said an unknown number of others got  away. Ten crew members also were \narrested on suspicion of smugging illegal  aliens.\n\nThirty-five of the detainees said they were under 18, and Ilchert said  they would be allowed to live with families in \nSan Francisco if any offered to  pay the $ 4,000 bond. The rest were distributed to two detention centers where \n they will be charged with illegally entering the United States.\n\nThe United States has seized seven ships with 1,599 Chinese aboard since  September 1992.\n\n\"Frankly, this is only the beginning,\" said INS spokesman Michael  Smirnoff. \". . . We're estimating that at this rate \nthere will be 13,000  undocumented Chinese here by (December) 1993.\"  - Information from San Francisco \nExaminer and Reuters was used in this report.\n"}
