The mayor told a \npredominantly Hispanic audience at St. Peter's Church that while city and state officials could not stop \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement from conducting sweeps in the city, he would do everything within his \npower to discourage them. ''We are a sanctuary city, make no mistake about it,'' Mr. Newsom said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
