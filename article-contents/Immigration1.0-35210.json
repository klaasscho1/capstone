{"title": "The Nation in Summary;A Look Into Haitian Camps", "body": "\nApparently weary of fending off charges of concentration-camp conditions, the Reagan Administration last week \nagreed to let an international body examine facilities at two detention centers for Haitian refugees.\n\nThe visits were requested by a unit of the Organization of American States, in response to complaints at Fort Allen \nin Puerto Rico and the Krome North camp near Miami.\nPresident Reagan agrees to allow international body examine facilities at two detention centers for Haitian \nrefugeesThe immigration and Naturalization Service said 555 Haitians were being held at Krome North and 771 at \nFort Allen. Nationwide some 2,025 Haitians are being held at centers in 14 cites.\n\nWashington had opposed an investigation on the ground that Haitians had not exhausted all available remedies in \nFederal courts. When the commission decided to visit anyway, the United States authorities agreed to cooperate.\n\nLast May the immigration service began detaining Haitians caught illegally entering the country instead of releasing \nthem to American sponsors. In October the Administration ordered interdictions at sea to stop Haitians before they \narrived; at the same time the immigration service began holding rapid deportation hearings.\n\nA Miami judge's subsequent ruling that no Haitain could be tried unless represented by legal counsel had the effect \nof stopping the trials but prolonging the Haitians' detention. The United States insists that the Haitians are economic \nrefugees, while the Haitains insist they are seeking political asylum.\n"}
