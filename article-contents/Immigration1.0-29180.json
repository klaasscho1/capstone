{"title": "Stars band together to protest Arizona law; Controversial statute ignites fervor, activism among musicians", "body": "\nFour summers ago, a handful of Spanish-speaking radio disc jockeys helped bring hundreds of thousands of Latino \nmarchers to the streets of Los Angeles and other cities to support immigration reform.\n\nNow, in what is partly a sign of the growing clout of U.S. Latinos both as voters and cultural consumers, a number \nof prominent artists, both Latino and non-Latino, are urging a boycott of Arizona's controversial new statute that \nrequires law enforcement officials to determine the status of people they suspect are illegal immigrants whom \nthey've stopped or detained for other reasons.\n\nSeveral musicians, including Carlos Santana, Willie Nelson and the Mexican pop-rock band Mana, are recording \nsongs in support of the millions of immigrants, mainly from Mexico and other parts of Latin America, living in the \nUnited States, whatever their legal status.\n\n\"These folks are coming to us the way immigrants have always come to us. We really need to welcome these \npeople,\" Nelson said in a phone interview, explaining why he took part in recording the song \"Si Se Puede,\" \ncolloquially translated as \"Yes We Can.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of other musical performers, including Colombian pop stars Shakira and Juanes, \nZack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, Los Tigres del Norte, Sonic Youth, Kanye West and Ozomatli have \ncalled for a boycott of Arizona to protest the new statute. So far few, if any, prominent musicians or artists have \nstepped forward publicly to support the Arizona law.\n\nWhile opinion polls indicate that  voters in the U.S. are deeply divided over the Arizona law, it's doubtful that \ngroups like Ozomatli and Rage Against the Machine need worry about alienating members of their multicultural, \npolitically progressive fan bases.\n\nIn a statement released this week, De la Rocha expressed concern that Arizona's SB 1070 could lead to fans of \nthe group being \"pulled over and harassed . . . because they are brown or black, or for the way they speak, or for \nthe music they listen to.\"\n\n\n\"Yes We Can\" imparts a message largely of solidarity rather than protest. But other musical artists are recording \nsongs with more politically pointed lyrics.\n\nThe U.S.-born, bilingual hip-hop performer known as Mexia has recorded a track called \"Todos Somos Arizona \n(We Are All Arizona),\" in which he declares, \"we're Latinos on the rise like blood pressure, yeah, trying to control us \nwith fear.\n\n\"We clean your home, cook your food while you sit on your [throne] without a clue,\" continues Mexia, who is the son \nof Hernan Hernandez, one of the founding members of the Mexican super-group Los Tigres Del Norte, which has \nan enormous stateside following and frequently sings about immigrants' struggles.\n\nAlberto Kreimerman, producer of \"Si Se Puede\" and president of Fundacion Hermes Music, emphasized in an \ninterview that the idea for the song originated several years ago and was not written specifically in response to the \nArizona law.\n\nThe track's aim, he said, was to raise consciousness and empathy for immigrants in general.\n\n\"We think it's a problem of awareness,\" Kreimerman said. \"It's not a problem of law.\"\n\nThe single, which includes contributions from Santana, Nelson, Ramon Ayala, Los Lonely Boys, Mana and the \nTejano/Norte\u00c3\u00b1o group Intocable, is scheduled to be released on the Fourth of July. Sales proceeds will benefit \nFundacion Hermes and another foundation that assists immigrants, run by longtime farmworkers-rights activist \nDolores Huerta.\n\nPilar Diaz, formerly of the group Los Abandoned, approaches the subject of illegal immigration somewhat playfully \nin her song and accompanying music video \"Ilegal En Estyle.\" Speaking by phone, Diaz said she hopes that her \nSpanglish-titled tune and whimsical, partly animated video will encourage all immigrants to believe that they can \nrise above temporary hardships and \"live in style,\" relatively speaking, while pursuing better lives.\n\n\"It's something that's very close to me because my parents immigrated here with me when I was a child,\" said Diaz, \nwhose family is from Chile. \"I know those struggles, and I know how hard that was for my parents.\"\n\n -- Los Angeles Times \n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE\n\nIMAGE\n\nIMAGE; Willie Nelson, Kanye West and Carlos Santana are among those urging a boycott.\n"}
