{"title": "Probert challenge avoids jail", "body": "\nA federal judge kept the Detroit Red Wings' Bob Probert out of jail and put him in the middle of a legal donnybrook \nwith constitutional ramifications far beyond his case.\n\nProbert, 25, successfully challenged a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service statute under which he would \nhave been jailed while appealing his deportation to Canada.\n\nU.S. District Judge Horace Gilmore said the statute is unconstitutional because it calls for detainment without the \npossibility of a bond hearing.\n\nHe said Probert could be detained only if he is proved to be a threat to flee or a risk to society. Michigan INS \nDirector Jim Montgomery said no bond hearing will be held.\n\n''This is just getting over one more hurdle,'' Probert said. ''There is a large one yet to come. Until that is over with, I \ncan't get on with my life.''\n"}
