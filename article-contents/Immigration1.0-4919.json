{"title": "Immigrants Aren't the Problem. We Are.", "body": "\nIn the next few weeks, the half million members of the Sierra Club will vote to set the club's policy on the issue of \nimmigration. Since the Sierra Club does not exactly control Congress, the final count won't much matter, but the \ndebate, which has already been spirited, represents an invaluable chance to raise the issue of how many people \nthis country can and should contain.\n\nImmigration is about as difficult a moral subject as one can imagine, so even the proposed change in Sierra Club \npolicy -- in favor of an unspecified \"reduction in net immigration\" -- has ignited controversy. In a world of desperate \npoverty, it is hard for citizens of the richest nation to argue that the door should be closed, especially since nearly \nall of us can recall our immigrant roots.\n\nNot only that, too many people who support tighter controls on immigration are racists of various types. I got a letter \nlast month from a board member of one national group working on population issues in which he complained about \n\"barbarians\" who littered the subways and played \"ugly\" music. (He professed to prefer that all-American composer \nJ. S. Bach.) So it is no surprise that most wise people, including most wise environmentalists, simply ignore the \nmatter: currently, the official Sierra Club policy is to \"take no position on immigration levels or on policies governing \nimmigration into the United States.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists have focused on living more simply and more efficiently as the keys to our problems here at \nhome, but many, myself included, have largely overlooked the messier and more divisive question of our sheer \nnumbers. While our birth rate is just below the replacement level of 2.1 -- the number of children each mother would \nneed to bear to keep the population constant -- our total population continues to grow quickly compared with that of \nother developed nations. Part of this is because of our longer life spans and the echoes of the baby-boom bulge -- \neven at two children apiece, we'll be increasing our numbers for decades to come. But our population is also \ngrowing because we have by far the world's highest level of immigration -- something like 800,000 legal \nimmigrants take up residence here each year (not to mention illegal immigrants, estimated at 300,000 a year). \nNatural increase and immigration, the Census Bureau projects, may combine to swell our population by as much as \n\n\n50 percent in the next 50 years, bringing it to nearly 400 million; by even the most conservative estimates, there will \nbe 30 percent more Americans by the middle of the next century.\n\nThat's a problem for two reasons. The first, and most obvious, is that this country, so seemingly empty when \nEuropeans initially arrived, is by some definitions becoming crowded. It's true that the Plains remain sparsely \npopulated, and probably always will. But the places Americans want to live are jammed. The Northeast corridor of \nsuburbs and cities is already more densely populated than Haiti or El Salvador; California's 30 million may become \n50 million by 2050. With each year, the ring of suburbs spreads a little farther out, the roads become a bit more \ncrowded, the margin for wildlife becomes slightly smaller. That endless growth places real stress on our supplies of \neverything from water to silence, from farmland to solitude. Such growth even strains our democracy. When the \nConstitution was ratified, each member of Congress represented 30,000 voters; now it's 570,000.\n\nBut there's a bigger problem still. Americans, as the world's most voracious consumers, contribute far more per \ncapita to the world's environmental problems than anyone else. So an extra hundred million Americans means, for \ninstance, a staggering amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere and warming the climate. It's true that we \ncould alleviate some of that problem if each of us consumed less and consumed more efficiently -- if we lived in \nsmaller homes heated by the sun. I've spent most of my career writing about just such ideas, and believe in them \nwholeheartedly.\n\nBut at the moment, we're building bigger homes and driving bigger cars. And even if we came to our senses, the \nmomentum of natural increase and immigration would render most of our changes meaningless. As the President's \nCouncil on Sustainable Development pointed out in 1996, domestic population growth means we'll need to increase \nour energy efficiency 50 percent in the next half century just to run in place.\n\nThis is a very different argument from the traditional \"they'll-take-our-jobs-from-us\" lament. Economists by now \nhave mostly concluded that immigrants actually create wealth, which should come as no surprise to anyone who \nhas visited Brooklyn or Queens in recent years. If those who wanted to immigrate here stayed instead in Juarez or \nShanghai or, for that matter, Dublin, they would do far less damage to the planet precisely because they would not \nbe as rich. That's the point, and that's also the rub. People want to come here for a better life with more \nopportunities, and who are we to deny them that chance?\n\nWe of course already deny plenty of people that chance -- even our current, historically generous immigration \nceiling means many people aren't allowed in. Of the world's huddled masses, only the tiniest fraction will ever come \nhere even with existing laws. And while some population-control advocates want to see immigration all but stopped, \nmost whom I've talked to would prefer to see the limits cut roughly in half, to about 400,000 annually, with special \nprovisions for asylum seekers. At that rate, if our birth rate simultaneously fell to the European average of 1.5 \nchildren, we could see our population stop growing within a generation.\n\nStill, such a policy would be harsh. It would mean 400,000 more people a year who would be turned away at the \ndoor -- people with particular hopes, particular sorrows. And all in the name of as-yet fairly abstract problems like \nglobal warming. Such restrictions would come at real cost to the American dream, too; in most cities I know, New \nYork included, immigrants best exemplify the kind of citizenship and community spirit increasingly absent from the \nnation's mainstream.\n\nSo I think we have no right to pass such laws, or even to support them in nonbinding forms like Sierra Club \nreferendums, unless we also take serious steps in our own lives to lessen our impact on the environment. If we're \nnot willing to reduce the size of our families or the size of our sport utility vehicles, then cutting immigration is \npiggish scapegoating; it may save some of our landscape, but at the price of our national soul. If, however, we are \nwilling to take some painful steps ourselves, then we earn the right to tell some tough truths to others -- chief among \nthem that even this rich land can't grow forever. Numbers count.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nDrawing\n"}
