{"title": "WHY IS A PERSON WHO WORKED AGAINST MULLAHS' REGIME LABELED A TERRORIST?", "body": "\n \n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nI have received a lot of calls from Iranian-Americans in Missouri since April 3. \"What about us?\" they ask. \"We are \nalso political refugees. We also want freedom for Iran and had to flee to America. Are we out of the mullahs' \nreach?\"\n\n \n\nI have no answer for them.\n\nOn April 3, the Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested a young Iranian woman, Mahnaz Samadi. A human \nrights activist, Samadi is well known in Missouri. A keynote speaker at several community events, her wrenching \npersonal testimony about the treatment of women in prison in Iran left a lasting impression. The INS is threatening \nto deport her.\n\nAs Iranians, we know that in her case that is a death sentence. Samadi sought to free Iran from the theocratic \ndictatorship installed by Ruhollah Khomeini, a goal shared by nine out of 10 Iranians. But she dared to speak out \nabout her beliefs. While still in high school in Iran, she campaigned for human rights. She was arrested and spent \nfour years under horrific torture in dreaded Evin political prison. The clerical regime killed her brothers, jailed her \nsister and tortured the entire family. She fled Iran to avoid being returned to the torture chambers, was granted \npolitical asylum in the United States in 1995 and dedicated her life to helping other Iranians victimized by the \nTehran regime.\n\nOn April 3, she was arrested by INS agents on her return from Canada. She was not allowed to speak to her \nlawyer, who was at the border. She was secreted away to an unknown location, and then transferred from one jail \nto another. She was subjected to all kinds of humiliation, strip-searched following a visit from her attorney, shackled \nduring the transfers between jails, taunted by guards as a \"terrorist\" and then locked up in a crowded cell in prison \nin rural Alabama.\n\nMembers of Congress, Amnesty International, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, and Iranian-American \ncommunities across the U.S. have protested her arrest in letters to Attorney General Janet Reno and the INS \ndirector.\n\nSO what is Samadi's crime? The INS's first notice to appear charges that she failed to tell them that, after fleeing \nIran, she spent seven months with National Liberation Army's forces, who conduct \"coordination attacks designed \nto liberate Iran.\" The NLA is the military wing of the resistance movement against the mullahs' tyranny. Sen. \nChristopher Bond led a group 28 senators who recognized the movement as legitimate. A majority in the House of \n\n\nRepresentatives, parliamentary majorities in Britain, Italy, Belgium and 143 members of the French National \nAssembly signed on the same initiative.\n\nSo what is really going on here? The State Department is still on the wrong track with the ruling regime in Iran. \nLet's flip through the history books. In January 1978, President Jimmy Carter referred to the shah's Iran as \"as \nisland of stability.\" Just months later, the monarchy was overthrown.\n\nIn 1985, the Reagan administration sent Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, a gift of a cake, a colt and a \nBible. That good will is better known now as the Irangate scandal.\n\nIn 1997, the State Department included Iran's largest and most effective opposition group in its list of foreign \nterrorist organizations. A senior Clinton administration official told The Los Angeles Times the i nclusion of the \nPeople's Mujahedeen was a \"goodwill gesture\" to Iran's newly elected president, Mohammad Khatami.\n\nIt was quite obvious to Iranians here and in Tehran that Mahnaz Samadi's arrest was simply another in this series \nof concessions to Iran's unpopular rulers. The mullahs' state-controlled newspaper, Jomhouri-Islami, welcomed her \narrest, adding that she might be deported.\n\n \n\nThat sure looks like a political agenda to Iranians in Missouri.\n\nMahnaz Samadi is the victim of a political game. So does that mean striving for freedom has become a crime? It is \na question Iranian-Americans in Missouri are taking very seriously. The stakes are very high. In the words of Sen. \nRobert Torricelli, D-N.J., \"Sending messages to foreign governments should not involve the taking of people's lives. \nShe faces certain death. This is outrageous. It cannot be permitted to happen.\"\n"}
