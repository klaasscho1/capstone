{"title": "City Seeks to Prevent Swindling of Immigrants Over Visa Lottery", "body": "\nThe New York City Department of Consumer Affairs said yesterday that it would seek to steer immigrants from \nunscrupulous businesses that claim to help them in a lottery for visas.\n\n     Through its Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, the federal State Department will award 50,000 visas granting \npermanent residency to applicants. \n\nIn the past, people, sometimes posing as immigration lawyers, have cheated immigrants of thousands of dollars, \noften falsely assuring them that that they will win the lottery. \n\n The commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Jane S. Hoffman, said: \"It is very important to realize that you don't need \nto pay any person, any lawyer or any business to apply. You cannot pay a lawyer or business organization to get a \ngreen card or to automatically become a citizen. If anyone is telling you that, it's a scam.\"\n\nAs part of its campaign to prevent such schemes, her department will distribute a brochure in nine languages -- \nEnglish, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, French, Haitian-Creole, Italian and Korean. \n\nThe brochure advises immigrants to take precautions, such as not to pay in cash and to be wary of people \nclaiming to have inside connections.\n\nMs. Hoffman said that immigrants should report schemes to her agency, which does not typically report \ninformation on illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
