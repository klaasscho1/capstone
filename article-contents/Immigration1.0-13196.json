{"title": "URBAN TACTICS; For Halloween, Candy as Sweet As the Old Country", "body": "\n     NEW York's immigrant children may be light years ahead of their parents in adopting American customs, as the \npreponderance of Bangladeshi Spider-Men and Peruvian SpongeBobs in the streets this Halloween should \ndemonstrate. \n\nBut children's sweet teeth don't necessarily become American as fast as the rest of them. \n\n In stores throughout the city's immigrant neighborhoods, wonderfully unusual imported candy is as common as \nHershey's Kisses. And although many immigrant families will hand out traditional American candy on Thursday, \nother, more unexpected items may find their way into trick-or-treat bags. Here are favorites among some of New \nYork's newer ethnic groups.\n\n   SETH KUGEL\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhotos: EAST ASIA -- Japanese gum; from China, White Rabbit candy, ginger candy, corn suckers that taste like \nsugary corn porridge, apple-flavored chews, dried-plum hard candy popular among pregnant women; MIDDLE \nEAST -- Natural gum from Egypt, Lebanese fruit-filled chocolate, sugary Lebanese candies made of sesame, \npistachio or almonds, Shaarawi Bros. spiced gum from Jordan; RUSSIA/BELARUS -- Coconut-covered Belarussian \ntruffles; from Moscow, Limping Bear chocolates and Crawfish Neck hard candy made with cacao and peanuts; \nCOLOMBIA/ECUADOR -- From Colombia, coffee hard candy, Bon Bon Bum lollipops and Supercoco nougat; from \nEcuador, liquid-filled Kataboom gum and colorfully wrapped chocolate bars with peanuts; JAMAICA -- Sweet and \nsour tamarind balls, fruity Paradise Plums; INDIA -- Gem sesame balls, Mango Mood and fennel-flavored Pan \nPasand hard candy; MEXICO -- Miguelito chili powder and sugar, chili with tamarind, chili-covered corncob-shaped \nlollipops (Photographs by Tony Cenicola/The New York Times) \n"}
