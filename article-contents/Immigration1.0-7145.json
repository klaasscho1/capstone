{"title": "I.N.S. Thwarts Basic Justice", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAnthony Lewis's Sept. 21 and Oct. 5 columns on the Immigration and Naturalization Service's treatment of Hawa \nSaid, a Yemeni immigrant who claims she should be tried as a citizen, only mentions in passing that Ms. Said was \nconvicted of drug trafficking. If she had led a life free of crime, would she have become involved with the I.N.S. at \nall?\n\nMr. Lewis's question, \"Why bring a dubious, marginal case like that against Ms. Said?\", prompts this reply: A \ndeportation case stemming from a conviction for a criminal act should be moved to the front of the huge backlog of \nwork the I.N.S. is trying to overcome. The processing of Ms. Said's deportation case arises from her being jailed for \nthe greater evil of drug trafficking; this is a critical, not a marginal, factor.\n\n \n\nSTEVE DELL'OLIO\n\nStamford, Conn., Oct. 6, 1999\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
