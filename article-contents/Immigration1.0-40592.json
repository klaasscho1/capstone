{"title": "INS CHIEF CALLS FOR CHANGES MORE GUARDS, BRIGHTER LIGHTS ON THE MEXICAN BORDER COULD REDUCE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, SHE TELLS LAWYERS.", "body": "\nBrighter lights along crucial U.S. border areas and 400 more guards in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, could \nhelp stop illegal immigration to the United States, the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService told a legal conference Friday.\n\n\"We need to reform the asylum system.\nThe current system does not work,\" Doris Meissner said in a speech at the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation annual meeting.\n\nEach year about 300,000 people enter the United States illegally, according to INS figures. Meissner's appointment \nby the Clinton administration marked a concerted effort to streamline a system plagued by social and legal pitfalls. \nAdditional funding to improve the immigration system is being reviewed by Congress. A proposed $327 million \nincrease would add agents, improve lighting along key U.S. border areas and emphasize deterrence overseas, \nMeissner said. With more equipment, technology and money, Meissner hopes to ensure Americans that U.S. \nborders would block illegal immigrants.\n\nMeissner cited San Diego and El Paso as areas where entry must be prevented. \"We're simply waiting for the \n(congressional) appropriation. The personnel have already been selected,\" said Meissner.\n\n\"This starts with a concentration on the Southwest border, and with preventing illegal entry in the first place,\" \nMeissner said. \"The Southwest border part of our plan is an effort at doing our work much more intelligently.\"\n\nMeissner also said she was concerned with improving the naturalization process for legal immigrants.\n\n\"One year from now we would be able to receive electronic filings,\" said Meissner, receiving a strong round of \napplause from the lawyers.\n"}
