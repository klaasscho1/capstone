{"title": "Engineers Needn't Fear Worker Influx", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nMichael S. Teitelbaum's cry of \"Too Many Engineers, Too Few Jobs\" (Op-Ed, March 19), on proposals rejected by \nCongress that would have held down increases in the number of skilled foreign workers allowed to immigrate to the \nUnited States, is an echo of the 1970's.\n\nI cannot fault Mr. Teitelbaum's statistics on unemployment among engineers, but they are counter to the \nexperience of my Ph.D. students, six of whom have found good jobs in industry in the last two years. In addition, all \nmy Taiwanese students have returned home to find jobs. Students from India are attracted back home to an \nexpanding economy.\n\nAs corporations cut research, the role of research universities in training engineers becomes more important. \nSome universities have seen decreases in their Ph.D. programs in response to anticipated funding cuts. Complex \ntechnology will require more engineers with advanced training, not fewer.\n\n \n\nFRANCIS C. MOON\n\nIthaca, N.Y., March 19, 1996\n\n \n\nThe writer is a professor of engineering at Cornell University.\n"}
