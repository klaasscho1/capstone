These include one of the leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood, \nYusuf al-Qaradawi and head of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Qadhi Hussein Ahmad.This letter is the latest manifestation of \nthe now well-established method of appealing to those who insist that the United States has only itself to blame for \nthe rise in international terrorism. Just as bin Laden and Zawahiri have made public statement that, if troops left Iraq \nand Afghanistan, then al-Qaeda would call it quits, this letter suggests that if Obama were to pull the troops out, \nthere would be no more \u0153resistance.It reads: \u0153The resistance in some Muslim countries is a result of the \naggression, injustice and tyranny practised or sponsored by the United States, and such resistance is not the cause \nof violence and terrorism as some circles in America like to claim. Therefore, if such resistance troubles you and \nyou wish peace to spread over, you have to end occupation and return to the peoples their rights and \nsovereignty.This is of course contrary to the words and actions of this \u0153resistance, who are not motivated only by \nthe US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also, to name but a few, by their obsession with creating an Islamic \nstate, their hatred of the democratic institutions that are now in place in both of these nations, and their disgust at \nthe gall that their women are showing by getting an education.The letter tries to justify the reasons for Islamist \nterrorism as simply a reaction to recent US imperialism in the Middle East, which does not explain why the \nSeptember 11 attacks occurred before any US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. But wait, they have found an \ningenious way of getting around this tricky subject:?? the events of the 11th of September 2001 were nothing but \nfabricated drama by some influential forces in America in co-ordination with Israeli Mossad. They have done all that \nin order to find a reason to trigger the Third World war that they have already planned for and decided its goals and \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4325049/Dont-fall-for-the-Islamist-letter-Barack-Obama.html\n\n\ntargeted fields.There are a number of references to the suffering of the Palestinian people, not in itself an \nunreasonable complaint, although they do border on the hyperbolic:\u0153We deeply realise that every sane person \nbelieves deep inside that no other nation in history has suffered injustice like the one inflicted upon the Palestinian \npeople.If we were to consider this as a genuine effort at highlighting to the President the plight of Muslims around \nthe world, rather than an attempt to further worldwide Islamist causes, then of course one would expect to see \nsome mention of the hundreds of thousands of Muslim Darfuris being slaughtered at the hands of the al-Bashir \nregime.Why, one might ask, has such a massacre been omitted from this litany of atrocities being committed \nagainst Muslims? A quick glance at some more of the cosignatories explains it all. They include the former Minister \nfor Religious affairs in Hassan al-Turabis National Islamic Front party (NIF), Esam Ahmed Al-Bashir, and one of the \nfounding members of the current Sudanese regime, Abdul Rahman Siwar al-Dhahb.Although it is unlikely that any \nof Obamas people will even see this letter, it is absolutely crucial that they do not fall for this sort of intimidation, \nespecially when it comes from some of the leading members of the most powerful and influential Islamist groups in \nthe world.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Egyptian Troops Training in TexasSecretive U.S. technology to assist in finding Hamas weapons \ntunnelsHERZLIYA, Israel \u201d Egyptian troops are undergoing training in Texas on the use of American military \ntechnology to uncover Hamas weapons smuggling tunnels, WND has learned.A top Egyptian intelligence official \ntold WND the Egyptian troops arrived in Texas in recent days, where they have been undergoing private courses on \nthe use of proprietary, secretive U.S. technology that makes use of sonar and certain frequencies to locate \nunderground tunnels along the Egypt-Gaza border.Also, the intelligence official said a team from the U.S. Armys \nCorps of Engineers recently arrived in the Egyptian Sinai desert, bringing the advanced machinery with them.The \nArmy has been aiding Egyptian troops in locating the tunnels.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Feel Like a Chump?You work hard, take care of your family, and pay all the taxes the government says you \nowe as is typical of honest, upright citizens.But what happens to your tax money?

It was unclear whether the two sides had reached any \naccommodation.The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse refused to distribute photos taken by \nthe White House of the new president on his first day in the Oval Office because of the dispute. Still photographers \nwere also not given access to Obamas do-over oath of office administered Wednesday night by Chief Justice John \nRoberts and an economics meeting on Thursday.Television network bureau chiefs also protested the exclusion of \nvideo cameras from the second oath of office.\u0153Were in an awkward phase and there will be bumps in the road, \nsaid Christopher Isham, CBS News Washington bureau chief. \u0153Hopefully they will be speed bumps rather than \nobstacles.Four reporters witnessed the oath of office and shared their observations with others, and a White House \nphoto was released.\u0153We think it was done in a way that was upfront and transparent, White House press secretary \nRobert Gibbs said in a briefing when questioned why video cameras were not present.Pressed on the matter, Gibbs \nsaid, \u0153we would have had to get a bigger room.The Associated Press also questioned on Thursday why reporters \nwere not allowed to use the names of administration officials giving a background briefing on issues regarding the \nGuantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba.Background briefings are hardly new in Washington, and were \nfrequently conducted during the Bush and Clinton administrations. But the AP wanted to establish early with the \nadministration that its important to get information on the record as often as possible, said Michael Oreskes, \nmanaging editor for U.S. news.\u0153Information is a lot more valuable to the public if you know where its coming from, \n\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2009/01/22/0122arrests.html\nhttp://www.freedomscost.net/?p=1744\nhttp://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jWIMzv3PZ_PQvXPxAqOU90VeOdjQD95SKJDG0\n\n\nOreskes said. \u0153So we try very hard in all source situations to identify sources as fully as we can.Gibbs did not \ndirectly address the issue when asked about it later, saying that \u0153I hope that you all found the exercise that we did \nthe morning helpful.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Obamas Vain BeginningNever forget the difference between good-sounding reasons and good sound \nreasoning. That was one of the first admonitions I remember hearing from my debate coach in high school.Barack \nObamas address at the high-priced ceremony marking his first day as an occupant of the White House is a \nmasterful symphony of good sounding reasons, filled with allusions to Americas founding principles, high ideals and \nhigh-minded purposes. Yet in the whole of it, there is not one shred of reasoning based on those principles, not one \nline that takes true account of their content and deliberately connects it with the view of government he articulates, \nor the wisps of policy he rhetorically flourishes. He uses words that evoke the founding ideals to give his assertions \nan aura of legitimacy, but he does not accept them as the starting point for deliberate reasoning that would justify \nthose assertions. He respects their usefulness, not their authority.Though Obama cleverly exploits the positive \nemotions still evoked by references to our founding ideals, he speaks without regard for the understanding that \njustifies those emotions, the logic that transforms them from good feelings to reasonable convictions; from vague \nhopes to truths which inform our lives and deserve our allegiance; and that we can sustain in the face of great \nsacrifice, pain and danger, even unto death. Because he refuses to acknowledge the vision of faith and reason \nactually articulated in our founding documents, his effort to portray the hard work and sacrifices of previous \ngenerations falls woefully short, in terms of truth and effectiveness: [\u00a6]\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Pa.

And it was \nmutually agreed that his situation was not working out and he would resign.The amount in bonuses paid out was \nbetween $3 and $4 billion, according to the Financial Times. Exorbitant Wall St. bonuses have garnered increased \nattention since the economic collapse and subsequent billions in bailout funds have gone to help companies stay \nafloat.[\u00a6]To make matters worse, Thain is now facing more criticism for reportedly spending $1.2 million to lavishly \ndecorate his Merrill Lynch office early last year while the firm was fighting to survive.Thain splurged on interior \ndesigns from the Obamas chosen White House decorator Michael Smith ($800,000), two area rugs ($131,000), two \nguest chairs ($87,000), a 19th Century credenza ($68,000), four pairs of curtains ($28,000), and a mahogany \npedestal table ($25,000), according to Charlie Gasparino, the CNBC contributor and Daily Beast columnist who \nbroke the story.Other items mentioned: six dining room chairs ($37,000), a George IV Desk ($18,000), a custom \ncoffee table ($16,000), a sofa ($15,000), a chandelier ($13,000), a mirror ($5,000), six wall sconces ($2,700).Also \nreported to be on the list was a trash can for $1,400.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\nhttp://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=86830\nhttp://thehill.com/leading-the-news/pa.-defense-firm-raided-by-fbi-2009-01-22.html\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6710368&page=1\n\n\n           The Big Lie About Obama and RaceA government-employed affirmative action officer by the name of \nCarolyn Pitts wrote the following:All white individuals are racist.

Still, many of the \ndifficult details \u201d such as what to do with Guant\u00e1namo detainees still deemed dangerous \u201d will be left up to a special \ninteragency panel that wont report its recommendations to Obama for six months. The panel is to be chaired by \nObamas choice for attorney general, Eric Holder, who is still awaiting confirmation.In perhaps his most far-reaching \nand potentially controversial move, Obama ordered that the CIA immediately cease using any interrogation \ntechniques that are not already authorized in the U.S. Army Field Manual. He also ordered the CIA to close, \u0153as \nexpeditiously as possible, any secret detention facilities overseas and begin immediate compliance with Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits \u0153humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners.[\u00a6]In recent \ndays, senior U.S. intelligence officials, including CIA Director Michael Hayden and outgoing Director of National \nIntelligence Mike McConnell, told Obamas advisers and journalists that they still needed the flexibility to use some \ninterrogation methods not permitted by the military. If nothing else, intel officials argued, inducing fear among \ndetainees that they might be subjected to harsh practices was useful in persuading them to talk.\u0153They were \npermitted to state their case, said one senior Obama adviser, who asked not be identified talking about internal \ndeliberations.But in the end, Obamas review team, headed by new White House Counsel Gregory Craig, rejected \ntheir arguments and questioned the premise that such methods were necessary. Obama is satisfied that the use of \nthe military field manual \u0153will not compromise national security, said another senior administration official, who also \nasked not to be identified talking about the administrations review process.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Theyre Poor Winners, TooLeftists are always lecturing Republicans and conservatives on the importance of \ncivility and bipartisanship yet revealing, whether winner or losing, that they are the ones who need lessons in \nmanners and collegiality.If you arent convinced of the lefts nonpareil arrogance and nastiness from observing their \nbehavior toward President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the past eight years, then contrast the behavior of \nMr. Bushs staff leaving office and that of Mr. Clintons, which literally trashed the White House like juvenile \ndelinquents.Fast-forwarding to this week, did you see Obama supporters booing President Bush at the \ninauguration, singing, \u0153Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye?

Theres a growing demand in West Virginia for sheep and goats from Muslim \nresidents tired of traveling hundreds of miles for meats prepared in accordance with their faiths dietary \nrequirements.At the same time, West Virginias farmers are eager for new customers.Putting these two \nconstituencies in the same room at South Charlestons Islamic Center was largely the work of Almeshia Brown, an \nagriculture and natural resources specialist at West Virginia State University Extension Service, who is also a \nMuslim.Tired of using the Internet to buy groceries, Brown saw the seminar as a chance to supply a growing ethnic \nmarket and bring new customers to state farmers.About 60 people \u201d farmers, grocery store owners, an imam and a \nrabbi \u201d met recently for a seminar on getting West Virginia meat onto the tables of Muslims, which included a crash \ncourse on halal.Meaning \u0153lawful or \u0153permitted, halal encompasses far more than food. But in dietary matters, it \nestablishes which animals can be eaten and how they must be slaughtered \u201d conscious, upright, the throat cut and \nthe blood drained.At first glance, West Virginia seems an unlikely laboratory for such an experiment. With only a \nhandful of mosques, few people here make big plans for Eid al-Fitr, which concludes the sacred month of \nRamadan, or attend many aqeeqahs, a ceremony held after a childs birth.\u0153If you look at West Virginias population \nas a whole, youre just a bunch of white people who come from Northern Europe and dont eat sheep or goat, Susan \nSchoenian told the crowd. Schoenian is a sheep and goat expert with the University of Maryland Extension \nService.West Virginias demographics are atypical \u201d with a population roughly 95 percent white, its one of the least \ndiverse states in the country.But there are pockets of the state \u201d Charleston, the university towns of Morgantown \nand Huntington \u201d where the Muslim population is growing.On average, American Muslims are younger, better \neducated and more affluent than their non-Muslim neighbors, which is music to a marketers ears.\u0153Theres more \ndemand than supply here right now, said Rich Durham, who once raised goats and sheep in Pinch and is getting \nback into it.Durhams wife, Pam, also noted that the relatively small market in West Virginia is a good fit for \u0153mini-\nfarms like hers.Exporting the meat to states with larger Muslim populations is not an option yet. Until recently, \nfederal law banned interstate shipment of meat that hadnt been inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nwhich typically happens only at larger plants.Although the law has changed, federal rules allowing more interstate \ncommerce havent been formulated yet, said West Virginia Department of Agriculture spokesman Buddy Davidson, \nso the old prohibition remains.Even in West Virginia, though, theres growing demand. Families routinely call Imam \nEhteshamul Haque, the spiritual leader of the local Muslim community, looking for lambs or goat on special \noccasions such as Eid al-Fitr or for an aqeeqah.Right now, Haque has to find a Muslim or halal-friendly butcher in \nanother state. Generally, they wont do business unless its a large order.\u0153Sometimes they come late, sometimes \nthey bring stuff we dont want, Haque said.Ahmed Barkiya, owner of Barakah International Groceries in Charleston, \nmakes twice-monthly trips to Detroit to meet his customers demand for halal meats. The seminar let him meet local \nsuppliers, and get a statewide directory of farms.Supplying the animals is important, but there are still problems, \nespecially when it comes to the actual slaughtering. Animals killed for halal meat cant be processed in \nslaughterhouses at the same time as swine, which is forbidden for Muslims.In the absence of a halal \nslaughterhouse among West Virginias 24 state-inspected abattoirs, theres the option of \u0153on-farm slaughter, in \nwhich a customer buys the animal, kills it and butchers it on the farm.It can be done, but as Schoenian told the \ncrowd, \u0153No one likes to know youre killing a goat in your garage.If farmers see enough of a boost in business from \nthe halal market, though, they can think about investing in things like mobile abattoirs. For the time being, the \npeople in baseball caps and the people in head scarves just seem pleased to have found each other.\u0153Todays \nfarmer has to adapt, Gardner said. \u0153If you try to do business the way you did 30 years ago, youre going to be left \nbehind.\n\nhttp://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=86857\nhttp://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j4khkr2cJaZVTbbTIRjiGPuAsZkgD95SVMB00\n\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Canada: the Bad-Idea QuartetCanada has six living former prime ministers. So when four of them get \ntogether to urge the current federal government to incorporate a \u0153green stimulus package into the \nupcoming budget, the joint effort sounds pretty impressive \u00a6 until you realize that among the four of them \u201d \nJoe Clark, John Turner, Kim Campbell and Paul Martin \u201d they spent just 42 months in office.Thats a total of \nthree-and-a-half years, less the a full term for a typical majority government. Only two of them \u201d Messrs. \nClark and Martin \u201d were ever elected to the job. And only one \u201d Mr. Martin \u201d spent as much as a year \n(actually, 26 months) as PM. If these folks have any special expertise in the field of environmentalism, they \nhid it well during their tenures..(Tellingly, the two living former prime ministers who did win majorities \u201d \nBrian Mulroney and Jean Chr\u00e9tien \u201d were not party to the call for environmentally friendly spending.)This \nweek, big unions, left-wing think-tanks and environmental groups put the less-than-impressive assemblage of \nformer leaders together in order to flog their $41-billion wish list of budget initiatives. (One is reminded of record \nproducers putting boy bands together. Which one, we wonder, is the bad boy?)Its the second time in less than six \nmonths that the quartet have lent their signatures to an environmental initiative designed to embarrass the \ngovernment of Stephen Harper. The first time was back in September, during the federal election campaign, when \nthe same four ex-prime ministers joined with Naomi Klein, Margaret Atwood, union, student and ethnic leaders to \npush an initiative known as \u0153Time to Get Serious on Climate Change, an effort that fell with a thud as soon as it \nwas launched.Like most calls for green spending, this current demand for eco-based stimulus is big on rhetoric and \nshort on detail. For instance, Rick Smith, executive director of Environmental Defence, one of the campaigns \nsponsoring organizations, called the package a \u0153no-brainer that would combat both the recession and global \nwarming: \u0153There are jobs just waiting to be created and businesses poised to grow. Really? Where?Much of the \ncampaigns projections for new jobs and economic growth are based on magic-wand reasoning that imagines the \nonly barrier between us and a post-industrial, green nirvana to be a lack of imagination and public funding. If we just \nthrow enough federal cash at the problem, the theory goes, the dream of a carbon-free future will wondrously \nmaterialize.Its true that if Ottawa spent a few billion a year over the next five years \u201d as envisioned by such a plan \u201d \nreimbursing businesses for the cost of retrofitting their offices and plants to be more energy efficient in the process, \nthere would be some temporary economic activity generated, some jobs, perhaps even a few new renovation \nbusinesses. But would the money necessarily produce economically sustainable industry, or merely provide a one-\noff cash transfer to businesses that happen to be well-positioned to exploit a fashionable cause?Most likely, as with \nany tax-funded, make-work project, the highest priority would be visibility and vote-winning. The money would go to \nthose projects likeliest to produce the biggest publicity bang, rather than generate the most efficient economic \nreturn. Long-term, very little would be accomplished.Rather than let unions, eco-activists, left-wing economists and \nfailed politicians decide where any stimulus package should go, the Conservative government would be well \nadvised to lower taxes and remove burdensome regulations on all consumers and business. That way, millions of \nordinary Canadians and hundreds of thousands of business will be unleashed to show the markets (and the \ninnovators) where to go.If private actors want to use their cash to go after green dividends, good luck to them. If \nthey dont, good luck to them equally. Either way, lets not let a set of four unsuccessful prime ministers \u201d notable \nmainly for providing leadership Canadians didnt want \u201d decide how to spend taxpayer money.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Canada/US: A Godly LeaderWhen Stephen Harper was first elected Prime Minister, he began ending his \nspeeches with the phrase \u0153God Bless Canada.

The court takes a hard line against the radical politician Geert \nWilders and issued an extensively outlined order to charge Wilders with hate speech and inciting discrimination. \nThat a lower court is now at liberty to give a dissenting verdict, after the appeals court has already ruled in such \nstrong wording, is an illusion. The limits on freedom of speech for politicians have hereby been set.So for years to \ncome, the courtroom will be the most important arena of debate about Muslims in the Netherlands. The focus will be \non the criminal nature of Wilders statements first, and only second on their validity \u201d or lack thereof. That is not \nanything to look forward to. Further escalation and polarisation are on the horizon.NRC Handelsblad has stated \nbefore that the position of Muslims in the Netherlands is not so weak that the criminal justice system needs \nto protect them against Wilders. The open political debate offers enough space to put him in his place. The \nEuropean Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has approved curtailing offensive political statements in several \nEuropean member states. But only if sanctions against such statements are proportional \u201d usually very limited. If the \nDutch penal code is to come into play here at any point, sanctions can therefor only be restricted. Otherwise they \nare deemed by Strasbourg to be illegal.The grand words used by the Dutch court are disproportionate in that \nregard. The judges set themselves up as the protectors of the \u0153foundation of a stable democracy. These \nmagistrates are rejecting not so much the offensive rhetoric used, but the very existence of Wilders \npopulist right-wing party (PVV). However right the court may be regarding its characterisation of Wilders \noffending statements, his right to voice them remains of paramount importance. The historical comparisons \nthat the court draws with 1930s anti-semitism is likewise unfortunate. Undoubtedly the law against hate speech was \nintroduced in that period with good intentions, out of concern for \u02dcpoisoning the hearts and minds of the public. But \nthat legislation created an adverse affect, rather than a positive one. The threat of that happening again is \nconsiderable.The court considers Wilders comparisons between Islam and Nazism to be insulting to such a \ndegree that freedom of speech should be limited. Yet why would it be acceptable to refer to Stalin or Pol \nPot, but not to Hitler, in this debate? Is it because Hitler occupied the Netherlands? And that everyone who \nis compared to him is automatically considered a traitor? That is indeed insulting. Yet outside the realm of \nnational history, this use of exceptions is indefensible. The Dutch courts have set themselves up for a long \nand unproductive debate, reminiscent of \u02dcThe People vs. Larry Flint. This time not on porn but on politics. \nThe prosecution of Wilders might therefore be the beginning of a never-ending story. \n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           EU Expected to Strike Iranian Opposition From Terror ListThe European Union is expected to strike the main \nIranian opposition group in exile off its list of terrorist organisations on Monday, EU officials said. A decision by EU \nforeign ministers to drop the group, the Peoples Mujahedeen of Iran [PMOI, a militant Islamic Socialist terrorist \norganization, also known as Mojahedin-e-Khalq, MEK], from its terror blacklist would bring to an end a long legal \nbattle.The Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance ruled last month that the EU had wrongly frozen the funds of \nthe opposition group and violated its rights by not justifying why it was placed on the list.It was the third such ruling \nby Europes second-highest tribunal.According to a draft document seen by AFP Friday, the EU will adopt a new \nblacklist \u201d a move which is necessary each semester \u201d as the current one expires next month. But it will also say: \n\u0153Following the judgement of the Court of First Instance\u00a6 (PMOI) has not been included in the lists of persons, \ngroups and entities.Founded in 1965 with the aim of replacing first the shah and then the clerical regime in Iran, the \nPMOI \u201d now led by exiled Iran opposition figure Maryam Rajavi \u201d has in the past operated an armed group inside \nIran. It was the armed wing of the France-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) but it renounced \nviolence in June 2001.In a statement, Rajavi, who lives freely in France, expressed hope that the \u0153EU council \navoids appeasement of the mullahs regime, abides by court ruling, and officially announces removal of PMOI from \nthe terror list.Over the last weeks, PMOI supporters have held regular rallies outside the European Council building \nin Brussels where the talks will take place. The EU decision will come as a so-called \u0153A point at Mondays meeting. \n\u0153A points are usually rubber-stamped without discussion as the details have already been ironed out by \nambassadors, but nations could still raise objections.\u0153Technically, any member state can pop up at the last \nmoment and say, actually we have a problem with this A point.

For the EUs part the messages sent out were unequivocal: \u02dcWithout a return \nto normal life, the Gaza situation will blow up again warned Karl Bildt, Swedens foreign minister. \u02dcIsrael has to \nunderstand that you cant leave Gaza imprisoned: without open borders the Strip takes on explosive potential, Jean \nAsselborn, Luxembourgs foreign minister joined in. The same point was made by the High Representative for \nForeign Affairs, Javier Solana and Commissioner for External Relations, Benita Ferrero-Waldner. On the political \nanalysis front, the voice of Finlands foreign minister, Alexander Stubb, was not part of the chorus, saying that a \nglobal solution is impossible without Hamas. \u0153We have to start reflecting on how to get all sides around the \nnegotiating table, Stubb said. \u0153There is no possibility of have a permanent peace unless everyone is around the \nsame table. But it wont happen soon. It will take time. There was a clear no-go on this point from Livni, according to \nwhom Hamas can play no part in the solution being sought between Israelis and Palestinians. \u0153 Hamas defends \nthe logic of hatred and terrorism. We are fighting terrorism, not the Palestinians, Livni stated. From the Israeli \nminister, whose arrival in Brussels was the target of a prostest by a group of Palestinians in front of the Council, \nthere came a impassioned defence of the Israeli amry which, she said, \u0153fights while respecting international values \nand laws.

A week ago, the minister explained to a hearing of the Senates constitutional affairs \ncommittee why there was a need to review public order regulations for events that attract thousands of people into \nthe streets. He made specific reference to the prayers by hundreds of Muslims in Milans Piazza Duomo during the \npro-Gaza march. He said: \u0153Demonstrations like the recent ones for Palestine pose new questions with respect to \nwhat we were used to. In the past, we prevented marches from passing various kinds of premises, including those \nof political parties. Its now time to assess whether marches should pass places of worship. Mr Maroni added that \n\u0153there is no wish to offer a repressive response but it is necessary to give full implementation both to the right to \ndemonstrate and to the right of non-demonstrators to use their own town.NO MORE DUOMO INCIDENTS \u201d The \nproposal was reiterated at question time in the Lower Chamber when Mr Maroni replied to a question by Riccardo \nDe Corato, the deputy mayor of Milan, who wanted to know what initiatives the minister was taking to prevent \nsimilar situations in future. Mr Maroni replied: \u0153I have drafted a directive so that episodes like the demonstration \noutside the Duomo in Milan will not happen again. The draft under consideration will give prefects clear instructions \nto deny demonstrations access to specific areas, such as places of worship above all, but also shopping malls, \nsupermarkets, monuments and sites of public interest. Meanwhile in Rome, the mayor, prefect and trade unions are \nalready working on a project to exclude demonstrations from the city centre and reduce the consequent disruption. \nThe rules, however, will not be hard and fast. Assessments will be made case by case and specific precedents will \nbe taken into account when authorisation is granted for routes indicated by demonstrators. The directive is \nexpected to include further measures, such as sureties against damage. The current proposal requires the \norganisers of demonstrations to make a deposit which would not be returned if any damage was caused during the \nmarch. The aim of the measure is to encourage organisers themselves to isolate the violent extremists who often \nhide among other demonstrators.English translation by Giles Watson           www.watson.it\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: C.

Despite the fact that \nthe knowledge of foreign languages is a necessity, almost half of the Spanish people, 49.7%, admit to ignore them \ncompletely. In particular, 64.4% of Andalusi\u00e0s residents, 63.7% of Cantabri\u00e0s residents, 47.4% of Galici\u00e0s \nresidents, 42.3% of Madrids residents; the percentage decreases for the inhabitants of Catalonia (23.7%) and the \nBalearic islands (24.6%). Above average, in terms of knowledge of languages other than Spanish, also the \nresidents of Valencia (51.1%), Navarre (51.4%), the Basque Country (55.6%) and Aragon (55.7%). The income per \ncapita and the coexistence of the two official languages in the community are the two factors which have the \ngreatest influence in the disparity in the knowledge of foreign languages.

None of the indigenous Kashmiri organisations has \nlinked the Mumbai attack to Jammu & Kashmir. Yet Mr Miliband sought to provide legitimacy to the LeTs terrorist \nattack by linking it to the \u02dcKashmir issue, disregarding the fact that the attack, as seen from the brutal murder of \nnine Jewish and 12 nationals of Western countries, which have contributed forces to the Nato contingent in \nAfghanistan, was part of the global jihadi agenda unrelated to either Jammu & Kashmir or the grievances of the \n\nhttp://www.ansamed.info/en/news/ME02.@AM50982.html\nhttp://www.ansamed.info/en/news/ME03.@AM18464.html\nhttp://www.dailypioneer.com/151294/UK-a-sanctuary-for-jihadis.html\n\n\nIndian Muslims.The shocking attempt by Mr Miliband to play down the murder of 138 Indians and 25 foreign \nnationals committed by the Pakistani terrorists should not have come as a surprise to those aware of the historic \nlinks of the British intelligence with the Mirpuri migrants from Pakistani-occupied Kashmir in the UK and their \nimportant role during elections in certain constituencies which traditionally return Labour candidates to the House of \nCommons with the support of the Mirpuri vote-bank.After Pakistan and Afghanistan, the UK has been traditionally \nthe largest sanctuary to foreign terrorists and extremists. Everybody, who is somebody in the world of terrorism, has \nfound a rear base in the UK \u201d the Khalistanis in the past, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Mirpuris from \nPakistan-occupied Kashmir, the Chechens, the Al Muhajiroun, the Hizbut Tehrir etc. Having allowed such a medley \nof terrorists and extremists to operate unchecked from their territory for so long, the British intelligence just does not \nhave a correct estimate of how many sleeper cells are operating from their country and of which \norganisations.Since persons of Pakistani origin have been playing an increasingly active role in promoting the \nactivities of Al Qaeda, it is necessary to analyse the nature of migration from Pakistan to the UK and the US. \nMuslims from Pakistan constitute the single largest Muslim migrant group from the sub-continent in both the UK and \nthe US \u201d followed by Indian and Bangladeshi Muslims. There are estimated to be about 7,00,000 Muslims of \nPakistani origin in the UK. No estimate is available in respect of the US.The largest migrant group from Pakistan in \nthe UK are Punjabi-speaking Muslims \u201d from Pakistani Punjab as well as from the POK. The migrants from the PoK \nare called Mirpuris. They are not ethnic Kashmiris, but Punjabi-speaking migrants from the Pakistani Punjab, whose \nfamilies had settled down in the Mirpur area of the PoK for generations. They were essentially small farmers and \nlandless labourers, who lost their livelihood as a result of the construction of the Mangla dam. They, therefore, \nmigrated to West Europe \u201d the largest number to the UK and a smaller number to France, Germany and the \nScandinavian countries. Many of them preferred to go to the UK because it already had a large Punjabi-speaking \ncommunity from Pakistani Punjab. The initial Mirpuri migrants, who hardly spoke English, felt themselves \ncomfortable in a Punjabi-speaking environment.As the number of Muslims of Pakistani origin in the UK increased, \nmosques came up to cater to their religious needs. Till 1977, these mosques were headed by clerics from the more \ntolerant Barelvi Sunni sect. When Gen Zia-ul-Haq, a devout Deobandi, captured power in Pakistan in 1977, he \nembarked on a policy of marginalising the influence of Barelvi clerics not only in Pakistan, but also in Europe and \nincreasing the influence of the rabid Deobandis. He inducted Deobandis into the Education Department as Arab \nteachers and into the armed forces to cater to the religious needs of the military personnel. He encouraged and \nhelped the Deobandis to take over the mosques in Pakistan and in the UK by replacing the Barelvis. With the \ninduction of an increasing number of Deobandis started the process of the Arabisation/Wahabisation of the Muslims \nin Pakistan and of the Pakistani diaspora in the UK.The intelligence agencies of the US and the UK went along with \nZias policy of Arabising/Wahabising the Muslims of Pakistan because this contributed to an increase in the flow of \njihadi terrorists to fight against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. Till 1983, the members of the Pakistani diaspora in \nthe UK were considered a largely law-abiding people. The first signs of the radicalisation of the diaspora appeared \nin 1983 when a group of jihadi terrorists kidnapped Ravi Mhatre, an Indian diplomat posted in the Indian Assistant \nHigh Commission in Birmingham, and demanded the release of Maqbool Butt, the leader of the Jammu & Kashmir \nLiberation Front, who was then awaiting execution in the Tihar Jail in Delhi following his conviction on charges of \nmurder. When the Government of India rejected their demand, the terrorists killed Mhatre and threw his dead body \ninto one of the streets. This kidnapping and murder was allegedly orchestrated by Amanullah Khan, a Gilgiti from \nPakistan. He was assisted by some Mirpuris of the Pakistani diaspora. The British were uncooperative with India in \nthe investigation of this case and declined to hand over those involved in the kidnapping and murder to India for \ninvestigation and prosecution. By closing their eyes to the terrorist activities of the Mirpuris from their territory, they \nencouraged the further radicalisation of the diaspora.Just as the radicalisation of the Muslims of Pakistan suited the \nUS-UK agenda in Afghanistan, the radicalisation of the diaspora in the UK, particularly the Mirpuris, suited their \nagenda for balkanising Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Many Pakistanis from the UK went to the training camps of the \nHarkat-ul-Ansar (now called the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen) and the LeT in Pakistan and got themselves trained with the \nknowledge and complicity of the British. They then went to Bosnia and Kosovo to wage a jihad against the Serbs \nwith arms and ammunition and explosives allegedly supplied by the Iranian intelligence with the tacit consent of the \nClinton Administration and paid for by Saudi intelligence.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           UK: 80 Foreign Murderers Welcomed to Britain\u00a6Albanian killers allowed to stay despite being on Interpol \n\u02dcwanted listEighty foreign killers are exploiting the chaotic asylum system to set up home in Britain, it was \n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1127084/80-foreign-murderers-welcomed-Britain-Albanian-killers-allowed-stay-despite-Interpol-wanted-list.html\n\n\nrevealed yesterday.The convicted murderers from Albania have been given British passports despite being officially \nlisted as \u02dcwanted by Interpol.Most slipped across the Channel from Calais to Dover hidden in the back of lorries on \nferries. They used bogus names and false papers to claim asylum, often pretending to be from the war-torn Balkan \nrepublic of Kosovo.The scandal came to light when Albanias chief of police complained that 100 criminals from his \ncountry have been granted British citizenship and now live here.The police chief said the criminals have been \nallowed to stay even though the Albanian government has informed the Home Office of the true identities of the \nmen and their crimes, which also include rape and robbery.Many of the convicted criminals have been living in the \nUK for up to ten years and have started new families here.As the revelations exposed the shambles within the \nasylum system yet again, campaigners expressed their outrage.Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said: \u02dcIt is a \nreal concern that people accused of, or even convicted of, very serious crimes should apparently find it so easy to \ngain asylum in Britain.Rose Dixon, of victim group Support After Murder and Manslaughter, added: \u02dcIm astounded. \nIf this is correct, Im appalled that these people are walking the streets of Britain. I think we should be told a lot more \nabout this.After the Home Office was informed about the true identity of the asylum seekers, extradition \nproceedings against them were lodged by the Albanian Government.But complex legal arguments and the need to \nfind interpreters and psychologists has led to lengthy delays.Albanian criminals use myriad loopholes in the \nextradition laws to avoid being sent home.Their lawyers often claim they will suffer human rights abuse on their \nreturn, or that trials in their absence were unfair because they could not give their side.The situation is even more \ncomplicated if they have become British citizens. Under the Human Rights Act 1988, this gives them further \nprotection against being removed because their family life would be disrupted.Even when a case does finally go \nthrough a British court, it is the Home Secretary who decides the fate of the asylum seeker.Meanwhile, many \ncontinue to live off state hand-outs while others have gone on to commit crimes in Britain.Ahmet Prenci, the \nAlbanian chief of police, said he felt as if all his forces hard work in tracking down the culprits had been in \nvain.\u02dcWe have made a list of our people who are hiding in the UK, he said. \u02dcThere are 100 criminals, and \nmore than 80 per cent are wanted for murder and have been convicted in absentia.\u02dcThey have been given \nBritish citizenship despite our efforts to extradite them to serve prison sentences in our country.\u02dcWe are \nworking intensively to identify, locate, and then to arrest wanted Albanian people in Britain. Unfortunately, \nmany have British passports obtained after they claimed asylum by pretending to be Kosovans.\u02dcWe are \nunhappy that the courts repeatedly refuse extradition of these criminals. There is no reason for an Albanian \ncitizen who has been involved in a crime not to be punished. Mr Prenci spoke out as a report by the National \nAudit Office revealed that Britain is struggling to cope with the growing numbers of asylum seekers..The UK Border \nAgency is overwhelmed with cases.

Roger Jenkins, the former international athlete turned the banks \nMiddle East fixer, and Amanda Staveley, the ex-model and now a financial power-broker with the Middle Eastern \nGulf rulers, had concluded a remarkable deal.While Barclays main British rivals, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS \nand Lloyds TSB, were forced to go begging to the British Government for assistance, the bank had persuaded the \nroyal families of Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, to stump up \u00a37 billion.It was a \ntriumph for Staveley. The former girlfriend of Prince Andrew collected \u00a340 million for brokering the coup. Internally, \nat Barclays, there were congratulations, too, for Jenkins and for John Varley, Barclays CEO. For Varley, the \ninjection of Arab cash at such a difficult time in the markets was a personal vindication. A dry, somewhat ascetic \nfigure, connected by marriage to one of the Quaker families that played a part in Barclays rise, he had always had \nto work that bit harder to prove himself to a sceptical City.The comparison was forever being made between Varley, \nwho looks like an English country parson and talks in hushed tones, and the go-getting American, Bob Diamond, \nwho runs Barclays investment banking side. Repeated reports of the perceived rivalry between the pair \u201d denied by \nthem both \u201d continually niggled.This shock Arab support was a victory for Varley, throwing up the possibility of \nBarclays forming strategic relationships in the richest region of the world. It was a slap in the face for the banks \ncompetitors, for the Government that was trying to bring its own influence to bear on Barclays, and to Varleys \ncritics.Almost three months later and Barclays shares are at their lowest level since 1985. For days now, the shares \nhave been falling. Speculation is rife in the City that the bank, which did not require an injection of government \ncapital, may now have to swallow its pride and seek help.But for Varley and his colleagues, there is a worse \nrealisation. Under the terms of the Arab injection, they are in danger of ceding control of the bank to their new Gulf \nfriends. In return for their money, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan from Abu Dhabi and his coinvestors \nreceived convertible notes, which are exchanged for shares.They agreed to wait seven months for conversion to \nshares at a price of 153p. However, if at any time before 30 June, Barclays raises more money at a lower price, the \nArabs can exchange their notes. As Barclays shares have since slumped to 66p, they could almost triple their \nholding \u201d which would give them around 55 per cent of the British bank.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Gaia [|Return to headlines]\n\n           UK: John Hutton \u02dcDeceived MPs Over Navy CutsJohn Hutton has been accused of deceiving Parliament \nover his explanation for a two-year delay in the Royal Navys aircraft carrier programme.The allegation came after \nLockheed Martin, the American defence company, contradicted his account.

The MoD insisted that the delay in the carrier \nprogramme would not add to the cost of the order.The MoD is expected to place an order for up to 150 Joint Strike \nFighters at a cost of about \u00a312 billion.

The news has been delivered personally by the prime \nminister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al-Thani, on Al-Jazeera, the television channel based in Doha.While \nthe Israeli army continues its withdrawal from Gaza, and another night has gone by peacefully, if the minister of \nQatar sees an overcoming of the divisions revealed in all their profundity precisely by events in Gaza, from various \ndirections there is emphasis of the disagreements within the Arab world. And Hamas itself is being asked to learn \nits lesson and choose which path it will take, that of permanent conflict or that of the search for peace \u201d meaning \nwhether it will follow the direction pointed out by Iran, or by Egypt.The pan-Arab newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, in an \neditorial by Abdul Rahman Al-Rashed, general manager of the satellite television station Al-Arabiya, affirms that the \nArab front \u0153seems even more divided than it was during the war in Lebanon in 2006, and the attack by Hezbollah \nagainst the Sunni population in Beirut in May of 2008. \u0153The leaders of the Hamas movement- because there is not \none single leader that can be addressed- have two choices with regards to their [foreign] relations that will decide \nthe fate of the movement, especially as they are aware of their strengths and weaknesses in confronting Israel. \n\u0153Hamas is facing a new history, and has been given another chance to review its position and chose between \nstaying in Irans camp, or returning to the Arab side.\u0153Hamas must be aware that they were used by Iran to attack \nthe Arabs in an unprecedented way that surpasses any previous antagonism. Iran has progressed as a result of \nthis, and made advancements on the ground to an extremely dangerous point, which includes the attempt to create \nchaos in Arab countries opposed to it, and explicitly seeking to destroy Saudi Arabia, and incite the overthrow of the \nEgyptian regime. Such audacity serves only to unite Arab countries against Hamas. However it is also just and \nreasonable to say that the door is still open; it is up to the Hamas movement to choose between returning to the \nArab family or remaining a weapon in the hands of Iran.\u0153Hamas is in a good position, and must negotiate with \nitself with regards to its own relationship with the Arabs, who can only respect Hamas and ensure its political and \nmaterial rights on Palestinian soil. Generally speaking, we know that Hamas is not a singular organization, despite \nthe similarity of its language and political fa\u00e7ade; there is Hamas the hostage to Damascus and Tehran and whose \nleaders live in hotels, and there is the Gazan Hamas who have paid a high price in order to fulfill the orders of their \nbrothers in Damascus, the results of which were always disastrous. The Gazan Hamas must chose between \nTehran or Cairo.On the divisions among Arabs, the Middle East Times notes in an editorial that if both the Israelis \n\nhttp://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=14264&size=A\n\n\nand Hamas claim that they are victorious, \u0153who are the losers? The Arabs, of course. Why? The Arab world \ncomes out of this war far more divided than it has been in decades. Egypt and Syria, the two powerhouses in the \nMiddle East remain as far apart as they have ever been. \u0153And one side has been working overtime trying to \nconvince the rest of the Arab world that they should sever ties with the Jewish state (Syrias view), while Egypts \napproach to the conflict is to keep negotiations with Israel going.\u0153The Arab world continues to show its inability to \npresent a unified front despite the rhetoric paid at the altar of Arab unity. They gather, they meet, they argue, and \nthey issue communiqu\u00e9s, all without any real substance and come out in worse shape than they went in. Would the \nArabs have learned from mistakes of the past? Hardly, as they keep committing them again and again and again. \nWar has been tried for over 60 years and without great success.

The \nUNRWA aid is shipped from the port in Ashdod via Israeli trucks to the Kerem Shalom crossing, where agency \nofficials deliver the trucks to UNRWA warehouses.Hamas and its rival Fatah faction have accused each other of \nstealing the aid, with Hamas charging that Fatah is diverting aid to Arabs in Judea and Samaria.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: VH [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Israel: Huge Natural Gas Find Off Israel CoastOfficial hails \u02dchistoric moment that could change \nnationNEW YORK \u201d A huge deep-water natural gas find off the coast of Israel promises to be a boon to the Jewish \n\nhttp://www.ansamed.info/en/news/ME01.@AM34447.html\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28798994/\nhttp://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129550\nhttp://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=86865\n\n\nstates economy as well as a stimulus to other developers searching for offshore oil and natural gas in the \nMediterranean.Noble Energy, a New York Stock Exchange-listed company, has discovered an estimated more than \n3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in three high-quality reservoirs drilled in the companys Tamar No. 1 well in the \nMediterranean Sea, about 56 miles off the Israeli northern port of Haifa.Noble Energy drilled the Tamar No. 1 well to \na depth of about three miles, beneath 5,500 feet of water.The find is significant for those who believe the Bible \nindicates Israel is sitting on a massive oil reserve that would reshape the geopolitical structure of the Middle East. \n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Israel Readies for Fight Against War Crime ChargesPrime Minister Ehud Olmert has put the justice minister \nin charge of defending Israel against charges of war crimes during its 22-day Gaza assault, a government source \nsaid Friday.

Under a face-saving compromise finally hammered out on Jan. 20, \nRussias Gazprom has achieved its central objective of making Ukraine pay \u0153market prices for its gas, which will be \nlinked to the European average. But to sweeten the pill, Ukraine has notched a 20 percent discount during 2009. \nOther terms of the deal include a one-year freeze on transit fees charged by Ukraine and the elimination of \nRosUkrEnergo, a controversial trading outfit that has acted as intermediary in the Russia-Ukraine gas trade.Both \nparties are attempting to frame the outcome as a victory and are already disagreeing over the implications for gas \nprices. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has said the rate per 1,000 cubic meters will average $228 for \nthe full year \u201d well below the $280 predicted by Gazprom (though higher than the $179.50 that Ukraine paid last \nyear). With both sides already disagreeing about the deals economic implications, the possibility of future disputes \narising between the two countries certainly cannot be discounted. \u0153The big question mark is what happens if \nUkraine again runs into arrears, notes Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Russias Uralsib Bank.In any case, the long-\nterm impact of the dispute will go far beyond the immediate implications for energy relations between Russia and \nUkraine. Despite similarities with the previous bust-up in 2006, Western energy experts emphasize the latest \ndispute has been far more serious, with lasting implications for the European energy market. \u0153This has been the \nmost serious security event in relation to gas that has ever happened in Europe, says Jonathan Stern, director of \ngas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u0153It cannot be allowed to happen again.Exactly what the \nlong-term implications will be are still rather hard to fathom. It doesnt help that many fundamental facts about the \ndispute remain clouded in controversy \u201d including the key question of who was ultimately responsible for cutting off \nEuropes gas. While Russia accuses Ukraine of blocking Russian gas supplies to Europe during the dispute, the \nUkrainians say that it was actually the Russians who turned off the taps.Ukraine Shares the BlameGetting to the \nbottom of such matters has more than purely academic significance. For one thing, the threat of legal action by \nGazproms European customers remains real \u201d potentially exposing the company to huge claims for damages. The \ndebate about responsibility will also rumble on because it matters for the future of European energy policy. \u0153If its a \nUkraine problem, then pipelines bypassing Ukraine are one answer to it. If, however, its a Russia problem, it doesnt \nmatter where the pipelines (from Russia) go, says Oxfords Stern.Whats already clear is that, in notable contrast to \nthe 2006 spat that was widely blamed on Russia, this time Western observers have also pointed fingers at Ukraine. \n\u0153This time round, its clear that Ukrainian politicians have a lot to answer for, says Kash Burkett, energy and utilities \nanalyst at Datamonitor in London. The crisis coincides with intense political turmoil inside Ukraine, including open \nconflict between President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, which has seriously \ncomplicated negotiations with Russia.The problems in Ukraine mean the dispute is likely to add impetus to energy \nprojects that bypass the country. In particular, Russia backs the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic, a project \n51percent-owned by Gazprom, in partnership with Germanys BASF and E.ON and Dutch energy firm Gasunie. Yet \ndespite this positive news for Russias pet project, many Western experts predict that ultimately Russia and \nGazprom will turn out to be the biggest losers.They are mystified why, in response to Ukraines alleged pilfering \nof Russias gas, Gazprom apparently responded by cutting off all gas supplies through Ukraine to Europe. \n\u0153Thats the big question, says Pierre No\u00ebl, an energy policy expert at Cambridge University.. \u0153Large \nimporters of Russian gas in Western and Eastern Europe have been really scared by what has happened. \nThere will be lasting damage to Gazproms reputation. He predicts that European governments will now \ndiscourage major importers from increasing their exposure to Russian gas. \u00a6\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Russia: Journalists From Novaya Gazeta Are \u02dcAssassination TargetsJournalists on Russias leading \ninvestigative newspaper are being made targets for assassination in a bid to force its closure, one of its owners said \nyesterday.Alexander Lebedev said that at least three reporters on Novaya Gazeta, the opposition paper that also \nemployed Anna Politkovskaya, had been assigned bodyguards because of fears for their lives.He had asked the \nFederal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, to allow staff to carry guns after accusing the Russian \nstate of failing to protect them.Mr Lebedev, the new owner of the Evening Standard, was speaking out after the \nlawyer Stanislav Markelov was assassinated on a street in central Moscow.

Red streaks of light plunge toward targets over \nhalf a kilometre away. The armoured units in Vekaranj\u00e4rvi are conducting exercises at the Pahkaj\u00e4rvi shooting \nrange, which is known for its apocalyptically wide-open spaces.  They are equipped with some of the most modern \nequipment that the Finnish Army has: Swedish CV 9030 assault tanks, which operate well in the dark, and in the \nfog and rain.  The Defence Forces are pleased to show off Vekaranj\u00e4rvi, and no wonder. The garrison of 3,000 \nsoldiers is the biggest in Finland and it has the most modern equipment.  However, this is not the entire story about \nthe state of the Finnish Army.  As the terrain vibrates in Pahkaj\u00e4rvi, national defence is a hot topic in Helsinki.  \nFinnish foreign policy leaders are currently pushing through a new security and defence policy report, which should \n\nhttp://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=19834\nhttp://www.hs.fi/english/article/Sufficient+deterrence/1135242890285\n\n\ncome before Parliament in February.  The drafting of the secretive report is taking longer than expected. The main \nreason for this is that after a long period of stability, Finlands security environment has changed. But how? And \nwhat would be the appropriate reaction to the changes? These are the difficult questions of the report, which has \nbeen under preparation since the summer of 2007.  Some advance information has come out about the report. \nPrime Minister Matti Vanhanen (Centre) has said that there will be no NATO surprises. Applying for membership is \nbeing kept as a possibility, and option, which at least the present government will not invoke. Of the parties, only the \nNational Coalition Party is openly supporting membership in the alliance.  The generals have let it be understood \nthat maintaining a credible defence requires more money.  Adding confusion to the preparations of the report has \nbeen the war in Georgia, which took place in August. It showed that Russia is ready to use its military power in the \nterritory of a neighbouring country.  Georgia sparked debate on the state of regional defence in Finland.  Although \nFinland is not a member of any military alliance, experts insist that Finlands capacity to defend itself is better than \never.  \u0153Our credibility has improved with respect to others, says Major Jyrki Raitasalo, who is researching Finnish \nDefence at the Department of Strategy of the National Defence University.  The biggest factor in this is that \nFinlands neighbours have less capacity, in relative terms, than they did before.  Russia remains a great power, and \nis developing its armed forces. Nevertheless, its military capacity is but a shadow of the power of the Soviet Union. \nThe strength of the Russian Army in areas near Finland is a tenth of what it was.  Sweden has cut back on its land \nforces, and is focussing on crisis management. The money is going to Afghanistan.  Finland has also cut back on \nthe wartime strength of its armed forces, but not as much as the others. This country still relies on conscription, \nwhich is getting to be exceptional in Europe. A reservist army of 350,000 is one of the biggest in Europe.  However, \nthe Defence Forces face considerable challenges in the next decade. The price of military hardware has doubled in \nseven years. If the aim is to keep the forces well equipped, it is necessary either to increase spending, or to cut \nback further on the Defence Forces. Or then to look for help elsewhere\u00a6\u00a6But how long can Finland afford an \nindependent defence? How big, and how developed an armed forces will Finland be able to equip in the future.  \nWarfare is always a balancing act between numbers and technology. With modern weapons it is possible to replace \na large field army, but not endlessly.  In 1997, when the wartime readiness of the Defence Forces was 540,000. \nFinland now has just 350,000 reservists, and Chief of Defence Juhani Kaskeala has said that in the future, Finland \nwould have to get by with 250,000, and even that might be a bit too high.  Lieutenant General Matti Ahola (ret.), the \nformer Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Defence, feels that ten years from now, no country in Europe will be able to \nmaintain a credible defence on its own.  \u0153The options are either NATO or the EU.  However, the EU has not yet \ndeveloped into a defence alliance. So actually, it is NATO that is left.  In a poll conducted in 2007 nearly half of all \nmilitary officers in Finland said they were in favour of joining NATO. Only a fifth of the population at large supports \nNATO membership.  However, the officers point out that even as a member of NATO, Finland would have to take \ncare of its defence primarily by itself.  Meanwhile, Finland would have to be ready to participate in NATO operations \nin Afghanistan, for instance, or help a member state that has been attacked. In the worst case, Finland could end \nup being a party to a conflict between NATO and Russia.  Finland has already decided to take part in the NATO \nResponse Force, and in EU battle groups, even though most of the population oppose joining an alliance because \nthey do not want Finns to die in foreign conflicts.  International crisis management improves the battle-readiness of \nFinnish forces. But if there is to be full-fledged participation in the operations, they will require some input. That \neffort would undermine Finnish regional defence.  Jyri Raitasalo says that cooperation in crisis management is \npartly about identity building for Finland. The country wants to be a part of the West, and to share responsibility. \nRussia, on the other hand, has questions about the enthusiasm that the West has for crisis management forces.  \n\u0153In the view of the Russians, the Western countries are voluntarily marginalising their their armed forces. They feel \nthat Finland still has a capacity for traditional warfare. \u00a6\u00a6The nation fights, but for how long? How long could Finland \nhold out against forces of the Leningrad Military District, for instance?  \u0153For months. The relative strength is no \nproblem. With high technology it is possible to fight against an overwhelming enemy, says Matti Ahola.  \u0153 But if the \nwar lasts more than three months, supremacy in war materiel will decide.  Finland would run out of munitions.  More \nmissiles would be needed already in a few weeks. In the last war, they were manufactured at home, but now they \nneed to be bought from abroad, and if there is a crisis in the world, the arms trade becomes more complex.  In an \nextended war a great power will be able to move reinforcements to the conflict areas.  In addition, Finland is rather \ndefenceless, if someone decides to fire ballistic missiles at us. Such missiles often contain nuclear warheads.  In \nthe view of researcher Pekka Visuri (Colonel, ret.) The idea of a nuclear attack against Finland is preposterous, and \nthere is no point to try to set up defences against it.  \u0153If we were alone in a conflict with a great power, it would be \na disaster. On the other hand, in an extensive international crisis, in which the great powers were pitted against \n\n\n\neach other, the Finnish Defence Forces are set up to prevent an attack.  Politics would seem to be the best defence \nafter all; to act in such a way that nobody feels that there is a threat against them from Finnish territory.  Nobody \nseems to anticipate any answers to big questions, at least from any new reports. There is no intention to join NATO, \nbut on the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that significant amounts of money would be spent on defence. Finland \nis looking to see in what direction the EU and NATO are developing, and what Russia is doing. Maybe everything \nwill turn out all right.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           India: \u02dcPartial War Looming Between China, India?Military suggests border dispute is \u02dcthreat to BeijingA \nborder dispute could become the spark that launches China and India into a military conflict, with Chinese \nstrategists resurrecting the concept of a \u0153partial war to recover what they call \u0153Southern Tibet, the region India \ncalls \u0153Arunachal Pradesh, according to a report from Joseph Farahs G2 Bulletin.The area in northeast India has a \n650-mile unfenced border with China, which lays claim to the region and refers to it as Southern Tibet.Some of the \nthreats are emanating from Chinese publications that reflect the opinion of the Chinese leadership without making \nofficial comments.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           India: Kingdom of the ForgottenChristians face forced ejection from refugee camps, deathNEW YORK \nCITY (Assist News Service) \u201d The headlines blare genocide, persistent and systematically planned.

Land was central and crucial in the \ntribal worldview. Culture, religion, history, spirituality and even the Sacred Being cannot be conceived without land. \nBy attributing the label Vanvasi, or people of the forest, the administration is denying these Indian indigenous \npeople their basic human right to land. Tribals land is linked to their identity; hence land alienation leads to a loss of \nidentity. Industrialists have brought huge amounts of tribal land, and are exploiting the natural resources, which \ncannot be renewed. The problem has two dimensions. First, the tribals are duped out of their landholdings. Second, \nthe families thus rendered landless are then forced to encroach further into the forests. Another even more pressing \nproblem is the saffronization or Hinduization of these tribals. These tribals are even being alienated from their \nreligious identity \u201d they are not Hindus.\u0153We have a scheduled visit to the indigenous communities in the Amazon \nand two days in Rio de Janeiro, to have exposure to the indigenous people in that area. The right to food is an \nimportant aspect to be considered.Fr. Xavier Jeyaraj (in the photo) is secretary for social action for the Jesuits, and \nis leading a group of 29 delegates from India, including tribals and Dalits. He tells AsiaNews that \u0153the government \ndenies the indigenous status of the tribals in India. Calling the tribals \u02dcscheduled tribes is an injustice done to the \npeople even in the constitution. It needs to be fought in a collective way. The same goes for the Dalits, who have \nbeen denied their basic human rights in many ways. In India, economic advantages, jobs, and free education are \ngranted on the basis of membership in a particular ethnic group. For this reason, classifying a community as part of \none group rather than another can lead to the loss or recognition of important rights.\u0153The problems of tribals in \nIndia or the indigenous people in Brazil or any other Latin American countries is very similar, Fr. Xavier continues. \n\u0153Our effort is to recognize the struggles of the indigenous all over the world and to join hands with them in the first \nstep. Such collective consensus building on the issues of tribals / indigenous people, reflection with them is \nnecessary. The result may not be visible immediately, but building the peoples power to speak truth to power at \nvarious levels, in the state and in the centre, is a must.Fr. Xavier also intends to denounce, at the WSF: \u0153A) \nAlienation of natural resources, particularly land, forest, water etc from the tribals in the name of so-called \n\u02dcdevelopment. We call this \u02dcdevelopmental terrorism that is going on in the country. We will highlight various ways \nin which the people have been displaced and are terrorised to leave their land for industries and multinational \ncorporations. B) The economic and political fundamentalism that uses religion to divide people. The attack on the \nminorities (Christians in Orissa) and the causes behind such attacks.

He said he had \nconveyed to Yafei that Islamabad would endorse whatever China told New Delhi on Pakistans behalf.The \nstatement, which was made by Qureshi during a reception at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, has raised \nquestion marks over Yafeis visit to India on January 5 because New Delhi has gone out of its way to ensure that \nChina did not act as mediator. Yafei had visited Pakistan on December 29 and wanted to visit New Delhi directly \nfrom Islamabad. New Delhi, however, did not allow this, fearing that it would give the impression that China was \ntrying to mediate between the two countries. Yafei later came to New Delhi on January 5 and advised India to \ncontinue the dialogue process with Pakistan.\u0153We have complete trust, mutual understanding and convergence of \nviews on bilateral, regional and international issues, Qureshi said, adding that Pakistans ties with China would \nflourish in the days ahead.There was no official reaction from the foreign ministry in New Delhi, but a senior official \nsaid there was no question of China playing mediator and what Qureshi had said was his flight of imagination.The \nWhite House in a foreign policy document released soon after Barack Obama took over as President had said that \nwhile non-military aid to Pakistan would be increased, Islamabad would be held accountable for security along the \nPak-Afghan border.

According \nto Libert\u00e9, the Algerian navy arrested 1335 (1327 of which are Algerian) last year at sea compared to 1259 arrests \nin 2007. Just over 1,000 migrants were stopped at sea in 2006, a black year marked by a 70% increase in arrests, \ncompared to 335 arrests in 2005. The number of bodies pulled out of these by the navy also increased to 98 in \n2008. In 2007 61 dead bodies were found off the Algerian coasts, compared to 73 in 2006, and 29 in 2005. Despite \nappeals from \u0153all the families in Annaba of the missing Harraga \u0153, it is impossible to obtain reliable data on the \nhundreds missing at sea. Investigations have been called for particularly by the Algerian League for Human Rights \n(Laddh) after reporting the illegal imprisonment of thousands of young Algerian migrants in prisons and secret \ndetention centres in Libya and Tunisia, and at least 600 dead bodies in the Almeria and Alicante morgues.

Of the 1335 harraga arrested, only 636 were \ncaught in the east, and 442 of these just in Annaba. According to the Algerian press, intensified inspections along \nthe western coast has discouraged the use of the route between Oran (400km west of Algiers) and Spain, and has \npushed those looking to immigrate to Annaba, which in a few short months has become the crossroads for these \nvoyages of hope. According to the report, even if cases of the elderly, women, and children have drawn attention, \nthe majority of migrants caught at sea are Algerians between 21-29 years old. In a recent poll promoted by Libert\u00e9, \nabout 50% of the Algerians between 15 and 34 said that they are \u0153ready to depart while 81% said they know \nsomeone who is getting ready to depart. Very few migrants of other nationalities choose make the voyage: only 8 \nAfghans, Moroccans, Malians, and Nigerians have been arrested at sea. Morocco, with the two Spanish enclaves of \nCeuta and Melilla, and Libya, has the routes that are favoured by the 300 thousand sub-Saharan Africans that, \naccording to some estimates, live in Algeria waiting to continue their journey to Europe. According to the Navy, in \n2008 639 harraga were expelled and repatriated from European counties compared to 189 in 2007, and 532 in \n2006.

The Ministers comments come in the wake of an explosive growth in the number of asylum \nseekers entering Finland since last year.Currently all detention centres in Finland are packed to capacity with \nauthorities receiving more residents than they can officially accommodate.The large influx of refugees has created \nbottlenecks in the processing time, with applicants queuing for months before the first interviewed by police and \nimmigration officials. Minister Thors has called for more resources for the authorities to expedite processing of \nresidence and refugee permits. Government will consider the proposal at the end of January.More Municipal \nFundingThors has also called for a higher level for municipalities hosting refugees. Many municipalities have \nrefused to take in more refugees, because compensation paid by the state for refugees has remained at the same \nlevel since 1993.The Minister pointed out that there had been an increase in student grants, while municipalities \nhave had to manage increasing costs with the same level of state support. The state compensates municipalities in \npart for expenses related to accommodation, health care and day care services.Increase in Influx of Asylum \nSeekersLast year the number of asylum seekers arriving in Finland jumped to 4,000, compared to 1,505 in 2007. \nUnstable situations in Iraq and Somalia helped push the numbers up.Interior Ministry Immigration Director Sirkku \nP\u00e4iv\u00e4rinne said that this year those numbers could increase to as much as 6,000.

The reduction in the number of \nunaccompanied children, especially those from Morocco, is due to the signing of a agreement for prevention, \nprotection and assisted return with the Moroccan government, currently under examination by the Moroccan \nParliament and awaiting definitive approval. A cooperation agreement similar to the one in force with Morocco will \nbe underwritten in the near future by the Spanish government with the Senegalese Justice Ministry. In 2008, \naccording to the data outlined by Rumi, there were only 44 unaccompanied child migrants who landed on the coats \nof Andalusia, 80pct fewer than those arriving in the region in 2007. Consuelo Rumi confirmed that, in 2008, there \nwere an overall 13,555 migrants who tried to enter Spain illegally by crossing the sea on rafts or makeshift sea \ncraft, 26pct fewer than those in 2007. According to the government representative, the reduction was due to the \ndeterrent effect of repatriation, cooperation for development in the countries from which the migrants normally \narrive, agreements made by Spain to reinforce coast surveillance and, in part, also to the economic crisis, which \nresulted in a decline as concerns domestic demand for immigrant workers. The confirmation lies in the fact that the \nnumber of foreign workers, according to the community rules to be contacted legally outside of Spain, is down by \n94pct decline in 2009.
