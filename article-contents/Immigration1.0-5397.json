{"title": "After 15 Years in Court, Workers' Lawsuit Against Trump Faces Yet Another Delay", "body": "\nEighteen years ago, Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump Tower, the skyscraper jewel in Donald J. Trump's real-\nestate empire. Today, Mr. Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of \nbeing cheated with 200 other undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe benefits.\n\n\"We worked in horrid, terrible conditions,\" Mr. Kozak said of the six months he spent in 1980 wielding a \nsledgehammer and a blowtorch in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump \nTower. \"We were frightened illegal immigrants and did not know enough about our rights.\"\n\nMr. Kozak, like other laborers on that job, has no hope of collecting about $4,000 in back wages from a contracting \ncompany that began the demolition and later became insolvent. But after almost two decades, the demolition \nworkers are still struggling to compel Mr. Trump and his business associates to compensate a union's welfare \nfunds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for some of the Polish workers.\n\nMr. Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that has meandered through the Federal courts for \n15 years and charges that Mr. Trump owes $4 million to the union welfare funds for the work the Poles performed. \nFiled in 1983, the suit has been bogged down by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by the \ndeaths of a judge, a lawyer, the original lead plaintiffs, an important witness and two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants.\n\nIn an effort to resolve the tangled case -- one of the oldest on the civil dockets of the Federal District Court in \nManhattan -- Judge Kevin T. Duffy last month warned lawyers for both sides to be prepared to begin a jury trial on \n48 hours' notice.\n\nBut on Thursday, in a development that could delay the trial yet again, Judge Duffy ordered the case assigned to \nanother judge. Lawyers for both sides said the 48-hour notice was still in effect, but that it was unclear when the \ntrial would start.\n\nMr. Trump denies that he was aware of the working conditions at the site in 1980 or that any of the demolition \nworkers were undocumented immigrants. He is also chal lenging claims that he is liable for payments to the union \nthat were evaded by the demolition contractor.\n\n\n\"All we did was to try to keep a job going that was started by someone else,\" Mr. Trump, in an interview, said of his \ncompany's efforts to guarantee that the demolition contractor paid wages to employees. \"In fact, we helped people \nand it has cost a lot of money in legal fees.\"\n\nMr. Kozak and other Polish immigrants who were hired for the demolition said in interviews that they often worked \nin choking clouds of asbestos dust without protective equipment. They accepted the conditions because they \nthought the job would pay 10 times as much as they could earn in Poland, said Mr. Kozak, 56, a slightly built man \nwho became an American citizen and joined a laborers' union.\n\nJulian Nalepa, 63, who suffered a head injury in the demolition, said he and fellow workers were baffled by the \nunending suit. \"It makes you think that only the rich have rights in the courts,\" he said.\n\nThe demolition project on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street lasted from January to June 1980. It cleared the way for an \nornate 68-story glass-sheathed structure containing shops and an atrium on the lower floors and 263 condominium \napartments above that originally sold for $500,000 to $10 million each.\n\nThe tower was financed and built by Mr. Trump's development company, the Trump Organization, and the \nEquitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.\n\nAccording to court records and testimony, the Trump-Equitable joint venture hired Kaszycki and Sons Contractors \nInc. at a fee of $775,000 to raze Bonwit Teller's 10-story flagship department store although the contractor had little \ndemolition experience. Demolition Workers Local 95 of the Laborers' International Union of North America had a \ncollective bargaining agreement with the Kaszycki company, of Herkimer, N.Y., requiring it to pay specified wages \nto union and nonunion workers at the Trump Tower site and to make additional payments for each worker into the \nlocal's pension and medical insurance funds.\n\nWendy E. Sloan and Lewis M. Steel, lawyers for current and retired Local 95 members in the suit, assert that \nWilliam Kaszycki, owner of the contracting company, hired about 200 Polish immigrants who were not Local 95 \nmembers and agreed to pay them $4 to $5 an hour on 12-hour shifts seven days a week.\n\nThe Kaszycki company, the plaintiffs said, violated the union's $11-an-hour minimum wage scale and made \npayments to the local's welfare funds for only 12 to 15 employees. The contractor also failed to pay the 200 Poles \ntheir full wages, causing work stoppages and delays.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that Mr. Trump was desperate to meet demolition and construction deadlines and that his \ncompany in May 1980 began supervising the demolition, assuming full responsibility for adhering to the union \ncontract and for the payments to the union welfare funds.\n\nWhen the suit was filed in 1983, the lead plaintiff was Harry J. Diduck, a dissident member of Local 95. Mr. Diduck \nhad not worked at Trump Tower but maintained that that he and about 500 Local 95 members and retirees lost \nmedical and pension benefits because Trump-Equitable and the Kaszycki company owed the union funds more \nthan $300,000.\n\nAfter eight years of arguments and a nonjury trial on some of the issues, in 1991 Judge Charles E. Stewart of \nFederal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Trump and his associates conspired with Local 95's president, \nJohn Senyshyn, to withhold payments to the funds. He determined that Trump-Equitable owed $325,415 plus \ninterest.\n\nBoth sides, however, appealed the findings and each won partial victories. A Federal appeals court upheld most of \nJudge Stewart's decisions but ruled that Trump-Equitable had been denied a full opportunity to rebut the charge \nthat the funds had been damaged by the loss of contributions for the Polish workers.\n\nThe appeals court also ruled that Judge Stewart wrongly dismissed a claim by the plaintiffs that the Trump group \nwas responsible for payments to the funds because it had been the workers' actual employer.\n\n\n\nJudge Stewart died in October 1994 and the case, with new issues at stake, was assigned to Judge Duffy. But \nprogress was further hampered by the deaths since 1991 of Mr. Diduck, the original plaintiff; Burton H. Hall, a \nlawyer for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Kaszycki and Mr. Senyshyn, who were co-defendants.\n\nBefore ordering lawyers to be ready for trial on two days' notice, Judge Duffy recently denied motions for further \ndelays.\n\nAdmonishing both sides, he said, \"There must be an end to all litigation: even Jarndyce v. Jarndyce ground down to \na conclusion.\" He was referring to an estate dispute in Charles Dickens's novel \"Bleak House\" involving generations \nof the Jarndyce family that was so convoluted no one understood it.\n\nEdwin G. Schallert, the chairman of the Federal Court Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New \nYork, described the Trump case's longevity as \"extraordinarily rare\" for the District Court. Mr. Schallert said records \nshow that the average civil suit in the court takes 29 months and that 90 percent of cases are tried within four \nyears.\n\nAt different stages, Mr. Trump has retained four prominent Manhattan law firms to represent him. \"The legal history \nof this case is a jigsaw puzzle,\" said Thomas A. Bolan, Mr. Trump's latest lawyer and a former partner of the late \nRoy M. Cohn. \"We are now back to square one on the key issues.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who is expected to testify at the trial, said he had resisted efforts to settle the case out of court. \"It \nwould be cheaper, but on principle I won't,\" he said. \"We did nothing wrong.\"\n\nMs. Sloan, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, said she would be paid for 15 years of legal work only if her side won. The \nfees would be set by by the court, she added, and would be paid by Mr. Trump and his co-defendants. She \nestimated that if the $300,000 judgment, and accumulated interest, is upheld a second time, the payments would \nreach about $4 million.\n\n\"When you are facing large firms, it tends to make the litigation protracted,\" said Ms. Sloan, who is a solo \npractitioner specializing in union and civil rights law. \"But we are stubborn.\"\n"}
