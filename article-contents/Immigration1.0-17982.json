{"title": "Marchers Protest Border Patrol Group", "body": "\nHundreds of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday to protest a controversial civilian border \npatrol group, calling it racist and un-American.\n\n The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the oldest Latino civil rights organizations in the country, \norganized the rally to show that volunteers from the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps were not wanted in the area.\n\n ''It's a racist organization, there is no question,'' said the league's national treasurer, Jaime Martinez. ''They say \nthey will monitor the border, but now they are coming into our cities. Something has to be done.''\n\n Minuteman volunteers, who plan to patrol parts of the border in New Mexico and Texas in October, have \nrepeatedly denied claims of racism. The group gained attention earlier this year when it patrolled a section of the \nMexican border in Arizona.\n\n William N. Norris, a coordinator for the group's New Mexico chapter who attended Saturday's rally, said the \ngroup's goal was not to stop immigration but to ensure that immigrants ''fill out the paperwork and sign the guest \nbook at the gate.''                                               \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
