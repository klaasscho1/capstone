{"title": "IMMIGRATION BILL BATTLE ENDS", "body": "\nHouse and Senate negotiators Tuesday approved an immigration bill that stiffens border enforcement, speeds the \ndeportation of aliens who are criminals and restricts public benefits to legal immigrants. Republicans dropped a \nprovision allowing states to bar children who are illegal immigrants from public schools.\nThat provision will be changed to exempt all illegal immigrant children who are enrolled in school as of next July, \nand will be voted on as a separate bill. Democrats objected to provisions allowing legal immigrants to be deported if \nthey used more than 12 months of public benefits, including child care or English classes. Another would bar legal \nimmigrants infected with the AIDS virus from receiving publicly financed health treatment. The House scheduled a \nvote for today and a Senate vote is expected soon.\n"}
