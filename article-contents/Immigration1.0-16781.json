New York officials boosted the average number of arrests from 44 a month to more than 100 a month by \nputting more investigators on the street.\n\nImmigration and Customs also is using new tactics, including cracking down on violent street gangs whose \nmembers violate immigration laws.\n\nThirty members of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, were arrested on Long Island this month. The \nfeds plan to do the same thing to crack down on the deadly Mexican gang M18.\n\nagendar@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\n\nRON ANTONELLI DAILY NEWS Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Michael Garcia visits city offices to laud \nfeds' efforts in netting fugitive immigrants.\n"}
