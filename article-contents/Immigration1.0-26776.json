The news caps an excellent week \nfor the pair following their Scotland recognition.\n\nTransfer latest, Page 3\n\nRANGERS finally offloaded French flop Jerome Rothen yesterday, avoiding a \u00a3300,000 bill for the winger.\n\nRothen, 31, flew out to Turkey yesterday to sign a six-month loan deal with Ankaragucu after snubbing advances \nfrom Greek sides Larissa and Kavala.\n\nHe will team up with former France coach Roger Lemerre, charged with the task of saving the Turkish side from \nrelegation. In doing so, Rothen severs his ties with the Ibrox club five months early.\n\nThe former French international joined Rangers on transfer deadline day with a \u00a31m option to buy him in the \nsummer. The club had been servicing half his \u00a336,000-a-week wages at French side Paris Saint-Germain and \nwould have been locked into the deal had he not been moved on during the January transfer window.\n\nRothen s ill-fated seven-game spell cost \u00a364,000 a start to the cash-strapped side who feared they would have to \nkeep the player until June.\n\nSnowsport GB believe they can halt their steep downhill plunge towards bankruptcy. Oliver Jones, the chairman, \ntold The Herald he expects to conclude a rescue package which would avoid administration  within the coming days \n.\n\nThe bullish and ebullient Jones insisted that this would not be  a splint . He said job losses were not a \nconsideration, and that all wages were paid up to date, but future salaries may be at risk.\n\nThe Herald exclusively revealed that the organisation was in financial trouble, threatening the participation of Britain \ns Alpine skiers and snowboarders at next month s Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nA number of benefactors are prepared to help, Jones said, but he would welcome more. His tone was confident, but \nthat has characterised previous slaloming towards crisis.\n\nJones helped negotiate a \u00a3360,000 rescue package only last summer, four-year loans believed to be at 7% interest, \naround double what banks were offering the British public.\n\n\nHe said higher rates were necessary.  We were trying to re-fund an organisation whose only asset is its brave \nskiers.  The rescue package remains in the balance, with the British Olympic Association waiting in the wings with a \ncontingency plan.\n\n We have a very clear route to a potential solution,  said Jones.  It s not government or traditional banking. It s from \nsupporters and enthusiasts of the sport, a combination of solutions is coming together, we hope.\n\n It will achieve a more sustainable platform if we can pull it together, a very real opportunity of avoiding the \nadministration scenario.\n\n A splint for the current situation isn t what we re looking for, but rather a solution that won t drop us back into the \nsame situation in six months  time. The world has changed. People in business have had to adapt to the new world \norder. Government funding and public finance for all parts of the economy are going to be under pressure for years. \n\nJones said only five admin staff, including the chief executive, are employed at Snowsport GB s headquarters near \nEdinburgh, plus coaches who tend to be on seasonal contracts.\n\n You don t save the federation by taking two or three heads out of three or four people. You have to look at overall \nfunding,  Jones said.\n\nHe added:  We have paid all wages we have needed to pay up to this time, but we have to make sure we have the \nliquidity to pay wages going forward. Assuming we put this package together over the weekend, the liquidity we \nneed will come into play in the next week. We can t spend money we haven t got, because that s improper. We had \nto curtail discretionary expenditure. \n\nAsked about total debt, claimed to be near \u00a3700,000, Jones said:  That s not a figure I recognise.  \n\nHe is adamant British skiers will be in Vancouver.  People involved in British skiing are passionate supporters of \ncompetitors doing the most dangerous thing in sport. \n\n When men and women take their lives in their hands to live their dream, we have to be sure not to destroy that \ndream. \n\nTHE financially troubled Snowsport GB believe they can halt their steep downhill plunge towards bankruptcy. \nChairman Oliver Jones said he expects to conclude a rescue package which would avoid administration within days   \nbut future salaries may be at risk. The participation of Britain s Alpine skiers and snowboarders at the Winter \nOlympics in Vancouver is currently in doubt.

Both the UK Government and \nOpposition yesterday expressed support for the general direction of Mr Obama s intervention, but reserved their \nposition on the specifics.\n\nMany staff at Royal Bank of Scotland are in line for bumper bonuses even though the institution has received tens \nof billions of pounds of taxpayer support. The issue has caused significant friction between RBS chief executive \nStephen Hester and the Westminster Government.\n\nShares in RBS, 84% state-owned, tumbled again yesterday, and Barclays suffered an even steeper fall. Both RBS \nand Barclays have significant global investment banking operations of the type that could be affected by Mr Obama \ns tough stance.\n\nMr Obama sent Wall Street tumbling on Thursday when he ratcheted up his combative stance toward Wall Street \nby setting out proposals aimed at preventing US banks from becoming  too big to fail    triggering a decline in the \nLondon stock market. This slide continued yesterday in London.\n\nShares in Barclays dropped by a further 4% to 271.35p and RBS fell 2% to 34.68p, having plunged as far as 32.28p \nduring yesterday s session.\n\nMr Obama s proposals focus on limiting both the scale of banks and their trading activities. \n\nHe is proposing that deposit-taking banks would be prevented from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds \nand private equity funds and from undertaking proprietary trading. \n\nProprietary activity by institutions involves them trading securities on their own account as opposed to dealing on \nbehalf of clients.\n\nShadow Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday that Mr Obama \n\nHAITIANS are fleeing their devastated capital in their hundreds of thousands, as survivors continue to be dragged \nfrom the rubble 10 days after the earthquake struck.\n\n\n\nWith food running short and fear of disease spreading, aid officials estimate some 200,000 people have crammed \ninto buses, nearly swamped ferries and set out on foot to escape the ruined capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nFor those who stay, foreign engineers have started levelling land on the fringes of the city to make way for tented \ncities   supposedly temporary   that are meant to house 400,000 people.\n\nRescuers are still finding survivors.

It is not fair to talk about \nplayers at other clubs. But Boyd is out of contract in the summer and it is possible we could do some business \nthere, but I am not committing myself. \n\nThere were reports that Boyd was at Villa Park on Wednesday to take in the Carling Cup semi-final with Blackburn \nRovers. O Neill would neither confirm nor deny that, but refuted the suggestion that Boyd was a player on his radar. \n\n\n\nThe former Celtic manager said:  I don t know if players are at football games, but the other part I can definitely \ncomment on. I was quite surprised to see the story that he is signing for us. Of course, I know the player very well \nindeed. He was in Scotland when I was in charge of Celtic, but there isn t any truth in it. \n\nWith Middlesbrough and Newcastle United also thought to be interested in signing the 26-year-old, Rangers must \nwait to see whether Boyd, currently recovering from a double hernia operation, will take them up on their offer of a \nnew three year-deal, said to be worth \u00a318,000 a week. \n\nWalter Smith revealed there was no expiry date on the offer and hoped Boyd could eventually be persuaded to stay \nat Ibrox.  The situation remains the same,  the Rangers manager said.  We have made the offer and we are waiting \nfor him to come back to us.\n\n There is no deadline and there is no great pressure there. It depends what offers people make Kris. Everybody in \nfootball, who like Kris is coming out of contract, is free to negotiate with whoever they want. They can then take into \naccount all the offers clubs make them.\n\n I don t know what clubs have offered Kris. All I know is what we have offered and the player is currently \nconsidering that and has been for the past fortnight now. As a club we have indicated that we would rather keep the \nplayer. That is where we stand. We want to keep him and we will do the best we can to do so.\n\n What I do know is that if Kris is here towards the end of the season, he will continue to give everything for Rangers. \n\nSteven Davis played in the Barclays Premier League with Aston Villa and Fulham but was persuaded north by the \nopportunity to play for his boyhood heroes. The midfielder understands why Boyd may be tempted by the prospect \nof playing in England, and admitted he fancies another crack at it himself one day, but hoped the emotional pull of \nRangers would prove too strong. \n\n The Premier League is massive, the best league in the world at the minute,  Davis said.  The quality is \nunbelievable, as is the coverage it gets. It s a great stage to play on but, at the same time, Boydy s in a similar \nposition as me where he grew up as a Rangers fan and is playing for the club he supported. \n\n That s a big thing first and foremost. Here you get to compete for and win trophies and that s a big factor. Rangers \nis a massive club with the fanbase that goes with it so hopefully he will make the right decision and stay here. \n\n RANGERS supporters got a glimpse this week of what the future may hold should Kris Boyd ever be enticed away \nfrom Ibrox. It should have sent a shiver down their spines. Boyd missed parts II and III of the Hamilton Academical \ntrilogy after undergoing surgery to fix a double hernia problem and, in the striker s absence, Rangers were largely \nimpotent.\n\nWhere goals had been thrashed in mercilessly in previous matches   seven past Dundee United, six past \nMotherwell and four at Easter Road against Hibernian   Walter Smith s side barely had a shot on target in the \nleague match at New Douglas Park last weekend until Nacho Novo s late strike eventually secured an unlikely \nvictory. \n\nIt was slightly different in the sides  cup replay on Tuesday night but with a similar outcome. Rangers enjoyed plenty \nof chances   most of which fell to Kenny Miller, recalled after missing the league game due to suspension   but \ncould not find a way past Tomas Cerny, Hamilton s impressive goalkeeper, within the regulation 90 minutes. \n\nIt took two extra-time strikes from Steven Whittaker, a right-back regularly deployed in midfield, finally to book \nRangers  passage through to a fifth-round tie with St Mirren. Whittaker is the third-top scorer at Ibrox behind Boyd \nand Miller this season, with the other forwards at the club barely registering in the goalscoring stakes. \n\nBoyd will again be absent for the visit of Hearts this afternoon, as will Miller, who limped off in Tuesday night s cup \nwin. Replacements are thin on the ground. DaMarcus Beasley, Nacho Novo and Steven Naismith have also all \nchecked into the Murray Park treatment room with a variety of knocks and bruises, leaving Smith with little option \nbut to contemplate experimenting with a strikeforce of Lee McCulloch and Kyle Lafferty. \n\n\n\nMcCulloch, for younger readers, used to be a forward of some repute at Motherwell. The subsequent years saw him \nmove to Wigan Athletic, where he was regularly deployed on the left of midfield, and then on to Rangers where he \nhas become the archetypal  utility man , asked to fill in as a defensive midfielder or pushed into emergency service \nin central defence. \n\nHis versatility has not always been appreciated by the Rangers support, but he remains a firm favourite in the eyes \nof the man who signed him.  We have one or two options [in attack] , Smith said.  Andrew Little plays centre forward \nas does Lee McCulloch. Lee could go back to his Motherwell roots if necessary.\n\n  I remember him in his early days at Motherwell and he did play in one or two positions. When he went to England \nhe played most of his stuff wide on the left of a four and he did that very well.\n\n Since he has come to us I have seen that he has good qualities. He has shown he can also play as a central \ndefender and even in the midfield. He has played well for us in that area because he is a good footballer and has a \ngood footballing brain. He knows what is required of the positions he has to play. I think everyone sees the value \nwe are getting from Lee at the present moment. \n\nMcCulloch could yet form a formidable front line, in terms of physical stature if nothing else, with the much-maligned \nLafferty who has recovered from a bout of flu. The Northern Irishman s club form stands in stark contrast to his \ninternational performances where he has earned rave reviews leading the line for Gerry Armstrong s side. \n\nIt is often left to Steven Davis, a team-mate for both club and country, to bang the drum for Lafferty and he did so \nonce more without hesitation.  His favourite position is up front but the form of Kenny and Boydy have kept him out \nof the side,  Davis said.  They ve forged a real partnership but now that they re out it gives Kyle a real chance to \nshow what he can do. \n\n It s his most natural position and his performances for Northern Ireland there have been very good in the last \ncouple of years. He leads the line well and with the injuries we have here hopefully he can come in and get us a \ncouple of goals.\n\n He s a decent finisher. We see that in training although his confidence is maybe a wee bit low in games. He s also \nquick for a big player with a decent touch and can bring a lot to the team. It s sometimes overlooked that he s still a \nyoung lad. He s come to a big club and it s been a big change for him. Whenever he has had a bit of a run in the \nside and shown a bit of form he s picked up a few niggly injuries that have kept him out for a week or two. Now he ll \nget the chance to play up front and I know he s capable of doing that. Hopefully he can get a bit of luck as well. \n\nDavis has endured precious little luck of his own on that front. His only  goal  this season has been struck from the \nrecords after the match against Tannadice was abandoned, while he also missed a penalty in the Champions \nLeague match against Unirea Urziceni. \n\n It s been a big disappointment from my point of view this season although it s more important that the team \ncontinue to win games. But I d like to chip in with a few myself as well. Maybe I need to take a leaf out of [Whittaker \ns] book. \n\nRangers will also be without Maurice Edu, who has succumbed to another ankle injury, but may be able to call upon \nPedro Mendes for the first time since October. Smith also confirmed that interest in the Portuguese from Sporting \nhad gone rather quiet. \n\n Pedro played the other day [in a bounce game] and with the length of time he has been out it is not the perfect \nsituation for him to come back in,  Smith added.  But he will be involved in the group. Martin [Bain, chief executive] \nspoke to the president of Sporting Lisbon two weeks ago and we haven t heard anything else from them since. \n\nMcCulloch s  versatility has not always been appreciated by the Rangers support\n\nCraig Brown may have travelled the world gathering victories and accolades, but he told his players his greatest \nachievement came last week in Kilmarnock.\n\n\n\nThe Motherwell interim manager collected his first win at Rugby Park and midfielder Chris Humphrey revealed that \nthe former Scotland manager gave a rousing appraisal of the performance. \n\nSpirits within the Motherwell camp have improved since Brown replaced Jim Gannon last month and former \nShrewsbury midfielder Humphrey is pleased that any fears over the change of manager have been allayed.\n\n He gave us a speech and said that was the best win that he has ever had,  he said.  For him to say that to the boys \nreally, really encourages us and makes us feel great.\n\n Between the boys, the heads were down and when you looked around the dressing room, it didn t really seem \nhappy. Since the gaffer has come in, there has definitely been a lift and everyone just seems happy.\n\n It is always difficult when the person that brings you in leaves. You always wonder,  Is the new manager going to \nlike me? Am I going to get a chance?  Since the gaffer and Archie have come in they have treated us all the same. \nThere are no favourites or anything like that, he has given us all a fair share. Hopefully I can play a couple of games \nunder him. \n\nMotherwell host St Mirren this afternoon looking for their fourth home victory of the campaign. Gus MacPherson s \nside beat Motherwell 3-0 in the Co-Operative Insurance Cup in October and Humphrey is hoping his side can fair \nbetter this time around. Motherwell have not won a televised game since 2005 but there will be no superstitions \ndisrupting their plans, with repeating the performance of Rugby Park the priority.\n\n I heard the boys talking about that [televised games jinx] the other day but it is like we have always said in the \nchanging room, that is in the past and records are there to be broken. \n\n I feel that if we play the way we did against Kilmarnock we are a very hard team to beat. I think we can go out there \nand win on Saturday. \n\nPaul Gallacher has other ideas. St Mirren s goalkeeper was handed his first Scotland call-up by Brown when he \nkept goal for Dundee United in 2001, but is determined to spoil his first home match in charge.\n\nGallacher knows Brown has boosted morale at Fir Park but he believes St Mirren have the resolve to get a result \nafter conceding just one goal   a penalty by Hearts captain Michael Stewart   in his previous three matches.\n\n I ve been involved in Scotland squads with him but I was just young at the time,  the 30-year-old said.  He s got a \ngreat pedigree, he did well for the national team. It s a great appointment but hopefully we can spoil the party and \nget a result.\n\n If we play to our potential, hopefully we can get three points. We ve been performing fairly well in recent weeks. \n\nSt Mirren have a good recent record against Motherwell, that 3-0 cup win the third time they had eliminated them \nfrom a knockout tournament in five years.\n\nThat game followed a 3-3 draw in Paisley three days earlier when a late Lukas Jutkiewicz double denied St Mirren \nthe league victory they seemed destined for.\n\nSo Gallacher is confident they can take something at Fir Park if they perform to a similar standard.  We played \nreally well in those games,  he said.  It would have been nice to get three points in the league match but we can \nrectify that on Saturday, it would be fantastic. If we play in the right manner we can get three points but it s going to \nbe a tough game. \n\nMarius Zaliukas never imagined he would reach a century of Hearts appearances when he joined the club on loan \nthree-and-a-half years ago. Indeed, the Lithuania defender is still owned by FBK Kaunas, with little sign of his \ntransfer being made permanent.\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old admits not knowing whether he was coming or going was difficult during his early days in \nEdinburgh, but he is now well used to his future being up in the air each year and is happy to wait to see what \nhappens when his latest loan extension expires at the end of 2010.\n\n I don t have any offers,  said the Hearts vice-captain.  I want to make my 100th appearance. Beyond that we will \nsee. \n\nZaliukas will reach his landmark appearance at Ibrox today and says the team, unbeaten in six games, will travel \nwith confidence. \n\n We will go there to win,  he said,  but warned the absence of strikers Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller will not \nnecessarily work in Hearts  favour.\n\n They are obviously the biggest threat but now young boys will want to prove themselves,  he said.  Maybe it will be \nharder. \n\nHearts have enjoyed a good record against the Old Firm since Csaba Laszlo took charge and Zaliukas admits the \nclub seem to raise their game against Rangers and Celtic.\n\n I notice that all the time after an Old Firm game, we go to a lower team in the table and it s just as hard or even \nharder to play against them. \n\nZaliukas would have reached a century of appearances for much sooner but for his appalling disciplinary record last \nseason   four red cards   and an injury-hit start to the current campaign.\n\nHe left Tynecastle on crutches after last weekend s win over St Mirren, but the calf injury he suffered proved not to \nbe serious and he will take his place at the heart of the defence today alongside Ismael Bouzid.\n\nA DRUG addict has tested positive for anthrax after using what is believed to be a contaminated batch of heroin. \nHealth chiefs said the outbreak is continuing to spread but this is the first confirmed case in the NHS Ayrshire and \nArran health board area. \n\nSeven people, including four in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, have now died, out of a total of \n15 cases.\n\nA British soldier was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan  yesterday, the 250th to die in  the conflict.\n\nThe death of the soldier, from A Company 4 Rifles, serving as part of 3 Rifles Battle Group, marks another tragic \nlandmark in the numbers of UK service personnel killed.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed the soldier died as a result of an explosion near Sangin, in central Helmand \nProvince. Next of kin have been informed.\n\nLieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, a spokesman for  Task Force Helmand, said:  It is my sad duty to inform you \nthat a British soldier from A Company 4 Rifles, serving as part of 3 Rifles Battle Group, was killed by an explosion.\n\n He was on a foot patrol,  part of a larger operation to provide security for the local population in Sangin, when the \nexplosion happened. \n\n His courage and the sacrifice he has made will not be forgotten. \n\nNext of kin have asked for a 24-hour period of grace before further details about the soldier are released.\n\nThere were 39 British deaths in the Afghan conflict in 2006, 42 in 2007, 51 in 2008 and 108  in 2009.\n\nIn Iraq, 179 UK personnel  died between 2003 and 2009, while 255 died in the 1982  Falklands War.\n\n\n\nA 19-YEAR-OLD Scots Guard who died after suffering serious head injuries during an attack  in a club was \nyesterday given a military funeral in his home town.\n\nColleagues from the 1st Battalion Scots Guard carried the coffin of Andrew Gibson into Cumbernauld Old Parish \nChurch. \n\nRelatives and friends joined his parents Freddy and Linda in a tearful farewell. Andrew was their only child. \n\nThe teenager died at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, when he suffered a massive heart attack \nduring surgery. \n\nDays earlier he had slumped unconscious at a nightclub in Darlington, Durham, following an incident involving \nunder-age drinkers. A murder inquiry was launched in connection with his death and three teenage boys   two 16-\nyear-olds and a 17-year-old   are on police bail.\n\nAn Army spokeswoman said:  Our thoughts remain with his family.

He talked about Clare Short \nbeing untrustworthy and so on. \n\nInquiry panel member Sir Roderic Lyne, a former senior diplomat, said:  He didn t directly say that. It was implicit \nrather than explicit. \n\nSir Suma, who is now permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice, replied:  OK, but I think the implication is quite \nclear and I thought it was extraordinary really because Clare Short after all had supported military interventions in \nother places.\n\n So she wasn t someone who was against military intervention, but she disagreed with this one.

It was hosted by George \nClooney and also featured Denzel Washington, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and former US President Bill Clinton.\n\nIt was one of several efforts spearheaded by celebrities to support the emergency response to the earthquake, \nwhich killed an estimated 200,000 people. \n\nRare memorabilia by bands such as Coldplay and the Arctic Moneys is being auctioned off on eBay to generate \nfunds for Oxfam s appeal and by yesterday afternoon, a bid of \u00a33,200 had been placed for Chris Martin s Viva La \nVida signed tour jacket and VIP tickets to Glastonbury were fetching \u00a31,650. \n\nOne offer which is bound to generate massive interest is the opportunity to own a personal song written and \nperformed by Blur and Gorillaz singer Damon Albarn, which had attracted a bid of \u00a31,650 by last night. The auction \nwill end on February 2. \n\nThe drive to raise extra funds came as an eight-year-old boy who became an icon of hope in the search for \nsurvivors told of his incredible escape from the rubble.\n\nKiki Joachin, who emerged with his arms outstretched in delight on Wednesday after more than a week buried \nunder the ruins of his family s home, said he smiled because he was  free  and  alive .\n\nHis sister Sabrina, 10, was also saved, but their rescue was tinged with sadness by the death of their siblings in the \ndisaster   Yeye, nine, Titite, three, and 18-month-old Didine. \n\nKiki, who was tracked down  living in poverty in a shanty town in the country s capital, said:  I am sad for my \nbrothers and sisters but happy with my mama. \n\nSpeaking about the moment he was pulled out, he said:  I smiled because I was free. I smiled because I was alive. \n\nSabrina, who was trapped alongside Kiki, spoke of the tragedy of their younger brother s death. She said:   My little \nbrother died right next to me and his body started to decay.\n\n Before he died he asked me for water. We couldn t find any water. He asked us for water on Wednesday, on \nThursday and Friday. He died of dehydration. \n\nThe children s mother, Odinel, 38, said she had felt  sure  Kiki and Sabrina were dead.\n\n When I saw them, I collapsed in tears and hugged them,  she said.  We were all laughing and crying at the same \ntime. \n\nBritish rescuers said it would be an  absolute miracle  if anybody else was found alive in the ruins and began \npacking up and heading home yesterday. \n\nLast night s telethon, which is expected to raise millions of dollars, follows pleas by celebrities attending the Golden \nGlobes ceremony for people to raise funds for those who survived the disaster. \n\n\n\nAs a number of stars wore red and yellow ribbons as a mark of respect, House actress Olivia Wilde announced she \nwould auction off her black and silver couture Gucci gown to raise funds for the appeal. \n\nA cover of REM s haunting ballad Everybody Hurts has been chosen as the Live Aid-style charity single which \nSimon Cowell is organising to support the emergency response.\n\nLeona Lewis, JLS, Rod Stewart and Michael Bubl\u00e9 have all signed up to sing on the single, which will be released \nlater this month. \n\nVAT on the record will be waived and REM will not take any royalties from the track to maximise revenues. \n\nMeanwhile, TV chat show host Jonathan Ross has vowed to make his own contribution to the earthquake appeal by \nselling some of his vast Japanese toy collection.\n\nThe BBC s highest-paid star, who will leave the corporation when his contract ends in July, is selling them via the \nMandarake toyshop in Tokyo.\n\nWriting on Twitter, he said:  Have spoken to my toy dealer and he s selling some of my toys off for me, proceeds \ngoing to Haiti. Will let you know what we raise! \n\nTWO thugs who filmed themselves viciously attacking a man in the street were caught out when they posted the \nvideo on YouTube, a court heard yesterday.\n\nRyan Currie and Frank Tominey laughed and joked as they recorded the attack after meeting 31-year-old James \nLavery as he walked home.\n\nCurrie, 19, and Tominey, 21, shouted  watch this troops  before headbutting, punching and kicking Mr Lavery to the \nground and shouting  you ve just been done .\n\nPolice officers recognised the pair after viewing the video on YouTube days later and they were arrested.\n\nAt Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday, Currie and Tominey, who were remanded in custody, admitted assaulting Mr \nLavery at Mossvale Road, Easterhouse, Glasgow, on August 6 last year.\n\nProsecutor Michelle Tollan told the court that Mr Lavery was walking home when he was stopped by the two men \nat a secluded lane.\n\nMiss Tollan said:  In the video two male voices ask Mr Lavery, who seems to be under the influence of drink or \ndrugs, to smile for the camera. A voice is then heard saying  Ryan Currie and Frankie here bamming up a jugger . \nThe verbal mocking continues for a while before the two males show themselves to the camera and it is the two \naccused.\n\n Ryan Currie then says  watch this troops  and asks  ready?  before punching the complainer, and Frank Tominey is \nseen headbutting the complainer nine times. The complainer doubles over as Tominey kicks him in the head and \nCurrie shouts  smash the junkie . \n\nThe pair continued their attack for some time, punching and kicking Mr Lavery a number of times while being filmed, \nbefore running away.\n\nPolice later found Mr Lavery with cuts to his face and arms but he refused to tell them what had happened.\n\nThe video was posted on YouTube a few days later under the name  Ryan & Frankie Junkie Whoopin  and officers \nrecognised Currie and Tominey.\n\nWhen Currie was later arrested at his home, he told police:  Nae bother, I ll plead to that, 10 year.  Tominey also \nadmitted being involved.\n\n\n\nSheriff Robert Anthony told the pair that a custodial sentence was  utmost  in his mind due to the gravity of the \noffence. He deferred sentence until next month for reports.\n\nA DRUNKEN bungling thief dropped himself in it when he phoned police to tell them his pal had taken off with items \nthe two of them had nicked.\n\nEdinburgh Sheriff Court heard how 22-year-old Florent Chawki's trip to Edinburgh for Hogmanay festivities landed \nhim in the cells.\n\nIn a stunt described as  amateurish , he stole two credit cards and a bank card from a suitcase at a hostel where he \nhad been staying.\n\nFiscal depute Trevor Smith said Chawki had reported the theft to police, who then realised he fitted the description \nthey had been given from earlier complainers.\n\nDefence agent Chris Fehilly told the court it was clear that Chawki was not a  criminal mastermind .\n\nChawki admitted forcing open a suitcase and stealing three bank cards on January 3 this year.\n\nSheriff Frank Crowe fined Chawki,  from London, \u00a3300 and ordered him to pay \u00a3150 in compensation.\n\nRANGERS goalkeeper Allan McGregor was interviewed by police yesterday over a sexual assault claim.\n\nThe 27-year-old met with Strathclyde Police detectives on a voluntary basis over allegations of an assault said to \nhave taken place after a night out in November last year.\n\nIt is understood that two other men have also been questioned in relation to the allegations.\n\nThe mother-of-two in her 20s made the allegations on January 6 nearly two months after the assault was said to \nhave taken place in Glasgow.\n\nA Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said:  We can confirm that a 27-year-old male attended at a police office earlier \ntoday, Friday, in relation to an ongoing investigation.\n\n His attendance was on a voluntary basis. No person has been arrested or charged with any offence. \n\nThe spokeswoman added:  A number of other people have been interviewed in connection with this matter and \ninquiries are continuing.\n\n It is an ongoing investigation and we are not going to be saying what the next step will be. \n\nMcGregor, a Scotland international who has been at the Glasgow football club for 11 years, has described the \nclaims as a  vile lie .\n\nHe says he was the victim of smears and a blackmail attempt and added:  I m devoting myself to clearing my name \nof these claims. \n\nMcGregor has hired Paul McBride QC, one of the country s most high-profile and successful defence lawyers. \n\n An Old Firm manager has to get the tone of his comments right when there is a large points gap between the rival \nGlasgow clubs at the top of the table. Rangers  legendary manager, Bill Struth, once came out with a remark the \nclub s supporters still cherish decades later:  Let the others come after us. We welcome the chase.  Today Walter \nSmith has a chance of going 12 points clear at the top, but he would rather run a mile than let slip a quote which \nseemed triumphant or disrespectful. He isn t the type to blurt out a provocative quote which could motivate Celtic.\n\nIt s all relatively straightforward for the team in the lead, though. Struth won so much he could pretty much say what \nhe liked. For the manager doing the chasing it s a different story. Tony Mowbray s contention yesterday that a \n\n\n\npossible dozen-point deficit was a  media-driven situation  was a novel interpretation of the SPL table. It hasn t \nbeen the media taking points off his team all season.\n\nPerhaps he meant the supposed pressure and tension of being several points behind was a media invention, and \nthat managers and players tend not to get too bothered with the state of the parties when the championship race is \nonly at the halfway stage. Few supporters will feel quite so relaxed.\n\n We will enjoy the challenge of chipping away, really,  said Mowbray.  Last season Celtic were at least seven if not \nat one stage 10 points clear and we all know where the league title went. I think when we find consistency we will \nhopefully win plenty of matches and see where that takes us. \n\nWhen it was put to him that Celtic could be 12 points behind with a game in hand tomorrow he quickly interjected:  \nTwo games in hand.  A pair of games don t equate to an automatic six points, of course, but if Celtic win their next \nfour games against St Johnstone, Hibs, Hamilton and Kilmarnock Rangers  lead will be six points at the most.\n\n I ve said before that we just look at our own team and just try to play well and win games,  said Georgios Samaras, \nwho seemed to share his manager s composure about the size of Rangers  lead. \n\nDuring last season s title run-in Samaras memorably claimed Rangers were not as a good a side as Celtic and did \nnot deserve to be champions. The comments quickly haunted him. They were used as motivation by players at \nIbrox, who went on to disprove them by winning the championship. \n\nHe was more careful yesterday although he remains one of the most engaging talkers at the club.  Of course \nRangers are going to drop points and our aim is to take advantage and close the gap. I came here in 2008 when we \nwere behind and it was the same scenario for Rangers last year. When I came we were seven behind and last year \nseven in front   and the team behind won the title. That proves that in football the last game is the only time you can \nsay you are champions or not. You must stay focused until the last day and try to do the best for your team.\n\nSamaras continued:  We have time to close the gap. We are feeling well within ourselves. The manager has not \nmade a lot of changes to the way we play football. We still play attacking football. Only some small details have \nchanged, for the best of course. But I feel well and I think we are all feeling well. We are happy with the system and \nthe atmosphere at our club.\n\n Some big players have maybe left, but I think there are still characters in the dressing room that can make the \ndifference. I have experience of winning a title, I don t think that is the case for some other guys like Marc Crosas. \nBut they don t need an extra push from me or anyone else. They have their own character and the quality to prove \nthemselves, not only in football, but outside as well.\n\n I said before the most important thing is to win the games. When we have a disappointing result or performance \nthe most important thing is to right our mistakes and be better every week or better every day if possible. If we do \nthat then the goals will come. If it s possible we have to make fewer mistakes in the game.\n\n I don t think that because Rangers will not buy players that it means we are going to win the title. I think the team \nthat has the clearest mind and is most focused for the games will win it. \n\nMuch has been made of Rangers  injury problems but Celtic have a huge casualty list of their own. Scott Brown, \nScott McDonald, Danny Fox, Shaun Maloney, Stephen McManus, Ki Sung-Yueng, Lee Naylor, Mark Wilson and \nPaul Caddis are all injured while Landry N Guemo is with Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations. Club captain \nMcManus continues to struggle with a calf strain while new signings Jos Hooiveld and Thomas Rogne are some \nway short of the match fitness required to make their debuts.\n\n St Johnstone are a team we have a lot of respect for,  said Mowbray.  They have a bright young manager. They \nplay quality football and have picked up some good results. It s a very, very difficult place to go to get results but we \nwill put a team out to be as positive as we can to try to get the points. \n\n* Celtic yesterday made a \u00a310,000 donation to the Haiti Earthquake Appeal.\n\n\n\nTony Mowbray, the Celtic manager, last night claimed he had a  great  working relationship with midfielder Scott \nBrown and had no intention of selling him.\n\nMowbray continued to deal with the ongoing fall-out from a midweek report that he told Brown he had no future at \nthe club and would be sold, a claim which the manager, player and club later denied in a strongly worded club \nstatement. \n\nMowbray s awkward general relationship with the media was demonstrated yesterday when he gave a vague \nanswer when asked about Scott McDonald s future.  Watch this space,  he said.\n\nAt least he was more forthcoming when it came to Brown s importance to the club:  You ve got to have good \nfootballers and Scott Brown fits the category of a good footballer. I ve had a great working relationship with Scott for \na few years at Hibs and I ve got a great working relationship with Scott here. It s just a little bit annoying for me, \nreally.\n\n We re looking forward to getting him back playing. I think he s been his usual self [this week], working hard in the \ngym, looking forward to getting his boots on and getting out there and training with his team-mates. He s fine. He ll \nhopefully join in full training on Monday. \n\nMowbray used his weekly news briefing at Lennoxtown to repeat comments he made on the club s online channel \nthat he would avoid the mainstream media altogether if he could.  I talk to the media because I ve got to transmit to \nthe supporters and a lot of our supporters read newspapers, so here I am. \n\nHe said he did not believe there was a media agenda against Celtic.  I think the players who have been here for a \nwhile understand how Scottish football works and the way the media works. I try to understand the way the media \nworks and that you gentlemen have a job to do and you have to fill newspapers and if there are no stories you \nsometimes, like previously this week, make them up. \n\nThere were no facts or information forthcoming from him about Morten Rasmussen, but it is believed that Celtic \nhave agreed a fee with Brondby. The 24-year-old striker told Danish TV last night:  A move to Celtic would \nobviously be interesting for me. \n\n Mowbray took pleasure from his belief that others were close to signing who had not yet been identified by the \nmedia.  It s interesting to see there s one or two bits of business we re quite down the line with and you ve not even \ngot a name yet. That s surprising. \n\nMowbray gave his strange  watch this space  response when asked about possible interest from English clubs in \nMcDonald, although he then tried to clarify what he meant:  It s old news. Was Roberto Martinez not quoted as \nsaying he was interested in McDonald? I m interested in Lionel Messi, me. I m interested in Ronaldo. I don t think \nthere is a story there. \n\nJody Morris doesn t score many goals so finding the net against Celtic would normally have him cock-a-hoop. But \nthe St Johnstone midfielder s neat penalty-box dribble and finish at Celtic Park last August barely registered.\n\nBy that stage, Saints were reeling from an excellent Celtic performance and Morris admits his first SPL strike was a \nnon-event.\n\n I don t get many goals but you only celebrate when you re in contention to win a game and we were nowhere near \nit. I just grabbed the ball and headed back to the centre circle. There was nothing to celebrate in losing 5-2. \n\nMorris doesn t believe suggestions that injury-hit Celtic will be vulnerable tomorrow after a series of setbacks which \nhave left them trailing nine points off the pace being set by Rangers. \n\n People might say this is a good time to face them but  I don t really buy into all that. I couldn t tell you if it s a good \nor bad time to get Celtic. \n\n\n\n I ll tell you after the game on Sunday. I m more concerned about us and hopefully we are better equipped at this \nstage of the season to face Celtic than we were back in August. \n\nManager Derek McInnes concurred:  I don t take any comfort from the fact that Celtic will be without a few players,  \nhe said.  Not at all. I understand there will be a few changes but whoever comes in to play for Celtic will be quality.  \nThe size of club they are means they will have a strong team.\n\n In fact, Celtic are the most impressive side we have played this season. \n\nMorris wasn t for celebrating after being led a merry dance \n\nEddie May last night dismissed the chances of Hearts, Aberdeen or Dundee landing Darren Barr this month and \ninsisted Hibs are the only Scottish club capable of signing the Falkirk captain during the current transfer window.\n\nThe Scotland cap is out of contract at the end of the season and has been the subject of fevered speculation over \nwhere his future lies.\n\nMay believes the 24-year-old is destined for English football but with Scottish clubs queuing up to hold talks with the \ndefender s agent, there has been talk of a possible move before the February 1 transfer deadline.\n\nHowever, the Falkirk manager yesterday reiterated his belief that the defender would be best served staying put \nuntil the summer and claimed that only a switch to rejoin former manager John Hughes at Hibs is a possibility in the \ncoming 10 days.\n\nSpeaking ahead of tomorrow s meeting with Dundee United, he said:  I don t think Darren Barr is in a difficult \nsituation, because somebody will need to go and pay money.\n\n Aberdeen have said on record that they ve got no money, Dundee are in the division below which will be a hard \nsell for them and I don t think Hearts have got any money.\n\n So, it s really down to whether Hibs want to pay money, and Darren would have to go and agree personal terms, \nwhich he s never done. Darren has always maintained that he wants to stay at the football club for the rest of the \nseason, so it would be a major surprise if he goes. \n\nFalkirk moved to within a point of second bottom Kilmarnock with last weekend s morale-boosting draw with Celtic \nand May has urged his players, including new recruits Enoch Showunmi, Colin Healy and Jack Compton, to retain \nthe standards they set at Parkhead.\n\nPeter Houston, the caretaker manager of Dundee United, has revealed he started the season by passing on advice \nto the Falkirk coach, Steven Pressley, but by the time he had taken the reins at Tannadice, the phone calls were \nflowing the other way.\n\nHouston worked with Pressley during his time with Hearts and the pair have remained close ever since. Pressley \nwas made a member of May s coaching team in the summer and Houston, who assisted Craig Levein for nearly a \ndecade, was on hand to offer words of wisdom.\n\nBut after Houston s United suffered a 7-1 humiliation at the hands of Rangers last month, it was Pressley  who was \npicking up the phone.\n\n I got a call from him the day after we lost to Rangers, but I blanked it. It was nice of him to phone me as he was \nobviously showing his concern but I just couldn t face speaking to him.\n\n I ll see him again this weekend but my main focus is Dundee United and trying to keep our run going. \n\nUnited look like a team transformed now the players are over the shock of Levein leaving to become Scotland \nmanager.\n\n\n\nThe heavy defeat at Ibrox was followed by a home loss to Aberdeen but since then they have won three matches in \na row, beating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Hibs.\n\nHouston, who will remain in charge until Stephen Thompson, the chairman, finds a permanent replacement, now \nsees a group of players brimming with confidence and revealed he has even had to tell them to ease off in training.\n\n Victories have given the players confidence so I just sense that Sunday can t come quickly enough. I had to hold \nthem back am little bit in training which is always a good sign. They were going at it full pelt but sometimes you just \nhave to save your energy in the build up to the game. \n\nAN MSP has condemned as  outrageous  the treatment by Scottish Enterprise (SE) of staff being made redundant \nbecause of the scrapping of a scheme to help graduates get jobs.\n\nGlasgow Kelvin Labour MSP Pauline McNeill is representing four of the seven staff who are losing their jobs \nbecause SE is winding up the Graduates For Business scheme, which organises internships for young people to \nhelp them get on the career ladder.\n\nThese staff were with Glasgow Opportunities, part of Scottish Enterprise Glasgow, when the scheme began and \nhad come to consider themselves core SE staff after it became a national project in 2005.\n\nMs McNeill said:  I am representing four individuals who have a legal case with SE regarding their employment \nstatus. Their terms would be more generous if they were SE. Glasgow Opportunities have never been in touch with \nthese employees until now   when they now claim to be their employer.\n\n The terms they were offered were conditional on them not going to an employment tribunal, which is outrageous. I \nhave written to Scottish Enterprise over my concerns about the way they have handled the ending of this \nprogramme. \n\nMs McNeill has also written to Finance Secretary John Swinney, saying:  My primary concern is for the employees, \nbut I am pursuing the wider issue of why such a successful scheme has ended without warning. \n\n I would be grateful if you could clarify what has happened to the programme? \n\n I understand the scheme had a very good evaluation and there was even an intention to extend the programme on \nan international level. \n\nThe agency justified the decision to scrap the scheme because  it was not delivering the expected increased \nturnover and longer-term jobs .\n\nHowever, internal documents seen by The Herald blamed the closure on the need to achieve budget cuts.\n\nA spokeswoman for SE said:  The Graduates For Business scheme has always been run through contracted \nproviders. We do intend to speak to the current providers over the next few weeks to see whether there might be \nemployment opportunities for their staff who are affected by the closure of this scheme. \n\nTHE fire alarm system in a nursing home was left  potentially faulty  just five weeks before a fatal blaze because \nstaff failed to voice concerns about apparent malfunctions, an inquiry has heard. \n\nA fatal accident inquiry into the fire that killed 14 elderly residents of Rosepark Care Home in Uddingston on \nJanuary 31, 2004, heard yesterday that the home s general maintenance manager swapped  potentially faulty  \nsmoke detector heads between alarms in an attempt to stop a spate of apparently false alarms.\n\nJoseph Clark, 65, told the inquiry he was called out in the middle of the night shortly before Christmas 2003 after \nthe fire alarm had gone off but staff had failed to find any cause. \n\nMr Clark found that the fire panel in reception indicated smoke had been detected in a ground floor corridor of \nbedrooms.\n\n\n\nHowever, on investigating the area, he found sensors on the ceiling indicated  the source of the alarm was a smoke \ndetector in the attic, even though indicator lights on the fire panel had not lit up for this area, indicating a malfunction \nin the system.\n\nMr Clark admitted that after finding no evidence of smoke or moisture in the attic, he swapped smoke detector \nheads between the attic, office and foyer to prevent further false alarms, after  at least two in quick succession . \n\n The inquiry continues on Monday.\n\nSCOTLAND S prison population will rise by almost a quarter in less than a decade, meaning 10,000 people will be \nbehind bars by 2018-19, according to new projections.\n\nThe number of criminals locked up in Scotland s jails is expected to carry on rising, with the total projected to reach \n9000 in 2013-14 and increasing further to 9600.\n\nMeanwhile, a new survey revealed that half of prisoners were drunk when they committed their crime.\n\nThe Scottish Prison Service annual prisoner survey found the number of inmates who were under the influence of \nalcohol when they carried out their offence had increased from 40% four years ago to 50% in 2009. Some 45% of \nprisoners were under the influence of drugs at the time of their offence.\n\nThis latest survey revealed more inmates were reporting problems with alcohol.\n\nA total of 42% said they thought they ought to cut down on the amount of booze they were consuming   up from \n34% in 2005, and 37% of prisoners surveyed said they felt guilty about their drinking, an increase from the 2005 \nfigure of 29%.\n\nHowever, the survey reported a fall in the number of inmates using illegal drugs behind bars.\n\nMeanwhile, the population projections show the numbers of prisoners has increased despite an overall fall in crime \nacross Scotland.\n\nThe projections report suggests that this is due to changes in the criminal justice system, including an increase to \nthe maximum sentences sheriffs can give, opposition to bail for repeat offenders and moves to prosecute knife \ncrime in solemn courts.\n\nThe report said the prison population had been at  record  levels in 2008 and 2009.\n\nIt added that the main reason for this was the increasing number of offenders given jail terms of less than four \nyears, with significant increases in remand prisoners.\n\nThe number of these short sentences has  increased steadily  since 2007, reaching about 3500.\n\nKenny MacAskill, the Justice Secretary, said:  These projections confirm what we already suspected   that if current \ntrends continue, Scotland will continue to lock up more and more of its people, many for very short periods.\n\n This is despite recorded crime being at its lowest level for 30 years. \n\nMr MacAskill has set out proposals to reduce the number of criminals sent to jail for periods of six months or less, \narguing these people should instead be given tougher community punishments.\n\nHe said:  Serious criminals deserve to go to jail but  they find themselves in prison alongside too many individuals \nwho, quite frankly, would be  better dealt with through tough community payback   clearing snow and ice, repairing \npaths  or landscaping parks and gardens.\n\n\n\n Having to deal with the churn caused by those caught in the revolving door of very short sentences means that the \nScottish Prison Service is diverted from working with the more serious offenders to reduce the risk they pose to the \npublic. \n\nMr MacAskill said the Scottish Government was investing \u00a3120 million each year in the prison estate.\n\nHe added:  What we are not prepared to do is build even more prisons simply to fill them with people whose \noffending could be dealt with more effectively in the community. This  will do nothing to tackle reoffending. \n\nHowever, Labour justice spokesman Richard Baker hit out at the Government, saying:  Today s figures show the \nscale of the problem but also show the paucity of the SNP s response.\n\n The SNP s only strategy so far is to see them want to scrap six-month sentences that would see thousands of knife \ncriminals, muggers and housebreakers dodge jail entirely. \n\nMr Baker continued:  Since the SNP came into power almost three years ago, not one new establishment has been \nfully commissioned and the future plans for the service include replacing Greenock and Inverness prisons without \nincreasing capacity. \n\nAN independent Scotland with complete autonomy over its legal affairs  could create its own Supreme Court, a \nreport has claimed.\n\nIt also suggests reforms to ensure an effective system of final appeal for Scottish cases and spells out  \nindependence  and  devolution max  models.\n\nThe research examines the implications of the new UK Supreme Court on the Scottish legal system.\n\nThe UK Supreme Court  is the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases and supplants the judicial authority of \nthe House of Lords. However, it does not hear appeals relating to Scottish criminal cases, which are reserved to \nThe High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.\n\nProfessor Neil Walker, of Edinburgh University, suggests in his findings that a  fully autonomous court system \nserving a fully autonomous Scots law  could only be an option within an independent Scotland. He states that this \nmodel represents a  perfectly coherent option, in line with international practice  if Scotland becomes a sovereign \nstate.\n\nProfessor Walker also proposes a quasi-federal Supreme Court system as the  most attractive reform option under \nthe present constitutional settlement .\n\nHe envisages civil and criminal Scottish cases raising common UK issues being heard by the UK Supreme Court \nsitting in Scotland, and those Scottish cases addressing distinct questions of Scots law being dealt with by \nindigenous courts.\n\nThe review was commissioned by the Justice Secretary two years ago.\n\nTorchwood s Captain Jack Harkness helped with a spot of time travel yesterday as part of the 10th anniversary \ncelebrations of a children s hospice.\n\nScottish TV star John Barrowman materialised in person at Ty Hafan Children s Hospice, in Sully, south Wales.\n\nThe star of BBC TV s Torchwood and Doctor Who helped to mark the occasion by burying a time capsule.\n\nBarrowman bought a home in Sully with his partner Scott three years ago as it is close to Cardiff, where Torchwood \nis filmed.\n\nHe discovered Ty Hafan while out walking and decided to help raise cash for the hospice. \n\n\n\nSince then he has raised \u00a39000.\n\n I m really proud to say I live in Wales because the people are so generous,  he said.

They were sold for \u00a3500 each   up to \u00a3750 \nwith ammunition   after they were purchased in Germany for  50.\n\nAbout half of the firearms were recovered but around 100 remain untraced.\n\nSentencing, Judge Martin Steiger QC said:  Many have been used in shooting incidents and there have been at \nleast two fatalities.\n\n One hundred of the guns are still in circulation, waiting to do their lethal work to innocent victims. \n\nFive men were sentenced in 2006 for their part in the operation.\n\n\n\nFOUR private operators are in talks about providing a replacement service for the Renfrew Ferry, which will sail for \nthe last time on March 31 after almost six centuries.\n\nStrathclyde Partnership for Transport, which operates the ferry, yesterday decided to scrap the service, saving \n\u00a3400,000 a year. The transport authority has to make savings of \u00a32.5 million in the year from April.\n\nAt present, it is subsiding each \u00a31.20 fare by almost \u00a33, which SPT officials say is not good value for money. The \ntwo ferries will be sold and SPT is in discussions with the eight staff about the possibility of them transferring to \nother SPT operations like the Glasgow Subway.\n\nThe move was greeted with anger by Paisley North MSP Wendy Alexander and Paisley and Renfrewshire North \nMP Jim Sheridan,.\n\nMs Alexander and Mr Sheridan met SPT chairman Alistair Watson in advance of the meeting that sealed the fate of \nthe ferry. They handed over a petition with almost 3000 names calling for the service to be maintained.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Watson described the decision as  very regrettable . He said:  The decision to close the \nRenfrew Ferry was not an easy one and we recognise it has served communities across the Clyde very well for a \nlong time.\n\n We are cutting services which will cause some pain but the economic circumstances we are facing are \nunprecedented and the ferry service across the Clyde has a track record of declining usage and increasing subsidy. \n\nHowever, Mr Watson said he was in discussion with four companies interested in setting up a new service.\n\nHe said:  There has been significant interest from the private sector with four offers from firms which want to look at \nour Renfrew/Yoker operation and we are prepared to sit down with them almost immediately. \n\nBut Ms Alexander said:  This short-sighted decision is a slap in the face to everyone who campaigned to keep the \nferry link.  \n\n It is a second big blow after the axing of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and I am calling on Scotland s Transport \nMinister to step in. \n\n The Scottish Government saved \u00a3175 million when they axed the airport rail link.

The recent European investigation into subsidies \nfound that the current service is unlawful and in breach of European regulations. \n\n The Government are willing to continue to fund the route and not to continue to fund the Renfrew service.

Both the UK Government and \nOpposition yesterday expressed support for the direction of Mr Obama s intervention, but reserved their position on \nthe specifics.\n\n\n\nMany staff at Royal Bank of Scotland are in line for bumper bonuses even though the institution has received tens \nof billions of pounds of taxpayer support. The issue has caused friction between RBS chief executive Stephen \nHester and the Westminster Government.\n\nShares in RBS, 84% state-owned, tumbled again yesterday, and Barclays suffered an even steeper fall. Both RBS \nand Barclays have significant global investment banking operations of the type that could be affected by Mr Obama \ns tough stance.\n\nMr Obama sent Wall Street tumbling on Thursday when he ratcheted up his combative stance toward Wall Street \nby setting out proposals aimed at preventing US banks from becoming  too big to fail    triggering a decline in the \nLondon stock market. This slide continued yesterday in London.\n\nShares in Barclays dropped by a further 4% to 271.35p and RBS fell 2% to 34.68p, having plunged as far as 32.28p \nduring yesterday s session.\n\nMr Obama s proposals focus on limiting both the scale of banks and their trading activities. \n\nHe is proposing that deposit-taking banks be prevented from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds and from undertaking proprietary trading. \n\nShadow chancellor George Osborne said yesterday that Mr Obama had  created a lot of space for the rest of the \nworld to come up with what I think would be a sensible system of international rules and agreements that creates a \nstrong and competitive City of London but also a safely regulated one .\n\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said of Mr Obama s plan:  It s directionally something the Prime \nMinister is very comfortable with. We are going to study the proposals. \n\nA European Union source signalled it would not imitate Mr Obama s plan to limit banks  size and trading activities, \nbecause the EU aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means.\n\nJIMMY CALDERWOOD will be hoping the public reception from Aberdeen fans mirrors the personal responses he \nhas been afforded since departing Pittodrie, when he returns as Kilmarnock manager today.\n\nCalderwood led Aberdeen into the top six of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League in each of his five seasons in \ncharge, but he is unsure of the welcome that awaits him this afternoon.\n\nHe left Aberdeen in May last year on the day he led the club into Europe for the second time. However, a section of \nthe support failed to take to him because of a failure to reach a cup final. But he has never experienced problems \nwith any Aberdeen fan in  person and trusts that remains the case tomorrow.\n\n They have been fabulous,  the former Dunfermline coach said yesterday.  I ve had lots of letters and texts. They \nhave been brilliant, but they always were. Maybe the websites were different, but privately the fans were always \nbrilliant.\n\n It was a wonderful time in my life. I was very proud to be manager of such a great club in a great city to and I miss \nit every day. But that s life, you just get on with it. \n\nCalderwood has spoken of his disappointment over the manner of his exit, which came days after the board \nprivately failed to back him. The former Birmingham City defender had been linked with several jobs in England \nduring his time at  Pittodrie, but no concrete offers materialised before he took over at Rugby Park last week. \nCalderwood is not sure whether the manner of his exit affected his job prospects, but he remains proud of his \nrecord at Pittodrie.\n\n We were bottom in October and we finished up in Europe. We ve got a wonderful record in the league and getting \nto the last 32 in Europe was phenomenal. \n\n\n\nCalderwood laughed off suggestions he would have a few tactical tricks up his sleeve against a team that has been \nstruggling for goals this season.\n\n No tricks, but we know their strengths,  he insisted.   Darren Mackie has come back and done really well. [Peter] \nPawlett is blossoming. Hopefully he keeps learning and takes it on   I hear he wants to play for Scotland. Fraser \nFyvie is also coming through. Their luck will change sooner rather than later   as long as it s not Saturday. \n\nKilmarnock s luck appeared to turn on Monday when Manuel Pascali inadvertently knocked Falkirk out of the Active \nNation Scottish Cup after Gavin Skelton s shot hit the bar and bounced in off the Italian. Calderwood hopes he also \nhas a fully focused Kevin Kyle after the striker ironed out his  differences with Michael  Johnston following public \ncriticism of the chairman s policies and conduct.\n\n You could see it was  affecting him,  Calderwood said.  I had a talk with him last Saturday and we agreed we would \nget it sorted out. Luckily, Kevin and the chairman have worked things out. You could see yesterday in training it was \na load off his mind. \n\nAberdeen s Mark McGhee is well aware of the immediate impact a new manager can make on a club, though he is \ndetermined that won t be the case today. However, he is concerned that his team has lost momentum as the result \nof the stop-start nature of January s games which included victories over  Dundee United and Hearts, a defeat at St \nMirren and two  postponements against Falkirk and St Johnstone.\n\nCombine those two aspects and the Aberdeen manager recognises the difficulties his side may face against \nKilmarnock.\n\n I looked at us having six games in January and  I thought, that s 18 points,  he said,  and I felt it was not \nimpossible. Instead, one game was off and we lost to  St Mirren, then another game was off and now we only have \nthree games left. So we have lost the momentum gained from Hearts and Dundee United and now we have to start \nagain. \n\nWhile Calderwood will be very keen to return to Ayrshire with three points, McGhee yesterday pondered the new \nmanager s likelihood success at Kilmarnock.  If Jimmy does a good job and keeps them up convincingly, then not \nonly would this job seem an obvious opportunity, but other clubs would be watching too and thinking,  He s doing it \nagain . He would open himself up to the market. All these things add to his incentive. \n\nLIAM MILLER hopes that the disappointment of  Hibernian slipping to fourth in the Clydesdale Bank  Premier \nLeague for the first time this season can be the catalyst for John Hughes  team to start putting together another \nlong  unbeaten run.\n\nDundee United leapfrogged the Easter Road side when they beat them at Tannadice last weekend, a result which \nmeant Hibernian have taken only one point from their last three league games, having also lost to Rangers and \ndrawn with Hearts.\n\nBefore going down 4-1 at home to Walter Smith s men, they were undefeated in 12 matches, the last team to beat \nthem before that having been today s opponents, Hamilton Academical, at New Douglas Park in September.\n\nMiller made his debut in that game and is keen to get his side s challenge for third place back on track.  Hopefully \nwe can get a win to get a run kick-started again,  he said.  It is a disappointment to slide down to fourth, but there is \nstill a lot of football to be played. I think we have a great chance this year. \n\nMiller will also return to Parkhead on Wednesday for the first time since quitting Celtic in 2004. He said:  It will be a \nreally tough game.  I felt it was the right call for me [to leave] at the time, I don t look back and regret. I suppose \nhindsight is a great thing, but I made my decision and I stick by it. I and I m delighted to be playing for Hibernian. \n\nReturning to today s encounter, Miller recalled:  It was a hard match down there. We knew we didn t play well, but \nwe have a chance to turn that around with a good  performance this time. \n\n\n\nTrent McClenahan, the Hamilton Academical right-back, also has half an eye on midweek, in the knowledge that \nGraham Arnold, the  assistant manager of the  Australian national team, will watch him line up against  Kilmarnock \non Tuesday with the World Cup finals in mind.\n\nThe 24-year-old played for his country at the 2008 Olympics. He fell off the radar after moving to Hamilton, but his \nside s recent performances in the league and Scottish Cup against Rangers have put him back in contention for.\n\n I ve not made the most recent squads: that s why a good performance is  important on Tuesday,  said \nMcClenahan.  If you make the squad it s a massive  experience. The Olympics was pretty good, but the World Cup \ns got to top that.\n\nHamilton have not won in five outings, but McLenahan says taking Rangers to extra time in their Scottish Cup \nreplay on Tuesday has given Billy Reid s squad a lift.\n\n You can t get any tougher, really, than playing Rangers three times [in four games]. We ve got to take confidence \nfrom our performances and try to continue them against the other teams in the league. \n\nPARENTS of young pupils at Scotland s only dedicated school for sporting excellence have claimed their children s \nhopes of success in the Olympics and Commonwealth Games could take a dive thanks to proposals to close \nGlasgow School of Sport s swimming programme.\n\nThe Herald can reveal the Glasgow City Council-run school, based at Bellahouston Academy, could be wound up \nfollowing a proposal by the sport s governing body, Scottish Swimming, that youngsters could better fulfil their \nambitions by training solely with their own clubs.\n\nParents claim the waters are being muddied by politics and hidden agendas, prompting officials to plan to meet with \nparents next week to reassure them the initiative will not be wound up.\n\nBut many of the families believe the success or otherwise of their children s ambitions will depend more on the \ndesires of Scottish Swimming and some major clubs than what they can achieve through the School of Sport.\n\nThe centre has produced swimmers Rebecca Hillis and Charles Mills who both won gold in swimming at the \nCommonwealth Youth Games in 2005.\n\nOne parent told The Herald:  The national bodies and many clubs have made it known in the past what they feel \nabout the school and, with the pressures for resources and 2014 coming up, some of us are finding it coincidental \nthat Scottish Swimming is now recommending youngsters train only with their clubs. \n\nLast year the City of Glasgow Swim Team appointed a new elite performance coach who, in turn, recruited the \nhead coach from the School of Sport, which was set up in 1999 as the first in the country dedicated to sporting \nexcellence.\n\nThe parents claim the failure to fill the vacant post and the channelling of under-pressure resources towards teams \noutside the school illustrates that the quest for medals lies elsewhere. \n\nOne proposal for consultation is that the children continue at the school but do their pool training during class time \nwith their local facility.  This has practical difficulties as many of the children travel from outside Glasgow.\n\nKaren Sweeny, whose 15-year-old daughter Shannon attends the school, asked:  What do I do about this \nuncertainty? Do I take Shannon out and just school her back here? Who will have the final say in this consultation? \n\nAshley Howard, chief executive of Scottish Swimming, said:  A review is the most important thing and I deny it is \nfinancially driven.\n\n We want to explore all the options and haven t come to any pre-determined conclusions. \n\n We re not interested in the signals this may give out. We need to take stock and reflect changes. \n\n\n\nMaureen McKenna, Glasgow City Council s head of education, said:  We want to reassure parents that no decision \nhas been taken on the provision of swimming at the school and these discussions are intended to give everyone   \nparents, pupils and interested parties   the opportunity to air their views and opinions on the continuing success of \nthe sport. \n\nIT S a myth that elite swimmers must train in Scotland to succeed. David Wilkie, the last Scot to win Olympic swim \ngold, in 1976, won only Commonwealth bronze while training in Edinburgh, where he went to school. \n\nHe became Olympic and world champion, and world breaststroke record-holder, only after moving to Miami to work \nwith coach Bill Diaz.\n\nFive-time Olympian Alison Sheppard s career was rooted in Scotland. However. it was only after she moved to \nCanada, under the influence of coach Gary Vandermeulen, now her husband, that she became Commonwealth \nsprint champion. She was training in Canada when she won gold in Manchester in 2002, with the world s third \nfastest time ever.\n\nVandermeulen changed her technique and training methods. A $50,000 World Cup win, and almost all of her 16 \nWorld, European, and Commonwealth medals, came after that.\n\nLottery investment, improved facilities and Scottish programmes have certainly moved swimming on. Much is made \nof the remarkable haul of 12 medals by Scottish swimmers at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006. \n\nThe truth is that the six gold medals won there were by swimmers training outside Scotland. Only one individual \nmedal was won by a Scottish-trained swimmer.\n\nThat said, hot-housing talent and having the best swimmers training together in a competitive environment is the \nprevailing elite performance philosophy among all of the sport s leading nations.\n\nThere are 26 pupils on the swim programme at the Bellahouston Academy-based Glasgow School of Sport. \n\nThey come from the city, but also from Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and Renfrew, and as far away as Dunoon, travelling \ndaily. \n\nThey are unlikely to reach full potential training in isolated silos.\n\nThe threat to the School of Sport swim programme may send some confused messages as the city moves towards \nthe 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nAN osteopath was yesterday convicted of seeking sexual gratification by molesting seven male patients.\n\nKeith Grieve, 58, of Inverness, was placed on the sex offenders  register after being found guilty of assaulting \npatients at his Highland Osteopathic Clinic in the city. \n\nDuring a 15-day trial  at the city s sheriff court, victims described how Grieve molested them, with one claiming he  \nprofessionally whipped off   his boxer shorts before caressing his genitals. \n\nThe court had heard how police were finally contacted by one patient who had concerns about the osteopath s work \nwith teenage footballers bidding to join professional teams in the Highlands.\n\nOnce one victim had come forward, a series of others followed.\n\nGrieve had originally been accused of sexually assaulting 10 men by removing their underwear without their \npermission and molesting them.\n\nSheriff Gordon Fleetwood yesterday found Grieve guilty on seven counts of sexual assault. \n\nHe found two other charges not proven, while another was dropped by the Crown during the trial.\n\n\n\nThe sheriff added that prison was not uppermost in his mind, but it was not being ruled out until he considers the \nsocial inquiry report. Sentence was deferred until March 25.\n\nONE of the UK s most prestigious musical institutions for young people, which organised an annual festival for \norchestras in Edinburgh, is to cease its activities.\n\nThe National Association of Youth Orchestras, which was for many years based in the Scottish capital, and whose \npresident is the leading conductor Sir Simon Rattle, is to cease its activities from March 30.\n\nA letter sent to youth orchestras said that NAYO, which represented 125,000 young musicians across the UK,  has \nhad to face up to growing financial and organisational challenges over the past few years, now culminating in the \ninevitable decision to cease our activities .\n\nNAYO has been in operation for 45 years, supporting youth orchestras and ensembles and organising the Festival \nof British Youth Orchestras, which The Herald recently revealed had been cancelled due to a lack of funds. \n\nThe association s membership was open to all kinds of youth music groups, including student orchestras, chamber \norchestras, symphonic, wind and jazz orchestras, and chamber music ensembles.\n\nGeorge Caird, chairman, said in a statement:  Our decision is made with great regret. NAYO recognises   as does \nthe musical world   the need for a national body representing and assisting youth orchestras at a time when their \nexistence is under threat, and that the withdrawal of NAYO will leave this need unsatisfied. \n\n For this reason, although as a result of the withdrawal of funding NAYO will cease its activities for the present, the \ncompany will remain in existence and we are prepared to offer assistance to any person or body interested in \nattempting to fill all or part of NAYO s role. \n\n We have already announced that there will be no Festival of British Youth Orchestras in 2010. \n\nNAYO had its headquarters in the Scottish capital from 1980 until a move to England in 2008. Carol Main, the first \npaid employee of NAYO, who built the organisation up as its director from 1979 until 2003, said she was  extremely \nsad  about the development.\n\n I am totally perplexed as to how what was a thriving and successful organisation for many years, with an \ninternationally highly regarded dual-city youth orchestra festival as its flagship event, could have come to an end at \na time when youth music continues to be vibrant and in need of specialist representation at national level,  she said.\n\n There is sad irony too in the UK headquarters office recently relocating south of the border, after being established \nfor almost 30 years in Edinburgh, in a move apparently intended to increase funding opportunities but which seems \nto have very quickly led to this deeply disappointing result.\n\n It is really important that the fantastic work and achievements of young musicians and their staff is supported and \nrecognised and so disheartening that this is no longer happening through NAYO. \n\nTHE Labour Party has attacked Scottish Government plans to remove public notices from newspapers and have \nthem published online as  undemocratic .\n\nThe party is using its debating time in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday to call on the Government to drop its \nproposals.\n\nPauline McNeill, the party s culture spokesperson, said the debate would provide an opportunity to highlight the \nwider importance of newspapers and identify ways to promote the industry.\n\nShe said:  Newspapers are an essential part of Scotland s democratic, artistic and popular culture. \n\n This proposal is fundamentally undemocratic because many Scottish homes still don t have access to the internet. \nThere is a danger that Government will become more secretive and decisions will be taken without consultation.\n\n\n\n The withdrawal of advertising will also damage local newspapers, many of which are already struggling as a result \nof the recession. \n\n I hope MSPs from all parties will support Labour s motion and we can persuade the SNP Government to see \nsense. Local newspapers are important and we don t want to lose them. \n\nMs McNeill is also hosting a meeting for MSPs of all parties at the Parliament on Wednesday at which Donald \nMartin, editor-in-chief of The Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times, and union leaders will brief politicians on \nthe issue.\n\nConservative and LibDem MSPs have joined Labour in urging Mr Swinney to rethink and industry executives, union \nleaders and academics have given evidence to Holyrood s Education, Culture and Lifelong Learning Committee \ncriticising the plan.\n\nThey ve warned that as well as damaging the industry it will allow Government to become more secretive.\n\nMr Swinney claims online advertising of local authority recruitment notices, planning applications and road closures \nwill save money.\n\nACTOR Michael Douglas has revealed the secret of  eternal youth   Viagra.\n\nThe 65-year-old, who is married to Catherine Zeta-Jones,  also admits he has  made a conscious effort to let his \nyounger wife s career take precedence over his own. \n\n God bless her that she likes older guys.  And some wonderful enhancements have happened in the last few years   \nViagra, Cialis   that can make us all feel younger,  he said in an interview with AARP The Magazine.\n\nDouglas also admitted that he could have been a better father to his eldest son, Cameron, who is in jail after being \narrested and charged with selling drugs.\n\n Would it have been better to have been around more? Absolutely. There were absences, and I was no angel,  said \nDouglas.\n\nACTOR Michael Douglas has admitted that he could have been a better father to his eldest son, Cameron, who is \nin jail after being arrested and charged with selling drugs.\n\nDouglas has said little about his actor son s July 28 arrest and subsequent imprisonment other than to describe it \nas  devastating . \n\nBut in an interview in the March/April issue of AARP The Magazine, he said:  I'll assume whatever responsibilities I \nhave to. Would it have been better to have been around more? Absolutely. There were absences, and I was no \nangel,  said Douglas who is to reprise his Oscar-winning role as Gordon Gekko from the 1987 movie Wall Street.\n\nDouglas, who described his son as a  tough kid , said:  He now recognises his own demons and struggles. \n\nIT S a myth that elite swimmers must train in Scotland to succeed.

This has practical difficulties as many of the children travel from outside Glasgow.\n\nKaren Sweeny, whose 15-year-old daughter Shannon attends the school, asked:  What do I do about this \nuncertainty?

There have been several arrests. \n\nTwo men aged 21 and 23 were arrested in Manchester in November and will answer police bail next month. They \nwere questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money-laundering.\n\nEmin, 46, is an artist, film-maker and journalist whose controversial Unmade Bed was nominated for the  Turner \nPrize in 1999. \n\nLast year, Emin took part in an exhibition of art celebrating Robert Burns that was held at the Mitchell Library in \nGlasgow. Her work was inspired by one of Burns s poems, Nine Inches Will Please A Lady. \n\nPolice investigated reports last month that an unknown person wrote inflammatory letters to her neighbours in \nSpitalfields, east London.\n\nThe letters included false claims about her plans to redevelop several warehouses in the area.\n\nA TEENAGER who drove  like a rally driver  and caused a smash that killed his 16-year-old passenger has been \njailed for four-and-a-half years.\n\nIrving Gracie , who had only been driving for a year, was doing 116mph just seconds before the accident, which left \nsports student Daniel McQueen dead.\n\nHis high-powered Honda Civic was left  obliterated  after the 19-year-old lost control and swerved into two trees.\n\nAnother passenger was thrown from the car but Daniel, who was wearing a seat belt, received fatal head and chest \ninjuries.\n\nGracie, of Rowanbank Road, Dumfries, admitted killing Daniel and seriously injuring his friend Christopher \nMcLaughlan by driving dangerously on the A75 in Dumfries on February 21 last year.\n\nJudge Lord Turnbull told Gracie:  The outrageous way in which you as a young and inexperienced driver drove was \nthe direct cause of the death of Daniel McQueen. The effect of your conduct extends far beyond the loss of one life.\n\n The loss and hurt suffered by his family is immense. No sentence I impose is capable of undoing the harm you \nhave caused when you chose to drive in this manner.\n\n Nor can any sentence of imprisonment alleviate Daniel McQueen s family s anguish.\n\n\n\n The sentence is not designed to be a measure of Daniel s life or value of a much-loved son and brother. The \nsentence I impose will seem inconsequential compared to the sentence you have imposed on his sister, brother \nand parents.\n\n You increased speed up to 116mph on a road which had bends and dips. Dangerous driving is criminal because it \nreflects an attitude on the part of the driver that cares nothing for the consequences to others. \n\nLord Turnbull told Gracie that but for his early plea of guilty he would have been jailed for six years.\n\nGracie was also banned from driving for 10 years and ordered to resit  his test.\n\nIT sounds relatively innocuous, with a proper Latin name and an English version using unthreatening words like \ncarpet and squirt.\n\nBut Didemnum vexillum has become the latest alien species to arrive in Scottish coastal waters, endangering \nshellfish farms and the wider ecology.\n\nA small colony of the Japanese carpet sea squirt has been found at Largs Yacht Haven, and now vessels moored \nin marinas in the Firth of Clyde and on the Argyll coast are to be surveyed by marine scientists. \n\nSurveys will be carried out in the next week by the Scottish Association for Marine Science to investigate how \nwidespread it has become, before deciding what to do. In the meantime, boat owners are being asked to make \nextra efforts to keep hulls clean and free of fouling to help prevent its spread.\n\nCarpet sea squirt is a distinctive pale orangey-yellow or beige colour and often appears as pale, flat patches. Larger \ngrowths may look like wax dripping from structures just below water level. Its surface has leaf-like veins with tiny \npores and it has a spongy texture and a leathery feel.\n\nDr David Donnan, policy and advice manager at Scottish Natural Heritage, said:  The carpet sea squirt can \nreproduce and spread rapidly and tends to smother other marine life that grows on the seabed. \n\n It is especially good at growing over underwater structures such as aquaculture equipment, boat hulls and \npontoons. It has spread around the world although it is thought to have originally come from Japan. \n\n Experience from Canada, New Zealand, continental Europe, and Ireland has highlighted it as a potential nuisance \nspecies that causes economic and environmental problems. The removal of the large, gelatinous growths can be \ndifficult and costly.\n\n We have been on the lookout for this species in Scotland as it was found in Holyhead harbour in north Wales in \n2008 and more recently in the south of England. \n\nIn Holyhead, it is being tackled by fixing large bags around the underwater structures to suffocate the sea squirt. If \nthis is successful, it could be considered in Scotland.\n\nChris Beveridge, of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, discovered the squirt. She said:  This is one of our \ntarget species, so when I spotted a mussel on a pontoon covered with a fawn coloured growth, I immediately \nsuspected the invasive sea squirt. \n\nShe later found a larger colony on the marina s mooring lines.  We carry out surveys of west coast marinas every \nyear, on the lookout for a variety of non-native species that have the potential to reach Scotland. The sea squirt \nmay have been brought into Largs Yacht Haven on the hulls of leisure craft which have travelled from Wales or \nIreland, where it is already established. \n\n It could be a real menace for all users of the marine environment if it spreads up the coast, with considerable \neconomic impact. \n\n\n\nHer colleague, Dr Kenny Black, said the species could cause damage to the likes of mussel farms.  I don t want to \nspread undue alarm but I think we have got to take it seriously. \n\n It could potentially smother mussels being grown. Even at salmon farms, it would mean a lot of extra cleaning of \nthe cages, nets and ropes. \n\nA GREAT-grandmother is to celebrate her 90th birthday white-water rafting   after her doctor refused permission for \nher to do a parachute jump.\n\nGean Hodsdon, from Linlithgow, West Lothian, said extreme sports appealed much more than the lunch party and \ncake enjoyed by most people  her age.\n\nOn March 5, she will go on the hair-raising trip down the River Tay in aid of her favourite charity, Blythswood Care, \nwhich helps poor families in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nDespite walking with two sticks and having two replacement knees, Mrs Hodson decided an ordinary birthday party \nwould be  too tame , and signed up for the challenge.\n\nShe hopes to raise \u00a35000 to buy a water pump for a children s summer camp in Moldova.\n\nMrs Hodsdon, who lives in sheltered housing, said:  Originally I wanted to do a parachute jump, but my doctor \nwouldn t let me as I ve had two knees replaced. He just said,   No way,  so I had to find something else.\n\n A friend takes me up to the Trossachs sometimes, and I happened to see a notice about white-water rafting. I \nthought,  I d quite like a go at that.  I could have chosen something easier,  I know, but it looked such wonderful fun.\n\n When I was first married, I used to go camping in that area and the scenery is beautiful. \n\nShe added:  The one thing I m not looking forward to is putting on a wetsuit.\n\n I don t feel like I m 90, although my body does.  \n\nAlthough her doctor wouldn t let her jump out of an aeroplane, she didn t think he would mind her new plan.  He s a \nmountaineer and an outdoors type himself, and he s on my side. \n\n Even so, I m keeping out of his way for the moment. \n\nMrs Hodsdon will take part in the challenge with three friends, speeding down a seven-mile route on the Tay. The \nfoursome will be supervised by a team from Aberfeldy-based Dunolly Adventures, who will be taking extra care of \nthe oldest participant they have ever had.\n\nMrs Hodsdon became involved with Blythswood Care 20 years ago. She started by sending shoeboxes filled with \nChristmas gifts to children.\n\nIn the past 12 years, she has travelled to Romania and Moldova several times. The summer camp gives poor \nchildren the chance to try new activities.\n\nShe said:  There s still a lot of poverty over there.\n\n They need a pump for water, as they have to rely on a tanker coming twice a week. Hopefully I ll be able to make a \ncontribution by white-water rafting. \n\nMarine non-native species found in Scottish waters in  the last 10 years:\n\n2002 Caprella mutica Japanese: skeleton shrimp, found in Oban \n\n2004 Heterosiphonia japonica: red seaweed of pacific origin from around Korea and Japan, found in the Moray Firth \n\n\n\n2004 Sargassum muticum, wireweed that naturally occurs in Japanese and Chinese waters, found in Loch Ryan. \nHad been detected in the English Channel in the late 1960s. \n\n2009 Didemnum vexillum:  colonial sea squirt originally from Japan, found at Largs\n\n In some ways, beyond that realm of the English top flight where clubs feel entitled to their eminence, the season \nbelongs to Alex McLeish. He has so dramatically revised what might be possible for Birmingham City that his own \nreputation has been bluntly reconsidered.\n\nThere was a time last year when supporters complained grievously of the team s style of play, the sense of grinding \nout results by a kind of sheer wilfulness. There is little appetite now for bemoaning their austerity; 11 games have \nbeen won by a single-goal margin, but then the team has not been beaten in 14 matches and sits eighth in the \nBarclays Premier League.\n\nHaving guided the club to promotion, McLeish is now rearranging some of the certainties of a division that has often \nbeen dismissive of incomers. His work is generating a growing acclaim, but is still short of the deep regard that \nDavie Moyes has established. The two managers, born and raised on opposite sides of Glasgow and only four \nyears apart in age, encounter each other at Goodison in today s FA Cup fourth round and the intrigue is sharpened \nby the contrasts of their careers.\n\nAs a forthright centre-back at Aberdeen, McLeish gathered trophies and caps as though they were as easily picked \nup as trinkets; as a manager, he won seven trophies in five years at Rangers, after impressing at Motherwell and \nHibernian, then took charge of Scotland for 10 months before moving to Birmingham. Renown evaded Moyes, who \nwas also centre-back, and he left Celtic as a young player for a series of lower league clubs. It was at Preston that \nhe revealed the managerial astuteness that has been the defining force of a steady progression. After winning \npromotion to the Championship and reaching the play-offs, he succeeded Walter Smith at Everton and has guided \nthe club to back-to-back fifth-place finishes, as well as fourth in 2005.\n\n I m afraid in England it doesn t matter much to people what managers do in Scotland, because they say there s \nonly two clubs who can win anything,  says Pat Nevin, the former Chelsea, Everton and Scotland winger.  If big \nAlex does it for another couple of years, then his stock will be up there as well, but they are two superb managers. \n\nThey share, Moyes and McLeish, that aura of command, a kind of leadership that emanates, so that players \nbecome immediately deferential. The pair are at their most formidable in shaping footballers  minds, and little ability \nis left unspent.\n\nMoyes might have a more significant track record in developing players over time, but then at Hibs, where \nrelegation had to be redressed, at Rangers, where success is considered compulsory, and at Birmingham, where \npromotion was a demand, there has been little time for contemplation in McLeish s career.\n\n With Roy Aitken and Andy Watson, big Alex is producing a team that plays football, is dynamic and defends well,  \nsays Mark McGhee, a former team-mate of McLeish s at Aberdeen.  His strength is his personality, and that s a big \naspect of his managerial style. Aitken and McLeish are two of the funniest people I know; both have a wicked, \nrazor-sharp sense of humour. They bring that to their management, where they re able to take the pressure off \nplayers in difficult situations, but at the same time it doesn t  get silly, they still retain respect. \n\nThe expression of Moyes  will is found in the strict discipline imposed at Goodison and the severity of the fitness \nsessions (earlier this season, Sylvain Distin confided that he has never endured such pain on the training ground). \nEverton play with an integrity that is considered a cherished value, while acuity is provided by the accomplished \nplayers Moyes assiduously identifies, such as Steven Pienaar, Marouane Fellaini, Tim Cahill and Louis Saha.\n\nNevin played for the same boys  club in Glasgow as Moyes and he remembers his friend, who was captain of the \nunder-14s, watching the matches of all the different age-group teams and talking to each player as they left the \nfield. He earned the first of his coaching badges at 22 and, like McLeish, is a favoured acolyte of Sir Alex Ferguson \n(both Moyes and McLeish have been linked with United s No.2 spot during their careers).\n\n\n\n Davie builds teams not on the cheap, but cheaper than the teams around him and he s certainly over-performed on \nthe finances he s had,  says Nevin.  He gets the best out of players and he doesn t make many mistakes in the \ntransfer market; his hit rate is fantastic. I ve said since he was Preston manager that he would be the next Man \nUnited manager. He s the perfect fit. \n\nIf the season so far is McLeish s, the  future may still be Moyes .\n\nMoyes and McLeish share an aura of command that ensures respect so players become deferential\n\nTODAY (3pm unless stated)\n\n P W D L F A Pts\n\nArsenal 22 15 3 4 59 25 48\n\nChelsea 21 15 3 3 52 18 48\n\nManchester United 22 15 2 5 49 19 47\n\nTottenham Hotspur 22 11 5 6 42 24 38\n\nManchester City 21 10 8 3 42 30 38\n\nLiverpool 22 11 4 7 40 26 37\n\nAston Villa 21 10 6 5 29 18 36\n\nBirmingham City 21 9 6 6 21 19 33\n\nFulham 21 7 6 8 26 24 27\n\nEverton 21 6 8 7 30 34 26\n\nStoke City 21 6 7 8 19 26 25\n\nBlackburn Rovers 22 6 6 10 23 39 24\n\nSunderland 21 6 5 10 30 38 23\n\nWigan Athletic 20 6 4 10 23 44 22\n\nBurnley 21 5 5 11 22 43 20\n\nWest Ham United 21 4 7 10 28 37 19\n\nWolverhampton Wndrs 21 5 4 12 17 38 19\n\nHull City 21 4 7 10 20 42 19\n\nBolton Wanderers 20 4 6 10 28 42 18\n\nPortsmouth 20 4 2 14 18 32 14\n\n* France.

It has been a long time since I have been playing;  I had forgotten what it is like. It \nis hard, but there are a lot of people worse off than me. But there have been times over the last few months where I \nthought that my career might be over. \n\nAfter missing out on a date at Wembley as Scunthorpe United  won promotion to the  Championship and a number \nof other big games as a result of his injury, Milne could be forgiven for feeling like he is owed a glamour tie. \n\nA return to action in the FA Cup against Barnsley was a step in the right direction for the former Partick Thistle  \ndefender and the visit of Manchester City in the fourth round tomorrow could turn out to be one of the biggest \ngames in the Glanford Park side s history.\n\n Hopefully I will be involved,  said Milne.  It is hard for me to be thrown straight back in because I have not played \nmany games, but if the manager thinks that he can use me, I ll be ready.\n\n We played them in the  Carling Cup earlier in the season and got a bit of a runaround. I watched their game \nagainst Manchester United during the week and they were outstanding. That is the standard they are setting \nthemselves, but it is a one-off game, so who knows what can happen? \n\nTWO young brothers who tortured two boys aged nine and 11 have been sentenced to an indeterminate period in \ncustody.\n\nMr Justice Keith had spent two days listening to harrowing accounts of how the attackers, then aged 10 and 11, \nlured their victims to a secluded spot and subjected them to 90 minutes of violence and sexual humiliation in \n\n\n\nEdlington, South Yorkshire, in April last year. The victims were strangled, hit with bricks, made to eat nettles, \nstripped and forced to sexually abuse each other.\n\nThe brothers admitted causing their victims grievous bodily harm with intent. They had denied a more serious \ncharge of attempted murder and the prosecution accepted their pleas so there was no trial.\n\nBoth also pleaded guilty to robbing one of the boys of a mobile phone and the other of cash. \n\nThey admitted two counts of intentionally causing a child to engage in sexual activity.\n\nThe brothers also admitted causing another 11-year-old actual bodily harm a week before the attack on the two \nboys.\n\nThe brothers, now aged 11 and 12, were told by the judge:  The fact is, this was prolonged, sadistic violence for no \nreason other than that you got a real kick out of hurting and humiliating.\n\n The bottom line for the two of you is that I m sure you both pose a very high risk of serious harm to others. \n\nSentencing them at Sheffield Crown Court, he told the pair they would serve a minimum of five years.\n\nAfter a case that bore similarities to that of the murder of two-year-old Jamie Bulger, who was abducted by Robert \nThompson and Jon Venables in 1993, Mr Justice Keith told the boys:  Neither of you need me to tell you how \nshocking your attack upon [the first 11-year-old boy] was and how appalling and terrible your treatment of [the two \nother boys in the later attack] was. \n\nSpeaking about the after-effect of the attack on the victims, he added:  Their physical and emotional scars will live \nwith them for a long time to come. \n\n Their relationship with each other has been seriously affected and their parents have been left with a strong sense \nof guilt, which they didn t begin to deserve, about whether they could have done more to protect their boys. \n\nMr Justice Keith said the risk of harm posed by the two boys was so high that he could not impose determinate \nsentences.\n\nThe families of the young victims issued a statement through South Yorkshire Police which said they had found the \nevidence  deeply upsetting , saying the events of April last year  rocked [their] lives . \n\n We have found the last nine months to have been an extremely difficult and testing time,  the statement said.\n\n Hearing the evidence in court during these past three days has also been deeply upsetting for us all. However, we \nwould like to thank everyone involved in providing support to us during this time. \n\nMr Justice Keith handed the boys concurrent sentences on all the charges they admitted.\n\nAfter the two defendants had been removed from the court, the judge addressed the families of the victims.\n\nHe said:  I want them to know that I ve taken into account the devastating effect that all of this has had on their lives \nand the lives of their boys.\n\n I have no doubt that they would have preferred to see [the two brothers] locked up for very much longer and I know \nthat nothing can compare to the trauma the boys went through, but I hope they will appreciate that five years is the \nvery least [the brothers] will serve. They may well be in detention for much longer than that. \n\nFollowing sentencing, a hearing was held in which Mr Justice Keith ruled he would not lift restrictions on revealing \nthe identities of the two defendants.\n\nLeader  Page 18\n\n\n\nDOZENS of bids have flooded in for a historic granite quarry after it went on sale for the first time in 150 years.\n\nThe sellers of Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen, which has a price tag of \u00a330,000, said they had been inundated with \nenquiries since it went on the open market on Wednesday.\n\nThe sale of the quarry, Europe's largest man-made hole, is now going to a closing date after about 40 bids were \nmade within hours of it going on sale.\n\nIt is estimated that about six million tonnes of granite was excavated from the quarry over a period of 200 years, \nhelping to sculpt some of the world's most iconic buildings.\n\nPotential plans for the seven-acre site, which is filled with water and home to a nature reserve, could include \nturning it into a climbing, diving or water sports base.\n\nProspective purchasers will have to square their plans with binding conditions that preclude any large construction.\n\nStaff at chartered surveyors AB Robb, which is marketing the property on behalf of owner Bixen, said they had \nbeen inundated with calls.\n\nA spokeswoman said they had about 40 calls and e-mails regarding the quarry. She said:  We have already \nreached a closing date because we have been so busy. \n\nProspective buyers have been given until noon on February 10 to lodge their bids for the site.\n\nLEGENDARY punk band The Skids are reforming  to play gigs in Scotland. The band will perform a show in \nDunfermline,  their home town, on  March 6 as part of the  Fifer Festival. The Skids then play in Inverness the \nfollowing night. Lead singer Richard Jobson, 49, said he chose Inverness  for what will be the band s last ever gig \nbecause of his love of the city. \n\nA hospital worker has been suspended after reports that photographs of patients having operations were posted on \nthe social  networking site Facebook.\n\nIt is understood that the images were taken on a mobile phone at Glasgow s Southern General Hospital. Patients \ncould not be identified but the NHS logo could be seen in some shots.\n\nIt has been claimed that a fellow nurse reported her colleague to management after spotting the offending images \non the website. \n\nAnother member of  staff, who appeared in  the images, has been questioned but no action has been taken.\n\nA spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said:  We can confirm a member of staff has been \nsuspended pending an internal investigation. \n\nSurgeons are allowed to take photographs during operations to get a quick second opinion. \n\nA spokesman for the nurses  union Unison said:  Staff should be well aware that they need to be careful about what \nthey put on social networking sites. \n\nMargaret Watt, the chairwoman of the Scotland Patients Association, said:  Any nurse caught doing this should be \nsacked.\n\n Putting pictures of patients in hospital on the internet is a gross breach of their human rights. \n\nA DUNFERMLINE couple who fled to Ireland because social workers wanted to take their child have had the \nnewborn removed from their care. \n\n\n\nKerry Robertson, 17, who has mild learning difficulties, and Mark McDougall, 25, left their home in Dunfermline \nafter social workers said they would take the baby away. She gave birth to Ben in Ireland last Friday and four days \nlater local social workers took the baby into care. \n\nA LORRY driver has been killed after his vehicle overturned and hit a wall. \n\nThe male driver of the articulated lorry was trapped in the cab under rubble at the scene, three miles east of Banff \non the A98. The lorry rolled over parked cars, which were apparently empty. Firefighters battled through the rubble \nto reach the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene after being freed on Thursday morning.\n\nCONTROVERSY over the West Highland Way has taken another twist after it emerged that a map at its southern \nstarting point contains a misleading mistake. \n\nAn error on a sign at the beginning of the route in Milngavie has wiped Loch Goil off the map, mislabelling it Loch \nLong.\n\nThe erroneous sign is only a few hundred metres away from the obelisk that marks the start of the 96-mile route, \nand just outside the train station where tens of thousands of walkers arrive to start their journey.\n\nCountryside campaigners said the oversight reflected the anti-rural bias of councils and central government, whom \nthey claim see the Scottish countryside as  worthless .\n\nEast Dunbartonshire Council installed the maps last October to provide a  better welcome  to walkers. But locals \nwarned that the mistake would confuse hikers, particularly foreigners,  as they arrived to trek the West Highland \nWay.\n\nA spokesman for East Dunbartonshire Council said:  The board in question has a representative map devised to \nhighlight the overall route of the West Highland Way and is not intended as an accurate geographical \nrepresentation.  There is an appropriate warning on the board.\n\n The board was erected as part of the public-realm improvements in Milngavie town centre around the underpass \nand station, with improved paving and lighting, giving a better welcome to the start of the West Highland Way in \nMilngavie for walkers. \n\nHowever, Helen Todd, head of development at the Ramblers  Association, said:  It s a shame the maps are wrong. \n\n Sometimes the people commissioned to make the maps get a bit confused and then the material they produce \nbecomes confused. They should have checked thoroughly because this mistake is not good. \n\nRural campaigners claimed the mistake was evidence of central government disdain for the countryside. \n\nCameron McNeish, author and presenter of the BBC s Wilderness Walks, said:  This sounds like a simple mistake   \nbut a simple mistake that shouldn t have been made. \n\n Errors like this aren t usual in local government but perhaps it represents the attitude of the current thinking in the \nScottish Parliament that our Scottish landscapes, so revered throughout the world, are  pretty worthless. \n\n Holyrood s attitude to landscape is simply to trash it, to industrialise it with massive windfarm developments and \nrun gigantic power lines across it. \n\nThe cartographical error has come to light only a day after the finishing point of the West Highland Way was \nextended from a roundabout on the outskirts of Fort William to the west end of the town s high street, making the \nroute one mile longer than its traditional 95 miles.\n\nThe extension was agreed in a bid to make the most of the trekking route s popularity  and to boost business in the  \nHighland town.\n\n\n\nBusinesses along the route rely on the West Highland Way for a large portion of their passing trade, particularly in \nthe summer months. \n\nAlan Christie, 40, who works at the farmers  market in Milngavie, said the council should have made sure their \nmaps were accurate in light of the significant income the town obtains from tourism.\n\nHe said:  This is where tourists start the West Highland Way. You would have thought they would at least get the \nnames of the lochs right. It will be confusing for the many people who come here to start the walk and I hope they \nchange it soon.  \n\nEast Dunbartonshire Council said it had received no complaints about the error. \n\nA SCOT has appeared in court in Northern Ireland charged with the murder of a young girl who vanished 28 years \nago.\n\nRobert Black, 62, is accused of kidnapping and killing nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy near Lisburn, Co Down, in \n1981.\n\nYesterday, Mr Black, originally from Grangemouth in Stirlingshire, denied the charges. Solicitor, Gabriel Ingram, told \nLisburn Magistrates  Court:  He is an innocent man and he will be contesting the charges. \n\nBlack spoke only to confirm that he understood the charges during the five-minute preliminary inquiry. Resident \nmagistrate Rosemary Watters referred the case to Craigavon Crown Court, where Mr Black will be arraigned on \nMarch 1.\n\nJennifer went missing in August 1981 as she cycled to her friend s home in Ballinderry, Co Antrim. More than 200 \npeople joined the search for the schoolgirl after her red bike was discovered in a field beside a hedge. \n\nAnglers found her body six days later near Hillsborough, about 10 miles from her home. \n\nHEATHER MILLS said yesterday that training for Dancing On Ice was  20 billion times harder  than appearing on a \nUS dance series. Mills, 42, will perform on the ITV show on Sunday. \n\n Jason White could be forgiven for feeling frustration at his lot. The redoubtable Scotland flanker was enjoying a \nnew lease of life after moving from Sale Sharks to Clermont-Auvergne last summer, adjusting quickly to the \nstrenuous demands of the French Championship, and impressing both his national coach, Andy Robinson, and the \nMurrayfield faithful with his performances throughout the autumn Test series.\n\nThen, on the day the New Year dawned, the 31-year-old suffered a double fracture in his left leg, breaking his tibia \nand fibula, during a typically committed training session, and there have to be questions as to whether he will ever \nrepresent his country again. Such fears must lurk beneath the surface of even the most resilient and phlegmatic of \ncharacters, but there was no indication that White is contemplating any notion of early retirement when we spoke.\n\nIn the aftermath of an operation, allied to a series of scans and prognoses about his recovery period   the most \noptimistic estimate is three months   he has been forced to listen to the advice of the specialists and will take no \npart in the imminent RBS 6 Nations.\n\nHowever, White has been down this road before and while this fresh blow night have demoralised some people, his \nrecollection of how he recovered fully from a similar setback in 2006 has provided him with grounds for hope.\n\n Everything had been going really well at Clermont and I was feeling really pleased about things. Then, in the \nmiddle of a session, I snapped my leg.\n\n There was this ominous sound, and I knew straight away it was pretty bad,  said White, who is on crutches, and \nadmits that one of the worst aspects of his injury is that he can t play with his baby daughter, Annabel. \n\n\n\n Because I was out for so long with my knee four years ago, I have just had to accept that these things happen, I \nwas feeling a bit down for a few days, but at least I know the score and have  been through this type of thing before,  \nso I realise I have to be patient.\n\n I am going for another X-ray tomorrow, then I will hopefully start rehab next month and it will be a case of building \nup gradually, from jogging to doing weights after that. There s no point in trying to rush my recovery, but Clermont \nare on a roll and I would like to think I might be involved in the play-offs at the end of the season. \n\nAs a stalwart with 77 caps to his name, White s qualities will undoubtedly be missed when Scotland strive to \norchestrate a more successful Six Nations campaign than in recent years. In 2008, there was an initial sense of \noptimism, swiftly deflated by the French who swept to a deserved 27-6 win in Edinburgh, then, 12 months ago, any \nMicawberish confidence was replaced with gloom when Wales powered to a 26-13 victory at Murrayfield.\n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, White believes early momentum will be crucial, and he sees no reason why Robinson s \nmen can t hit the ground running.  Glasgow and Edinburgh are both doing well in the Magners League, so there is \nno shortage of talent for Andy and his backroom staff to work with,  he said.  The biggest thing is to lay down a \nmarker in the opening game against the French [in Edinburgh on February 7], because if you can start with a win, it \nsets you up for the rest of the competition.\n\n Last year, we just didn t perform and made it far  too easy for Wales, but if  we can put pressure on France, get in \ntheir faces, and take our chances,  I am convinced we can be successful. It s important, because that would \ngenerate a lot of confidence before we travel to Cardiff and if the Welsh were to get beaten by England at \nTwickenham, all the pressure would suddenly be on their shoulders. \n\n To be honest, we should not be afraid of anybody else in Europe   Wales, for instance, have some quality players, \nbut are not as strong as they have been in the last two or three years, and the Scots have to aim to capitalise on \nthat. We must go out with the right amount of belief and courage,  but it should be a very open Six Nations,  so why \nshouldn t we be in contention? \n\nAt the end of a week of tristesse for Scottish rugby, following the death of  Bill McLaren, White concluded:  His voice \nwas the first I heard on the television as a wee boy and I was privileged to meet him and benefit from his wisdom \nbecause Bill was a lovely man. \n\nScotland can perhaps best pay homage  to McLaren by serving up the brand of exciting, effervescent rugby which \nused to thrill him.\n\nGet off the backs\n\nof older members \n\nThe problem of a reducing club membership is obviously not down to older members, whether in receipt of a \nreduced subscription or not. The shortfall is down to the missing generation of 20-to-45year-olds. \n\nI have offspring in that category, and have some awareness of the lifestyle which obtains. An incredibly high \nnumber of wives are now working mothers, even when children are quite young.  The male half of the equation now \nhas more domestic responsibilities, and less time for relatively time consuming occupations like golf. There is now \nconsiderable competition from a variety  of other recreations, some more family friendly.\n\nFor Douglas Lowe to suggest that not wishing to support subsidised seniors is a disincentive is simply mischievous. \nLike many of the assertions that he makes, I have no proof, but I am sure that potential members know nothing \nabout membership structure when they are considering joining a club. Much more important is the ability of the  \nfloating  golfer to play his summer golf on a variety of courses, often at reduced green fees due to competition \nbetween clubs, and to schemes operated by golf magazines, etc. This situation should not be underestimated. The \nScottish Golf Union suggested last year that there were around 250,000 floating golfers, more than the 228,302 \nmen and women who were members of Scotland s clubs at that time. \n\n\n\nThe SGU should be advising member clubs on ways to reduce opportunities for floating golfers. If even 10% of \nfloaters turned into members, this would solve the financial problems of many clubs.\n\nFinally, sooner or later, even for Douglas Lowe, age affects one s ability or desire to play multiple rounds per week, \nand a reduced subscription means that members with 40-50 or more years service do not require to leave friends \nand fellow competitors. If, in the future, there were no reduced subscriptions, there will be significant numbers of \nseniors becoming floaters, and an ever increasing problem for clubs of attracting even more new members from \nother age groups to pay a greatly increased annual subscription.\n\nAndy Salmon [Scottish Golf s development manager] insists that:  we have never said that older golfers are bad or \nthe enemy . They are his constituents along with all other age groups, and contribute towards his salary. It also \nmakes a welcome change from the antagonistic and ill-considered views of your golf correspondent.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that the SGU are not yet being sufficiently pro-active. Like many others, I was not aware \nof the details of the Single Equality Bill. There may be debate around the age at which discounted memberships are \napplied, but make no mistake that it makes economic sense to retain these older members, many of whom do not \nplay enough to justify a full subscription. \n\nMr Lowe, encourage people, including the SGU,  to address the actual problem of the missing generation. Get off \nthe backs of senior golfers. With any luck you may be old some day.\n\nJames Caldwell, by email\n\n* Douglas Lowe replies:  It is flattering to be thought of as a youngster but alas,  at 57, I am already a senior. \n\nMischievous? Perhaps, but as a member at Helensburgh for more than 30 years  I would have been eligible for \nheavily-subsidised golf in just over seven years  time but voted along with fellow members to abolish the practice for \nthe ever-increasing number of incoming 65-year-olds with the intent of lessening the burden for future generations.\n\nI have been a member  of my golf club for 51 years. I got free membership on reaching 65 as I had been a member \nfor 30 years and a new member joins the club in my place. \n\nThis year the club want to change this and ask senior paid-up members for 25% of green fees. There are 77 \nmembers in this category. However, as 50% no longer play golf the club would gain \u00a34000 but lose 30 members, \nmyself included, as well as bar and catering revenue. Every year Douglas Lowe comes up with this complaint about  \npampered senior members . These members have paid for years to keep clubs going without any outside \ninterference from SGU or Douglas Lowe .\n\nWillie Dowie, Mauchline\n\nThe many should  not pay for the few \n\nI remain unconvinced that cost is the primary reason for junior golfers leaving the game, probably temporarily, as \nthey reach adulthood, the real driver being time pressure as other activities enter their maturing lives. I know of \nclubs who have implemented discounted memberships for under-25s, and 25-to-30 year olds, who have seen little \nincrease.\n\nStarting new careers, and families, travelling the world, starting out on the property ladder etc all jostle for time and \ndispensable income. It is vital for juniors to be introduced to golf and helped to play the game, but it should be \naccepted that most will drift away, the key being that early introduction will encourage them to return in time. If this \npremise is accepted the task is to ensure golf thrives and is attractive to re-enter from a cost and enjoyment \nperspective.\n\nThere are key challenges facing golf in general and clubs in particular. Studies have shown that there are now more \npay-and-play golfers in Scotland than member players, and the gap is likely to increase in the coming years. Hence \nthe falling golf club roles, and evaporation of waiting lists and joining fees.\n\n\n\nThe current model where a flat fee is charged for unlimited golf, is fantastic news for the avid golfer who plays at \nleast once a week while working and probably three or four times a week when retired, but is really bad news for \nthe occasional golfer who still has to stump up a \u00a3400-odd annual fee. \n\nAnecdotal evidence from golf clubs is that the majority of their members fall into this latter category. What a surprise \nthat people are reducing the number of club memberships they hold, or drift to pay-and-play golf. The many are \npaying for the few.\n\nThe model used in several other countries is of low membership, say \u00a3100, with a low green fee for each round \nplayed. This entices far more to retain membership and allows clubs to increase their numbers. \n\nReduced memberships for longstanding members will come under pressure in the coming years as they prolong \nthe few paying for the many. To my mind these schemes should at the least cease for new members, and ideally \nscaled down for existing ones.\n\nI accept this model challenges the way golf has always been played in Scotland, but I fear staying with the existing \nwill see more and more golf clubs fail.\n\nDavid Begbie, by email\n\nA sad east-coast  swing to the dollar \n\nSeeing the golf secretary standing beside a stone dyke at Balcomie Links brought on a combination of nostalgia \nand modern irony as  I recalled how in the summer of 1956 as a callow youth of 15, I contested the final of the \nBruce Memorial Trophy at Balcomie against Mr Meldrum, a local fisherman and member of the club.  \n\nFive feet in his stocking soles and four feet wide, he had the traditional east-coast swing   fast, flat and shoulder-\nhigh sending the ball forward like a bullet, low and drawing. My holiday monthly junior ticket was about 30 shillings. \nA day summer ticket at Balcomie is now an unbelievable \u00a372. Have we sold our golfing soul to dollar and yen?\n\nMaybe Scottish golf should return to the basics. So what if things get a bit rougher round the edges. Can ye Trump \nthat ?\n\nDr M A Porteous, by email\n\nA committee of  wide experience \n\nI read with interest the views of David Roy at Crail,  a wealthy club which charges members below what many clubs \nare forced to. They are fortunate to be able to feed off St Andrews and make money from visitors. \n\nMost clubs simply cannot afford to pay the wages that such a post demands and  I do not for one minute believe the \nadditional cost of that post will either be saved or made up in other ways.\n\nThe management of my club contains an oil rig manager, a senior lecturer,  a project manager for building \ndestroyers, a retired senior police officer, two chartered accountants,  a retired vice-president of an international \ncompany as well as successful businessmen and two past club champions who collectively have much more \nexperience in the line of business, management and golf than the likes of Mr Roy.\n\nHe has, surprisingly, been allowed to put his views, unchallenged, into a national newspaper, exaggerating  the \nneeds for his position.   I would not expect him to do otherwise. After all, a Turkey wouldn t vote for Christmas.\n\nAngus McIntosh, by email\n\nAustralian rookie Rick Kulacz collected 11 birdies  in a nine-under-par 63  yesterday to take a one-shot lead at the \nhalfway point of the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship.\n\n\n\nThe 24-year-old from Perth secured limited playing rights on the European Tour with a final-round 64 at Q-School \nlast year   a round he rates as his best ever   but landed a spot in the field this week via  a sponsor s invite.\n\nThe two-time winner on the Asian Tour took full advantage of his chance and charged up the leaderboard to be on \n132, 12 under par and clear of  Sergio Garcia, Shane Lowry and Peter Hanson.\n\nWhile Kulacz s round is an achievement in itself, it is made more remarkable given the fact he was so unhappy with \nhis pre-tournament form he made a phone call to his coach back home in Australia on Wednesday to iron out the \nflaws in his game.\n\n I was just in the zone,  said Kulacz after his round.  I tried to get it on the green and every putt went in. It was just \none of those days where everything went right.\n\n That round is definitely top-five in my career. I think the one at Q-School was better  under the circumstances; to \nget to Europe was pretty special. \n\nKulacz shot a final-round 65 to come back from four behind to win the New South Wales Open as an amateur in \n2006, while he achieved a first win as a professional courtesy of a chip-in on the first play-off hole at the 2008 \nBrunei Open.\n\nIrish Open champion Lowry carded a bogey-free seven-under-par 65, Garcia dropped just one shot in a 67, while \nHanson went one better with a flawless five-under-par round.\n\nFormer champion and last year s runner-up Martin Kaymer (67), Chris Wood, who carded a bogey-free 64, and \nRhys Davies (68) are just a further shot off the pace with Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter in a group at nine under.\n\nScotland s Paul Lawrie added a 70 to his opening 66 to move into a share of 13th place on 136, eight under, while \nMarc Warren savoured a second 69 to stand six under.\n\nLawrie observed:  It was a very good round as I drove the ball poorly today, and when you drive it poorly and you \nstill get around in two under you have to be pleased. \n\n I drove it pretty well on the front nine and didn t make any putts, but then drove it horrendous over the inward nine \nbut managed to get it back for a 70. \n\n I am right up there and just three off the lead, so I am going to hit a few balls now and try and get it sorted it out. \n\nWarren started his round with three straight birdies and picked up two more at his sixth and ninth holes. But the \ndouble European Tour winner stalled over his inward half with a 13th-hole birdie before ending birdie, bogey.\n\n A pair of 69s is not too bad,  said Warren.  It s been a good two days, though today was a bit disappointing given \nthat I was five under par through nine holes I just struggled quite a bit over the back nine. \n\nColin Montgomerie qualified  for the final two rounds on 141, three under par, after shooting a 68. But the Ryder \nCup  captain was far from pleased after his round, citing he s had the wrong end of the draw over the opening two \ndays.\n\n It was hard work out there this afternoon as it seems the early morning starters had a better go of it as there was \nno wind this morning while we were out early yesterday when there was wind, but there the wind then dropped for \nthe afternoon half,  he said.\n\n So all the wind was doing was drying out the greens and making it hard to get close on some holes. But three \nunder after two days is a good score and around a golf course this tough is a good start for the year. \n\nLee Westwood said that his clubs  felt like fishing rods  after shooting a 78 and missing the cut. \n\n\n\nIndeed, things were so bad that the  winner of last season s Race to Dubai was left  wondering if his equipment \nsupplier, Ping, had fitted all his clubs with wrong shafts.\n\n They just don t feel right and they don t feel the same, and I don t know if they ve put the wrong shafts in or  \nwhatever,  he said.\n\nNeil MacGregor, left, and some of the objects that feature in his series (clockwise from below):\n\nl The Ardross Wolf:  A magnificent carving of a wolf sculpted in the 6th or 7th centuries. \n\nl Avant Armour: Standing in Kelvingrove, this is the oldest near-complete armour in the world.\n\nl Horn Spoon: Made from a cow s horn in 1877 by a travelling craftsman. \n\nl The Lewis Chessmen:\n\nMade from  walrus ivory and whale teeth, this set was unearthed on Lewis in 1831. \n\nl Billy Connolly s Banana Boots: Made for the comedian by John Byrne in 1972. \n\nl Burmese silk coat: This beautiful navy coat with gold buttons belonged to King Thibaw Min, the last crowned \nmonarch of Burma. \n\nIn the 1950s, a little boy called Neil was taken to Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow. Sixty years later, \nNeil MacGregor is the most powerful man in British museums and galleries and the writer and presenter of an \nambitious new programme aiming to tell the story of the world in 100 objects. He has never forgotten those trips to \nKelvingrove though. Despite everything he has seen since, it was, he says, those visits to Glasgow s greatest \nmuseum that introduced him to the world. \n\nMacGregor s new series for Radio 4, which he has written and presents, aims to tap into that passion for history but \nalso use the power of objects to tell the story of the world and Britain s and Scotland s place in it.  A History Of The \nWorld is a partnership between the BBC, the British Museum and 350 museums and other collections across the \nUK. As well as the Radio 4 series, the project includes the creation of a digital museum of world history using \nobjects which have both local and global significance. There are 60 Scottish objects included in the project, from \nBilly Connolly s banana boots and Dolly the Sheep to the oldest football in the world.\n\nMacGregor said yesterday that his own favourites from the list change regularly.  Currently I am fascinated by \nRhind Mathmatical Papyrus from Ancient Egypt. It is not a stunningly beautiful object but it is about managing \npractical problems: it was used to help Egyptians build, calculate taxes, regulate trade and myriad other accounting \nactivities. As such it gives us a direct connection with the people of the past and their problems   which are \nremarkably similar to our own. \n\nHe said there were many wonderful objects on the Scottish list too, but singled out Dolly the Sheep.  Dolly is a key \nexample of an object which has a local resonance but is of course of global significance. \n\nMacGregor s love of history can be traced right back to those childhood visits to Kelvingrove s collection, which \nincludes Dali s Christ of St John of the Cross, and has provided many of the objects in the project.  \n\n Kelvingrove has the sharpest sense of public ownership of the collection than any other museum I know,  said \nMacGregor.  It is part of the life of the city in a way that all museums ought to be.  \n\nMacGregor said he had high hopes for the Radio 4 series.  The series and surrounding project is a huge   and very \nexciting   undertaking. I hope that through the radio programmes, through the BBC Nations and English regions \nactivity and through the website we will enable the public to engage with objects and the stories they tell, and to \nencourage them through uploading their own objects  to the web to tell their own  histories of the world . \n\n\n\nAngela Roberts, the manager of the project in Scotland, said the scale of the project had quickly grown when they \nstarted in September last year.  The aim was to have 30-40 objects from Scotland but soon became clear that we \nwould have to have more than that,  she said yesterday.  The aim was to try and make the project user-friendly. It \nwas all about stories and objects that told good, compelling stories. It was a huge amount of work. We started in \nSeptember and we only finished last weekend. \n\nThere are a range of TV and radio programmes to accompany A History Of The World including the Radio 4 series, \na 13-part television series for CBBC series. There is also a website at www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld where \nScottish museums and the public can upload their own objects to create a digital museum for future generations.\n\nRoberts added:  We hope everyone can get involved  by uploading pictures of their objects to help tell the story of \nScotland s influence on the world and, in turn, the world s influence on Scotland. \n\n  \n\n(corrected repetition, amending sales figure and period in par 4)  McDONALD'S SERVES UP 'RECORD-\nBREAKING' YEAR  By Kelly Macnamara, Press Association City Staff  The UK was McDonald's best performing \nmajor market last year as consumers were drawn to its value meals in the recession, the firm said today.  \nMcDonald's hailed a \"record breaking\" performance in 2009 with like-for-like sales up 11% and 7.5% growth in the \nnumber of customer visits.  The fast food giant today announced plans to create another 5,000 jobs in 2010 as its \nrestaurants are now busier and open longer, while 10 to 15 new outlets are also planned.  McDonald's brushed off \nthe recessionary gloom with its strongest results in four years as it grew its share of the market. The chain has \ngrown UK sales by \u00a3465 million during the past four years.  The firm has seen an upswing in consumers seeking \nout its Extra Value Meals in the difficult economic environment.  Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald's \nUK, said \"now more than ever\" value was important to customers and the firm wanted to offer \"good food that is \naffordable to everyone\".  The firm has seen growth across its menus, with particular demand for its Saver Menu and \na new Little Tasters value offer.  \"If you have just got a pound in your pocket you know there is always something \nfor you in McDonald's,\" he said.  The firm added that it gained share in a declining eating out market in 2009.  Mr \nEasterbrook said the company invested in upgrading the quality of the ingredients it uses and customers also \nreacted positively when ethical products like organic milk were used - as long as the price was kept the same.  He \npredicted the firm would continue to be attractive to customers even if the economy pulls itself out of recession as \nexpected.  \"Whilst the economy may return to growth I don't see that being returned to people's pay packets so \nvalue will always be important,\" he said.  McDonald's, which spent \u00a395 million on its refurbishment programme last \nyear, is in the process of a cafe-style refit for its 1,200 stores and Mr Easterbrook said the programme is about \nhalfway through.  He said restaurants that had been refitted performed 6% better than the market.  McDonald's UK \noutdid the global group, which saw like-for-like sales of 3.8%. Mr Easterbrook said the country was the top \nperformer of the firm's best 10 markets.  The 5,000 new jobs will mainly be in existing restaurants as they gear up \nfor longer opening hours - taking advantage of breakfast and late night customers - and increasing customer \nnumbers.  McDonald's added 6,000 jobs last year, 2,000 more than it had expected and taking its overall headcount \nto 80,000.  Group net income was up 6% at 4.55 billion US dollars (\u00a32.83 billion).  end\n\nSIX men convicted for their roles in the UK s biggest cash robbery were yesterday ordered to pay back money \nstolen in the raid.\n\nThe criminals behind the \u00a353 million Securitas raid in February 2006 were told by a judge at Woolwich Crown Court \nthey must comply with the confiscation orders within six months or face additional jail sentence.\n\nPaul Allen, the trusted lieutenant of the mastermind behind the robbery on the cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent, \nadmitted his part in the hold-up in October and accepted he had benefited to the sum of \u00a31.9m.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr Justice Penry-Davey accepted that assets to the value of \u00a31.231m were available to be \nconfiscated and ordered Allen, 31, from Chatham, Kent, to pay that sum. The judge dismissed Stuart Royle s \napplication, in which he claimed the money he gained from the robbery was beyond his control or reach, and \nordered him to pay back \u00a32m.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld\n\n\nCar salesman Royle, 51, of Maidstone, was jailed indefinitely in January 2008 along with four other men for their \nparts in the robbery.\n\nMr Penry-Davey ordered a third man, Ermir Hysenaj, to pay \u00a3250,000.\n\nLea Rusha, Jetmir Bucpapa and Roger Coutts were meanwhile made the subject of nominal confiscation orders \nafter the judge ruled there was enough evidence to show money recovered at three locations was their share of the \nproceeds.\n\nThe men will be called before the courts if they show unexplained financial gain in the future, a police spokesman \nsaid.\n\n Almost \u00a320m was recovered in a garage in Southborough, a Ford Transit van in a car park at the Ashford \nInternational Hotel and at ENR Cars in Welling. Detective Inspector Mark Fairhurst of Kent Police said:  Six men \nwere convicted of their part in a robbery which involved the kidnap of a woman and child and keeping them and the \nSecuritas employees hostage at gun point.\n\n The presiding judge has dismissed claims made by some of the defendants in which they have tried to mask the \nactual amounts of money they have benefited from following the robbery. \n\nNigel Pilkington of the Crown Prosecution Service unit which dealt with the case said:  Seizing criminal assets and \nrecovering the proceeds of criminal activity is not simply an add on to the prosecution of criminals   it helps \ninvestigators and prosecutors to disrupt further criminal activity and return the money to the general public to whom \nit rightly belongs.\n\n These were organised criminals who tried to benefit from their crime at the expense of and to the detriment of the \ncommunity as a whole. \n\nMcDonald s has enjoyed a record year for UK sales after customers opted for its  extra value meals  during the \nrecession.\n\nLike-for-like sales were up 11% in 2009 on the previous year and the number of customer visits rose by 7.5%.\n\nThe fast food giant has announced plans to create another 5,000 new jobs in 2010 as its restaurants are now busier \nand open longer, and 10 to 15 new outlets are also planned.\n\nLast year s results were its strongest in four years, during which time UK sales have grown by \u00a3465m.\n\nSteve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald s UK, said value was important to customers  now more than ever  \nand that the firm wanted to offer  good food that is affordable to everyone .\n\nHe predicted the firm would continue to be attractive to customers even if the economy pulls itself out of recession \nas expected.\n\nMcDonald s, which spent \u00a395 million on its refurbishment programme last year, is in the process of a cafe-style refit \nfor its 1,200 stores.\n\nMr Easterbrook said the programme is about half-way through and that re-fitted restaurants performed 6% better \nthan others.\n\nA supermarket in Glasgow has been bombarded with more than 1500 job applications for only 93 posts at its new \nstore.\n\nRetail giant Tesco s recruitment team have been overwhelmed by the applications for jobs at the ex-Woolworths \nshop in Byres Road.\n\n\n\nNext month s opening of the West End store heralds Tesco s plan to enter the fight for customers in one of \nGlasgow s most affluent neighbourhoods.\n\nThe medium-sized Metro branch in Byres Road is just around the corner from an M&S Simply Food and only 200 \nyards from Glasgow s first Waitrose, which at the end of last year reported sales were 39% ahead of forecast in \ntheir first month of trading there.\n\nTesco research shows the West End customers were driving to its Maryhill and St Rollox stores to buy staple or \ntop-up items,  in the lead up to the store opening.\n\nAllan Williams, store manager, said:  In this time of economic uncertainty, it is great that we are able to create jobs \nand help get people back into work.\n\n We recruited from the local area in conjunction with the local JobCentre and the quality of applicants was fantastic. \nI am delighted with my new team.\n\n We are currently preparing for the launch of the new store on February 15 and look forward to playing an active \nrole in the local community. \n\nThe 6500sq ft store aims to attract a diverse profile of customers   from students to pensioners.\n\nWaitrose said more than 4,000 shoppers visited their Byres Road outlet since it opened last November.\n\nA Tesco spokesman added:  With M&S and Waitrose at one end of Byres Road, Tesco will bring a different choice  \nto the area. \n\n It will be what we would describe as a  basket shop . \n\n Our small stores, such as the one in Byres Road, are designed for people arriving on foot or public transport. \n\nAyr v Stewart s-Melville\n\nKenny Murray, the Ayr coach, is  looking for his champions to deliver  a bonus-point win against the foot-of-the-\ntable visitors to complete a  joyful series of deliveries, his wife Kirsten having recently given birth  to their first child.\n\nThe seasiders expect to be close  to full strength as they bid to remain  on he heels of the pacesetters Currie, and \nthey should be in for a stroll.\n\nGraham Moffat, of Stew-Mel,  brings in the winger Liam Steele for the injured Mike Doneghan as they try to erase \nthe memory of last weekend s fade-out at home to West.  Most  teams would expect to win after scoring 33 points,  \nhe said,  but,  after our defence conceded 44 points, we will have to tighten up hugely. \n\nPrediction No additional sleep  lost for Murray\n\nBoroughmuir v Glasgow Hawks\n\nBoroughmuir have the Glasgow Warriors prop Justin Va a available and he will be on the bench, ready to be \ndeployed as an impact sub while Hawks welcome back Va a s pro team chum Colin Shaw for his first appearance \nof the season\n\nPeter Wright, the Hawks coach, said:  We are keen to kick start our season after the freeze-up. It will be a very \ndifficult game: Meggetland is never any easy place to play, as we found to our cost last season. \n\nPrediction Hawks to sneak it\n\nEdinburgh Accies v Currie\n\n\n\nAccies will be without centres  Stevie Wilson (hamstring) and  Iain Berthinussen (hand bone) but Stuart Moffat, the \nformer Scotland full-back, returns to face the league leaders.\n\nIn an effort to beef up the pack, Greg Campbell goes to No.8 and is replaced by Matt Stevens in the second row, \nwith Robin Snape unlucky to find himself demoted to the bench.\n\nTheir coach Ian Barnes said:   Last week against Boroughmuir  was a disaster and we are looking for  a \ndramatically improved performance. \n\nAlly Donaldson, the Currie coach, said:  We are without our Scotland Under-20 boys, so we are grateful to have \nScott Forrest and Chris Kinloch from the pro ranks. \n\nPrediction Currie in a hurry\n\nHeriot s v Melrose\n\nRob McKillop, the Heriot s coach, is  set to have a pro team playmaker at  his disposal after shaking off illness.  \nLast week was a very frustrating experience for us at Dundee for a variety of reasons, but the commitment and \neffort the boys showed was superb,  McKillop said.  Melrose are always a tough challenge with guys like John \nDalziel up front and Scott Wight and James King in the backs. \n\nMelrose s only absentee is the scrum-half Robbie Chrystie and their coach Craig Chalmers said:  Both teams will \nlook to play open attractive rugby so, if the weather is good, it should be a cracking game. \n\nPrediction Melrose to shade it\n\nWatsonians v Dundee\n\nWatsonians  plans have been hit by an injury to their Hong Kong internationalist Mike McKee, with Nick Montgomey \ncoming in. Ian Rankin, the Dundee High coach, wants his troops to build on last weekend s home win against \nHeriot s. His squad are bolstered by the return of Ross Lemon following the birth of his son.\n\nPrediction High on a high\n\n West of Scotland v Selkirk\n\nJohn Beattie, the West coach, moves Conor Davis to full-back because  Ben Wright is unavailable. Eager to build \non their win at Inverleith, he said:   We have a chance to demonstrate our top-flight ambitions. We have a group of \nplayers embarrassed about the  last time they played down in Selkirk. \n\nLee Jones makes a welcome  return after injury for the Borderers, while Gavin Craig moves back to his favoured \nposition at No.10 in the absence of Michael Rutherford.\n\nPrediction West best\n\nDAVID KELSO\n\nPREMIERSHIP 1  (KICK-OFFS 2PM UNLESS STATED)\n\nKelso v Gala\n\nWhile Hawick lead the way, Stirling County, a point behind, have played  two fewer games. The title will go to one of \nthe pair, with third-placed Gala nine points adrift of Stirling.\n\nIn the battle for survival, two of the bottom four, Jed (at Stirling) and Dunfermline (at Aberdeen) are unlikely to take \nmore than a narrow loss bonus point. Haddington may also struggle at home to a  Peebles side that has enjoyed \nmore success on the road than at home, so Kelso look likeliest to improve their position at home to Gala.\n\n\n\nPrediction Kelso to sneak it\n\nOTHER FIXTURES Aberdeen Grammar v Dunfermline, Haddington v Peebles, Hawick v Biggar, Kirkcaldy v GHA, \nStirling County v  Jed Forest\n\nPREMIERSHIP 2\n\nGarnock v Perthshire\n\nHillhead/Jordanhill, Howe of Fife and Falkirk are well clear and two of them will be in Premier 2 next season. So \nlong as they overcome rustiness from a lack of match practice, home wins are on the cards against, Musselburgh, \nCartha Queen s Park and Hamilton.\n\nArdrossan and Dumfries should also chalk up home wins so only at Garnock does home dominance seem under \nthreat. The meet Perthshire in a classic relegation zone  eight-pointer . An away win would probably make Shire \nsafe.\n\nPrediction six home wins\n\nOTHER FIXTURES Ardrossan Acads v Irvine, Dumfries v Morgan Acad FP, Falkirk v Hamilton, Hillhead Jordanhill \nv Musselburgh, Howe of Fife v Cartha Queen s Park\n\nPREMIERSHIP 3\n\n This year s Australian Open has more than  a touch of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about it, but Andy Murray will be hoping that things \nchange here tomorrow when he plays his fourth-round match against the American John Isner.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Murray has cruised through to the last 16 without losing a set. Twelve months \nago, his confidence was rocked by a stunning performance from Spain s Fernando Verdasco, playing the match of \nhis life.\n\nTomorrow, he will take on Isner, another man in the form of his life. The world No.28 won the warm-up event in \nAuckland and yesterday he took out the man Murray must have expected to face, Frenchman Gael Monfils, beating \nhim in four sets.\n\nBut Murray, who eased into round four yesterday with a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 win over Florent Serra, another Frenchman, \nhas never played Isner, but knows all about the challenge the 6ft 9in American will present as he looks to reach the \nquarter-finals in Melbourne for the first time.  The run he s been on, he s a difficult guy to play against,  Murray said \nyesterday.\n\n He s the guy everyone talks about all the time. You don t want [Ivo] Karlovic or Isner next to your name in the draw, \nbecause the match is on the other guy s racket. If he serves great and hits some big shots and returns, Isner is a \nreally tough guy to beat. I m going to have to be on my game. \n\nIsner hammered down 26 aces on his way to victory over Monfils and Murray will need his returns to be on song if \nhe is to avoid a similar fate. The chances tend to be few and far between and the Scot knows he will have to be \npatient and focused throughout. \n\nFortunately, he has tended to play well against the taller players on tour. He has beaten the 6ft 10in Karlovic in \neach of their three meetings and also triumphed over 6ft 8in South African Kevin Anderson in round one here. \n\n I ve always played well against them, but it does always come down to a few points,  he said.  So it s really \nimportant to be on the ball when you get the chances, as they don t come so often. \n\nMurray s movement has been superb in the first week. The Scot s fitness work over the past few years has been \nwell-documented, but in addition to his anticipation and feel, his speed is making him an even bigger danger to his \nopponents, as Isner admits.\n\n\n\n It s going to be tough,  he conceded.  Andy s such a really good player. I m going to have to play really well to have \na chance out there. He s one of the fittest guys on tour. He really can do anything. He can play offence, he can play \ndefence. He can mix it up really well. \n\nIsner s game revolves around his serve, which is devastating when it works, as it did at the US Open last summer \nwhen he upset Andy Roddick on his way to the fourth round. His run here equals his best performance at a grand-\nslam event and his confidence makes him a danger to Murray.\n\n I m going to force the issue,  said Isner.  Coming forward, being aggressive. I ll be making mistakes, but hopefully \nhitting a good number of winners as well.  \n\nIf Lord Lucan had turned up alive and well at Melbourne Park yesterday, it would barely  have been a bigger \nsurprise. Kim Clijsters  stunning 6-0, 6-1 defeat by Russia s Nadia Petrova in the third round left the Belgian \nshattered and wondering what had happened. It was one of those days.\n\nHaving won the US Open in incredible fashion in September, in just her third event back after two years away and \nthe birth of her first child, no one could have foreseen her losing to Petrova, let alone the way in which it happened. \nIt was utterly stunning.\n\n It sucks,  a dumb-struck Clijsters said after what was, not surprisingly, her heaviest defeat in any grand slam event.  \nIt sucks that it has to happen at this stage of this tournament at least. If it happens in another tournament, then you \ncan say, OK, it s not a big deal, just keep working hard. But matches like this happen maybe once a year. \n\nThe quality of the performance by world No.19 Petrova should not be underestimated but Clijsters gave so many \npoints away that she didn t even need to be that good. The errors flew off the Belgian s racquet to the extent that \nshe won just five points in the  first set.\n\nThe second set wasn t much better and Clijsters said she just wanted to forget all about the match and rest.  I will \njust stick to the routines,  she said.  Everything I ve been doing so far with my coach has been going really well. I m \ngoing to try to not let a match like this get me down or start doubting myself or anything. \n\n I ve played some good tennis here, especially last week in Brisbane [she won the Brisbane International]. I think \nthat s what I want to try to take away from this trip. It s too bad it didn t happen here. \n\nClijsters had been expected  to play another returning former world No.1 from Belgium, Justine Henin, in the \nquarter-finals. Henin looked a little scratchy yesterday but still managed to beat Alisa Kleybanova of Russia. She \nnow plays another Belgian, Yanina Wickmayer, for a place in the last eight.\n\nConsidering the effort that she put in over the first three weeks of 2010 it is particularly harsh on Elena Baltacha that \nshe will lose her British No.1 status once the tournament is done and dusted.\n\nHer impressive run at Melbourne Park ended yesterday with a 6-1, 6-2 defeat at the hands of the world No.2 Dinara \nSafina in the third round, but she successfully defended the 160 points she earned last year by qualifying and \nreaching round two. However, with Katie O Brien gaining points on her efforts 12 months ago, Baltacha will slip \nbehind  her fellow Briton in the country s standings.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, however, it will not matter much for Baltacha, who achieved her first objective in \nmaintaining her place in the world s top 100.  Any tournament I play now, I m going to be trying to build from what I \nve done already this year, in Auckland, Hobart and then here,  said Baltacha.\n\n I ve had a fantastic start to 2010. I was in the third round and earned my spot in the Rod Laver Arena against \nSafina  and that was a great experience for me. I ve learned a lot. It s good motivation. \n\nALPINE SKIING\n\n\n\nTODAY & TOMORROW. Bairns Alpine Races, The Lecht; British Schools Alpine International, Boys, Meiringen; \nGirls, Flaine.

I think he  will dismantle \nIsner s serve and then take him apart off either wing off  the ground. Andy has always done  really well against the \nbig servers  and I think that Isner is a good match for him.\n\n The type of returns Isner is going to be getting at his feet, with a variety of pace and spin on them, will disorientate \nhim. To me, Andy seems to enjoy playing the big servers. \n\n* Scottish Hydro Electric National League\n\nDiv 1 Annan v Ellon, Berwick v Langholm, Dalziel v Whitecraigs, Edinburgh Uni v East Kilbride, Linlithgow v RHC, \nLivingston v Murrayfield Wndrs\n\n\n\nDiv 2 Caithness v Lasswade, Glasgow Acads v Stewartry, Hawick YM v Waysiders Drumpellier, Highland v \nKilmarnock, Newton Stewart v Cambuslang, Preston Lodge FP v Greenock Wndrs\n\nDiv 3 Aberdeenshire v GHK, Allan Glen s v Lenzie, Gordonians v Marr, Hawick Linden v Hillfoots, Helensburgh v \nTrinity Acads, Ross High v  Forrester FP\n\n* Scottish Hydro Electric Regional League \n\nCaledonia.

This will give no comfort to teachers who believe it is their professional duty to \nact firmly and fairly when it comes to addressing indiscipline.\n\n\n\n Parents will also be alarmed by the fact that teachers might feel reluctant to intervene when a fight breaks out. We \nneed radical measures to improve discipline in our schools, not pander to those who seek to cause trouble. \n\nLast year, the SSTA wrote to Glasgow City Council asking officials to sanction payment for the dental bill since the \ninjuries were incurred at work. \n\nHowever, Josephine Giblin, the council s senior claims officer, has told the teacher the claim is invalid as there was \nno negligence on the part of the council.\n\n The council is self-insured in relation to claims of this nature and compensation can be paid only if the loss or \ndamage occurs due to negligence on the part of the council,  she said.\n\nAnn Ballinger, general secretary of the SSTA, said:  Intervening in a fight can incur a considerable risk to the \nmember of staff. However, teachers are prepared to do that because it is in the best interests of the pupils and the \nschool.\n\n If teachers feel they do not have the full support of their local authority employers when they are injured in such an \nincident, then it puts school staff in a very difficult position where they may be less inclined to get involved. \n\nA council spokeswoman said:  All claims are judged on their individual merits. Advice is given to staff to consider \ntheir own safety and not put themselves at risk or any danger in a  particular situation. \n\nA LANDMARK venue is to have a casino installed as part of a multi-million-pound facelift.\n\nThe Corinthian in Glasgow has closed for six months while millionaire owner Stefan King hedges his bets on a \nmajor refurbishment.\n\nThe five-floor complex, in the city s Merchant City, will be transformed during the closure. \n\nA casino will be created on one level of the A-listed building in Ingram Street after Mr King secured a gambling \nlicence. \n\nWork has already started on the building, which will reopen with a  dramatic new look  overseen by renowned \nGlasgow design company Graven Images. \n\nWhen it reopens, the complex will feature a cocktail bar, brasserie, nightclub and private dining rooms, in addition to \nmeeting and event spaces.\n\nDavid McDowall, group operations director, said:  We are delighted to start work and look forward to working with \nGraven Images to develop the possibilities the casino licence presents for Corinthian Club. \n\n I can reassure all our regular customers the extensively refurbished facilities will cater for a wide variety of tastes \nand feature a completely remodelled bar, restaurant and club facilities. \n\nOnce the home of the Union Bank, the building later became Glasgow s High Court and boasts one of the most \nimpressive interiors in the city. \n\nThe main bar currently features a domed ceiling and chandeliers, while club nights are held downstairs in the old \ncourt cells. The bar, club, cocktail lounge and function suite closed on Hogmanay and will reopen in June. \n\nThe grand entrance to the Victorian property and its ornate windows have been boarded up while work is carried \nout.\n\nA spokesman for Mr King s G1 Group said:  We opened in March 1999 and it has been a long time since we have \nhad a refurbishment. \n\n\n\n We have been planning this for a while. The building has five floors and is A-listed, so it is not the sort of thing you \ncan do overnight. \n\nMr King first applied for a gaming licence for the Corinthian in 2006, marking a change in direction for his G1 \nempire, and a licence was granted the following year. \n\nOver the past decade, the Corinthian has hosted some of the city s most glamorous events, including an Armani \nfashion show, the Music Of Black Origin Awards afterparty and the premiere party for Ken Loach s film Sweet \nSixteen.\n\nThe Corinthian is the most prestigious venue in Mr King s portfolio of more than 40 venues across Scotland, \nincluding restaurants, bars, clubs, cinemas and hotels.\n\nHis Glasgow-based company recently suffered a drop in profits, according to figures issued in October and Mr King \ns annual salary and dividend package was more than halved to \u00a3500,000. But figures show the firm had invested \nsome \u00a311.2 million in new venues and refurbishments during the year and turnover climbed 6.6% to \u00a345.2m for the \nyear to the end of March 2009, compared with \u00a342.4m the year before.\n\nGlasgow already has several casinos and plans are under  way to establish another as part of a \u00a31.2 billion retail \nand leisure development at Glasgow Harbour.\n\nONE of Glasgow s finest Chinese restaurants has promised to reopen next week after a burst pipe sent water \npouring through the ceiling and caused \u00a350,000 of damage.\n\nAround 40 customers at Ho Wong in York Street were rushed out in the middle of their meals  after water cascaded \nthrough the ceiling in the bar area.\n\nBosses at the restaurant, which has been in the street for almost 25 years, described it as being  like Niagara Falls .\n\nOwner David Wong, 62, said:  It started leaking at the front of the restaurant and then all the water suddenly came \nthrough and the ceiling collapsed. We had to close.  The main area is OK, but the bar and the private room have \nbeen damaged. \n\nStaff had to call the fire brigade to break into the building above to locate the burst pipe, which was one of many \naffected by the recent big freeze and resulting thaw that caused chaos throughout Scotland.\n\nMr Wong and business partner Tony Cheung, 56, are planning to reopen at the end of next week after the ceiling, \ncarpet and wallpaper have been replaced. \n\nWhile they should be able to claim for all the damage on their insurance, they say trade has been hit since it closed \nin the middle of the month.\n\nMr Wong said:  We have lost business and have to pay our staff when the restaurant is closed. We need the money \ncoming in. There will be disappointed customers, but there is nothing we can do. \n\nStars who have dined at the restaurant over the years include Australian model Rachel Hunter, who visited with \nMichelle Mone, boss of the Ultimo lingerie company.\n\nThe restaurant is still at the centre of a wrangle with the Dubai-based Jumeirah Group, which wants to open a six-\nstar hotel on the site at the junction with Argyle Street.\n\nA Scottish Government public inquiry in September backed up Glasgow City Council s compulsory purchase order \non the restaurant, as well as pawnbroker Robert Biggar and two flats, so building work can start.\n\nMr Wong said he still does not want to move. \n\nHe added:  We ve been here for such a long time    everybody knows us. \n\n\n\nONE of Glasgow s finest Chinese restaurants has promised to reopen next week after a burst pipe sent water \npouring through the ceiling and caused \u00a350,000 of damage.\n\nAround 40 customers at Ho Wong in York Street were rushed out in the middle of their meals  after water cascaded \nthrough the ceiling in the bar area.\n\nBosses at the restaurant, which has been in the street for almost 25 years, described it as being  like Niagara Falls .\n\nOwner David Wong, 62, said:  It started leaking at the front of the restaurant and then all the water suddenly came \nthrough and the ceiling collapsed.

Nicholls was confident his two-mile chaser would win the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in the \nabsence of stablemate Master Minded. He was right, too, Twist Magic winning by five lengths.\n\nThat was an exhilarating performance and if he can replicate that display at Ascot he will win again. The question \nmark about the Nicholls horse is that he may not necessarily repeat the form at the Surrey track.\n\nLast year he had his first experience of the Ascot turf in this race, when he blundered at the last fence, although \nlooking as if he was already bound for second place behind Tamarinbleu.\n\nOn the face of it that was not too bad a show as the winner is an even more unpredictable character and if he can \navoid the type of error he made then, he could easily add this prize to his cv.\n\nThe main dangers, apart from his own frailties, would seem to be Well Chief and Petit Robin. The former is doing \nremarkably well after a long lay-off through injury, while Petit Robin (2.40) has quirks of his own but, like the \nfavourite, can be smart in his best form. He beat Well Chief at Kempton, is better  off now and, with Tony McCoy \nbooked, he is the one I believe is worth a bet against the favourite. \n\nNicholls  belief in Celestial Halo as a possible, maybe even probable, Champion Hurdle winner, has not wavered \ndespite a relatively disappointing run when second to Khyber Kim at Cheltenham last month, but  he was giving \nweight away to that winner and the form may be better than it looks.\n\nEither way, he was only narrowly beaten in the Champion Hurdle at the same course last year and looks sure to be \na formidable  contender for the Irish version  tomorrow. He, Solwhit and Sublimity appear to be the main players in \nwhat should be quite a race. The former, who beat the latter over course and distance last time out, is a consistent \n\n\n\nhurdler  who is top class proven. He is odds-on, which does not appeal and, in the circumstances, Celestial Halo \n(2.45) is the choice.\n\nAt Haydock, the reigning Cheltenham champion, Punjabi (2.55), faces only three rivals in the Champion Hurdle \nTrial, one of whom, Afsoun, is his stablemate. He should win, but the pace of the race could be false and might go \nagainst him unless Afsoun, who is not normally a pacesetter, is asked to do the job this time.\n\n* Selections\n\nAscot 2.05 Whiteoak, 2.40 Petit Robin, 3.10 Stravinsky Dance, 3.45 Miss Mitch \n\nHaydock 2.20 Diamond Harry, 2.55 Punjabi, 3.30 Cloudy Lane \n\nLeopardstown (Tomorrow)   2.45 Celestial Halo\n\n1919 One of the most successful managers in football history, Bob Paisley, was born.

This runs contrary to the \nfacts and is harmful to China-US relations.\n\n We urge the United States to cease using so-called internet freedom to make groundless accusations against \nChina. \n\nBut he indicated his Government did not want the dispute to  overwhelm co-operation with the Obama \nadministration, which has sought Beijing s backing on economic policy and diplomatic standoffs, such as Iran and \nNorth Korea.\n\nYesterday, Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei played down the dispute with Google and said his Government \nwas more worried about broader economic and political disputes that could flare up in coming months.\n\nMrs Clinton s speech criticised the cyber policies of China and Iran, among others, and demanded Beijing \ninvestigate the hacking complaints from Google.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and YouTube are blocked in China, which uses a filtering  firewall  to prevent internet users from \nseeing overseas websites with content anathema to the Communist Party.\n\n Sino-US ties have been impacted,  said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in \nBeijing, of Washington s push on internet controls.\n\n China has admitted there are areas where it can improve and then Clinton made her comments in a public venue, \ncomparing us to Egypt and Saudi Arabia,  he added.\n\n So I think over the past year Clinton s speech is the most undiplomatic thing she s said. \n\nSome sections of the Chinese media were quick to criticise Mrs Clinton s remarks. But many of the Chinese reports \nwere themselves cut from websites within hours of appearing.\n\nChinese websites often adjust or cut content based on propaganda authority instructions, especially for volatile \nissues.\n\nMany cyber-experts suspect that the hacker attacks from China on Google and other targets were so sophisticated \nthat official involvement was likely.\n\nTies between China and the US have been put to the test in recent months over trade, currency, climate change \nand arms sales to Taiwan.\n\nWith the two giant nations joined at the hip economically, tensions are unlikely to escalate into outright confrontation   \nbut could make co-operating on global economic and security issues all the more difficult.\n\nEarlier this month China denounced the US sale of Patriot air defence missiles to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as \nits own.\n\nChina announced its own anti-missile test soon after and warned that more weapons sales to  Taiwan could bruise \nrelations.\n\n\n\nBeijing has also urged President Obama not to meet the Dalai Lama, the exiled Buddhist leader of Tibet, who China \ndenounces as a separatist.\n\nNiu Jun, an international studies expert at Peking University, said:  Over the short haul the Google issue will go \naway because other problems that the US and China face are rather numerous. \n\n Economic and trade issues are still more important.    Reuters\n\nTHE Indian interior ministry has recommended extra security measures at airports after intelligence services \ndiscovered a threat from militants to hijack a plane belonging to Air India.\n\nThe warning comes ahead of India s annual Republic Day on Tuesday, when there are often security scares.\n\nSecurity officials said they have put the country s air defences on the highest possible alert following warnings of \npossible air attacks by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group using gliders.\n\nIndia has beefed-up security measures and remains wary of militant threats after the 2008 Mumbai attacks killed \n166 people and raised tensions with nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan.\n\n We have alerted our civil aviation security people against a possible attempt to hijack an Indian airlines flight,  U.K. \nBansal, the special secretary for internal security at the Indian Home Ministry, said.\n\n This would obviously be from terrorist groups who are clearly against Indian interests,  he added, but did not \nspecify which group.\n\nAn Air India spokesman did not offer any immediate comment on the threat.\n\nThe ministry had not recommended suspension of flights but suggested measures such as greater frisking and \ndeploying more sky marshals, Bansal said.\n\nThe biggest hijack threat was to flights by the carrier to and from the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC) group of neighbouring nations, he said.\n\nSAARC is made up of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Indian Air Force said it was taking extra precautions after receiving intelligence on a possible air attack.\n\n The air force is on high alert, although use of gliders by militants to carry out attacks seems unlikely. But we are not \nleaving anything to chance,  a senior air force official said in New Delhi.\n\nUNITED States defence secretary Robert Gates has urged Pakistan to put pressure on all militant groups based in \nits lawless northwest, including the Afghan Taliban.\n\nThe army is fighting al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban factions who have been responsible for several bombings \nand other attacks in the country.\n\nMilitants were cleared out of the Swat valley, northwest of Islamabad, after three months of clashes which started in \nApril.\n\nIn October, the army launched an offensive against the main Pakistan Taliban bastion in South Waziristan, on the \nAfghan border. \n\nSecurity forces have also been fighting a third main Pakistani faction in the Bajaur region at the northeast of the \nethnic Pashtun tribal belt on the Afghan border.\n\nMr Gates praised these actions but is pressing Islamabad to go after the Afghan factions too.\n\n\n\nHe said making a distinction between Pakistani Taliban and their Afghan allies was counterproductive and he called \nfor Pakistan to pressure Afghan factions. \n\nBut Mr Gates, keen to build trust with the Pakistani military, did not repeat the usual US call to  do more .\n\nHe said it was up to Pakistan to decide when to act.\n\nAnalysts, however, say Pakistan is reluctant to begin hostilities with groups that pose no danger to its security. \n\nTWO Greek policemen have denied the shooting of a teenager that provoked nationwide riots.\n\nAlexandros Grigoropoulos, 15, was killed during a confrontation in December 2008 when a gang of youths taunted \nthe officers and threw plastic bottles at their car.\n\nThe shooting triggered days of violent rioting that spread throughout Greece.\n\nRioting in Athens last year, on the anniversary of the shooting, led to more than 130 arrests.\n\nThe heavily guarded trial opened in the provincial town of Amfissa, 120 miles from Athens.\n\nEpaminondas Korkoneas denies murder and Vassilis Saraliotis pleads not guilty to complicity to murder.\n\nKorkoneas, 39, claims the boy was killed by a warning shot fired into the air that ricocheted.\n\n I don t accept liability for anybody s death,  he told the court. Saraliotis, 33, said he also was innocent  and will \nprove it .\n\nsergipe: Two members of British heavy metal band After Death have drowned on tour in Brazil.\n\nThe body of 21-year-old guitarist Leon Villalba washed ashore shortly after he was seen struggling in heavy waves \non a beach in Sergipe state.\n\nBass player Tim Kennelly, 18, who was with him in the water is missing and police say he has drowned.\n\nThe band had just begun a 23-date tour in Brazil.\n\nMiguel Freitas, managing director of the band s label Death Toll records,  confirmed the drowning.\n\ncrete: Two British men have been arrested for two arson attacks on a medieval synagogue on the Greek island of \nCrete.\n\nThe attacks in the seaside town of Hania this month destroyed thousands of books, valuable archives and \nheirlooms.\n\nPolice said a Greek man and the two Britons living in Crete have been arrested and another two US nationals are \nwanted in connection with the attacks.\n\nThe Etz Hayyim Synagogue is the only one to survive on the island, whose last Jewish community, in Hania, was \nwiped out during the Second World War.\n\nNEW YORK: Toyota is recalling more than two million cars in the US over fears of sticking accelerator pedals, just \nmonths after another major problem affected massive numbers.\n\nThe latest recall is due to potential problems with the pedal mechanism.\n\nThe earlier issue affected 4.2 million vehicles which were at risk of the pedal becoming trapped under floor mats.\n\n\n\nThis time Toyota said, in rare cases, the pedal mechanism wears down, causing the accelerator to become harder \nto press, slower to return or, in some cases, stuck. \n\nIt said the problem appeared to be related to the potential build-up of condensation on sliding surfaces in the \naccelerator system that helps drivers push down or release the pedal.\n\nToyota said drivers in the recalled vehicles whose pedals become stuck should firmly apply their brakes, drive the \ncar to a safe location, shut off the engine and contact the nearest dealer.\n\nWORLD IN BRIEF  YEMEN ANTI-TERROR PRAISE  America will provide more anti-terror and development aid to \nembattled Yemen, but the country must keep up its fight against al Qaida and other militants, secretary of state \nHillary Clinton said.  After meeting Yemeni foreign minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi at the US State Department, Mrs \nClinton praised Yemen's actions to combat violent extremists in the Arabian Peninsula.  Yemen is emerging as a \ncentral focus in the fight against extremists and the US has stepped up both military and civilian aid to the country \nover the past year.  BOMB PLOTTER CONVICTED  A member of a home-grown terrorist group was found guilty of \ntaking part in a plot to set off truck bombs in front of Canada's main stock exchange and two government buildings.  \nShareef Abdelhaleem, 34, was a member of the so-called Toronto 18 plot to set off bombs outside the city's sock \nexchange, a building housing Canada's spy agency and a military base, to scare Canada into removing its troops \nfrom Afghanistan.  The plot mastermind, Jordanian-born Zakaria Amara, 24, was convicted earlier this week and \nsentenced to life in prison - Canada's first life sentence for a terrorism offence,  DRONE 'KILLS MILITANT'  A \nFilipino militant wanted by the US is believed to have been killed in an American drone strike close to the Afghan \nborder earlier this month, Pakistani intelligence officials said.  If confirmed, the death of Abdul Basit Usman on the \nborder of Pakistan's South and North Waziristan tribal regions would represent another success for the US covert \nmissile programme on targets in Pakistan.  There have been an unprecedented number of attacks this month \nfollowing a deadly December 30 militant attack on a CIA base in Afghanistan.  JAYCEE SUSPECT'S \u00a312m BAIL  A \nCalifornia judge has set bail at 20 million dollars (\u00a312.3m) for a woman accused of kidnapping and raping schoolgirl \nJaycee Dugard and holding her captive for 18 years.  El Dorado Superior Court judge Douglas Phimister said he \nconsidered Nancy Garrido to be a danger to the community and a flight risk.  Garrido denies kidnapping and sexual \nassaulting Jaycee in 1991. Her husband Phillip Garrido, who has also pleaded not guilty, had bail set at 30 million \ndollars (\u00a318.4m) in September.  CHAVEZ CABLE EDICT  Venezuela's state-run telecommunications agency has \ntold 24 local cable TV channels that they must carry mandatory government programming, including marathon \nspeeches by President Hugo Chavez.  Agency director Diosdado Cabello said the cable channels, including the \nanti-Chavez station Radio Caracas Television, which moved to cable in 2007 after the government refused to renew \nits broadcast licence, must air presidential addresses under new regulations.  Mr Cabello said the rules approved \nby the agency last month applied only to cable stations that produced content within Venezuela.  TOYOTA U.S. \nRECALL  Japanese car giant Toyota is recalling 2.3 million vehicles in the US to fix accelerator pedals that can \nbecome stuck - the latest in a string of quality problems that have bedevilled the firm.  The recall affects the 2005-\n2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry and the 2007-2010 Tundra, the 2010 Highlander, the 2008-2010 Sequoia, the \n2009-2010 RAV4, the 2009-2010 Corolla and the 2009-2010 Matrix.  The Avalon, Camry and Tundra models were \nalso included in the 4.2 million-vehicle recall Toyota launched late last year over concerns that the pedals could \nbecome lodged under floor mats, causing sudden acceleration - a problem blamed for several crashes.  CHER \nSELLS HAWAII HOME  Cher's home in Hawaii which overlooks the Pacific Ocean has been sold for 8.7 million \ndollars (\u00a35.3 million), a luxury property company said.  Concierge Auctions said the home, one of five Big Island \nresidences was bought at auction on Monday for a total of 19.4 million dollars (\u00a311.9 million) by a buyer from \nArizona.  The firm had estimated the singer and actress' Hualalai Resort property, which she designed, was worth \nbetween eight million dollars (\u00a34.9 million) and 12 million dollars (\u00a37.4 million).  AP\n\nPARIS: The capital is marking the 100th anniversary of guitarist Django Reinhardt s birthday with a number of \nconcerts and commemorative events.\n\nReinhardt, the founder of gypsy jazz, with its driving rhythms and nimble solos, grew up just outside Paris and lost \nthe use of two fingers in a fire.\n\n\n\nThe accident only drove the 18-year-old Reinhardt to come up with a unique style involving lightning-fast solos that \nstill baffle guitar teachers today.\n\nSeveral jazz clubs are putting on Django shows, and yesterday a square    just a few metres from where Reinhardt \ns family once parked their caravans   was named after him.\n\nCALIFORNIA: Opee the dog doesn t go for walkies, he prefers  ridies  on his owner s motocross bike.\n\nMike Schelin has trained the Australian shepherd, 8, to sit in front of him during dirt bike races   wearing a helmet \nand goggles. \n\n This dog has been over 150mph and absolutely loves it.

And, while we re on the \nsubject, who are those mysterious unnamed celebrities he supposedly dated while married? \n\nThis week the burning Tiger question has been: is he attending an exclusive clinic to cure himself of a sex \naddiction? You couldn t make this up. Sadly, for Tiger s wife and family, it doesn t look like anyone is. After keeping \na low profile for the past month Tiger was snapped by a National Enquirer photographer at the Pine Grove Centre in \nHattiesburg, Mississippi. The clinic describes itself as  one of the nation s most comprehensive treatment campuses \n.\n\nAs well as offering classes on eating and anxiety disorders, the centre offers a class called Gentle Path which deals \nwith  those suffering from sexual addiction, relationship addiction and sexual anorexia . It is this kind of class which \nwe assume Tiger is attending.\n\nOf course, Tiger hasn t said anything. After the car crash incident he said:  I have let my family down and I regret \nthose transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves. I \nam not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind \nclosed doors with my family. \n\nFrankly, it s hard not to see the whole sordid affair as gossip mag fodder. Although events of recent weeks have \nundoubtedly been incredibly important for Tiger and his family, the rest of the world has heard it all before. \n\nRemember Halle Berry s ex, Eric Benet, who was reportedly treated for sexual addition while the pair were \nmarried? Or what about Russell Brand, who admitted in his autobiography that he had issues with sex and ended \nup being treated for his carnal addictions in Keystone clinic, Philadelphia? \n\nEven family favourite actor David Duchovny, who played the leading role in The X Files series, announced he was \ngoing into a rehabilitation clinic to be treated for sex addiction in 2008. Michael Douglas was also branded a sex \naddict in 1990 when he was admitted to rehab, although the actor has always strongly denied that he suffered from \na sexual addiction.\n\nPerhaps the most telling thing about this list is that all the entries are male. Indeed, the very idea that a man who \nhas cheated on his partner several times must be suffering from an addiction reeks a little of sexism. Why can he \nnot just be weak-willed or, most shocking, just not a very nice person? \n\nInstead, we all see one photograph, at one clinic, and feel the need to glamorise a particularly unglamorous \nsituation: Tiger  obviously has a sex addiction, doesn t he? That s why the nice man who plays golf so well and \nmakes lots of money, must have done those awful things we ve all read about. Isn t it?\n\n\n\nBear this in mind: the investment bank Goldman Sachs was one of the biggest contributors to Barack Obama s \nelection campaign. Wall Street, because it likes to pick a winner, gave more collectively to the Democrats in 2008 \nthan to the Republican right. On Thursday, nevertheless, Goldmans announced that its bonus pool this year stands \nat $16.2bn. \n\nBear this in mind, too: good, bad or indifferent, an American President remains an American President. Incumbents \nare moulded to the office, not the other way around. At most, new Presidents offer a change in emphasis or style. \nThe job s imperatives, the perceived national interests and ideology of the United States, endure. \n\nThat s one reason why the messianic qualities bestowed on Obama were an absurd illusion  from the start. That s \nwhy every dream   peace, a decent health service, economic justice, environmental reform   has turned to  dust at \nhis touch. Guantanamo is still in business; Afghanistan goes on; and Americans are still losing their homes. \n\nWhen the President promises to cut the bankers down to size, therefore, the words matter as much as any deed. \nObama needs a win, or the appearance of a win, or the chance to prove to angry voters that he is being shackled \nby the malign forces of big business. But where the banks are concerned, neither his record, nor the nature of his \njob, nor ingrained American attitudes should persuade anyone to suspend disbelief just yet. \n\nFinally, remember that, despite all the incessant boasting to the contrary, America s democracy is a compromised, \nparalysed thing. On Thursday we were told   and the President himself seemed to acknowledge   that healthcare \nreform was dead simply because a single Senate seat, albeit totemic Massachusetts, had been lost. But how so? \n\nHealthcare reform is a Democrat dream. The President is a Democrat. His party controls the House of \nRepresentatives. Despite the loss of their  super-majority  thanks to Massachusetts, Democrats still retain 59 of the \nSenate s 100 seats. Yet on this issue, and on every other issue, the Republican minority has blocked the majority, \nand thus overturned the people s will, in the self-styled home of democracy. \n\nThere are numerous reasons, but chief among them has been the threat of the congressional  filibuster    easily \nnegotiated, in point of fact   and a guerrilla propaganda campaign led by the likes of  Murdoch s Fox News and the \nradio demagogue Rush Limbaugh. Obama s party has been duly terrified by the prospect of this year s mid-term \nelections. So what does a clever President do? \n\nWhat he does best: he campaigns; he circumvents the legislative process. Already Obama s willingness to pick a \nfight with the banks is being dismissed as  populist , as though that has suddenly become a political sin. In truth, \ncoming after the debacles of Copenhagen, healthcare and Massachusetts, it is an exquisitely timed stroke of \ngenius. It might even produce a result. \n\nThe decision to attempt to curb and reform the banks has two virtues. First, it is wildly popular around the globe. In \nBritain, the initial reaction to Obama s statement was simply to ask when   not if   our government would be \nfollowing suit. In an America that s as mad as hell, meanwhile, Republicans face a profound problem: how can they \nnow oppose this President? The healthcare controversy was intended to destroy him. Now, out of the blue, he \nclaims Franklin Roosevelt s legacy. \n\nCan the right even whisper a defence of the moneychangers in the present climate? Obama has sided with Main \nStreet (where the votes are) against Wall Street. Of the banks and the lobbyists, he has said:  If these folks want a \nfight, it s a fight I m ready to have.  In a similar circumstance, FDR acknowledged that all of Wall Street hated him.  \nHe added a single word:  good . There, suddenly, is the new  political battleground. \n\nReform s other virtue is simple: it is right. Despite 18 months of talk, the banks have endured no serious \nimpediments. They have neither changed their habits   weird derivatives are back in fashion   nor their attitudes. \nThey have returned to treating public companies as private cash dispensers while the rest of the world suffers the \nconsequences of their folly. \n\nThe new race for bonuses has depended entirely on taxpayer money, the state s implicit guarantees, and bond \nmarkets feasting on the government borrowing needed   the symmetry is awesome   to allow banks to survive. Yet \n\n\n\nstill bankers whine, and still they react to the idea of paying their dues, whether through mere restraint or higher \ntaxes, with a threat to flounce off to more congenial climes. But if Obama has his way, and if he puts the weight of \nAmerica s influence behind his reforms, hideaways may soon be hard to find.\n\nPleasingly, the markets know as much. Around the world on Thursday the indices fell, with bank shares notable \ncasualties, as the bourses took Obama seriously. They know that nothing he demanded is impossible, or even \nunreasonable. Thanks to historically low interest rates, they, too, have been gorging on cheap money and having a \nwhale of a time lately. But they can sense public sentiment and they know that for banks the game, the  binge of \nirresponsibility , may soon be up. \n\nThose in Britain who only half-understand the American system have been wondering whether Obama will be \nblocked by his Republican enemies. \n\nThey watched the healthcare row and saw only manufactured anger and Democrat timidity. They forget that the \nPresident cannot afford another such defeat. They forget that money bills   and any bill can become a money bill   \ncannot face filibusters. And somehow they forget the sheer weight of public demand for banking reform. \n\nIn Britain, a distrust of bankers derives mostly from a socialist tradition. In the US, the feeling is more widespread, \nmore deeply rooted, and born of repeated bitter experience down the generations. Everywhere, these days, the \nattitude is near-visceral. Unthinkable sums went from the public purse simply to ensure the survival of self-\nrewarding incompetents: why? The quaint theory of moral hazard has died, but capitalism s reputation is none too \nchirpy either. \n\nSo why should a high street bank keep a betting shop in, as it were, the back room? Why should the bank to which \nyou entrust your life be able to lay bets    proprietary trading , they call it   for its own enrichment? Why should any \nbank become  too big to fail ? Why shouldn t banks take their own advice and put enough by for that rainy day? \nWhy shouldn t they be forbidden the practices that led to the crisis? None of this is Marxism, more s the pity. \n\nIt is one of the reasons why Obama was elected, nevertheless. He inherited the crisis and promised to fix it. He has \nsince broken quite enough promises, and disillusioned quite enough people, for one year. Now he has a great, \neven historic, opportunity: he can do this. The world will follow, for once. And the glorious part of it all is that the \nbankers and their friends know it. So an onslaught is about to begin, with the usual falsehoods for its weapons. \n\nThe President says he is ready for the fight. I hope that this time he means it. A great many people are willing him \non. After all, they know that unless change is forced on banking, another crash is inevitable. And if he wins, Obama \ncan return that donation to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIt s a tall order for Obama to beat the banks. But he can\n\nPicking this fight is an exquisitely timed stroke  of genius\n\n Love lift us up where we belong,  where the eagle fl    sorry   caught me having a bit of a Top Gun moment there. \nYes, yes, I know   wrong film. The Joe Cocker classic is from An Officer And A Gentleman. \n\nMind you, the films are pretty much interchangeable. You anoraks out there, what are you like?\n\nThe song has been in my head  since reading about the USS Carl Vinson, the Nimitz-class aircraft  carrier providing \nrelief to Haiti. The  day before the earthquake struck, it had been heading south off the coast of Virginia, en route \nback to its homeport of San Diego. \n\nBut it was immediately re-routed  and was among the first ships to  arrive off the coast of the island, since when it \nhas acted as a floating airport and hospital.\n\nNaturally, the carrier has its own Wikipedia entry and website. There is nothing surprising about this. \n\n\n\nMost dust motes have their own website now and I caught a spider in our bathroom recently that was on Twitter. On \nthese pages you can read that it is named after a Congressman from Georgia and that it is the height of a  24-\nstorey building   and that Nimitz refers to Fleet Admiral Chester William Nimitz (1885-1966). See? Two can play at \nthe anorak game.\n\nBut the USS Carl Vinson is also  a thoroughly modern vessel, so it has  its own Facebook page and a  Twitter \naccount. \n\nIts Facebook page is worth a look. There are photos of water being unloaded, people being treated on board, aerial \nshots of the devastation from the helicopter doorways. \n\nIt is powerful, inspiring stuff,  despite comments of the  You guys  are the best  and  God bless America  type. \n\nThese men and women had been  due short leave shortly. They are  now helping save lives.  God speed  seems \nappropriate.\n\nbasketball\n\nSteve Parillon, Glasgow Rocks  sixth man, has insisted the team s bench must prove their worth in this weekend s \ngruelling double-header to keep the Kelvin Hall outfit on the heels on the British Basketball League leaders, writes \nMark Woods.\n\nSterling Davis  men visit Leicester Riders tonight before travelling onward to face Plymouth Raiders tomorrow and \nParillon, who has an average of 7 points and 5 rebounds, acknowledges that his transition from starter to reserve \nremains an awkward switch. Despite fears that the combustible Caribbean would become disenchanted away from \nthe limelight, though, he is increasingly finding ways to make an impact.\n\n It s the first time I ve not started in my career and there are times when I m still trying to find my role,  he said.  It s \nbeen a tough adjustment because I am a player who gets a lot from my own aggressiveness. I found that when I \nwas coming in, maybe midway through the first quarter, I wasn t getting that aggressive play going so quickly. I ve \nrealised I need to do that as soon as I get on the floor. I m looking for my shots now which I wasn t doing before. \nAnd that s helped me and the team. \n\nGlasgow, defending a four-game winning streak, will give a debut to the Great Britain centre Randall Hanke in \nLeicester.\n\n* Great Britain s point guard Flinder Boyd has joined Newcastle for the rest of the season but is not fit enough for \ntomorrow s tie against London.\n\nScots win 5-2  then lose 5-2\n\nScotland s senior women opened their European Indoor Nations A Division campaign in Duisburg, Germany, with \nan emphatic 5-2 win over Lithuania  but later lost by the same margin to  the hosts, writes Craig Madden.\n\nGoals by Vikki Bunce (2), Amy Rowan, Linsey Glass and Julie Bryce ensured that Gordon Shepherd s team \nachieved their initial target of victory over the Lithuanians. Bunce, of Dundee Wanderers, scoring her goals from \npenalty corners in the first 10 minutes and, after Doviel Jakaite replied, also from a penalty corner, Rowan, another \nDundee Wanderers player, made it 3-1 from another corner routine, the ball being deflected in via a defender s \nstick.\n\nGrove s Glass scored the fourth in the second half, slotting a lovely shot into the corner of the goal from a pass by \nBunce. Lithuania again reduced the deficit before yet another Dundee Wanderers player, Bryce, finished off their \nchallenge when she drove the ball in from the right five minutes from time after a neat interchange with Bunce.\n\n\n\nThe clash with Germany, who earlier beat Ukraine 8-7, was always going to be a major test for a relatively \ninexperienced squad. The Scotland goalkeeper Carmin Dow, yet another Dundee Wanderers player, made vital \nsaves but, playing a half-court system, the Scots also caused problems for the holders and reigning champions.\n\nGermany went ahead in 18 minutes from a penalty corner and soon added a second with a backhand flick from the \nleft. Scotland hit back when Bunce won the ball on the halfway line and drove at the German defence before lifting \nthe ball over the goalkeeper but, from the restart, a long pass into the D was directed into the net 15 seconds from \nhalf-time. \n\nElspeth Cockburn, the Milne Craig Western striker, led a quick counter attack before slotting past the keeper for a \nfine individual goal to make it 3-2 but, as in the first half, the Germans responded immediately with a goal from open \nplay. They later netted again following a penalty corner.\n\nsubway national indoor league\n\n* Menzieshill s six-year monopoly  of the men s Subway National Indoor League may be under serious threat this \nseason if upstarts Western Wildcats and Inverleith continue to fulfil their potential.\n\nWildcats lead by two points after the first round of matches and take on Menzieshill and Dundee Wanderers  in this \nweekend s fixtures.\n\nWildcats  Harry Dunlop said:  The squad are very much up for the second half of the season; there is a positive \nmood around indoor this year across the team and the club in general.  Inverleith are only two points adrift of \nWildcats and are also in confident mood as they face the same two sides.  We re looking to win both games as we \nmount our challenge for the league,  said coach Stuart Neave.\n\nSo where does Billy McPherson, Menzieshill s coach, go from here?  We haven t beaten Western or Inverleith so \nfar this season, but we had chances to win both games. We have to get two results this weekend as the league is \nmuch more competitive now. \n\nAnderson blasts into semi-finals\n\nStewart Anderson, the 24-year-old from Auchinleck, is Scotland s sole standard bearer in today s semi-finals of the \nsingles championship and  within touching distance of becoming the first qualifier to take the title,  writes Anne \nDunwoodie.\n\nPaul Foster and David Gourlay,  both former champions and leading seeds, were surprise losers in yesterday s \nquarter-finals.\n\nAnderson, who booked his tilt at the title way back at the World Bowls Tour s Scottish qualifiers in Perth in \nSeptember, left the 1990 champion John Price from Port Talbot reeling as he romped to a 13-0 first-set win in just 6 \nof the allotted 9-end set.\n\nHe took singles from the opening two ends of the second set before 49-year-old Price surged back to take a 6-2 \nlead. Both players produced some telling shots after that but Anderson picked up the counts to win it 8-6.\n\n My performance at Perth [he beat David Gourlay and reigning world singles champion Billy Jackson in the Scottish \nInternational Open], told me that I can play against be best and give them a run for their money,  said Anderson.  \nBeating Alex Marshall to get a place in the quarter-finals [at Potters] is up there with my best performances. I knew \nJohn would come back at me in the second set, but I just tried to stay focused. I got a bit worried when he picked up \nsix shots mid-set and but I knew I just had to continue to play the way I know I can. \n\nAnderson will meet City of Ely s Nick Brett in today s semi-final after the 35 year old from Peterborough ended \nhopes of an all-Scottish clash between Anderson and No.6 seed Gourlay who took the match to a tie break before \nlosing 12-6, 5-6, 2-0.\n\n\n\nFoster, the provisional world No.1, lost 1 \u00bd-\u00bd on sets to another City of Ely player, the No.5 seed Greg Harlow. The \nturning point came in the second set when Foster, holding a single to go 4-3 ahead,  gave the shot away and failed \nto score again. Harlow took the count over the remaining four ends to win 8-3.\n\nNATIONAL TRIPLES PLAYDOWNS\n\nMEN.

Both players produced some telling shots after that but Anderson picked up the counts to win 8-6.\n\n My performance at Perth [he beat David Gourlay and reigning world singles champion Billy Jackson in the Scottish \nInternational Open], told me that I can play against the best and give them a run for their money,  said Anderson.  \nBeating Alex Marshall to get a place in the quarter-finals [at Potters] is up there with my best performances. \n\n I knew John would come back at me in the second set, but I just tried to stay focused. I got a bit worried when he \npicked up six shots mid-set, but I knew I just had to continue to play the way I know I can. \n\nAnderson will meet City of Ely s Nick Brett in today s semi-final after the 35-year-old ended hopes of an all-Scottish \nclash between Anderson and No.6 seed Gourlay, who took the match to a tie-break before losing 12-6, 5-6, 2-0. \n\nFoster, the provisional world No.1, lost 1 \u00bd-\u00bd on sets to the No.5 seed, Greg Harlow. The turning point came in the \nsecond set, when Foster, holding a single to go 4-3 ahead,  gave the shot away and failed to score again. Harlow \ntook the count over the remaining four ends to win 8-3.\n\nThe inquiry into the Iraq  war chaired by Sir John  Chilcot has laboured since  it was first announced  under the \ncharge that it will be a  whitewash. Perhaps stung by that,  Sir John, a former civil servant,  whose retirement has \nbeen spent as  a board member or chair of a long  list of public bodies, gave notice of  the seriousness with which \nhe took  his latest appointment by insisting  that evidence should be heard in  public, with an exception for  secret \nintelligence.\n\n\n\nThat was an important first step towards public accountability.  Nevertheless, there is wide currency for the cynical \nview that this inquiry will not add significantly to what we already know from the Hutton inquiry into the issues \nsurrounding the death of Dr David Kelly and the Butler inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the war. \n\nThat is why it is essential that the members of the inner circle which made the decision to go to war in  2003, \nespecially Tony Blair and  Gordon Brown, are subjected to  forensic and public questioning  while the accounts of \nothers involved, such as senior civil servants and members of the cabinet, are fresh in the memory. \n\nMr Brown s offer to appear before the inquiry in advance of the  General Election is welcome, even if it has been \nprompted by a calculation that it will be in his political interests to do so. The claims by Geoff Hoon, Defence \nSecretary at the time, that the  Treasury under Mr Brown failed to fund the forces properly in the  years before the \nconflict and then slashed their budget following the  invasion, leaves the Prime Minister as the chief target for public \nfury over the failure fully to equip troops on the ground and provide sufficient helicopter back-up. \n\nThe contradictory evidence from Sir Nicholas Macpherson, who was permanent secretary at the Treasury, that no \nrequest for essential military equipment for the 2003 invasion was turned down and that there had been an increase \nin MoD spending in 2002, adds confusion rather than clarity and adds impetus to the need to hear Mr Brown s \naccount. \n\nWith Tony Blair s hotly anticipated appearance next week likely to be  the most damaging for Labour s  electoral \nprospects, Mr Brown  may well have calculated that he  has more to lose than to gain by  giving his own version in \nadvance of the election.\n\nIt was Sir John Chilcot s justifiable concern that party politics would obfuscate the real issues that prompted the \noriginal decision to delay calling current cabinet members in key roles until after the election. Care must be taken by \nall concerned to avoid that, but we have a right to know how the crucial decisions were made and on exactly what \nbasis we invaded Iraq. \n\nIf, as he claims, Gordon Brown  has nothing to hide, he must be prepared to give a detailed account of  the part he \nplayed, not only as  Chancellor but as a member of that inner circle, and face the country on that basis.\n\nYour article  Youth unemployment  up by one-third in single year  (January 21) gives the impression that the \nposition in Scotland is worse than in the rest of the UK. \n\nWhile claimant count rates for this cohort are rising, Scotland continues to have the lowest youth unemployment \nrate in the UK. The most recent quarterly figures (ONS Labour Force Survey), show the unemployment rate for 16-\n24-year-olds (July-September 2009) was 17.9% for Scotland. This is lower than the other UK countries, with \nEngland at 21.3%, Wales at 22.7% and Northern Ireland at 20.7%. The UK rate overall is 21.1%. \n\nScotland also has the highest  employment rate in the UK for the  16-24 age group, at 57.8%. This rate is higher \nthan the other UK countries, with England at 53.3%, Wales at 51.3% and Northern Ireland at 42.7%. The UK rate \noverall is 53.2%. \n\nThese figures, based on the International Labour Organisation s (ILO) definitions, are from the Labour Force Survey \nand present a full picture of youth employment across Scotland and the UK. In addition to claimant count, this data \ncaptures information about young people who may be ineligible for Jobseekers  Allowance, but who are actively \nseeking a job and are available to start work. When you consider this data, Scotland is performing better both than \nthe UK as a whole, and each of its other countries. \n\nJim Mather,\n\nMinister for Enterprise, Energy  and Tourism,  The Scottish Parliament, Edinburgh.\n\nEditor s note: The Herald traditionally uses claimant count figures rather than International Labour Organisation s, \nwhich includes those who are not eligible for benefits. Claimant count figures, or a tally of those receiving \n\n\n\nJobseekers  Allowance, are issued monthly, whereas ILO figures are issued quarterly. The latest claimant count \nfigures are for December and the ILO figures are for September to November.\n\nI have very serious concerns about the conclusions drawn by the Nuffield Trust regarding healthcare in Scotland ( \nScots health  is worst value in the UK   , The Herald, January 20). To say our nurses are not value for money as \nthey only look after half of the patients compared to the workload of English nurses is to draw the wrong conclusion.\n\nI would strongly argue that the quality, quantity and intensity of care provided by district nurses in Scotland is of a \nvery high standard. This also ensures that we have fewer admissions to hospitals in Scotland compared with \nEngland, as patients at home are looked after by nurses, general practitioners and associated health professionals. \nThis is an indicator of good healthcare, not, as the report concludes, poorer healthcare.\n\nAs a GP working in Fort William, I regularly encounter patients who have moved into the Highlands from England, \nwho wish to experience our quality of life. Many are elderly or bring with them elderly relatives. A significant number \nof these patients express serious gratitude and, at times, awe at the quality of healthcare which they have received \ncompared with what they would have received in England.\n\nI have never had a patient tell me that they or their relatives would have experienced better healthcare had they \nremained in England. \n\nMrs Thatcher and the Tory party did damage to the NHS in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. The damage was worse \nin England, fortunately, than in Scotland.\n\nWe can and must continue to improve our health service in Scotland but it is a National Health Service that we \nshould be really proud of.\n\nDr Michael Foxley, \n\nLiberal Democrat, Leader of the council administration, Highland Council, \n\nGlenurquhart Road, Inverness.\n\nHealth is not the only malaise at the heart of Barack Obama s US ( Health remains the malaise at the heart of \nObama s US , Anne Johnstone, January 21). \n\nAt the next election, 435 House of Representatives and one-third of the 100-member Senate seats will be available, \nalong with 37 state governorships. In the economic depths the US finds itself, its electorate is forgetting that the \nBush government was responsible for the unbridled greed and the illegal Iraq war at its core. Despite Mr Obama s \nefforts, unemployment is rising, house prices are falling and wars are increasingly worrying.\n\nHowever, the main reasons for his unpopularity are raised taxes affecting the rich, increased public spending, his \npledge to withdraw troops from Iraq and an attempt to introduce universal healthcare. \n\nWith the election of Republican Scott Brown to Senator Ted Kennedy s seat, it is now almost certain the \nRepublicans will be able to prevent the healthcare Bill from coming to a vote in the Senate, despite the blended Bills \nbeing already approved by the House of Representatives. Allied to these causes, a degree of racism now \nundoubtedly lies behind much of the opposition to his presidency, especially in the southern states; to highlight this, \nit is doubted if he is even an American citizen and a Christian.\n\nIan F M Saint-Yves,\n\nDunvegan, School Brae, Whiting Bay, Arran.\n\nthe percentage by which UK car production fell in 2009.

As in almost all such cases, however, their background reveals the brothers themselves to have been \nvictims of abuse and neglect. \n\nIn this case, other people were aware of their foul home life. People who knew the family told police they regularly \nwatched horror films that adults would have to turn away from. Their mother suffered domestic violence from their \nfather, and the older boy drank cider and smoked cannabis from the age of nine. In short, they were almost \ncertainly doomed to a life of violence and crime unless they could be sprung from this cycle of depravity in time.  \n\nWhy did that not happen? One  factor was that although they had come to the attention of the  authorities, they had \nthe additional misfortune of living in the Doncaster area, where social services are in  disarray with seven children \nknown to the department having died since 2004. In this case, the boys were removed from the family home and \nplaced with foster parents, who although experienced were also elderly. \n\nThe admission by the council that children s care services did not act in accordance with legal requirements is \nanother example of a care system under so much pressure that it cannot function in the way intended. That is not \nconfined to Doncaster. Its admission that this horrific incident was preventable should act as a warning to \nauthorities across the UK that guidance and legislation are useless unless backed by front-line resources. \n\nIn specifically absolving the victims  parents from failing to protect their sons, the judge makes an important stand \nfor children to be allowed freedom. Parents will have the confidence to follow his lead if all adults accept a shared \nresponsibility to pursue the authorities relentlessly when we come across children who are neglected or abused.\n\n\n\nThe attempt by Margo MacDonald, MSP, to resurrect legalisation of euthanasia through her End of Life Assistance \nBill will, no doubt, bring out the usual plethora of complaints that the  religious right  is imposing its views on society \n( Suicide Bill launched , The Herald, January 22).\n\nThose who know me would probably class me as being of that ilk, and they would not be too far off the mark. \nHowever, let s forget any religious/moral objection to this proposed legislation. We must still recognise that its \nimplementation would involve serious risks to public safety. \n\nA law that may be acceptable for a minority of determined, and self-reliant, people   such as Ms MacDonald, for \nwhom I do have the highest regard   could result in many others who are depressed or suffering from feelings of \nguilt at the  burden  they are imposing on their families following the same course of action. In addition, the \npossibility of pressure from more unscrupulous family members could not, sadly, be discounted.\n\nIt may, of course, be argued that the law would ensure this did not happen. However, it is my understanding of the \nproposals that there are few safeguards. Even if more were to be added, we would have already set out on a very \nslippery slope. Baroness Warnock, a major proponent of assisted suicide, has already suggested, publicly, that \npeople with dementia are wasting the lives of others, and resources of the NHS, and should consider whether or not \nthey ought to remove themselves .\n\nAs I pointed out when this issue was last raised by Ms MacDonald, there are many things in life, the results of which \ncan be reversed. Unfortunately, euthanasia is not one of them.\n\nRev C Brian Ross,\n\n253 Shields Road, Motherwell.\n\nI congratulate Margo MacDonald on her principled stance in trying to introduce legislation to decriminalise assisted \nsuicide. While fully supporting her endeavours, I would take an even firmer position in asserting that strangers have \nno place in voicing an opinion or attempting to influence what is the ultimate expression of an individual s freedom \nof choice. \n\nFor the same reason, I see no justification for according more weight to the opinion of the medical profession simply \nbecause, as Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the BMA in Scotland rightly states (Letters, January 22) their role is  \none of care giver and healer .\n\nWhile being aware of the potential dangers of enforced euthanasia, I hope MSPs will have the courage to support \nthis Bill. Anyone who has witnessed the unnecessary prolongation of life against the choice of the sufferer, knows is \na kindness. \n\nDavid J Crawford,\n\nFlat 3/3 131 Shuna Street, Ruchill, Glasgow.\n\nYou are selfish. Really selfish. But don t take it personally, because I m selfish, too. We all are. The Queen is \nselfish. The poorest person in the land is selfish. Ordinary people. Celebrities. All selfish.\n\nOf course, we do things that make us look like we re not selfish, that we re actually selfless, but even then, buried \nso deep you sometimes can t see it or admit it, is the real motive: the selfish motive. When you give presents, when \nyou give a friend support, when you give to charity, you re doing it because you expect something back, or because \nyou want to preserve a relationship you like, or because you want to feel good. It s all about you.\n\nWhich goes some way to explain why I m troubled by Bono s latest benevolent act. The singer, with his band U2, \nJay-Z and someone called Swizz Beatz have recorded a song to raise money for victims of the Haiti earthquake. \nAnd they re not the only ones. This week I ve been emailed by press officers about many other musicians who are \ndoing their bit for Haiti: Damon Albarn, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, and on and on. It s interesting as well to look at \nthe long list of singles released to raise money for Hurricane Katrina: there are dozens and dozens of them.\n\n\n\nThese singles have raised a lot of money   and no doubt the new ones for Haiti will as well   but you don t have to \nbe a cynic to wonder if self-promotion isn t part of it too. Bands that we ve never heard of can become famous, \nbands that we have heard of can improve their image and bands that are struggling can improve their sales.\n\nThere s another problem with Bono s single, too: it may encourage those who buy it to believe that they, and Bono \nand other celebrities, are doing enough for Haiti. It may encourage, in other words, what has been called political \nquietism and deflect attention away from the causes of poverty in Haiti and elsewhere.\n\nIn his new book, The Life You Can Save, philosopher Peter Singer praises those celebrities who, despite their \nlifestyles, have done much on poverty. He singles out, quite rightly, Bill Gates. But he says they have to go further \nand should give at least 5% of their income to good causes. \n\nWe all should. Composing, or buying, a charity single just isn t good enough.\n\nASTITCH in time saves ninepence. That was the cheery thought as I set about the apparently simple task of \nmending a cardigan. I would be like Snow White, with a halo of tweeting bluebirds, but without a posse of short men \nin tow. One hour later, the thread that was meant to save money turned out to be the one that broke the camel s \nback. Forgive the mixed maxims; blood loss will do that to a victim of austerity Britain. \n\nWas it really only a year ago that everyone adopted a Churchillian attitude in the face of recession? Weren t we  \ngoing to fight consumer temptation on  the beaches? And hasn t every second  of this economy drive been hell on \nwheels? Suddenly, making do just won t do any more.\n\nAt a time when the political parties are getting ready to fight an election on who will cut spending most, the mood \nout there is changing from unalloyed pessimism to vigilant optimism. If we will this recovery, goes the thinking, it will \ncome. \n\nPerhaps you ve noticed a tendency in yourself to seize on the smallest bit of economic good news as evidence that  \nthe worst is over. Unemployment is  down. House sales are up. Even though every positive has a negative flipside   \nthe jobless total has risen in Scotland,  house sales are only up because there was a rush to get in before the \nstamp duty holiday ended   the optimist will grab at any green shoot. \n\nHow naive, I know. Yet if there s one thing this recession has taught us, it s  that anyone can be an economist. We \namateurs could hardly do a worse job than the so-called pros. \n\nAs far as mending clothes goes, I m done. Hanging up my hair shirt. It wasn t just the half-hour of life wasted trying \nto thread the needle. Or the sheer tedium of the task itself. But stabbing my thumb with the needle? Too much. \nMight as well go back to medieval days and start baking my own bread. \n\nJust as a hard rain has fallen, a frivolous purchase is going to come. It might be something as small as a fancy \ncoffee, or as large as a new cardigan   steady, steady   but needs, and the soul, must. \n\nAH, the fickle ways of fame.  Sometimes true celebrity means being known by just one name. Madonna. Cher. \nSubo. The alternative is to have your very own adjective. Just as Amy Winehouse never goes anywhere without a \nfag and the word  troubled  in front of her name, so Jennifer Aniston is forever being billed in the media as  poor \nJennifer Aniston .\n\nYes, in case you didn t know it, Jen is a tragic figure. Sure she s made the move from sitcom popsy to movie star to \nproducer. So what if she has more houses than the British royal family, looks fabulous and has enough millions to \nnever work again? Set all that beside losing Brad Pitt and what do we have: poor Jennifer Aniston, or PJA for short. \n\nPJA was courting the sympathy vote again this week. There she was at the Golden Globes, Scotland s Gerard  \nButler on her arm, looking every inch Calamity Jen. That wasn t a huge grin on her face: it was a grimace. That little \nblack dress split to the thigh? A cry for help if ever I saw one.\n\nHow PJA must end every day shedding tears   of laughter. \n\n\n\nIN Leicester, having turned what should have been a four-hour drive into an eight-hour odyssey due to getting lost \nthree times.

Road access to the airport is set to become ever less attractive through worsening \ncongestion by 2015, whereas the green electric rail option will here (as in most other European cities) prove an \nindispensable facility. Mr McGeoch is looking down only at his narrow short-term circumstances instead of at the \nimperative of freeing up Greater Glasgow to remain Scotland s powerhouse. \n\nIn any case, although Garl will improve the local network, it is a national priority for its quick efficiency. The pilot line \nfrom airport to Central Station is but the initial service, hugely worth it for business and tourist use alone, plus \nconnections to Edinburgh, Newcastle and Manchester; with upgraded Crossrail interconnectivity, all Scotland \nimmediately has trouble-free direct access. Crossrail will have particular regenerative effects within some of Greater \nGlasgow s most challenged districts, so employment will be, indeed, be affected positively.\n\nJim Murphy, Secretary of State for Scotland, was right to point out Greater Manchester s wisdom in promoting its \nairport and rail connections; until now, Greater Glasgow has been denied the chance to do likewise; ironically, since \nthe benefits to be gained here would extend Scotland-wide.\n\nWith all respect to the First Minister, the funds for Garl completion (\u00a3120m only) are still available   he has only to \nask. This is well within current budget parameters, and his proposed spending programme for the next few years. \nGarl remains priority infrastructure investment in Scotland s future. \n\nAndrew W Heatlie,\n\n109 Hyndland Road, Glasgow.\n\nI find it staggering that Labour s finance spokesman, Andy Kerr, is still on about the Glasgow Airport Rail Link ( \nLabour anger at scrapping of Garl , The Herald, January 21).\n\nDoes Mr Kerr not appreciate that local authorities throughout Scotland are struggling to come to terms with the \nimmense damage caused to roads and footpaths by the recent spell of severe weather? I would have thought that, \nfor the Scottish Government to agree to fund Garl, would be political suicide.\n\nI wonder how many Labour supporters outside Glasgow would back the funding of Garl instead of allocating \nadditional support to local authorities for road repairs. Governments are elected to decide on priorities and, \nthankfully for Scotland, Garl is not one of the priorities.\n\nThomas L Inglis,\n\n7 Menzies Avenue, Fintry.\n\nIt was disappointing, but perhaps inevitable, that Andy Kerr, Labour s finance spokesman, made little headway for \nreinstatement of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link during reading of the Budget Bill. Demands for party political loyalty \nin the lead-up to the Budget have regrettably paralysed the reasoned debate that should have taken place on the \nkey transport issues. But the intervening two weeks of further detailed discussion fortunately still allow a breathing \nspace to evaluate more adequately positive ways forward of maintaining a commitment to an airport rail link.\n\nContinuing support for Garl is a confirmation of belief that this project constitutes a legitimate and coherent \ncomponent of a modern, integrated and sustainable alternative to car use. This view is throughout Glasgow and \nStrathclyde, the business community and people across the party divide. \n\n\n\nThe main charge against Finance Secretary John Swinney is his abrupt cancellation of Garl just two weeks after his \nTransport Minister, Stewart Stevenson, confirmed (September 1, 2009) that delivery of this link was  on track and \non budget  for delivery for 2013, honouring their 2014 Commonwealth Games pledge.\n\nAn independent engineering estimate has already suggested a significantly reduced construction cost of \u00a3120m \n(nearly 30% less) than Transport Scotland s \u00a3175m and could, if verified by an  expression of interest  from any \ncontracting firm, be the basis of fresh negotiations within the detailed Budget. \n\nGarl is already now half under way as part of an integrated investment with Network Rail s related investment in the \nPaisley line upgrading, with extra tracks, including those at Central Station. Network Rail has the power to nudge \nthe Scottish Government into applying for funding assistance available under Regulatory Asset Base provisions. It \noffers a satisfactory way of overcoming Mr Swinney s claimed capital funding difficulties.\n\nThe next fortnight of detailed Budget negotiations still allows a vital window of opportunity for dialogue or a rail link \nsummit engaging all the relevant stakeholders and interested parties to put the rail link case in the more specific, \ndetailed and reasoned way which now demands to be given a fair hearing.\n\nSurely that would be preferable to slamming the door on a key rail link, specifically authorised and intended by its \n2007 Act of Parliament.\n\nK A Sutherland, \n\n12A Dirleton Gate,  Bearsden, Glasgow.\n\nStephen McGeoch makes the same mistake as most of the other anti-Garl gang when he says he wouldn t catch a \ntrain to Glasgow Airport. \n\nThe pattern of current access to the airport is well established with the bad habits of those who already use the \ngateway ingrained to the detriment of other travellers on the M8. Garl is not about now   it is about the future and \nhow we cope with an expansion of the airport if, of course, you regard it as important that the city has good national \nand international transport links. \n\nGlasgow Airport shows a progressive growth over time and I would suggest BAA would not be planning a \u00a3100m \nexpansion if it did not believe there was a prospect of a return. Part of that expansion is geared towards handling \nthe new super-jumbo aircraft which will disgorge thousands of travellers on to the M8. \n\nFlying is here to stay. BAA predicts that by 2012, the airport will generate more than 11 million road traffic \nmovements. That s in excess of 30,000 each day in real money, and buses alone cannot cope.\n\nThat is why the cancellation of Garl delivers an extra blow to Glasgow Airport as it was to be part of a new public \ntransport interchange serving all public transport. That plan is being redrawn as, no doubt, are the BAA plans for \nhow the airport is accessed. With the demise of Garl, the airport operator now has a compelling case for creating a \nnew access on to the M8 so  Mr McGeoch and all the others who would never use Garl can reach the traffic jam at \nHillington faster.\n\nWilliam Forbes,\n\n23 Greenlees Park, Cambuslang, Glasgow.\n\nIt is an undisputed fact that the proposed Glasgow Airport Rail Link would run between Glasgow Airport and \nGlasgow Central, calling at Paisley Gilmour Street. How can that be described by Labour s finance spokesman \nAndy Kerr as  a project for the whole of Scotland ?\n\nUnder the Garl plan, trains from the airport would terminate at Central. Passengers would have to transfer with \nluggage to Glasgow Queen Street for services to Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Inverness. In the case of \nInverness, a further change would sometimes be required at Perth.\n\n\n\nHow can this be said to benefit the whole of Scotland when most people will prefer a direct car journey from the \nairport to avoid not only having to change trains, but stations in most cases? \n\nHowever, if the Saltmarket Crossrail connection were added to the plan and trains ran direct from the airport to \nother principal Scottish cities, then this would amply justify Mr Kerr s description. Without that key extra link, there is \nlittle point in wasting money duplicating what the airport bus service already does perfectly well.\n\nDave Stewart,\n\n129 Novar Drive, Glasgow.\n\nWEAN *. child\n\nThis week s word is one many people associate with Glasgow. Glasgow authors have used it to great effect, as in \nthis quotation from John and Willy Maley s From The Calton To Catalonia (1990):  Picture it. The Calton. Fair \nFortnight. 1937. Full of Eastern promise. Wimmen windae hingin. Weans greetin for pokey hats [ice-cream cones]. \nGrown men, well intae their hungry thirties, slouchin at coarners, skint as a bairn s knees.  \n\nHowever, wean   a running together of wee and ane   first appears in the dictionaries with Leadhills-born poet Allan \nRamsay s The Gentle Shepherd (1725):  Troth, my Niece is a right dainty we an.  There is an Aberdeenshire \nquotation in Helenore (1768) by Alexander Ross:  The dentyest wean bony Jane fuish (fetched) hame . \n\nWeans also appear in Burns, Scott, Hogg and Stevenson. Weans may mean offspring generally, but Anna Blair in \nThe Rowan on the Ridge (1980) places weanhood between infancy and adolescence:  A wean and a baby whose \nnames he had not caught, and the dour halflin  Bryce, who had looked him up and down and seemed as if he might \nhave checked his teeth or hooves before taking him on to labour.  \n\nEven adults can be called weanly. P H Waddell s 1871 version of Psalm 119 gives  Fu  clear comes a blink o  yer \nwords, makin wyss the weanliest chiel  and, in figurative usage, we imagine the flying leather described in James \nDenniston s The Battle of Craignilder (1832):  But sword or axe gied weanly whacks Compared wi  Geordy s flail, \nman . \n\nScots Word of the Week is written by Chris Robinson of Scottish Language Dictionaries, 25 Buccleuch Place, \nEdinburgh EH8 9LN (0131) 650 4149; www.scotsdictionaries.org.uk.\n\n THEY say that elephants never forget. Although strangely you rarely see them working as waiters. The same could \nbe said about football fans (the bit about remembering stuff, not the waiting). In our everyday lives we constantly \noverlook trivial things like paying bills on time, setting the Sky Plus, or putting our trousers on before we leave the \nhouse. But come Saturday we develop the sort of memory capacity to rival Rain Man after  a good night s sleep. \n\nSome of the recollections are positive. There are those supporters who cannot remember their own children s \nnames but who can recall the most unremarkable of football matches in the greatest of detail.  Remember that great \nday in 1984 when we came from behind to win 2-1 at Arbroath on a Tuesday night? The wind blew over the corner \nflag at one point and the pie stall ran out of Bovril. And we stopped for a fish supper on the way home, a wee place \noutside of Dundee . . . \n\nSome of the memories are not as pleasant. Hell hath no fury like a football fan scorned. When you re playing for our \nclub we ll love you to the point of a restraining order. But leave us for another club and we ll never let you forget it. \nWe don t do break-ups well. \n\nAnyone daring to move from one club to another can expect the equivalent of having his clothes dumped on the \nfront lawn and his name bad-mouthed all over town and scrawled with felt-tip pen on all the local bus shelters. And \nnot nice words either. \n\nJimmy Calderwood and Carlos Tevez shouldn t leave the house without extra thick ear muffs and a cast-iron \nconstitution this week. Calderwood returns to Aberdeen today for the first time since leaving Pittodrie at the end of \n\nhttp://www.scotsdictionaries.org.uk/\n\n\nlast season. Never mind that it was him who was dumped rather than the other way around. And forget all that stuff \nabout European qualification and top-six finishes. All some fans will remember are those cup exits to diddy teams \nand the fact that he was, apparently,  a Rangers man . In America they call it a Bronx cheer. Over here we call it \ngetting absolute pelters, involving the sort of language usually reserved for BBC memos about Ronnie Corbett. \n\nCalderwood s welcome will be nothing like the noise which will greet Tevez when he returns to Old Trafford on \nWednesday. There will be jumbo jets taking off from Manchester Airport that will register fewer decibels than the \nabuse that will pour out of the stands   and possibly the home dug-out, too. \n\nTevez was seen as the unfortunate victim of circumstances last season, willing to kiss the United badge with his \nsharp pointy teeth for years to come, only for mean old Fergie to not give him the contract he felt he merited. A \nmove across the city, though, and his two goals and subsequent celebrations against United last week mean all that \nis out the window.\n\nForgot all those happy memories the Argentine gave United fans last season. On Wednesday night he will become \nthe most unpopular man at Old Trafford since Jose Mourinho practised his 100m sprint down the touchline in his \nPorto days. \n\nTevez broke the No.1 rule when it comes to a parting of the ways. If you must leave, never ever go to the club s \nbiggest rivals. Alan Smith made the same mistake when he signed for United. A teary, badge-kissing farewell \nappearance had many Leeds United fans wishing him well after the club were relegated in 2004. Just not for THEM. \nSmith daren t show his face in Yorkshire ever again. \n\nAnother golden rule is to never openly hanker for a move. Ian Ferguson should be revered forever as the man who \nhad them dancing in the streets of Mirren after bringing the Scottish Cup back to Paisley for the first time in 28 \nyears. Instead, he made the mistake of suggesting that he might not have been averse to joining boyhood heroes \nRangers. It did not go down well at Love Street. Ferguson returned many years later in a Dunfermline shirt and was \njeered by many, but not all, in the home end and ended up being sent off. It got the biggest cheer of the afternoon.\n\nThere are a few who return to a hero s reception. They are the ones who traditionally leave a small club for a much \nlarger one, bringing in a sizeable transfer fee in the process and muttering tearfully about how  Albion Rovers made \nme the player I am today . \n\nThey are the few who escape  the abuse and the brickbats.  The rest are not so lucky. Still, it beats the third \nalternative. Could there be anything worst than being ignored entirely by the people who never forget? \n\nTevez broke the No.1 rule when it comes to a parting of the ways   if you must leave, never ever go to the club s \nbiggest rivals\n\n YOU find the Tenner Bet in contrite form this week. Having had my knuckles rapped by the combined might of the \nsports editor, a disgruntled reader and a 10-year-old child for an incorrigible and licentious comment in last week s \noffering, my heavy mood was not lightened by the discovery that the bet ruined by the inclement weather had \nreturned a 2/1 winner.\n\nSuddenly, the bookies   extreme generosity  in paying out on a non-runner was rendered nothing more than a \nPyrrhic victory. The Tenner Bet likes to think it doesn t do hard luck stories, but by God, it does. I love a good \ncaterwaul about monies owed, perceived or otherwise, and chances are I ll still be wittering on about it come \nseason s end when I m trying to talk my way out of a deficit.\n\nAll told, I m about as popular as Alan Wiley at a Bolton Wanderers fans  night out. Mrs Tenner Bet is giving me the \nsilent treatment, wee Fiver is so bored with my patter that he keeps falling asleep and even Dunky from next door is \nblanking me, although that might be something to do with all the wailing and gnashing of teeth about last week s \nbeaten docket.\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of being in everyone s bad books is that you get plenty of time to yourself. That doesn t mean, \nhowever, that I have been spending my time in solitude wisely. No, if it s incisive betting advice you want, best look \nelsewhere. All you re getting from me this week is a patchy run down on the FA Cup. It is, alas, all I am fit for.\n\nThere is one game which stands out this week, not least because it involved my team, Tottenham Hotspur, who \ntake on Leeds, conquerors of Manchester United, with something of a point to prove. Anyone who did not witness \nSpurs  2-0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool in midweek might be forgiven for thinking it was a typical capitulation by \nthe Londoners at the hands of one of the Sky 4.\n\nUtter tripe, say I. The only person in England less popular than Wiley is Howard Webb   that other doyen of \nrefereeing   at a Bar Mitzvah in N17. Webb s frankly ludicrous decisions, or rather non-decisions, in denying Spurs \na stonewall penalty and a second-half equaliser explained Liverpool s victory more easily than Tottenham s \nadmittedly indifferent performance. Nevertheless, Spurs are struggling for goals and have failed to score since \nnotching four against Peterborough United in the third round of this competition at the start  of January.\n\nAaron Lennon s injury helps explain their sterility in part, so don t expect goals by the bucketload today with the \nEngland winger absent once again. That said, with top-four aspirations stuttering, this might be Harry Redknapp s \nbest chance of earning plaudits this season and Spurs should have just enough to ease their way into the last 16. \n\nShould Leeds nick a goal, expect it to come from Jermaine Beckford.\n\nSelectioNS\n\nTottenham 2-0 (6/1, Skybet); Jermaine Beckford to score any time (3/1, Ladbrokes)\n\nSeason s total \u00a354\n\nProfessor of Medicine;\n\nBorn October 23, 1922; Died December 30, 2009.\n\nPROFESSOR Arthur Colville Kennedy, who has died aged 87, was a pioneer of renal medicine, a gifted clinician \nand a respected academic.\n\nACK, as he was widely known, was born in Glasgow, attended Whitehill High School and studied medicine at \nGlasgow University, graduating MB ChB with commendation in 1945. After training posts in the west of Scotland, \nthe award of his MD with high commendation in 1956 and military service in the RAFVR, he was appointed senior \nlecturer in medicine and honorary consultant physician at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, an institution he served for his \nprofessional life. \n\nHis academic achievements led to a titular chair in medicine in 1969 and to appointment to the Muirhead chair of \nmedicine in 1979, a position he held until he retired in 1988. Prior to retirement, ACK held many significant posts \nincluding external examinerships in many universities in the UK and abroad, membership of the Greater Glasgow \nHealth Board and the presidency of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. \n\nFollowing retirement, he held a number of important posts, including membership of the General Medical Council, \nchairmanship of the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board and the presidency of the BMA. He was a fellow \nof the UK Royal Colleges of Physicians, a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an honorary fellow of the \nAmerican College of Physicians and of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. He was appointed CBE in \n1992.\n\nThis impressive list of achievements, however, does not do full justice to ACK as a man or to his contributions to \nmedicine.\n\nHe is known as one of the pioneers of renal medicine and, in particular, of the effective treatment of acute renal \nfailure. It is easy to forget how this illness was usually a death sentence 50 years ago, even in young and previously \n\n\n\nfit people. ACK instituted the first dialysis service in Glasgow in 1959, using a rotating drum artificial kidney \nmachine, housed in the basement of the hospital. Almost immediately, this machine reduced the mortality in acute \nrenal failure from just under 100% to around 30%. \n\nWithin a few years, the introduction of more sophisticated dialysis machines allowed regular treatment for patients \nwith chronic renal failure. However, the success of this treatment rapidly led to a demand which was much greater \nthan could be provided. \n\nAs a result, ACK and his small team were often faced with difficult decisions as to who would benefit most from \ndialysis. He approached these decisions using a combination of great clinical competence and a strong ethical \ngrounding. He was determined that the treatment should be more widely available and was unstinting in his efforts \nto build renal services in the west of Scotland. He was justifiably proud of what had been achieved by the time he \nretired. He was a noted mentor in the developing speciality, and renal physicians trained by him have been \ninstrumental in developing renal services in the UK and other parts of the world. His eminence was recognised by \nhis presidency of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association from 1972-75. \n\nACK s clinical acumen was not limited to renal medicine. His knowledge and ability to elicit a clinical sign that others \nhad missed made his a valued opinion in diagnostic quandaries. His comments, written in characteristic confident \nhand, were usually brief, but always illuminating. This ability to define the core of a problem made him an effective \nteacher. To join ACK on a ward round was inspiring and educational because of his ability to combine great clinical \ncompetence with humanity and an understanding of the patient as a whole.\n\nAs an individual, Arthur was characterised by his energy and determination in pursuit of his goals. His boyish good \nlooks often led these who did not know him to underestimate his experience and ability, a mistake they soon \nrectified. \n\nHe was a reserved, modest and courteous man, but also made many friends. He set high standards for himself and \nexpected the same of his colleagues. \n\nHe had a great ability to spot gifted clinicians at an early stage in their careers and guide their development. He was \narticulate and able to see the  bigger picture  while not forgetting the important details. This combination made him \nvery effective on committees as a member or as the chair, and enabled him to promote many important \ndevelopments during his career.\n\nArthur married Agnes (Nancy) Taylor in 1947 and they remained a devoted couple until his death. \n\nHe is survived by Nancy and their two daughters, a granddaughter and two great-grandchildren. Their son died at a \nyoung age. \n\nJim McKillop, Douglas Briggs and Marjorie Allison\n\nEconomist and academic;\n\nBorn July 1, 1934; Died October 19, 2009.\n\nALAN Tait, who has died aged 75 from cancer, was an Edinburgh-born economist and former professor at \nStrathclyde University who went on to senior positions within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both at its \nWashington DC headquarters and its key Geneva office. \n\nHe was internationally-renowned for his advocacy of Value Added Tax around the world, a tax which existed only in \nFrance during the early part of his career but is now levied in more than 150 countries.\n\nHe spent the early part of his career in Ireland, where he met and married a Tipperary girl and became a fellow of \nTrinity College, Dublin, and an economic adviser to the Irish government and industry. As a highly-respected \neconomist, his was a leading, and sometimes lonely, voice in favour of Ireland joining the European Economic \nCommunity in the years leading up to its entry in 1973. \n\n\n\nAlan Anderson Tait was born in Edinburgh in 1934 but his family moved to North Yorkshire when he was a child \nand he first went to Yarm Grammar School in Stockton-on-Tees. He returned to Edinburgh to attend George Heriot \ns School before gaining a degree in political economy from Edinburgh University. \n\nIn 1959, after dabbling in the world of business in London for two years, he was appointed  junior lecturer in public \nfinance at Trinity in Dublin, where he remained for a dozen years, gained a PhD and was elected a fellow in 1967. \nThe conversations among the college s senior academic staff and their guests at the high table over fine food and \nclaret were echoed throughout his life in his academic, artistic and cultural pursuits. \n\nIn 1971, Mr Tait returned to his native Scotland, this time to Glasgow as professor of money and finance at \nStrathclyde. In that role, he often found himself sought out for advice by the Secretary of State for Scotland of the \ntime   including Gordon Campbell, Willie Ross and Bruce Millan.\n\nIt was while in Glasgow that the International Monetary Fund also sought his advice and he would leave the city to \njoin the IMF s permanent staff in Washington DC in 1977, rising to the post of deputy director of its fiscal affairs \ndepartment. He was later appointed director of the IMF s Geneva office. \n\nIn 1999, Mr Tait retired to Sandwich, Kent, where he focused on one of his life s great loves, painting. (As a \nschoolboy, he had originally wanted to attend the Edinburgh School of Art.)

Bill \nHoward, who retired yesterday from running the Justiciary Office in Parliament House, Edinburgh, said that \nbecause of the increase, and the strict time limits in Scottish criminal cases,  we are now walking a tightrope all the \ntime . \n\n50 YEARS AGO \n\nTHE Standing Joint Committee of the Royal Automobile Club, the Automobile Association, and the Royal Scottish \nAutomobile Club issued the following statement on alcohol and road accidents:  The motoring organisations have \nno sympathy for any driver who causes an accident because his faculties are impaired by the effects of alcohol. On \nthe contrary, they support the imposition of severe penalties in proved cases.  \n\n100 YEARS AGO \n\nAN ALARMING gas explosion by which a man and a number of boys were more or less seriously injured occurred \nin the Truant School of the Glasgow School Board at Springboig, Shettleston. The occurrence took place in a \nworkroom.  \n\n150 YEARS AGO \n\nUPWARDS of 80 children belonging to the High School of Howwood assembled in Elliston Church for buns and \nfruit provided by the Lady Elizabeth Lee Harvey of Castlesemple. It is pleasing to see those who occupy the highest \npositions taking a condescending interest in the rising generation.\n\n200 YEARS AGO \n\nAS A cotton-spinner was on his way home with his wages in Glasgow from Tradestown he was attacked and \nrobbed.\n\nSinger and songwriter;\n\nBorn February 6, 1946; Died January 18, 2010.\n\nKATE McGarrigle, who has died aged 63 from cancer, was a Canadian folk singer and songwriter best known for \nperforming with her sister, Anna. \n\nThere s never a right time but there was added poignancy in her death being announced during Celtic Connections, \njust as that of another friend of the festival, John Martyn, had been in 2009. The two musicians, while very different \npersonalities, shared a record producer in Joe Boyd and a talent for making music that will live on in their absence \nand continues to inspire and delight new audiences.\n\nMcGarrigle and her younger sister were in with the bricks at Celtic Connections. They appeared at the first event in \n1994 and, having included Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on one of their infrequent tours in October 1996, when Kate \nintroduced her now rather better known son, Rufus Wainwright, they returned in 2001 and 2004, when they lent \ntheir inimitable harmony singing to the Transatlantic Sessions concert.\n\nWith typical mischief, they announced before leaving Canada for that 2001 concert that it was a gig they could do \nwithout   because it meant interrupting their skiing practice just when they were beginning to get pretty good. Such \ndisregard for matters business was typical, too, and could cause record company executives to tear out their hair. \n\nDespite writing songs that sold millions   Kate s Hard Work brought in sizeable cheques after it appeared on Maria \nMuldaur s first album   and making albums in the 1970s that saw off rivals from Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, \n\n\n\nFleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd to take album of the year titles, they stuck to their principle of family first, careers \nsecond.\n\nGrowing up in the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec, with French-Irish parents, they, along with their older sister, \nJanie, learned piano from the nuns in their village and developed their harmony singing in family music sessions at \nhome. The McGarrigle Hour, their 1998 album recorded with various offspring, husbands past and present, and \nfriends, was the sisters in their natural habitat, singing the songs they loved, wrote and grew up with.\n\nThey were never really an act, as such (their borderline shambolic presentation was part of their charm), and even \ntheir colleagues in their first band, the Mountain City Four, didn t think they had a hope as songwriters, remaining \nstoically unimpressed when, in 1975, Warner Brothers invested heavily in studio time to capture the sisters  songs, \nincluding Kate s Kiss and Say Goodbye and Talk  to Me of Mendocino and Anna s much covered Heart Like a \nWheel.\n\nThey invented themselves during those first recordings, they insisted, using stacked harmonies to the extent that \nwhen they heard themselves singing in concert, they became discouraged. They also had domestic commitments. \nKate s now long-dissolved marriage to Loudon Wainwright, who d encouraged her songwriting by including We ve \nCome a Long Way on his 1973 album, Attempted Moustache, produced Rufus and another keeper of the family s \nmusical flame, Martha. Albums appeared in the sisters  own good time and live appearances could sometimes \nstruggle to be described as occasional   one year they played just three gigs.\n\nReunited in 1996 with Boyd, who had produced their first album, they picked up some momentum and their \nGlasgow appearances, when these by now middle-aged sisters could give every impression of being naughty \nschoolgirls, are cherished for their living-room intimacy and drop-dead gorgeous singing of some of the best songs \nof the past 50 years. \n\nShe died at her Montreal home in the company of her sisters, Jane and Anna, and her children, Rufus and Martha.\n\nRob Adams\n\nWITH spring planting weeks away, NFU Scotland is encouraging its members to only consider growing those crops \nthat they believe they can sell profitably this coming harvest\n\nThe volatility experienced in the 2009 season saw grain prices tumble at the same time as input prices, such as \nfertiliser, increased, and the Union is keen that arable farmers learn from last year s pain and better manage what \ngrowers produce to meet market demand.\n\nThe Union had a positive meeting with the Malting Association of Great Britain (MAGB) this week to discuss the \npotential market for spring barley this harvest. It has also welcomed the release of a number of contracts in \nScotland for malting barley   the main ingredient in Scotch whisky production   that give some opportunity for \ngrowers to better manage risk over the coming seasons.\n\nSpeaking after the MAGB meeting, NFUS combinable crops committee chairman, John Picken said:  Unfortunately, \nas farmers we need to learn from last year s financial pain and focus on growing crops that are actually likely to sell \nat a viable price. \n\nMarket report round-up:\n\nUnited Auctions sold 2946 prime hoggs on Thursday to a top of \u00a3115 for Beltex and 261p/kg, also for Beltex.

Heavy ewes sold to \n\u00a3151.50 for Texels and averaged \u00a390.22, whilst light ewes sold to \u00a392.50 for Blackfaces and averaged \u00a357.34. \nCast rams sold to \u00a3169.50 for Texels and averaged \u00a382.63.\n\nALLIED Vehicles, the UK s leading supplier of wheelchair-accessible taxis and a manufacturer of electric vans, saw \nprofits slump by more than 80% last year, as recession and the credit crunch choked demand   but Paul Nelson, the \ncompany s managing director, said conditions were  beginning to ease .\n\nHowever, Allied, which has its headquarters in Possil in the north of Glasgow, said it had responded to the slump by \nreducing working capital and costs, which included a number of redundancies   although it said it was now  better \nplaced to deal with the recession .\n\nNelson yesterday told The Herald:  At the beginning of last year we employed around 380 people, but by the end of \nthe year we were down to 320. \n\n Now we re back up to 350, which is positive.\n\n Margins are still tight and the market is still tough, but we re now getting production levels back up to where they \nwere. And while the electric car market is still slow, we re already up to about 100 this year, against 25 or 30 last \nyear. \n\nThe company also has around 3000 other vehicles.\n\n There are definitely some optimistic signs,  Nelson added.\n\nNonetheless, Allied booked pre-tax profits of \u00a3110,601 for the year to the end of April 2009, compared with \n\u00a3594,380, calculated on an annualised, pro-rated basis for the previous 15 months.\n\nTurnover came in at \u00a360.5m, compared with \u00a355.4m on the same annualised, pro-rated basis, according to the \ncompany s latest set of accounts, obtained by The Herald from Companies House.\n\nNelson said:  A strong start to the year was hampered by the recession in the taxi market in the second half.\n\n A shortage of finance products available to purchasers and a significant downturn in revenue for taxi drivers, \ncombined with a shortage of base vehicle stock as vehicle manufacturers cut inventories, led to reductions in sales \nby up to 35% in the last quarter. \n\nThe directors added in the accounts:  The company has continued to invest in the development and lithium-\npowered electric vehicles. Sales continue to be low for these vehicles which carry a significant premium. \n\nThe firm last year unveiled the revolutionary E7 vehicles. Powered solely by Lithium batteries, the taxi has a top \nspeed of 60mph and can travel 100 miles between battery charges.\n\nAllied is also part of a Glasgow-based consortium, which includes the city council, to have received \u00a31.8m to trial \nelectric cars in the city over the next two years.\n\nThe accounts showed the highest-paid director at Allied last year earned \u00a3106,262, compared with \u00a3131,073 the \nyear before.\n\n  \n\nBRITISH engineer Invensys has said operating profit in its third quarter was ahead of a year ago, helped by cost \nsavings, a good performance in its rail division and improved profitability in its controls unit.\n\n\n\nThe company, which makes automation systems and control for nuclear power plants, railways and domestic \nappliances,  said despite the difficult economic climate and customers delaying orders, it was sticking to its \nprediction of better profits for the year.  Its operations management division, which serves production facilities like \nchemical plants, was continuing to see reduced orders.\n\nHowever, it expected an improvement in the fourth quarter, it said.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report operating profit of \u00a3237.7 million ($388m) for the year to the end of March, \nslightly down on the \u00a3244m reported a year ago, according to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of six analysts. \n\nPAWNBROKER chain H&T said demand among recession-hit consumers to swap their unwanted gold for cash had \nmore than tripled scrap profits for 2009.\n\nThe group   the UK s largest pawnbroker   now expects full-year profits at the top end of forecasts as it reaps the \nrewards of rocketing gold prices and a burgeoning market to trade in the precious metal.\n\nThe consumer watchdog had launched an investigation of five companies offering cash for gold by post.\n\nThe Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it was demanding information from the firms to ensure they are not breaking \nconsumer protection laws.\n\nHowever, H&T said it was not one of the five firms being investigated.\n\nAlthough the company does offer a postal service, it largely trades its cash for customers  gold across its stores.\n\nH&T has recently launched a chain of 56 shopping centre-based Gold Bars outlets.\n\nTHIS week s shock jump in the inflation rate to 2.9% has highlighted the need for savers to keep on their toes.   \n\n Savings rates look to have hit rock bottom, with the average no notice rate hovering at 0.75%, not far above bank \nbase rate,  said Darren Cook at Moneyfacts.  A basic rate taxpayer currently needs to find a savings account that \npays at least 3.63% in interest to stop their savings pot eroding away. A higher rate taxpayer needs to locate an \naccount that pays 4.81%. \n\nCurrently, there are no variable rate accounts paying interest above above 3.63%. \n\nDavid Kuo, director at financial website The Motley Fool, commented:   The return of VAT to 17.5% this month \nfollowing the pointless 2.5% cut last year is likely to stoke inflation further. \n\n Consequently, the jump in inflation should be a wake-up call for all of us. We ignore it at our peril. \n\nKevin Mountford at moneysupermarket.com said:  The potential good news from this announcement is that banks \nand building societies will have to react accordingly so we could see savings rates increase in the near future. The \nrecord increase should mean a rise in base rates this year becomes much more likely which will be better news for \nsavers. \n\nHe added savers in some of the best easy access savings accounts should monitor when their  introductory bonus  \ndeal comes to end, or risk losing out on up to \u00a386 in interest. \n\nThe website warns the bonus can make up over half the rate on the average easy access account, meaning that \nwhen the introductory bonus ends, the rate will slide to around half its rate.\n\nThe newly launched easy access account from Coventry Building Society, for instance, pays a market leading 3.3%   \nbut 1.3% of that is a limited period bonus. Tesco is offering 2.75% on its internet savings account but this includes a \n1.5% bonus which ends after a year. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile higher rates of interest are available but the best ones are on fixed rate accounts.  Rates of over 5% are \ncurrently being paid on five-year bonds.   The top rate of 5.25% is offered by the State Bank of India on deposits of \n\u00a310,000 or more, reduced to 5.12% for those who want a monthly income. \n\nBut you don t need large deposits. Birmingham Midshires and Saga are both  offering 5.1% for amounts of \u00a31 or \nover on (the same) five-year bond.\n\nThe Clydesdale has a five year bond paying 4.75% for amounts of \u00a32000 and over.  \n\nAs well as providing higher returns at the moment, fixed rate accounts provide certainty.  Douglas Cameron of \nGlasgow based independent financial advisers Campbell Thomson says:  Fixed rate accounts can be \nadvantageous for budgeting purposes as well as safeguarding against falls in interest rates.   \n\nThe risk of putting savings into a fixed rate account is that interest rates start to rise again and savers then lose out \nbecause they will be locked in at a lower rate. But few advisers expect base rate to increase any time soon.  The \ngeneral consensus is that rates are unlikely to go up in 2010 and that it could be 2011 or beyond before they start to \nrise.    \n\nRichard Wadsworth, director of independent financial advisers Fitzallan in Glasgow, says:  We really don t see rates \nrising much at all over the next 18 months because the economy is still in a fragile state.  \n\nAnd Barry O Neill, investment adviser at Thomson Shepherd agrees.   We believe it is unlikely interest rates will go \nup for a year or two and even then it is uncertain how fast they will rise.  \n\nThe message from advisers therefore is that locking into fixed rate accounts now is probably a good idea   but not \nfor too long. David Thomson of VWM Consulting advises:  Two or three years are the optimum terms to go for. That \nway you will benefit from the higher rates for most the term even if variable rates start to go up towards the end of \nperiod.  \n\nAmong the top fixed rate bonds available over shorter terms are two-year bonds from Santander and Nationwide, \nboth offering 4.1%, while Nationwide and Saga both have a three-year bond at 4.5%.  \n\nFor cash Isas, the same handful of providers are all jostling for attention with an offer of 3.5% for a two-year fixed \nrate.   This is equivalent to a gross rate of 4.4% on an ordinary savings account for basic rate taxpayers and 5.8% \nfor higher rate taxpayers.  Nationwide s fixed rate Isa also has a monthly income option paying 3.4%. \n\nHowever, advisers are more cautious about recommending savers lock themselves into longer term accounts of \nfour or five years. Mr Wadsworth explains:  There is a risk that as the economy recovers, inflation will start to rise \nand interest rates will have to be increased to choke it off.   \n\nBarry O Neill adds:  The further ahead you look, the more uncertain the direction of interest rates appears. Nobody \ncan predict what they are going to be   even the providers of longer term bonds, so they will tend to err on the side \nof caution which means savers could end up getting a poor deal.      \n\nOnce savers put money into a fixed rate bond, it normally cannot be withdrawn so it is never a good idea to lock \naway too much capital anyway. As an alternative to fixed term savings bonds, Douglas Cameron suggests the High \n5 Account with Investec Bank. It currently pays 3.32% per annum on balances over \u00a325,000.  The bank says the \naccount will offer the average rate of the best 5 savings accounts as published on Moneyfacts website.\n\nAROUND the top table at a major financial industry dinner in Edinburgh last autumn, the company director on my \nleft said to the one on my right:  You can t get a room for under \u00a3250 in London now. \n\nTravelodge offers rooms from \u00a329, but I decided to keep quiet rather than get my coat.\n\nEvidently the top brass in the Financial Services Authority have the same attitude to other people s money.\n\n\n\nChairman Lord Turner spent \u00a3811 on a two-night hotel stay last February, and his average bill for overnight stays is \n\u00a3265 a night.\n\nHector Sants, the chief executive, is more canny   his average bill is only \u00a3225 a night.  \n\nManaging director Jon Pain claimed \u00a3545 for a two-night stay, while director Sally Dewar was not to be outdone, \nracking up a bill of \u00a3358 for a single night.\n\nThe average amount spent per night by all directors was \u00a3259.\n\nBut the FSA s staff handbook states that hotel stays in the UK are subject to a maximum VAT-inclusive cost of \u00a3150 \na night, excluding breakfast. \n\nThis maximum rises to \u00a3170 including tax for foreign hotels and \u00a3250 for North America.\n\nThe information was published by the fearless Money Marketing which obtained it through a Freedom of Information \nrequest to the regulator.\n\nThe reaction from independent financial advisers, who tend to see the FSA as an expensive bureaucracy which \nfails to regulate banks,  was apoplectic. \n\nWithin moments of the item hitting screens came the first response from the IFA bloggers:  Have they not heard of \nPremier Inns?  wrote one.  More than adequate for a night s kip   they aren t there to party after all. \n\nAnother added:  I ve just been billed my annual FSA fees of \u00a33000. I questioned this and was told that this is due to \nthe regulatory changes which will require more time and resources on their part. Now I read this I want my money \nback! \n\nAn FSA spokeswoman said:  All FSA staff are expected to follow the expenses policy and we will always try to get \nthe best deal available, but we may not always be able to meet that limit due to exceptional circumstances that may \narise. \n\nHalf an hour later came the news that the FSA had fined Standard Life \u00a32.45m, its biggest ever penalty on an \ninsurer, for misleading investors over its  cash  pension fund that was only 12% in cash and the rest in money \nmarket instruments which lost value in the crash.\n\nStandard had admitted its mistake within 18 days and promised to inject \u00a3100m into the fund to recompense all \n98,000 investors in full. Yet it was judged more guilty than Scottish Widows, which in 2003 had to be ordered to pay \n\u00a3100m to 22,000 Lloyds bank branch customers for the mis-sale of precipice bonds. A further 51,000 Lloyds \ncustomers who bought the bonds and lost capital got nothing, as they were judged ineligible for compensation.\n\nThe IFA bloggers were soon on the warpath.  The company acted quickly and voluntarily   maybe there is a time \nand place for the FSA occasionally congratulating someone for doing the right thing, rather than levying pointless \nfines just so they can feel important,  wrote one.\n\nThe FSA insists that the action  demonstrates our commitment to the principle of credible deterrence . \n\nIts own hotel rules appear to be an exception.\n\nTHERE S no such thing as a free lunch. Last year s massive fiscal stimulus by the UK Government eased some of \nBritain s economic problems. But it came at a price. Rather than being conjured away, the excess borrowing that \nlay at the heart of the financial crisis was, in effect, transferred from the private sector and on to the Government s \nplate.\n\nAs taxpayers, this has important consequences for us all. But, as recent developments in debt markets indicate, it \nalso has implications for our financial future. \n\n\n\nFor over a year, the credit default swap (CDS) market (in which investors insure themselves against the risk of one \nof their debtors going bust) has considered a handful of Britain s largest companies to be better credit risks than the \nUK Government. \n\nIn recent weeks, however, the market s mounting nerves about the UK s debt mountain has sent the cost of \ninsuring UK Government debt soaring. \n\nAs a result, CDS prices suggest that a substantial number of FTSE 100 companies, from BP through to Rolls-\nRoyce, are less likely to default on their debt payments than the UK Government.\n\nThat is a remarkable development. It represents a complete inversion of the traditional relationship between \ngovernment debt (where low risks are matched by low returns) and private-sector debt and equity markets (where \nrisks and returns are traditionally higher). \n\nGiven that, it may be tempting to dismiss the current situation in the credit default swap market as  irrational , as the \nFinancial Times did recently. \n\nStockbrokers seem equally sceptical. One broker I spoke to dismissed the rise in the cost of insuring gilts (UK \nGovernment debt) above that of major UK companies as  an unusual situation which may reflect illiquidity and \nidiosyncrasies.   \n\nThey may be right. Equally, however, they may be falling victim to what psychologists refer to as  confirmation bias . \n\nConfirmation bias leads us to look for information that confirms our existing ideas and to dismiss contradicting \nevidence. Recent experience, however, shows us that dismissing unsettling signals from the market can be \ndangerous. \n\nIn August 2007 the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other (known as the Libor rate) spiked sharply \nhigher. In retrospect this was a strong indication that something was badly wrong in the banking system. \n\nAt the time, however, many commentators dismissed the signal as an  irrational  reflection of illiquidity. A few weeks \nlater, long queues were forming outside branches of Northern Rock. An unthinkable abstraction (a bank run) had \nturned into an unpleasant reality. The  irrational  message from the Libor rate was right. \n\nWhat does all this mean? Basically it has implications for anyone with a pension fund. Because pension funds \ninvest in gilts, we are all creditors of the UK Government. Conventional wisdom holds that government-bond funds \nare the safest place for your money: they are  risk free . Sovereign debt defaults are relatively rare   but they do \nhappen. Spain defaulted seven times in the 19th century. In the 20th century, European nations defaulted on their \ndebts 16 times.\n\nThere is, however, good news too. The CDS market indicates that a host of blue-chip FTSE 100 companies are \nfinancially stronger than the UK Government. And, in the case of four of the market s largest stocks   BP, Glaxo, \nShell and AstraZeneca   the margins are considerable. Together, these four companies constitute over 20 percent \nof the UK market, and generate an average dividend yield of over 5%, which is a lot more than the four percent \nyield on ten-year gilts, even before dividend growth is taken into account.\n\nThere s no such thing as a free lunch. But it might turn out that some lunches are better  value than you think. \n\nJeff Saunders is a UK fund  manager with Martin Currie\n\nFather-to-be Ross Corry from Edinburgh is busy saving for the next generation.

Rather than being conjured away, the excess borrowing that \nlay at the heart of the financial crisis was, in effect, transferred from the private sector and on to the Government s \nplate.\n\nAs taxpayers, this has important consequences for us all. But, as recent developments in debt markets indicate, it \nalso has implications for our financial future. \n\nFor over a year, the credit default swap (CDS) market (in which investors insure themselves against the risk of one \nof their debtors going bust) has considered a handful of Britain s largest companies to be better credit risks than the \nUK Government. \n\nIn recent weeks, however, the market s mounting nerves about the UK s debt mountain has sent the cost of \ninsuring UK Government debt soaring. \n\nAs a result, CDS prices suggest that a substantial number of FTSE 100 companies, from BP through to Rolls-\nRoyce, are less likely to default on their debt payments than the UK Government.\n\nThat is a remarkable development. It represents a complete inversion of the traditional relationship between \ngovernment debt (where low risks are matched by low returns) and private-sector debt and equity markets (where \nrisks and returns are traditionally higher). \n\nGiven that, it may be tempting to dismiss the current situation in the credit default swap market as  irrational , as the \nFinancial Times did recently. \n\nStockbrokers seem equally sceptical. One broker I spoke to dismissed the rise in the cost of insuring gilts (UK \nGovernment debt) above that of major UK companies as  an unusual situation which may reflect illiquidity and \nidiosyncrasies.   \n\nThey may be right. Equally, however, they may be falling victim to what psychologists refer to as  confirmation bias . \n\nConfirmation bias leads us to look for information that confirms our existing ideas and to dismiss contradicting \nevidence. Recent experience, however, shows us that dismissing unsettling signals from the market can be \ndangerous. \n\nIn August 2007 the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other (known as the Libor rate) spiked sharply \nhigher. In retrospect this was a strong indication that something was badly wrong in the banking system. \n\n\n\nAt the time, however, many commentators dismissed the signal as an  irrational  reflection of illiquidity. A few weeks \nlater, long queues were forming outside branches of Northern Rock. An unthinkable abstraction (a bank run) had \nturned into an unpleasant reality. The  irrational  message from the Libor rate was right. \n\nWhat does all this mean? Basically it has implications for anyone with a pension fund. Because pension funds \ninvest in gilts, we are all creditors of the UK Government. Conventional wisdom holds that government-bond funds \nare the safest place for your money: they are  risk free . Sovereign debt defaults are relatively rare   but they do \nhappen. Spain defaulted seven times in the 19th century. In the 20th century, European nations defaulted on their \ndebts 16 times.\n\nThere is, however, good news too. The CDS market indicates that a host of blue-chip FTSE 100 companies are \nfinancially stronger than the UK Government. And, in the case of four of the market s largest stocks   BP, Glaxo, \nShell and AstraZeneca   the margins are considerable. Together, these four companies constitute over 20 percent \nof the UK market, and generate an average dividend yield of over 5%, which is a lot more than the four percent \nyield on ten-year gilts, even before dividend growth is taken into account.\n\nThere s no such thing as a free lunch. But it might turn out that some lunches are better  value than you think. \n\nJeff Saunders is a UK fund  manager with Martin Currie\n\nTHIS week s shock jump in the inflation rate to 2.9% has highlighted the need for savers to keep on their toes.   \n\n Savings rates look to have hit rock bottom, with the average no notice rate hovering at 0.75%, not far above bank \nbase rate,  said Darren Cook at Moneyfacts.  A basic rate taxpayer currently needs to find a savings account that \npays at least 3.63% in interest to stop their savings pot eroding away. A higher rate taxpayer needs to locate an \naccount that pays 4.81%. \n\nCurrently, there are no variable rate accounts paying interest above above 3.63%. \n\nDavid Kuo, director at financial website The Motley Fool, commented:   The return of VAT to 17.5% this month \nfollowing the pointless 2.5% cut last year is likely to stoke inflation further. \n\n Consequently, the jump in inflation should be a wake-up call for all of us. We ignore it at our peril. \n\nKevin Mountford at moneysupermarket.com said:  The potential good news from this announcement is that banks \nand building societies will have to react accordingly so we could see savings rates increase in the near future. The \nrecord increase should mean a rise in base rates this year becomes much more likely which will be better news for \nsavers. \n\nHe added savers in some of the best easy access savings accounts should monitor when their  introductory bonus  \ndeal comes to end, or risk losing out on up to \u00a386 in interest. \n\nThe website warns the bonus can make up over half the rate on the average easy access account, meaning that \nwhen the introductory bonus ends, the rate will slide to around half its rate.\n\nThe newly launched easy access account from Coventry Building Society, for instance, pays a market leading 3.3%   \nbut 1.3% of that is a limited period bonus. Tesco is offering 2.75% on its internet savings account but this includes a \n1.5% bonus which ends after a year. \n\nMeanwhile higher rates of interest are available but the best ones are on fixed rate accounts.  Rates of over 5% are \ncurrently being paid on five-year bonds.   The top rate of 5.25% is offered by the State Bank of India on deposits of \n\u00a310,000 or more, reduced to 5.12% for those who want a monthly income. \n\nBut you don t need large deposits. Birmingham Midshires and Saga are both  offering 5.1% for amounts of \u00a31 or \nover on (the same) five-year bond.\n\n\n\nThe Clydesdale has a five year bond paying 4.75% for amounts of \u00a32,=000 and over.  \n\nAs well as providing higher returns at the moment, fixed rate accounts provide certainty.  Douglas Cameron of \nGlasgow based independent financial advisers Campbell Thomson says:  Fixed rate accounts can be \nadvantageous for budgeting purposes as well as safeguarding against falls in interest rates.   \n\nThe risk of putting savings into a fixed rate account is that interest rates start to rise again and savers then lose out \nbecause they will be locked in at a lower rate. But few advisers expect base rate to increase any time soon.  The \ngeneral consensus is that rates are unlikely to go up in 2010 and that it could be 2011 or beyond before they start to \nrise.    \n\nRichard Wadsworth, director of independent financial advisers Fitzallan in Glasgow, says:  We really don t see rates \nrising much at all over the next 18 months because the economy is still in a fragile state.  \n\nAnd Barry O Neill, investment adviser at Thomson Shepherd agrees.   We believe it is unlikely interest rates will go \nup for a year or two and even then it is uncertain how fast they will rise.  \n\nThe message from advisers therefore is that locking into fixed rate accounts now is probably a good idea   but not \nfor too long. David Thomson of VWM Consulting advises:  Two or three years are the optimum terms to go for. That \nway you will benefit from the higher rates for most the term even if variable rates start to go up towards the end of \nperiod.  \n\nAmong the top fixed rate bonds available over shorter terms are two-year bonds from Santander and Nationwide, \nboth offering 4.1%, while Nationwide and Saga both have a three-year bond at 4.5%.  \n\nFor cash Isas, the same handful of providers are all jostling for attention with an offer of 3.5% for a two-year fixed \nrate.   This is equivalent to a gross rate of 4.4% on an ordinary savings account for basic rate taxpayers and 5.8% \nfor higher rate taxpayers.  Nationwide s fixed rate Isa also has a monthly income option paying 3.4%. \n\nHowever, advisers are more cautious about recommending savers lock themselves into longer term accounts of \nfour or five years. Mr Wadsworth explains:  There is a risk that as the economy recovers, inflation will start to rise \nand interest rates will have to be increased to choke it off.   \n\nBarry O Neill adds:  The further ahead you look, the more uncertain the direction of interest rates appears. Nobody \ncan predict what they are going to be   even the providers of longer term bonds, so they will tend to err on the side \nof caution which means savers could end up getting a poor deal.      \n\nOnce savers put money into a fixed rate bond, it normally cannot be withdrawn so it is never a good idea to lock \naway too much capital anyway. As an alternative to fixed term savings bonds, Douglas Cameron suggests the High \n5 Account with Investec Bank. It currently pays 3.32% per annum on balances over \u00a325,000.  The bank says the \naccount will offer the average rate of the best 5 savings accounts as published on Moneyfacts website.\n\nMARKETS-BRITAIN-STOCKS UPDATE 2 FTSE down as Obama proposals knock financials  * FTSE 100 sees \nbiggest weekly fall in nearly 3 months  * Banks, financials dented by Obama proposals  * Energy slips as China \nfears rumble on    By Simon Falush  LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 share index suffered its \nbiggest weekly fall in nearly three months on Friday, as the U.S. president's proposals to curb the banks hit \nfinancials, while energy stocks fell on lower crude prices.  The blue-chip index closed down 32.11 points, or 0.6 \npercent, at 5,302.99, taking its weekly decline to 2.8 percent, the biggest weekly fall in 12 weeks.  Banks were hit \nafter Obama announced far-reaching proposals to limit the size and activities of U.S. lenders. France, Britain and \nGermany offered support on the plans but fell short of pledging to follow suit.  Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and \nHSBC fell 0.2 to 4.1 percent but Lloyds Banking Group bucked the trend, adding 0.6 percent.  \"It's the Obama \nnews, and (U.S.) bank earnings reports were mixed, so there's a lot of uncertainty in the ring,\" said Richard Hunter, \nhead of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.  ICAP, the world's largest inter-dealer broker, was the biggest faller, \ndown 6.6 percent on worries the Obama move will also curb its business, while shares in the London Stock \nExchange lost 4.3 percent.  Energy stocks, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and BG Group fell 0.2 to 1 percent as the shaky \n\n\n\ndemand outlook pushed oil back to around $75 per barrel.  The index was knocked further after quarterly results \nfrom U.S. bellwether General Electric failed to reassure investors.  \"It's difficult to see what would be the catalyst in \nthe short term for appreciation in this market,\" Tim Whitehead, investment manager at Redmayne-Bentley said.    \nRETAIL GLOOM  Data from the UK's Office for National Statistics added to the gloom after it reported British retail \nsales volumes rose by much less than expected in December as a large rise in prices deterred shoppers from \nsplashing out over Christmas.  The news sent the general retailers down with Home Retail off 1.9 percent, while \nMarks & Spencer and Next dropped 0.7 and 1.2 percent respectively.  Profit-takers moved in on pharmaceutical \nstocks, which were among a select group of stocks in positive territory in the previous session on hopes Obama's \nhealthcare plan will stall and as investor risk appetite waned.  AstraZeneca, boosted on Thursday by a Morgan \nStanley upgrade, shed 0.8 percent. GlaxoSmithKline and Shire shed 1 and 0.7 percent respectively.  On the upside, \nBritish engineer Invensys rose 1.2 percent after it said cost savings and higher margins in its controls unit delivered \na better third-quarter operating profit, and it expected a resumption of large industrial orders.  Miners were broadly \nhigher, recovering some of the sharp losses the previous session, with Xstrata the pick of the bunch, up 2.4 \npercent, helped as it said a new estimate of its Frieda River project in Papua New Guinea shows a 26 percent \nincrease in resource tonnage.

Redwood noted this was weaker than the 1% \nquarter-on-quarter growth in the three months to September 30.\n\nShe added:  Accordingly, if the economy came out of recession at the end of last year, it does not appear to have \nbeen due to the retail sector. \n\nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said:  Retail sales disappointed hugely in \nDecember. The disappointment was compounded by the fact that it followed a drop of 0.3% in November. \n\nHe added:  Given that consumer spending accounts for some 65% of GDP (gross domestic product), the limited \nrise in retail sales volumes in December modestly dilutes hopes that the economy saw a significant rise in GDP in \nthe fourth quarter of 2009. \n\nNevertheless, retail sales volumes still rose by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2009, so they were \nhardly disastrous, and it still seems odds-on that the economy exited recession. \n\nUK GDP data for the fourth quarter are due on Tuesday. Yesterday s retail sales data caused some to question \nwhether the consensus forecast of 0.4% growth in the final three months to last year, after six consecutive quarters \nof contraction, might be too optimistic.\n\nFrom back page\n\nSTANDARD Life Investments yesterday lambasted billionaire Joe Lewis s attempts to dictate boardroom \ncomposition at pubs group Mitchells & Butlers as  unreasonable and contrary to interests of the wider shareholder \nbase .\n\n\n\nLewis s Piedmont investment vehicle, which owns 23% of Mitchells & Butlers, has been in a bitter public spat with \nthe pubs group over the make-up of the board. Lewis is probably best known north of the Border as a former major \ninvestor in Rangers Football Club.\n\nMitchells & Butlers, in trying to reach a compromise  with Lewis s Piedmont investment vehicle, has argued that it  \nis not appropriate for one shareholder owning 23% of the company to  nominate both the chairman and a majority \nof directors .\n\nThe pub group s compromise proposes that John Lovering,  the retail industry veteran nominated by Piedmont as \nchairman of Mitchells & Butlers, would be appointed to this post.\n\nHowever, Mitchells & Butlers wants  parity  between directors  nominated by Piedmont and those appointed through \nthe normal board process .\n\nIt is recommending that shareholders vote against the resolutions to appoint Piedmont nominees Michael Balfour \nand Jeremy Blood as directors and also oppose the Piedmont-proposed resolution to remove Drummond Hall from \nits board, at its forthcoming annual meeting on January 28.\n\nStandard Life Investments, which owns just under 2% of Mitchells & Butlers, said it noted  that the numerous \nattempts of the board of Mitchells & Butlers to achieve a compromise with its largest shareholder over the \ncomposition of the board have been rebuffed .\n\nIt added:  The demands of this shareholder are, in our view, both unreasonable and contrary to interests of the \nwider shareholder base. \n\n We believe that it would be in the best interests of both the company and all shareholders that stability should be \nbrought to the board in a manner that does not give control of the board to its largest shareholder. \n\nStandard Life Investments emphasised its support for the voting recommendations of the Mitchells & Butlers board.\n\nIt said:  Amongst other things, these support some measure of board representation for the company s largest \nshareholder. These recommendations are in the best interests of all shareholders and should command support.  \n\n  \n\nSteve Remp, executive chairman of SeaEnergy, has demonstrated his faith in his reinvented company by taking \ntwo years of deferred pension contributions in newly-issued shares.\n\nSeaEnergy said yesterday it had issued 149,000 new shares at 60p a share, in satisfaction of pension payments \nowed to Remp.\n\n During 2008 and 2009 Steve Remp voluntarily deferred pension entitlements totalling \u00a389,400,  the company said.  \nNo security was given by the company for, and no interest was charged on, the deferred amounts. \n\nMany top executives have for some time been devising alternatives to pension contributions following the \ngovernment s imposition in 2007 of lifetime limits. \n\nBut SeaEnergy said:  Mr Remp s pension fund has agreed that the contributions of \u00a389,400 which had been \ndeferred can be satisfied by the issue of new shares. \n\nFounder Remp now holds 5,585,668 shares or 8.2% of the company which flirted with disaster in 2005 after failed \nIrish gas exploration, but last year changed its name from Ramco Energy and positioned itself as a pure \nrenewables specialist.\n\nRemp is working on plans to set up a service division to exploit the offshore wind market, and hinted China would \nbe a key area of focus after the UK.\n\n\n\nJIM LINDSAY, the affable chief executive of Airdrie Savings Bank (ASB), is a man of the people   although that has \nbeen no mean feat. In an age characterised by supercharged greed and interlinking global financial maelstroms, \nmany bankers are demonised as pariahs.\n\nEven as foreign-accented salesmen from competing institutions continue to push to offload dubious loans, \ninsurance policies and credit cards from call centres half way around the world   when most customers only want a \nchat with the bank manager at their local branch   Lindsay has remained true to his bank s founding principles.\n\nIndeed, call centres, fancy derivatives, exposure to exotic sub-prime mortgages, toxic securities and wildly complex \nfinancial instruments are  utterly anathema to this bank whose official history is titled The Triumph of Thrift.\n\nAirdrie Savings Bank, the last surviving independent savings bank in the UK, this year celebrates its 175th \nanniversary, and over those years not much has changed. \n\nThe Herald met Lindsay in the bank s wood-panelled boardroom, with its photographs of past managers and \nhistoric deeds on the walls. \n\nThe weight of the past here is comforting   especially given the banking sector s thrashing over the past couple of \nyears.\n\nASB s aim has remained to  continue to strive to serve local customers on a face-to-face basis , which likely \nexplains its aversion for offshore call centres. \n\nLindsay, relaxed at the head of the heavy oak table, at which sit the bank s trustees during their regular meetings, \nshuddered and threw his arms in the air when asked if the bank has    or has ever had    exposure to US sub-prime \nmortgages or even FTSE-100 equities.\n\n Sub-prime? Equities? Absolutely not. This is proper banking,  said Lindsay, who has been the chief executive of \nAirdrie Savings Bank for the past 10 years, before which he was 27 years with Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\n The starting point is that we are governed by our trustees, none of whom are paid but have only the interests of our \ncustomers at heart.\n\n While other banks are primarily concerned with profits, bonuses and a return for shareholders, our main interest is \nprotecting depositors. That s a completely different ethos.\n\n We re here to offer a service, not generate a profit. If you only go after the profit, you end up losing your customers. \n\nIn fact, Airdrie Savings Bank has no shareholders and its Board of Trustees is appointed to represent the interests \nof depositors and to ensure the bank is managed prudently and efficiently. \n\nBecause there are no shareholders, the bank is not required to pay dividends and all surpluses are re-invested for \nthe benefit of customers. \n\nOver its 175 years, the bank has watched with varying degrees of alarm as economic catastrophes have unfolded \naround the world   although none has ever had any adverse impact on the bank s core operations. There were even \neyebrows raised and angst expressed in the year the bank was established.\n\nSeven days after it was founded on January 1, 1835, US public debt contracts to zero for its first and only time in \nhistory and later that year, on December 16 and 17, the Great Fire of New York destroyed 530 buildings, including \nthe New York Stock Exchange.\n\nJust as neither of these economically significant events of 1835 had any negative impact on the core activities of \nAirdrie Savings Bank, neither did the collapse and fire sale of investment bank Bear Stern to JP Morgan Chase in \n2008, or the subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and ensuing global financial whirlwind that wreaked havoc \namong ASB s own UK high street competitors.\n\n\n\nLindsay said:  Usually what happened when domestic and foreign crises occurred, Airdrie Savings Bank \nexperienced an increase in the number of depositors. That was certainly the case last year. People talk about a \nflight to safety.\n\n For us, the net result of the trouble at Bear Stern and Lehman Brothers was that we got more deposits. The bank \nhas about 60,000 accounts now, and it s growing strongly.\n\n I think it s fair to say that we came out of the global financial crisis with our reputation enhanced. \n\nHe added:  It s a fact that this bank, in all its history, never lost a penny until 1929. But even during the Great \nDepression, it went on an expansion drive. We never gambled with our customers  money and we would still never \ndo that. \n\n Years ago, we used to invest in British war bonds. The tanks actually came down the main street in Airdrie   not to \nquell the natives, but to let investors see what they were buying into   it was something like two treads of a tank \ntrack, or so they said. \n\nThe bank, although small, has also determined to remain independent throughout its life. When the other UK \nsavings banks banded together to form the Trustee Savings Bank and subsequently merged with Lloyds Bank to \nform LloydsTSB, the Airdrie bank decided to remain on its own two feet. \n\nIt is now the only independent savings bank in the UK.\n\nFrom the beginning, ASB was established on the principle of providing local workers with the opportunity to save   \nand not much has changed. \n\nThat remains a large part of the business and latest results show customers  deposits were \u00a3124m. \n\nNevermind the rest of the world, ASB wasn t much interested in elsewhere in Lanarkshire until 1916, when it spread \nits wings into neighbouring Coatbridge, and the following year in Bellshill.\n\nIt wasn t until the Great Depression struck in 1929 that it opened in Shotts in 1931, Muirhead in 1931 and \nBaillieston in 1936. \n\nIt didn t make to Motherwell until 1997.\n\nHowever then, as now, each branch operates under the control of a manager and the emphasis has remained on \nface-to-face personal service.\n\nWhile the bank has concentrated on looking after customers  savings, it has widened its range considerably over \nthe past 25 years, starting with lending to personal customers and then subsequently providing lending and general \nbanking services to business customers.  It only began its foray internet banking yesterday.\n\nAsked about the next 175 years. Lindsay smiled and looked around at the history on the dark wooden walls around \nhim. \n\n Our intention is that we will certainly be here in 175 years,  he said.  If we keep looking after our customers I see no \nreason why we shouldn t be. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nONE of the UK s leading investors has called for an attack on  deep incentives embedded in the financial and \naccounting system  that encourage banks in the UK to create a credit bubble.\n\n\n\nKeith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments, said banks were incentivised to create excessive \nleverage in the private sector and to take on excessive investment and liquidity risk.\n\n We need to move policy beyond its current macro-prudential orientation of ensuring the system can cope with a \nbust, to looking to reduce the risk of a  bubble being created in  the first place,  Skeoch  told businessmen in \nEdinburgh.  \n\n The UK s long-term love affair with debt and its continued dependency on consumption to drive economic activity \nputs it in a precarious position relative to its major competitors.  \n\nHe said while much of recent focus had been on the creditworthiness of the government, private sector debt has \nrisen from 65% of GDP in 1980 to 427% now.  This makes the UK s private sector the most indebted of the world s \ntop ten economies. \n\nWhile this dependency on debt finance should not prevent economic recovery taking hold in 2010, it is likely to \nmake the pace and activity in the coming cycle both anaemic and fragile. \n\nUS chocolate firm Hershey cleared the way for Kraft s \u00a311.9 billion takeover of Dairy Milk firm Cadbury after it said \nit would not make a counter-bid.\n\nHershey s formal withdrawal from the race comes three days after an improved Kraft bid was recommended by \nCadbury s board.\n\nThe Oreos-to-Philadelphia cheese maker s 840p-per-share offer is set to end the independent history of the British \nfirm, which dates back to 1824.\n\nHershey s decision comes after a unanimous board vote by directors against a bid on Wednesday, according to \nreports.\n\nOn Tuesday, the City's Takeover Panel gave the firm a deadline of Monday for it to make an approach or walk \naway.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-based firm had been weighing up its own move but Kraft's improved bid, including a higher cash \nshare, put too much pressure on the firm.\n\nHershey already has a relationship with Cadbury, making Dairy Milk and Creme Eggs in the US under licence, and \nhad been seen as the UK firm's preferred choice as a  white knight  before Kraft upped its bid.\n\nKraft says its takeover will create a  global confectionery leader    making the combined group world number one in \nthe chocolate and sugar confectionery market and number two for chewing gum.\n\nCadbury employs around 5,600 staff at eight manufacturing sites in the UK and Ireland.\n\nShareholders in Cadbury have until February 2 to vote on the offer.\n\nFEARS over the momentum of any UK economic recovery were fuelled yesterday by the revelation of much weaker \nthan expected UK retail sales for the key December trading period.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said UK retail sales volumes rose by only 0.3% month-on-month on a seasonally \nadjusted basis in December. This was less than one-third of the 1.1% increase forecast by the City, and the 0.3% \nrise was the worst month-on-month increase for any December since 2007.\n\nRetail sales volumes in December were up 2.1% on the same month of 2008. This was the worst year-on-year \ngrowth for any December since 1998 and marks a significant deceleration from an annual pace of increase of 2.7% \nin November.\n\n\n\nHowever, a 3.6% year-on-year rise in retail sales value last month was the best for any December since 2006, with \nretailers having discounted by far less last month than in December 2008.\n\nA survey from the British Retail Consortium earlier this month had painted a picture of buoyant Christmas trading. A \nraft of retailers, including John Lewis and Next have reported strong festive sales, and supermarkets also clocked \nup significant increases in volumes.\n\nYesterday s official data are much more downbeat. They may signal, amid much talk of tougher times for \nindependent retailers and the collapse of chains such  as clothing retailers d2 and Happit, that the picture on the \nhigh street has been much more patchy than the buoyant sales figures from the big high street names suggest.\n\nDepartment store sales were particularly weak in December, according to the official data. \n\nSales volumes in the non-specialised category, which includes department stores, were down 1% month-on-month \nin December. Textile, clothing and footwear sales fell 0.1% between November and December.\n\nFood sales volumes rose by 0.3% month-on-month on a seasonally adjusted basis in December. Non-food sales \nvolumes rose just 0.1%. \n\nOnline retail sales appeared relatively strong. The non-store retail and repair category, which includes online sales, \nenjoyed a 2.8% jump in volumes during December alone. Sales of household goods rose by 0.5%.\n\nVicky Redwood, senior UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said:  December s modest rise in the \nofficial measure of retail sales was disappointing given the far more upbeat tone of the surveys and trading updates.\n\n Although the figures should not be taken as gospel, they were a timely reminder that UK consumers should not be \nrelied upon to drive a strong economic recovery. \n\nReferring to the restoration of the value-added tax rate from the emergency level of 15% to 17.5% at the start of this \nmonth, Redwood added:  Sales should have received at least some boost from consumers bringing forward \nspending ahead of the VAT rise. \n\n Admittedly, the VAT rise is most notable on more expensive items, yet household goods sales rose by only 0.5%. \nWithout the VAT effect, sales may well have fallen. \n\nUK retail sales in the fourth\n\n Continued on Page 27\n\nDELOITTE is eyeing a bigger slice of Britain s \u00a32 billion ($3.3 billion) property advisory market after acquiring \nDrivers Jonas, one of Britain s oldest  surveying firms.\n\nDrivers Jonas, which was established in 1725, will move its 650 employees to Deloitte s much smaller real estate \nteam by March, Deloitte said. \n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Nick Shepherd, managing partner of Drivers Jonas, will become managing partner of \nthe enlarged real estate group. It will have about 700 staff,  annual revenues of more than \u00a3110m and will trade as \nDrivers Jonas Deloitte.\n\nA spokesman for Deloitte said no capital was changing hands and there would be no job  losses following the \nmerger.\n\nThere is renewed optimism for the prospects of the property market.\n\nUK commercial property prices climbed by 3% last month, their highest monthly rise for 23 years, as demand \neclipsed assets available for purchase.\n\n\n\nAIRDRIE Savings Bank, the UK s last remaining independent savings bank, which this year celebrates its 175th \nanniversary, leapt boldly into the 21st century yesterday with the launch of internet banking for its customers.\n\nThe move, the product of a \u00a3500,000 investment, comes more than a decade after most of ASB s high street \ncounterparts took the plunge and allowed their customers to view account details and conduct transactions online.\n\nJim Lindsay, the chief executive of the bank, which is almost obsessively focused on servicing and protecting its \ndepositors, said:  We have not done this to attract new customers around the world or to offer a new service.\n\nQuite the contrary. It is an expansion of our existing service for our customers.  This is the kind of thing we do with \nour profits. \n\nAirdrie Savings Bank has no shareholders and its board of trustees is appointed to represent the interests of \ndepositors and to ensure the bank is managed prudently and efficiently. \n\nIn spite of its belated leap into the world of internet banking, ASB has long set itself apart from its rivals as one the \nbeneficiaries of last year s flight to safety amid the global financial downturn.\n\nBecause there are no shareholders, the bank is not required to pay dividends. All profits are re-invested for the \nbenefit of customers. \n\nDuring its most recent financial year to the end of October 2009, the bank earned pre-tax profits of \u00a3270,000, down \nfrom \u00a3790,000    a decline the bank blamed on the historically low interest rates.\n\nChistopher Ormerod, the bank s president, said:  ASB consider the results for 2009 to be satisfactory. \n\nThe bank s latest results also reveal deposits slipped by less than 1% to \u00a3124m   although Lindsay said that was \nlikely the result of  a few  new customers leaving after the  flight to safety . Meanwhile, bank reserves came in at \n\u00a314.7m and bad debt provision fell to \u00a355,000 from \u00a3110,000 previously.\n"}
