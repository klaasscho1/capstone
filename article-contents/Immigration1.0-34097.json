{"title": "Washington: Border Guards Will Cease Acting as Interpreters", "body": "\nUnited States Border Patrol agents will no longer serve as interpreters when local law enforcement agencies \nrequest language help, according to a new decree issued by the Department of Homeland Security. The new \nguidance said agents should refer such requests to private services often used by government agencies. Seeking \nlanguage help is a common practice among local law enforcement agencies in Washington State. If a person is \npulled over and can speak only Spanish, the Border Patrol is often called. But immigration advocates complain that \nBorder Patrol agents ask people questions about immigration and in some cases arrest immigrants suspected of \nbeing in the country illegally. ''The concept of language access should be without people being questioned about \ntheir immigration status,'' said Jorge L. Bar\u00f3n, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a legal \naid organization based in Seattle. Immigrants have grown apprehensive about calling local law enforcement \nagencies if they know the Border Patrol will respond, he said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/us/washington-border-guards-will-cease-acting-as-interpreters.html\n"}
