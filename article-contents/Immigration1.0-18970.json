{"title": "Wal-Mart facility is site of 14 arrests", "body": "\nImmigration agents have arrested 14 illegal immigrants who were working for a subcontractor of Wal-Mart Stores \nInc., which settled an immigration probe this year.\n\nAgents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement staged the raid on a Wal-Mart distribution center in North \nPlatte, Neb., on Dec. 20, the agency said in a statement yesterday. The laborers, all Mexican citizens, worked for \nReich Installation Services Inc. of North Platte and were installing shelving.\n\n\"Fourteen people at one work site is not a small number,\" immigration spokesman Tim Counts said in an interview. \nWal-Mart \"cooperated fully\" with the raid, he said. The agency is a division of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n\nLast month, a lawsuit filed in federal court in New Jersey accused Wal-Mart of knowingly using companies that \nhired undocumented workers. The claims are based in part on records unsealed by a federal judge in Arkansas \nfrom a U.S. investigation of cleaning contractors hired by Wal-Mart. The retailer settled the probe in March by \nagreeing to pay $11 million and to improve oversight of its contractors.\n\n\"No charges will be brought against Wal-Mart or any of our associates,\" Wal-Mart spokeswoman Sarah Clark said \nof the arrests in Nebraska. \"As we have said before, we expect our contractors or subcontractors to hire only \ndocumented workers, and we will not tolerate anything else.\"\n\nOn Nov. 17, immigration agents raided a Wal-Mart distribution center under construction in Pennsylvania, \narresting 125 suspected illegal immigrant workers. Federal agents searched five subcontractors at the site, looking \nfor evidence of money laundering and helping immigrants from Mexico and Central America enter the United States \nillegally.\n"}
