{"title": "Letters: An inhumane proposal on birthright citizenship", "body": "\nAs a Sister of Mercy, I am dismayed to learn that a Pennsylvania legislator is leading a coalition of lawmakers from \nseveral states to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants (\"Pa. legislator in 'birthright' \nfight,\" Thursday). Proposed bills would require the states to deny standard birth certificates to these children. This is \na clear violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe lawmakers' proposal comes out of a context of fear and distrust of \"the other.\" This is not an appropriate \nenvironment in which to have a civil discussion of the issue.\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy, who have a long history of service to immigrants, recognize that our immigration system is \nbroken. We have a commitment to immigration reform that recognizes the need to protect our borders but that also \nrecognizes the need for family unification and a way for undocumented immigrants to earn legal status.\n\nThe proposal around birthright citizenship is an ill-advised and inhumane way to deal with the issue.\n\nRegina Ward\n\nMerion\n\nrward@mercymidatlantic.org\n"}
