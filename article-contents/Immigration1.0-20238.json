{"title": "Mexican boycott spurs outcry; U.S. FIRMS SAY THEY'RE ALLIES OF WORKERS", "body": "\nU.S. lobbyists lashed out Wednesday at the Mexican boycott-American campaign timed for May 1 to coincide with \nthe ``Day Without Immigrants'' protest in the United States.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico said organizers are risking a backlash and foolishly targeting \nsome of their best allies, since U.S. corporations have actively lobbied the U.S. Congress for immigration reform, \nincluding legalization for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants.\n\nMexicans' refusal to ``buy American'' on May 1 could further polarize the debate and make reform supporters seem \nanti-American at the very moment that lobbyists are trying to persuade lawmakers in Washington to pass a bill that \nwould benefit migrants, said Larry Rubin, the chamber's president.\n\n``This is like shooting oneself in the foot,'' Rubin said. ``U.S. companies have been the first to lobby, launching a \nhuge lobbying effort for immigration reform. . . . Why hurt something that is helping you?''\n\nMigrants and their supporters in the United States are being encouraged to skip work and school and not spend \nmoney for one day to demonstrate the migrants' importance to the U.S. economy.\n\nSouth of the border, Mexicans are targeting American stores and chain restaurants -- ``That means no Dunkin' \nDonuts, no McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, Sears, Krispy Kreme or Wal-Mart,'' reads one e-mail making the \nrounds.\n\nBut even activists are confused about which companies are U.S.-owned. Sears is cited by boycott organizers, \ndespite the fact that Sears' Mexico stores were bought by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim in 1997. And few \norganizers mention Vips -- the chain of ubiquitous Mexican diners -- even though they are owned by Wal-Mart.\n\nA quarter of Mexico's formal private-sector jobs with regular pay are provided by U.S. firms, according to the \nchamber, including Walmex, the Mexican Wal-Mart subsidiary that is the nation's biggest private employer with \n140,000 workers. Delphi Corp., the U.S. auto-parts maker, is second with 70,000 workers.\n\n``Certainly, companies could be hurt,'' Rubin said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\nThe chamber represents more than 2,000 American and other foreign companies doing business in Mexico, and \nsays its members are responsible for $100 billion of investment in the country.\n\nThe companies say they're helping Mexico by providing jobs, but activists counter they pay so little that Mexicans \nhave little choice but to head north.\n\nBackers of the Mexican boycott insisted Wednesday that the protest could send a message that American \ncompanies should offer better pay and benefits to their Mexican workers.\n\nUnskilled workers at U.S. companies usually start with Mexico's minimum wage of $4.35 a day. A cashier at \nSubway (or ``sandwich artist,'' as the company refers to them) earns about $189 a month in Mexico City. In \nColorado, Subway cashiers make four times that -- $824.\n"}
