{"title": "TERRORIST FEARS STIR IMMIG HUNT", "body": "\nTHE FEDS ARE stepping up their hunt for undocumented immigrants with suspected terrorist links as the \npresidential election draws near, officials confirmed yesterday.\n\n\"We are moving at an up-tempo pace at pursuing, identifying, arresting immigration-status violators in the interest of \nnational security,\" said Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement in \nWashington. \n\n\"This is information based on intelligence.\"\n\nAuthorities have warned about a possible terrorist attack before the Nov. 2 elections.\n\nBut immigrants rights groups fear the heightened search for undocumented immigrants with suspected terrorist \nlinks could unfairly target Arabs and Muslims.\n\n\"We understand immigration enforcement, we just want to make sure this is not racially motivated,\" Laila Al-Qatami, \ncommunications director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said. \"We'll see what happens in the \nupcoming weeks.\"\n\nSince the 2001 terrorist attacks, Arab and Muslims have complained of being profiled. Advocates also have been \ncritical of a federal program that mostly required Middle Eastern male visa holders to register with the government.\n"}
