{"title": "Machineguns, Destructive Devices and Certain Other Firearms; Background Checks for Responsible Persons of a Trust or Legal Entity with Respect to Making or Transferring a Firearm", "body": "\n Washington, DC:  This Rule document was issued by the Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Bureau (ATF)\n  \n <h2>\n  Action</h2>\n \n  Final rule.\n <h2>\n  Summary</h2>\n \n\n  The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives (ATF) regarding the making or transferring of a firearm under the National Firearms Act (NFA). This final \nrule defines the term \u201cresponsible person,\u201d as used in reference to a trust, partnership, association, company, or \ncorporation; requires responsible persons of such trusts or legal entities to complete a specified form and to submit \nphotographs and fingerprints when the trust or legal entity files an application to make an NFA firearm or is listed as \nthe transferee on an application to transfer an NFA firearm; requires that a copy of all applications to make or \ntransfer a firearm, and the specified form for responsible persons, as applicable, be forwarded to the chief law \nenforcement officer (CLEO) of the locality in which the applicant/transferee or responsible person is located; and \neliminates the requirement for a certification signed by the CLEO. \n\nThese provisions provide a public safety benefit as they ensure that responsible persons undergo background \nchecks. In addition, this final rule adds a new section to ATF's regulations to address the possession and transfer \nof firearms registered to a decedent. The new section clarifies that the executor, administrator, personal \nrepresentative, or other person authorized under State law to dispose of property in an estate may possess a \nfirearm registered to a decedent during the term of probate without such possession being treated as a \u201ctransfer\u201d \nunder the NFA. It also specifies that the transfer of the firearm to any beneficiary of the estate may be made on a \ntax-exempt basis.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Dates</h2>\n\n\n \n\n  This rule is effective July 13, 2016.\n\n <h2>\n\n  For Further Information Contact</h2>\n\n \n\n  Brenda Raffath Friend, Office of Regulatory Affairs, Enforcement Programs and Services, Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, U.S. Department of Justice, 99 New York Avenue NE., Washington, DC 20226; \ntelephone: (202) 648-7070.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Supplementary Information</h2>\n\n \n\n  I.

Executive Summary</h3>\n\n <h4>\n\n  A. Purpose of the Regulatory Action</h4>\n\n \n\n  The current regulations at 27 CFR 479.63 and 479.85, which require fingerprints, photographs, and a law \nenforcement certification for individual applicants to make or transfer National Firearms Act (NFA) firearms, do not \napply to trusts or legal entities. On September 9, 2013, the Department of Justice (\u201cthe Department\u201d or DOJ) \npublished in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking titled \u201cMachine Guns, Destructive Devices and \nCertain Other Firearms; Background Checks for Responsible Persons of a Corporation, Trust or Other Legal \nEntity with Respect to Making or Transferring a Firearm,\u201d 78 FR 55014 (ATF 41P). The proposed rulemaking \namended the regulations in \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.11, 479.62-479.63, 479.84-479.85, and 479.90. The proposed regulations \nresponded to a petition for rulemaking, dated December 3, 2009, filed on behalf of the National Firearms Act Trade \nand Collectors Association (NFATCA). The petitioner requested that the Department amend \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85, \nas well as corresponding Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Forms 1 and 4. 78 FR at \n55016-55017. The proposed regulations were intended to conform the identification and background check \nrequirements applicable to certain trusts and legal entities to those that apply to individuals.\n\n \n\n  The goal of this final rule is to ensure that the identification and background check requirements apply equally to \nindividuals, trusts, and legal entities. To lessen potential compliance burdens for the public and law enforcement, \nDOJ has revised the final rule to eliminate the requirement for a certification signed by a chief law enforcement \nofficer (CLEO) and instead require CLEO notification. DOJ has also clarified that the term \u201cresponsible person\u201d for a \ntrust or legal entity includes those persons who have the power and authority to direct the management and policies \nof the trust or legal entity to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, \nor on behalf of, the trust or entity. In the case of a trust, those with the power or authority to direct the management \nand policies of the trust include any person who has the capability to exercise such power and possesses, directly \nor indirectly, the power or authority under any trust instrument, or under State law, to receive, possess, ship, \ntransport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for or on behalf of the trust.\n\n <h4>\n\n  B. Summary of the Major Provisions of This Rule</h4>\n\n \n\n  With respect to trusts, partnerships, associations, companies, or corporations, this final rule defines the term \n\u201cresponsible person\u201d as an individual in the organization that has the power and authority to direct the management \nand policies of the entity insofar as they pertain to firearms. This final rule requires that each responsible person \ncomplete a specified form and submit photographs and fingerprints when the trust or legal entity either files an \napplication to make an NFA firearm, or is listed as the transferee on an application to transfer an NFA firearm. The \nDepartment has also reassessed the need for CLEO certification and is implementing a new approach that focuses \non notifying CLEOs. The final rule only requires that the applicant maker or transferee, including each responsible \nperson for a trust or legal entity, provide a notice to the appropriate State or local official that an application is being \nsubmitted to ATF. An \u201cappropriate State or local official\u201d is the local chief of police, county sheriff, head of the State \npolice, or State or local district attorney or prosecutor of the locality in which the applicant, transferee, or \nresponsible person is located. In addition, this final rule requires responsible persons of a trust or legal entity to \nsubmit fingerprint cards and other identifying information to ATF and undergo a background check. It also adds a \nnew section to ATF's regulations to address the possession and transfer of firearms registered to a decedent. The \nnew section clarifies that the executor, administrator, personal representative, or other person authorized under \nState law to dispose of property in an estate may possess a firearm registered to a decedent during the term of \nprobate without such possession being treated as a \u201ctransfer\u201d under the NFA. It also specifies that the transfer of \nthe firearm to any beneficiary of the estate may be made on a tax-exempt basis.\n\n\n\n <h4>\n\n  C. Costs and Benefits</h4>\n\n \n\n  This rule requires that trusts and legal entities (e.g., partnerships, companies, associations, and corporations) \napplying to make or receive an NFA firearm submit information for each of their responsible persons to ATF to allow \nATF to verify that such persons are not prohibited from possessing or receiving firearms. ATF estimates a total \nadditional cost of $29.4 million annually for trusts and legal entities to gather, procure, and submit such information \nto ATF and for ATF to process the information and conduct background checks on responsible persons. These \nprovisions have public safety benefits because they will enable ATF to better ensure that the approximately 231,658 \nresponsible persons within trusts and legal entities\u2014an estimate based on the number of NFA applications \nprocessed by trusts or legal entities in calendar year 2014 multiplied by an average of two responsible persons per \ntrust or legal entity\u2014applying to make or receive NFA firearms each year are not prohibited from possessing or \nreceiving such firearms.\n\n \n\n  This final rule also requires that all those who apply to make or receive an NFA firearm, as well as all responsible \npersons for each trust or legal entity applicant or transferee, notify their local CLEO that an application has been \nfiled with ATF before the applicant or transferee is permitted to make or receive an NFA firearm. Current \nregulations require individuals, but not trusts or legal entities, to obtain CLEO certification before making or \nreceiving an NFA firearm. ATF estimates that the total cost of the CLEO notification requirement will be \napproximately $5.8 million annually ($0.5 million for individuals; $5.3 million for legal entities). The current cost of \nCLEO certification for individuals is approximately $2.26 million annually. Consequently, the final rule's estimated \nnet cost increase is approximately $3.6 million annually. This increase, however, primarily involves costs to \nresponsible persons for trusts and legal entities that had not previously been required to register, and will be offset \nby cost savings to individuals. ATF estimates the change in the final rule to a notice requirement will save \nindividuals approximately $1.8 million annually. This rule is not an \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rulemaking under \nExecutive Order 12866.\n\n <h3>\n\n  II. Background</h3>\n\n \n\n  The Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53.  (1)  The \nAttorney General has delegated that responsibility to the Director of ATF (Director), subject to the direction of the \nAttorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. 28 CFR 0.130(a). ATF has promulgated regulations that \nimplement the provisions of the NFA set forth in 27 CFR part 479, which contains procedural and substantive \nrequirements relating to the importation, making, exportation, transfer, taxing, identification, registration of, and the \ndealing in machineguns, destructive devices, and certain other firearms.\n\n <h4>\n\n  A. Application To Make a Firearm</h4>\n\n \n\n  Section 5822 of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. 5822, provides that no person shall make a firearm unless the person has: (1) \nFiled with the Attorney General a written application, in duplicate, to make and register the firearm; (2) paid any tax \npayable on the making and evidenced such payment by affixing the proper stamp to the original application form; \n(3) identified the firearm to be made in the application form in such manner as prescribed by regulation; (4) \nidentified the applicant in the application form, in such manner as prescribed by regulation, except that, if such \nperson is an individual, the identification must include the individual's fingerprints and photograph; and (5) obtained \nthe approval of the Attorney General to make and register the firearm and shows such approval on the application \nform. Applications shall be denied if the making or possession of the firearm would place the person making the \n\n\n\nfirearm in violation of law. For purposes of title 26, United States Code, the term \u201cperson\u201d means \u201can individual, a \ntrust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(1).\n\n \n\n  Regulations implementing section 5822 are set forth in 27 CFR part 479, subpart E. Section 479.62 provides, in \npertinent part, that no person may make a firearm unless the person has filed with the Director a written application \non ATF Form 1 (5320.1), Application to Make and Register a Firearm, in duplicate, and has received the approval \nof the Director to make the firearm. Approval of the application will effectuate registration of the firearm to the \napplicant. The application must identify the firearm to be made by serial number and other specified markings and \ninformation. In addition, the applicant must be identified on the form by name and address and, if other than an \nindividual (e.g., a trust or legal entity), by the name and address of the principal officer or authorized representative \nof the trust or legal entity, as well as the employer identification number of the trust or legal entity, if applicable. If an \nindividual, the identification must also include certain information prescribed in \u00a7\u2009479.63.\n \n\n  Section 479.63 states that if the applicant is an individual, such person must securely attach to each copy of the \nForm 1, in the space provided on the form, a 2 x 2-inch photograph of the applicant taken within 1 year prior to the \ndate of the application. The regulation also provides that a completed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Form \nFD-258 (Fingerprint Card), containing the fingerprints of the applicant, must be submitted in duplicate with the \napplication.\n\n \n\n  In addition, \u00a7\u2009479.63 provides that the law enforcement certification located on Form 1 must be completed and \nsigned by the local chief of police or county sheriff, the head of the State police, the State or local district attorney or \nprosecutor, or such other person whose certification may be acceptable to the Director. The certifying official must \nstate, inter alia, that the certifying official has no information indicating that possession of the firearm by the maker \nwould be in violation of State or local law or that the maker will use the firearm for other than lawful purposes. The \ncertifying official must have jurisdiction over the area within which the maker resides. The purpose of this \nrequirement is to ensure that the official will have access to criminal records concerning the maker, and knowledge \nof the State and local laws governing the transfer, receipt, and possession of the firearm by the maker.\n\n \n\n  Under the current regulations, the requirements for fingerprints, photographs, and law enforcement certification \nspecified in \u00a7\u2009479.63 are not applicable to an applicant who is not an individual, e.g., a trust or legal entity.\n \n\n  Section 479.64 sets forth the procedure for approval of an application to make a firearm. As specified, the Form 1 \napplication must be forwarded, in duplicate, by the maker of the firearm to the Director, in accordance with the \ninstructions on the form. If the application is approved, the Director will return the original to the maker of the firearm \nand retain the duplicate. Upon receipt of the approved application, the maker is authorized to make the firearm \ndescribed therein. The maker of the firearm may not, under any circumstances, make the firearm until the \napplication has been forwarded to the Director and has been approved and returned by the Director with the NFA \nstamp affixed. If the application is disapproved, the original Form 1 and the remittance submitted by the applicant \nfor the purchase of the stamp will be returned to the applicant with the reason for disapproval stated on the form.\n\n <h4>\n\n  B. Application for Transfer of a Firearm</h4>\n\n \n\n  Section 5812(a) of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. 5812(a), which applies to applications to transfer a firearm, is substantively \nsimilar to NFA section 5822 (described above in section II.A of this final rule). Regulations implementing section \n5812 are set forth in 27 CFR part 479, subpart F. In general, \u00a7\u2009479.84 provides that no firearm may be transferred \n\n\n\nin the United States unless an application, ATF Form 4 (5320.4), Application for Tax Paid Transfer and Registration \nof Firearm, has been filed in duplicate with, and approved by, the Director. The Form 4 application must be filed by \nthe transferor and must identify the firearm to be transferred by type, serial number, and other specified markings \nand information. The application must identify the transferor by name and address and must include the transferor's \nFederal firearms license, if any, and special (occupational) tax stamp, if applicable. If the transferor is other than an \nindividual, the title or status of the person executing the application must be provided. The application must identify \nthe transferee by name and address and, if the transferee is an individual not qualified as a manufacturer, importer, \nor dealer under part 479, the person must be further identified in the manner prescribed in \u00a7\u2009479.85.\n \n\n  Section 479.85 states that if the transferee is an individual, such person must securely attach to each copy of the \nForm 4, in the space provided on the form, a 2 x 2-inch photograph of the transferee taken within 1 year prior to the \ndate of the application. The transferee must also attach to the application two properly completed FBI Forms FD-\n258 (Fingerprint Card). In addition, a certification by the local chief of police, county sheriff, head of the State police, \nState or local district attorney or prosecutor, or such other person whose certification may in a particular case be \nacceptable to the Director, must be completed on each copy of the Form 4. The certifying official must state, inter \nalia, that the certifying official has no information indicating that the receipt or possession of the firearm would place \nthe transferee in violation of State or local law or that the transferee will use the firearm for other than lawful \npurposes. The certifying official must have jurisdiction over the area within which the transferee resides. The \npurpose of this requirement is to ensure that the official will have access to criminal records concerning the \ntransferee, and knowledge of the State and local laws governing the transfer, receipt, and possession of the firearm \nby the transferee.\n\n \n\n  Under the current regulations, the requirements for fingerprints, photographs, and law enforcement certification \nspecified in \u00a7\u2009479.85 do not apply to individuals qualified as a manufacturer, importer, dealer, or Special \n(Occupational) Taxpayer (SOT) under part 479; nor do they apply to a transferee who is not an individual, e.g., a \ntrust or legal entity.\n\n <h4>\n\n  C. Transfer Tax Exemption Available</h4>\n\n \n\n  Section 5852(e) of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. 5852(e), provides that an unserviceable firearm may be transferred as a \ncurio or ornament without payment of the transfer tax imposed by section 5811, under such requirements as the \nAttorney General may by regulations prescribe.\n\n \n\n  Section 5853(a) of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. 5853(a), provides that a firearm may be transferred without the payment of \nthe transfer tax imposed by section 5811 to any State, possession of the United States, any political subdivision \nthereof, or any official police organization of such a government entity engaged in criminal investigations.\n\n \n\n  Regulations implementing sections 5852(e) and 5853(a) are set forth in 27 CFR 479.90 and 479.91. These \nsections provide, in pertinent part, that the exemption from the transfer tax for the transfer of an unserviceable \nfirearm as a curio or ornament or for a transfer to or from certain government entities may be obtained by the \ntransferor of the firearm by filing with the Director an application, ATF Form 5 (5320.5), Application for Tax Exempt \nTransfer and Registration of Firearm, in duplicate. The application must: (1) Show the name and address of the \ntransferor and of the transferee; (2) identify the Federal firearms license and special (occupational) tax stamp, if \nany, of the transferor and of the transferee; (3) show the name and address of the manufacturer and the importer of \nthe firearm, if known; (4) show the type, model, overall length (if applicable), length of barrel, caliber, gauge or size, \nserial number, and other marks of identification of the firearm; and (5) contain a statement by the transferor that the \ntransferor is entitled to the exemption because either the transferor or the transferee is a governmental entity \n\n\n\ncoming within the purview of \u00a7\u2009479.90(a) or the firearm is unserviceable and is being transferred as a curio or \nornament. In the case of the transfer of a firearm by a governmental entity to a transferee who is an individual who \nis not qualified as a manufacturer, importer, dealer, or SOT under part 479, the transferee must be further identified \nin the manner prescribed in \u00a7\u2009479.85.\n <h3>\n\n  III. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</h3>\n\n \n\n  On September 9, 2013, ATF published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) titled \n\u201cMachine Guns, Destructive Devices and Certain Other Firearms; Background Checks for Responsible Persons of \na Corporation, Trust or Other Legal Entity with Respect to Making or Transferring a Firearm,\u201d 78 FR 55014 (ATF \n41P), amending the regulations in \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.11, 479.62-479.63; 479.84-479.85; and 479.90.\n <h4>\n\n  A. Petition</h4>\n\n \n\n  The proposed regulations were in response to a petition for rulemaking, dated December 3, 2009, filed on behalf \nof the National Firearms Act Trade and Collectors Association (NFATCA). The petitioner requested that the \nDepartment amend \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85, as well as corresponding ATF Forms 1 and 4. 78 FR at 55016-55017. \nThe petition requested amendments as numbered and discussed below.\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. Request To Amend \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85</h5>\n \n\n  The NFATCA expressed concern that persons who are prohibited by law from possessing or receiving firearms \nmay acquire NFA firearms without undergoing a background check by establishing a trust or legal entity such as a \ncorporation or partnership. It contended that the number of applications to acquire NFA firearms via a trust or \ncorporation, partnership, and other legal entity had increased significantly over the years, increasing the potential \nfor NFA firearms to be accessible to those prohibited by law from having them. Therefore, for cases in which a \ntrust, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity applies to make or receive an NFA firearm, the petitioner \nrequested amendments to \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85 requiring photographs and fingerprint cards for individuals who are \nresponsible for directing the management and policies of the entity so that a background check of those \nindividuals may be conducted.\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule set forth ATF's finding that the number of Forms 1, 4, and 5 it received from legal entities that \nare neither individuals nor Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) increased from approximately 840 in 2000 to 12,600 \nin 2009 and to 40,700 in 2012, resulting in a substantial increase in the number of individuals who have access to \nNFA firearms but who have not undergone a background check in connection with obtaining that access. The \nproposed rule stated that the Department agreed with the concerns underlying petitioner's requests, and believed \nthat responsible persons for a trust or legal entity should not be excluded from background checks and other \nrequirements of the regulations that seek to ensure that prohibited persons do not gain access to NFA firearms. The \nproposed rule also discussed an application ATF had recently denied after recognizing that the trust name and \nfirearm were the same as those on a prohibited individual's recently denied application. The proposed rule noted \nthat the application might have been approved if the trust name had been different from that of the prior transferee \nor if the application had included a different firearm.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Request To Amend Certification of Citizenship</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  When filing an ATF Form 1, 4, or 5, the applicant also must submit ATF Form 5330.20, Certification of \nCompliance with 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(5)(B). Under section 922(g)(5)(B) of the Gun Control Act, it is generally unlawful \nfor an alien admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa to ship or transport in interstate or foreign \ncommerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or \nammunition that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Section 922(y)(2) provides for \ncertain exceptions. If an alien who was admitted under a nonimmigrant visa falls within one of the specified \nexceptions, or has obtained a waiver from the Attorney General pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 922(y)(3), appropriate \ndocumentation must be provided on Form 5330.20.\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule accommodated the petitioner's request that the information required on Form 5330.20 be \nincorporated into the requirements of 27 CFR 479.63 and 479.85 and the corresponding forms. According to the \npetitioner, \u201c[e]limination of the ATF Form 5330.20 by adding a citizenship statement to the transfer [and making] \nforms would reduce human effort for both the public and ATF while reducing funds expenditures for printing, \ncopying, and handling the form.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule stated that the Department supports the elimination of unnecessary forms and is committed to \nreducing the paperwork burden for individuals and businesses. Accordingly, the Department proposed amending 27 \nCFR 479.62 and 479.84 and the corresponding forms to incorporate information currently required in Form \n5330.20.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Request To Revise Instructions on Forms 1, 4, and 5</h5>\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule also accommodated the petitioner's request that the instructions on applications to make or \ntransfer a firearm be revised so that they are consistent with those on ATF Form 7 (5310.12), Application for \nFederal Firearms License. This request appeared to be referring to the Form 7 instruction regarding the submission \nof photographs and fingerprint cards for responsible persons (e.g., in the case of a corporation, partnership, or \nassociation, any individual possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the \nmanagement, policies, and practices of the legal entity, insofar as they pertain to firearms).\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule stated that the Department agreed that proposed changes to the regulations would require \nmodifications to corresponding Forms 1, 4, and 5, including changes to the instructions on the forms, and proposed \nto go forward with those changes.\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Law Enforcement Certification</h5>\n\n \n\n  Finally, the proposed rule accepted in part petitioner's request that the law enforcement certification requirement \nbe eliminated and that ATF \u201cadopt a CLEO [chief law enforcement officer] process that will include a full NICS \n[National Instant Criminal Background Check System] check for principal officers of a trust or corporation \nreceiving such firearms for the trust or corporation.\u201d The petitioner articulated several reasons in support of its \nrequest. In addition, the petitioner stated that \u201c[s]ome CLEOs express a concern of perceived liability; that signing \nan NFA transfer application will link them to any inappropriate use of the firearm.\u201d See 78 FR at 55016-55017 for full \ndiscussion.\n\n \n\n  The Department agreed in principle with some of petitioner's assertions (for example, that ATF independently \nverifies whether receipt or possession of an NFA firearm would place the applicant or transferee in violation of \nState or local law). Id. However, ATF did not propose to eliminate the CLEO certification requirement. Rather, ATF \n\n\n\nproposed extending the CLEO certification requirement to responsible persons of a trust or legal entity, but also \nproposed amending the language of the certification to omit the requirement that the certifying official state that the \ncertifying official has no information that the applicant or transferee will use the firearm for other than lawful \npurposes.\n\n <h4>\n\n  B. Amendment of 27 CFR 479.11</h4>\n\n \n\n  In addition to the issues raised in NFATCA's 2009 petition, the Department proposed amending 27 CFR 479.11 to \nadd a definition for the term \u201cresponsible person.\u201d The proposed term included specific definitions in the case of a \ntrust, partnership, association, company (including a Limited Liability Company (LLC)), or corporation. Depending \non the context, the proposed term included any individual, including any grantor, trustee, beneficiary, partner, \nmember, officer, director, board member, owner, shareholder, or manager who possesses, directly or indirectly, the \npower or authority under any trust instrument, contract, agreement, article, certificate, bylaw, or instrument, or under \nState law, to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf \nof, the trust or entity.\n\n \n\n  To ensure that responsible persons, as so defined, were subject to penalties under 26 U.S.C. 5871 for committing \nunlawful acts under the NFA (see 26 U.S.C. 5861) to the same extent as are the trusts or legal entities with which \nthey are associated, the Department also proposed amending the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in 27 CFR 479.11 to clarify \nthat a \u201cperson\u201d is a partnership, company, association, trust, or corporation, including each responsible person \nassociated with such an entity; an estate; or an individual.\n\n \n\n  Although the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7\u2009479.11 includes the word \u201cestate,\u201d ATF traditionally has treated estates \ndifferently from business entities. Therefore, the Department did not propose defining the term \u201cresponsible person\u201d \nto include estates. The Department explained that estates are temporary legal entities created to dispose of \nproperty previously possessed by a decedent with the estate's term typically defined by the law of the State in \nwhich the decedent resided, whereas partnerships, trusts, associations, companies, and corporations are formed \nfor a specific purpose and remain in existence until action is taken to dissolve them. The Department further \nexplained that, historically, ATF has treated the transfer of a registered NFA firearm held by an estate differently \nfrom other transfers under the NFA. ATF has allowed the executor\u2014or other person authorized under State law to \ndispose of property in an estate\u2014to convey firearms registered to the decedent without being treated as a voluntary \ntransfer under the NFA. ATF has also allowed such transfers to be made on a tax-exempt basis when an ATF Form \n5 is submitted and approved in accordance with 27 CFR 479.90. When the transfer of the firearm is to persons who \nare not lawful heirs, however, the executor is required to file an ATF Form 4 and to pay any transfer tax in \naccordance with 27 CFR 479.84.\n\n <h4>\n\n  C. Amendment of 27 CFR 479.62 and 479.63</h4>\n\n \n\n  With respect to an application to make a firearm, the Department proposed several amendments to 27 CFR \n479.62 (\u201cApplication to make\u201d) and 479.63 (\u201cIdentification of applicant\u201d).\n\n \n\n  Amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.62 proposed to:\n \n\n  1. Provide that if the applicant is a partnership, company, association, trust, or corporation, all information on the \nForm 1 application must be furnished for each responsible person of the applicant;\n\n\n\n \n\n  2. Specify that if the applicant is a partnership, company, association, trust, or corporation, each responsible \nperson must comply with the identification requirements prescribed in the proposed \u00a7\u2009479.63(b); and\n \n\n  3. Require the applicant (including, if other than an individual, any responsible person), if an alien admitted under \na nonimmigrant visa, to provide applicable documentation demonstrating that the applicant falls within an \nexception to 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(5)(B) or has obtained a waiver of that provision.\n\n \n\n  Amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.63, where the applicant is an individual, proposed to maintain the CLEO certification but \nomit the requirement for a statement about the use of a firearm for other than lawful purposes. This section \nproposed to require, instead, that the certification state that the official is satisfied that the fingerprints and \nphotograph accompanying the application are those of the applicant and that the official has no information \nindicating that possession of the firearm by the maker would be in violation of State or local law.\n\n \n\n  The Department stated that the CLEO's certification that the CLEO \u201cis satisfied that the fingerprints and \nphotograph accompanying the application are those of the applicant,\u201d is an existing requirement for an individual \napplicant (see 27 CFR 479.63); however, this certification was not reflected on the current form. ATF proposed to \nmodify the Form 1 to include this certification for individuals and include the same certification on Form 5320.23 for \nresponsible persons within a trust or legal entity.\n\n \n\n  Additionally, amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.63, where the applicant is a partnership, company, association, trust, or \ncorporation, proposed to:\n\n \n\n  1. Provide that the applicant must be identified on the Form 1 application by the name and exact location of the \nplace of business, including the name of the county in which the business is located or, in the case of a trust, the \naddress where the firearm is located. In the case of two or more locations, the address shown must be the principal \nplace of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporation) or, in the case of a trust, the principal address at \nwhich the firearm is located;\n\n \n\n  2. Require the applicant to attach to the application:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Documentation evidencing the existence and validity of the entity, which includes complete and unredacted \ncopies of partnership agreements, articles of incorporation, corporate registration, declarations of trust, with any \ntrust schedules, attachments, exhibits, and enclosures; however, if the entity had an application approved as a \nmaker or transferee within the preceding 24 months, and there had been no change to the documentation \npreviously provided, the entity may provide a certification that the information has not changed since the prior \napproval and must identify the application for which the documentation had been submitted by form number, serial \nnumber, and date approved;\n\n  \n\n   A completed ATF Form 5320.23 for each responsible person. Form 5320.23 would require certain identifying \ninformation for each responsible person, including each responsible person's full name, position, Social Security \nnumber (optional), home address, date and place of birth, and country of citizenship;\n\n\n\n  \n\n   In accordance with the instructions provided on Form 5320.23, a 2 x 2-inch photograph of each responsible \nperson, clearly showing a full front view of the features of the responsible person with head bare, with the distance \nfrom the top of the head to the point of the chin approximately 11/4 inches, and which must have been taken within \n1 year prior to the date of the application;\n\n  \n\n   Two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 (Fingerprint Card) for each responsible person. The fingerprints must \nbe clear for accurate classification and should be taken by someone properly equipped to take them; and\n\n  \n\n   In accordance with the instructions provided on Form 5320.23, a certification for each responsible person \ncompleted by the local chief of police, sheriff of the county, head of the State police, State or local district attorney \nor prosecutor, or such other person whose certification may in a particular case be acceptable to the Director. The \ncertification for each responsible person must be completed by the CLEO who has jurisdiction over the area in \nwhich the responsible person resides. The certification must state that the official is satisfied that the fingerprints \nand photograph accompanying the application are those of the responsible person and that the certifying official \nhas no information indicating that possession of the firearm by the responsible person would be in violation of State \nor local law.\n\n \n\n \n\n  ATF also sought public comments regarding the feasibility of asking CLEOs to certify that they are satisfied that \nthe photographs and fingerprints match those of the responsible person and whether changes were needed to this \nproposal.\n\n <h4>\n\n  D. Amendment of 27 CFR 479.84 and 479.85</h4>\n\n \n\n  With respect to an application to transfer a firearm, the Department proposed several amendments to 27 CFR \n479.84 (\u201cApplication to transfer\u201d) and 479.85 (\u201cIdentification of transferee\u201d).\n\n \n\n  Amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.84 proposed to provide that:\n \n\n  1. The Form 4 application, in duplicate, must be filed by the transferor. If the transferee is a partnership, company, \nassociation, trust, or corporation, all information on the Form 4 application must be furnished for each responsible \nperson of the transferee; and\n\n \n\n  2. The type of firearm being transferred must be noted on the Form 4. If the firearm is other than one classified as \n\u201cany other weapon,\u201d the applicant must submit a remittance in the amount of $200 with the application in \naccordance with the instructions on the form. If the firearm is classified as \u201cany other weapon,\u201d the applicant must \nsubmit a remittance in the amount of $5.\n\n \n\n  Where the transferee is an individual, the proposed amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.85 retained the certification requirement \nbut eliminated the requirement for a CLEO statement about the use of a firearm for other than lawful purposes. In \naddition, the proposal required the certification to state that the official is satisfied that the fingerprints and \nphotograph accompanying the application are those of the applicant and that the certifying official has no \n\n\n\ninformation indicating that receipt or possession of the firearm by the transferee would be in violation of State or \nlocal law.\n\n \n\n  The Department stated that the CLEO's certification that the CLEO \u201cis satisfied that the fingerprints and \nphotograph accompanying the application are those of the applicant,\u201d if an individual applicant, is an existing \nrequirement (see 27 CFR 479.85) but was not reflected on the current Forms 4 and 5. The Department proposed \nhaving ATF amend Forms 4 and 5 to include certification to that effect by the CLEO for individuals, and include the \nsame certification on Form 5320.23 for responsible persons of a legal entity.\n\n \n\n  Amendments to \u00a7\u2009479.85, where the transferee is a partnership, company, association, trust, or corporation, \nproposed to:\n\n \n\n  1. Provide that the transferee must be identified on the Form 4 application by the name and exact location of the \nplace of business, including the name of the county in which the business is located or, in the case of a trust, the \naddress where the firearm is to be located. In the case of two or more locations, the address shown must be the \nprincipal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporation) or, in the case of a trust, the principal \naddress at which the firearm is to be located;\n\n \n\n  2. Require the transferee to attach to the application:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Documentation evidencing the existence and validity of the entity, which includes complete and unredacted \ncopies of partnership agreements, articles of incorporation, corporate registration, declarations of trust, with any \ntrust schedules, attachments, exhibits, and enclosures; however, if the entity has had an application approved as a \nmaker or transferee within the preceding 24 months, and there had been no change to the documentation \npreviously provided, including the responsible person information, the entity may provide a certification that the \ninformation has not changed since the prior approval and must identify the application for which the documentation \nhad been submitted by form number, serial number, and date approved;\n\n  \n\n   A completed ATF Form 5320.23 for each responsible person. Form 5320.23 would require certain identifying \ninformation, including the responsible person's full name, position, Social Security number (optional), home \naddress, date and place of birth, and country of citizenship;\n\n  \n\n   In accordance with the instructions provided on Form 5320.23, a 2 x 2-inch photograph of each responsible \nperson, clearly showing a full front view of the features of the responsible person with head bare, with the distance \nfrom the top of the head to the point of the chin approximately 11/4 inches, and which must have been taken within \n1 year prior to the date of the application;\n\n  \n\n   Two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 (Fingerprint Card) for each responsible person. The fingerprints must \nbe clear for accurate classification and should be taken by someone properly equipped to take them; and\n\n  \n\n   In accordance with the instructions provided on Form 5320.23, a certification for each responsible person \ncompleted by the local chief of police, sheriff of the county, head of the State police, State or local district attorney \nor prosecutor, or such other person whose certification may in a particular case be acceptable to the Director. The \ncertification for each responsible person must be completed by the CLEO who has jurisdiction over the area in \n\n\n\nwhich the responsible person resides. The certification must state that the official is satisfied that the fingerprints \nand photograph accompanying the application are those of the responsible person and that the certifying official \nhas no information indicating that receipt or possession of the firearm by the responsible person would be in \nviolation of State or local law.\n\n \n\n \n\n  ATF also sought public comments concerning the feasibility of asking CLEOs to certify that they are satisfied that \nthe photographs and fingerprints match those of the responsible person, or whether changes were needed to this \nproposal.\n\n <h4>\n\n  E. Amendment of 27 CFR 479.90</h4>\n\n \n\n  Section 5853(a) of the NFA, 26 U.S.C. 5853(a), provides that a firearm may be transferred to any State, \npossession of the United States, any political subdivision thereof, or any official police organization of such a \ngovernment entity engaged in criminal investigations, without the payment of the transfer tax. Regulations \nimplementing section 5853(a) are set forth in 27 CFR 479.90. That section provides, in pertinent part, that the \ntransfer tax exemption may be obtained by the transferor of the firearm by filing with the Director an application on \nATF Form 5 (5320.5), Application for Tax Exempt Transfer and Registration of Firearm, in duplicate. The \napplication must provide certain information, including the name and address of the transferor and the transferee. In \nthe case of a transfer of a firearm by a governmental entity to a transferee who is an individual not qualified as a \nmanufacturer, importer, or dealer under 27 CFR part 479, the transferee must be further identified in the manner \nprescribed in \u00a7\u2009479.85.\n \n\n  The Department proposed amending \u00a7\u2009479.90(b) to remove the word \u201cnatural.\u201d Removing the word \u201cnatural\u201d \nleaves the term \u201cperson,\u201d which was defined in proposed \u00a7\u2009479.11 to include a partnership, company, association, \ntrust, or corporation (including each responsible person of such entity), an estate, or an individual. Under this \nproposal, each transferee (including all responsible persons) would be subject to the requirements prescribed in \nproposed \u00a7\u2009479.85 when a governmental entity transfers a firearm to a partnership, company, association, trust, or \ncorporation that is not qualified as a manufacturer, importer, dealer, or SOT under part 479.\n\n <h4>\n\n  F. Addition of 27 CFR 479.90a, Estates</h4>\n\n \n\n  The Department also proposed adding a new section to part 479 to address the possession and transfer of \nfirearms registered to a decedent.  (2)  The proposed new section provided that the executor, administrator, \npersonal representative, or other person authorized under State law to dispose of property in an estate (collectively \n\u201cexecutor\u201d) may lawfully possess the decedent's NFA firearm during the term of probate without such possession \nbeing treated as a transfer from the decedent. The proposed section also sought to clarify that the executor may \ntransfer firearms held by the estate on a tax-free basis when the transfer is to a beneficiary of the estate; however, \nwhen the transfer is to persons who are not lawful heirs, the executor must pay the appropriate transfer tax.\n\n <h4>\n\n  G. Transfer of Unserviceable Firearm</h4>\n\n \n\n  Section 479.91 provides that an unserviceable firearm, defined in \u00a7\u2009479.11 as a firearm that is incapable of \ndischarging a shot by means of an explosive and incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition, may be \ntransferred as a curio or ornament without payment of the transfer tax. This section also provides that the \n\n\n\nprocedures set forth in \u00a7\u2009479.90 must be followed for the transfer of an unserviceable firearm, with the exception \nthat a statement must be entered on the application that the transferor is entitled to the exemption because the \nfirearm is unserviceable and is being transferred as a curio or ornament. The Department proposed no changes to \nthis section. However, the Department noted that \u00a7\u2009479.91 references the procedures in \u00a7\u2009479.90, which in turn \nreferences \u00a7\u2009479.85, thereby providing notice that changes to \u00a7\u2009479.85 would apply to transfers governed by \n\u00a7\u2009479.91.\n <h4>\n\n  H. Miscellaneous</h4>\n\n \n\n  In the proposed rule, ATF recognized that the composition of the responsible persons associated with a trust, \npartnership, association, company, or corporation may change over time. As a result, ATF stated that it was \nconsidering a requirement that new responsible persons submit Form 5320.23 within 30 days of such a change. \nATF sought comments on this option and solicited recommendations for other approaches.\n\n \n\n  The comment period for the proposed rule closed on December 9, 2013.\n\n <h3>\n\n  IV. Analysis of Comments and Department Responses for Proposed Rule ATF 41P</h3>\n\n \n\n  In response to the proposed rule, ATF received over 9,500 comments. Comments were submitted by citizens; \nindividuals associated with trusts, corporations, and other legal entities; individuals associated with estates; FFLs; \nSOTs; silencer manufacturers; nonprofit and other organizations; trade associations; lawyers; collectors; hunters; \nand others.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters supported the entire proposed rule, while the majority opposed the entire proposed rule. The \nmajority of commenters also opposed the proposed expansion of the CLEO certification requirement and the new \ndefinition for a \u201cresponsible person\u201d for a trust or legal entity. Some of the commenters who opposed the proposed \nexpansion of the CLEO certification requirement and the new \u201cresponsible person\u201d definition, however, supported \nother portions of the proposed rule. The commenters' support and opposition, along with specific concerns and \nsuggestions, are discussed below.\n\n <h4>\n\n  A. Comments Supporting the Rule</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. General Support for the Entire Rule</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  More than a dozen commenters stated that they supported the proposed rule in its entirety. This support was \nbased on a variety of reasons, including that: (1) The current regulations create a \u201cloophole,\u201d through which \nprohibited persons can use a trust to circumvent the background check and CLEO certification requirements; (2) \nthe benefit of ensuring felons and others could no longer circumvent background checks by submitting \napplications as representatives of a corporation or trust outweighed the \u201csmall inconvenience\u201d the proposed rule \nwould involve; (3) the current system of background checks only for individuals is inadequate to do the job of \nkeeping guns out of the wrong hands; and (4) identification of and background checks on responsible persons \nwould increase accountability for firearms regulated under the NFA.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges the commenters' support for the proposed rule, which generally focuses on the \nimportance of conducting background checks, particularly for individuals acquiring NFA firearms. This rule will \nrequire all responsible persons to provide the necessary information, including fingerprints, to allow ATF to conduct \nbackground checks through the various criminal record databases. In addition, individuals, as well as any \nresponsible person associated with a trust or legal entity, will be required to provide notification to the local CLEO of \nthe intent of the individual, trust, or legal entity with which the responsible person is associated, to make or acquire \nthe NFA firearm identified on the form. This notification will provide the CLEO an opportunity to conduct any \ninquiries required by State law, and provide ATF with appropriate input regarding the lawfulness of the individual's \nor responsible person's acquisition or possession of a firearm.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the commenters who desired greater accountability for NFA weapons, the Department notes that the \nNFA requires inclusion of those weapons in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (NFRTR), and \nthat the NFRTR includes firearm identification information, as well as the name and address of the registrant. \nMoreover, by allowing for background checks on individuals who will possess and control firearms on behalf of \ntrusts or legal entities, the rule will deter persons who are prohibited from possessing firearms from attempting to \nuse such trusts or legal entities to unlawfully acquire firearms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Particular Support for Portions of the Rule</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Comments Relative to Forms 5330.20, 1, 4, and 5</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Two commenters stated that the proposal to incorporate the information currently required on ATF Form 5330.20 \ninto Forms 1, 4, and 5 is beneficial, will reduce unnecessary paperwork, and increase efficiency. Another two \ncommenters, including an FFL who is an SOT, supported the proposed changes eliminating the Form 5330.20 and \nincorporating the information from that form into Forms 1, 4, and 5. One of these commenters based his support on \nguidance provided by Executive Order 13610 of May 10, 2012 (\u201cIdentifying and Reducing Regulatory Burden\u201d). \nAnother commenter, a member of the NFATCA, stated that he supports the part of the proposed rule that would \nincorporate the certification of an applicant's status as a U.S. citizen, immigrant alien, or exempt nonimmigrant \nalien into Forms 1, 4, and 5, and eliminate the requirement to attach a separate certification of compliance. Another \ncommenter stated that the elimination of the Form 5330.20 by adding a citizenship statement to the transfer forms \nwould reduce the \u201chuman effort\u201d expended by both the public and ATF, and reduce the expenditure of public funds \nto print, copy, and handle that form.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges the commenters' support for incorporating the certificate of compliance required to \nobtain the exemption provided by 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(5)(B) into ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5. This change will reduce the \nburden on the applicant by reducing the number of forms the applicant must complete to acquire an NFA firearm. \nThe change will also reduce the cost burden on the Department as the Form 5330.20 will no longer have to be \nprinted and separately processed by ATF.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  b. Addition of 27 CFR 479.90a, Estates</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters agreed with the addition of a new section in ATF's regulations addressing firearm transfers \nby estates, and supported the provisions regarding when a transfer occurs, and when a transfer tax must be paid. \nThese commenters supported the additions because they increase clarity and provide specific direction for transfers \nthrough estates.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters supported the proposed changes related to estates and transfers, but suggested that the \nproposed rule did not go far enough. One commenter recommended expanding regulations to cover all involuntary \ntransfers, including transfers at the dissolution of a corporation or other entity, liquidation in bankruptcy, and forced \ntransfers during divorce proceedings, not just those involving the death of the owner. Other commenters argued \nthat although they supported the treatment of estates, the proposal ran afoul of the Department's stated purpose to \nrequire the same identification and background checks of individuals and legal entities, and created a \n\u201cfundamental internal inconsistency.\u201d Similarly, another commenter suggested that trusts should be treated the \nsame as estates, and not subject to the same requirements as apply to individuals. That commenter further stated \nthat \u00a7\u2009479.90a should expressly address the role of attorneys, because issues may arise that require an attorney to \ntake possession of a firearm to effectuate distribution to beneficiaries. This commenter also stated that a copy of the \nobituary in a recognized newspaper should be an acceptable alternative to the death certificate.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges supporters' comments regarding the addition of \u00a7\u2009479.90a to address the \npossession and transfer of firearms registered to a decedent. The addition of this section clarifies that an executor, \nadministrator, personal representative, or others recognized under State law may possess the firearm during the \nterm of probate, which is often a concern for individuals dealing with the NFA firearms as part of an estate. \nAdditionally, the rule provides clarification as to when a transfer tax must be paid.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree that its positions with regard to estates should be expanded to include other types \nof involuntary transfers as part of this rulemaking. Other types of involuntary transfers were not addressed in the \nproposed rule. The Department has exercised its discretion to decline to expand the scope of the rulemaking to \nencompass involuntary transfers not addressed in the proposed rule. Should the Department determine that its \nposition with regard to estates should be extended to other involuntary transfers, it will do so in a separate \nrulemaking.\n\n \n\n  Transfers of NFA firearms from an estate to a lawful heir are necessary because the deceased registrant can no \nlonger possess the firearm. For this reason, ATF has long considered any transfer necessitated because of death to \nbe involuntary and tax-free when the transfer is made to a lawful heir as designated by the decedent or State law. \nHowever, when an NFA firearm is transferred from an estate to a person other than a lawful heir, it is considered a \nvoluntary transfer because the decision has been made to transfer the firearm to a person who would not take \npossession as a matter of law. Such transfers cannot be considered involuntary and should not be exempt from the \ntransfer tax. Other tax-exempt transfers\u2014including those made by operation of law\u2014may be effected by submitting \nForm 5. Instructions are provided on the form.\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department disagrees that \u00a7\u2009479.90a should expressly address the role of attorneys to effectuate distribution \nto beneficiaries. Clear rules are provided that establish who can make the necessary distributions and how those \ndistributions should occur. The Department also disagrees with the assertion that a copy of an obituary in a \n\u201crecognized newspaper\u201d should be recognized as equivalent to a death certificate for purposes of the new section \naddressing estate transfers, as anyone can pay to have an obituary published in a newspaper. However, a death \ncertificate is an official document issued by a government agency; a newspaper obituary has no equivalent \nguarantee of authenticity.\n\n \n\n  When an individual heir is named in a will, the executor of the estate would file a Form 5 to effect the transfer. The \nheir would be listed on the Form 5 as the transferee and an individual heir would be required to submit photographs \nand fingerprints and be subject to a background check. Similarly, if the trust expires upon the death of the grantor, \nthen the trustee, as the administrator of the trust, would file Form 5 to transfer the firearm to the individual named as \nthe beneficiary. Like the heir, the beneficiary would be required to submit photographs and fingerprints and be \nsubject to a background check. Transfers to trusts and legal entities from estates will require that responsible \npersons at those trusts and legal entities identify themselves in the same manner as they would in circumstances \ninvolving a taxable transfer. If there is no beneficiary or the beneficiary does not wish to possess the registered \nfirearm, the trustee would dispose of the property to a person other than a trust beneficiary on an ATF Form 4. If, \nhowever, the trust remains a valid trust after the death of the grantor, the trustee would continue to administer the \ntrust property according to the terms of the trust as there would be no transfer under the NFA.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Background Checks for Responsible Persons</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Seventy-two commenters, including members of a trade organization, stated in a form letter that they agree that \nrequiring fingerprint cards and photographs of all adult applicants or responsible persons of a trust or LLC \nacquiring NFA firearms would ensure that NFA firearms are not acquired by prohibited persons. These same \ncommenters stated that they oppose any expansion of the CLEO requirement. Thirty-six other commenters stated \nin a form letter that by eliminating the CLEO signoff and narrowing the definition of responsible persons, ATF could \nstill require fingerprints and background checks on the person primarily responsible for a legal entity application \nwithout exposing law-abiding citizens to what they consider to be the arbitrary and capricious CLEO signoff ban. \nAnother commenter expressed the belief that the regulations need to be changed to expand the requirements for \nfingerprints and photographs, but only as to one responsible person, not every responsible person who is part of a \ntrust or legal entity. A few other commenters stated that they did not oppose fingerprints, photographs or \nbackground checks of responsible persons, but are opposed to the expansion of the CLEO signoff. Several other \ncommenters, including an owner of a company that manufactures firearms and firearms accessories, an FFL/SOT, \nand employees of an FFL/SOT company, stated that requiring background checks for trust members is \nappropriate, but that ATF should remove the CLEO signature component. Another commenter stated that requiring \nbackground checks, fingerprints, and photographs for responsible persons \u201cis sufficient\u201d and makes more sense \nthan the CLEO certification requirement that nullifies the right to acquire firearms for personal protection. Another \ncommenter stated that he supports background checks, but is unequivocally opposed to the CLEO signoff \nrequirement for any NFA transfer. Another commenter stated that the CLEO requirement is too time consuming and \noutdated, but it is reasonable for people associated with legal entities to be subject to the same fingerprint-based \nbackground checks that individuals go through before they can obtain some of the most dangerous weapons.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department acknowledges support regarding the requirement for responsible persons of trusts or legal \nentities to submit fingerprints and photographs and undergo background checks. The Department agrees that \nresponsible persons of trusts or legal entities should be subject to the same requirements as individuals acquiring \nan NFA firearm.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges comments regarding expansion of the CLEO certification requirement. The \nDepartment has changed the CLEO certification in the proposed rule to a CLEO notification requirement in the final \nrule for all transferees, whether individuals, trusts, or legal entities. See discussion infra in section IV.C.1. The \nDepartment also acknowledges comments regarding those who would be considered a responsible person for a \ntrust or legal entity. The Department has changed the definition of responsible person to provide that responsible \npersons are generally those individuals in the organization who have the power and authority to direct the \nmanagement and policies of the entity insofar as they pertain to firearms.\n\n <h4>\n\n  B. Comments Generally Opposing the Rule</h4>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters disagreed with all proposed changes without providing any specifics. The majority of \ncommenters who were opposed to the proposed rule provided specific reasons as discussed below.\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. Current Regulations Are Sufficient</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that there are already stringent Federal regulations in place for the firearms covered by \nthe proposed rule; for example, prohibited persons who receive or possess an NFA firearm through a legal entity \nare already violating current laws. A few commenters stated that these existing laws work, as shown by ATF's \nexamples in the proposed rule. A few commenters objected to any additional firearm regulations.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that this rule only creates more \u201cred tape\u201d for lawful citizens. Another commenter \nbelieved that the \u201cfilings\u201d for corporations, trusts, and legal entities already identify a legally responsible person, \nand, as a result, maintained that the burdens of the proposed rule outweighed its benefits. Another commenter \nargued that a corporation or a trust was not a person, and should not be treated as one.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that there are existing Federal laws and regulations that pertain to NFA firearms \nand firearms more generally. Requiring background checks for responsible persons of trusts and legal entities \nhelps to enforce those laws by keeping firearms out of the hands of persons who are prohibited from possessing \nthem. The efficacy of background checks is evident in the statistics. The most recent statistics released by the \nDepartment of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, reflect that through the end of December 2012, background \nchecks run through the NICS by either the FBI or State point-of-contact agencies resulted in about 2.4 million \ndenials. See Karberg, Frandsen & Durso, Background Checks for Firearms Transfers, 2012\u2014Statistical Tables, at \n1 (December 2014). And given that there is not an abundant number of NFA firearms readily accessible without \ngoing through the transfer process, background checks in this area should be expected to be highly effective in \nkeeping NFA weapons out of the hands of those prohibited by law from possessing them.\n\n \n\n\n\n  In addition, requiring background checks for responsible persons of trusts and legal entities conforms the \nrequirements applicable to those entities to those that apply to individuals. It also maintains consistency with the \nway ATF processes applications for Federal firearms licenses, where responsible persons for legal entities are \nsubject to background checks. See 27 CFR 478.47(b)(2).\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Allegations That the Proposed Changes Were Motivated by Politics</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated their view that this rulemaking is motivated by politics and not driven by legitimate \nconcerns. Some argued that the proposal was an executive \u201coverreach,\u201d represented an \u201cend run\u201d around \nCongress, and was beyond the scope of ATF's regulatory authority. Some commenters expressed concern that the \nproposed regulation was intended to disarm law abiding citizens.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that the regulation of firearms provokes strong feelings on all sides and that any \nform of firearm regulation is often a topic of substantial debate. The Department initiated this rulemaking after ATF \nreceived a petition from the NFATCA, a non-profit association. ATF agreed with the petitioner that by not requiring \nbackground checks for trusts and legal entities, the existing regulations created the potential for abuse. The \ngoal\u2014as stated in both the proposed rule and here\u2014is to ensure that the rules regarding NFA applications that \napply to individuals apply equally to trusts and corporate entities. By ensuring background checks are run on \ncertain persons who may have access to NFA weapons, the rule is intended to help enhance public safety. Put \nsimply, this rule will not prevent a person who can lawfully possess firearms from receiving or possessing NFA \nfirearms; it was designed to prevent persons who are prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms from \nobtaining them through the use of trusts or legal entities not currently subject to the same procedures applicable to \nindividuals. The rule will not disarm law abiding citizens. However, it will help ensure that persons who are \nprohibited by law from possessing firearms are not able to acquire them.\n\n \n\n  The Department also does not agree that the rule is outside of ATF's authority. ATF has regulated the \ncircumstances under which NFA firearms are manufactured, transferred, and acquired for decades. This authority is \nbased upon the authority to implement the law that Congress has both expressly and implicitly delegated to the \nDepartment. Specifically, the authority to implement the regulations requiring a CLEO certification have withstood \nchallenge. See Lomont v. O'Neill, 285 F.3d 9 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The Court, in upholding the CLEO certification \nrequirement, noted that sections 5812 and 5822 of the NFA give \u201cthe Secretary broad authority to promulgate \nregulations governing application forms, including regulations pertaining to the identification of the transferee, the \ntransferor and the firearm,\u201d and \u201cbroad authority over the form of applications for permission to make firearms.\u201d Id. \nat 16. Similarly, in upholding ATF's authority to make destructive device determinations, another court noted that \nCongress may lawfully leave \u201ca certain degree of discretion to executive or judicial actors.\u201d The court noted that \nATF acted lawfully in implementing the statutory definition, utilizing the authority delegated to it by Congress and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. Demko v. United States, 216 F.3d 1049, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Such authority was \nalso recognized when, in construing the Gun Control Act (GCA), a court found that the Secretary of the Treasury \nwas authorized to promulgate regulations to facilitate its enforcement. This responsibility was delegated within the \nDepartment of the Treasury to ATF. National Rifle Ass'n v. Brady, 914 F.2d 475, 477 (4th Cir. 1990).\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Changes Are Not Necessary if Current Regulations Are Enforced</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that it is not necessary for the Department to add additional rules and that the current \nrules are sufficient to ensure NFA firearms are not acquired by unauthorized individuals. Many commenters felt that \nthe proposed rule fails to address crime, and instead simply makes it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to legally \nobtain NFA registered firearms. Many commenters stated that someone who wishes to obtain a firearm for criminal \npurposes would not go through the NFA application process for a legal entity, a process that entails expense and \nefforts to register such firearms with the Federal Government.\n\n \n\n  One commenter noted that the proposed rule would alter the timing of the background check, and asserted that \nthe timing would have a negative effect on safety. Currently, background checks are performed at the time the \nweapon is physically transferred; the proposed change would require the background check be performed at the \nbeginning of the application process. This commenter stated that it currently takes transfer applications a year for \napproval, and with the proposed change, any arrests, convictions, or restraining orders that occur during this year \nwould not be discovered and restricted persons could potentially obtain possession of the NFA items. Several \ncommenters questioned why it takes ATF months to approve NFA applications if it does not currently run checks \non trusts and legal entities.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that there is no \u201cloophole\u201d to close, arguing that nothing in the current system allows \nfelons or otherwise prohibited persons to possess NFA items through trusts, corporations, or individually. Several \ncommenters further added that their trust was constructed in a manner such that prohibited persons may not have \na role in the trust. Other commenters noted existing requirements that the person picking up the NFA item must still \nfill out ATF Form 4473, Firearms Transaction Record, and pass the required NICS background checks at the point \nof sale before taking possession. Other commenters noted generally that it is already illegal to let unauthorized \npersons be in possession of firearms and NFA items. Others stated specifically that an individual who takes \npossession (i.e., the responsible person), is prohibited by State and Federal law from transferring or making that \nweapon available to anyone with a firearm restriction. In addition, a few commenters stated that there is not an \n\u201cunderground black-market conspiracy\u201d or \u201cunderworld entity\u201d circumventing NFA gun laws by using trusts. Several \ncommenters stated that trusts are used by law-abiding citizens to prevent unintentional illegal transfers; people \ncreating an NFA trust are not trying to game or cheat the system or pass through a loophole.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters noted that ATF's three examples provided in the proposed rule fail to illustrate that there is a \nproblem to be solved (i.e., that a prohibited person ever gained actual possession of an NFA firearm by virtue of an \nassociation with a legal entity, much less committed a crime with that weapon). Those same commenters also \nobserved that these three examples just as strongly argue that prohibitions and safeguards, under current law, are \nentirely sufficient. A few of these commenters asked ATF for access to the details of the three situations and stated \nthat without such access, there are many unanswered questions and no evidence of any problem that existing law \ndoes not address.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters requested ATF to leave the current regulations in place. Instead of proposing new rules and \nregulations, many commenters asked ATF to enforce the rules, laws, and penalties already on the books, and \nnoted the small number of prosecutions resulting from NICS denials. A few of these commenters also requested \nthat ATF give longer sentences and harsher penalties to those who break the rules. Another commenter noted that \nthe current regulations are unenforceable due to an already \u201cover-taxed and under-funded and under-staffed \nsystem.\u201d Another commenter stated that ATF makes so many \u201cgun laws\u201d that the public cannot possibly understand \nthem, and asked how ATF proposes to enforce them.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  While the Department acknowledges that most individuals who apply to register and transfer an NFA firearm are \nnot prohibited from possessing or receiving firearms, there have been a significant number of instances in which \nprohibited persons have submitted NFA applications. Information received from the ATF NFA Branch disclosed that \nfrom 2010 to 2014 there were approximately 270 NFA applications by individuals, out of 115,842 applications, that \nwere disapproved due to background check denials. The NFA Branch also tracked the number of applications \nreceived from trusts and legal entities during the same period. The Department believes that the disapprovals would \nhave been higher if background checks would have been conducted on responsible persons associated with the \n217,996 applications received from trusts or legal entities during this time. This belief is based on the FBI's denial \nrate on NICS background checks between November 30, 1998, and December 31, 2014, which is approximately \n1.24 percent. Additionally, the Department believes that the background check requirement has an important \ndeterrent effect as a prohibited person would be less likely to try and acquire an NFA firearm knowing that the \nperson would be subject to a background check.\n\n \n\n  As a result of the increased use of trusts or legal entities to acquire NFA firearms, the number of qualifying \nfirearms acquired without a background check has greatly increased. Between 2004 and 2014, the number of \nNFA applications received from trusts or legal entities increased from 1,938 to 90,726. In 2013 and 2014, ATF \nreceived a combined total of 162,759 applications from trusts or legal entities.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree that the proposed regulations are unnecessary. Background checks required \nunder the Brady Act (18 U.S.C. 922(t) and 27 CFR 478.102), as part of the licensing process (18 U.S.C. \n923(d)(1)(B) and 27 CFR 478.47(b)(2)), and the application process for individuals submitting applications to make \nor receive an NFA firearm (26 U.S.C. 5812 and 5822, 27 CFR 479.63 and 479.85) are in place to prevent \nprohibited persons from unlawfully acquiring firearms. The proposed rule is similarly intended to prevent prohibited \npersons from acquiring firearms by closing down an avenue that can be exploited.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that there is a backlog of NFA applications, and notes that the backlog has \ndecreased over the last year. ATF processes applications as quickly as its resources allow.\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with the commenters that the existing laws should be enforced, and the Department is \ncommitted to focusing its limited prosecutorial resources on the most significant violent crime problems facing our \ncommunities. That said, enforcement must be paired with common-sense regulatory efforts to help limit access to \nfirearms by persons prohibited from possessing them. This rule is intended to do just that.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that the person picking up the NFA item must still fill out ATF Form 4473, Firearms \nTransaction Record, and pass a NICS background check at the point of sale before taking possession. Such a \nbackground check on the person picking up the firearm would verify that that individual is not a prohibited person, \nbut it would not verify that other people who are responsible persons of a trust or legal entity are not prohibited.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not regard time-of-transfer background checks as sufficient to comply with the transfer \nprovision of the NFA. The Department interprets that provision to require that background checks precede the \ntransfer of NFA firearms. Specifically, the statute provides that a firearm \u201cshall not be transferred unless\u201d the \nSecretary has approved the application, and that an application \u201cshall be denied if the transfer, receipt, or \npossession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of law.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 5812(a). The Department \nconstrues that language to mean that background checks for individuals and responsible persons must be \n\n\n\nconducted before the application is approved. Additionally, this provision requires that an individual's \u201cidentification \nmust include his fingerprints and his photograph.\u201d Id. A NICS background check does not satisfy the statute's \nbiometric language (fingerprint cards) requirement. The submission of fingerprints allows a more robust check of \ncriminal history databases and provides a means of eliminating false negative and false positive matches. For \nexample, the relevant individual may have a disqualifying criminal record under another name.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree that the proposed rule would alter the timing of the background check. \nBackground checks under the statute's transfer provision are not currently performed at the time the weapon is \nphysically transferred, as the commenter suggested. Rather, background checks are currently performed before \nan application is approved and will continue to be performed in the same manner. With respect to the commenter's \nconcern that delay in processing applications might mean that an individual will become a prohibited person while \nawaiting a background check, the agency has two responses. First, because nothing about the Department's \nmethod of processing applications will change because of this rule, the Department believes the commenter's \nconcern is outside the scope of this rulemaking. Second, processing times for applications reflect the delay between \nthe time the application is received by the NFA Branch and the time the application is entered into the NFRTR and \nprocessed. As the background check is not conducted until after the information is entered into the NFRTR, any \nprohibitions that may have occurred after the applicant mailed the application will be disclosed when the \nbackground check is conducted.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Criminal Activity Assertions Are Not True</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. The NFA and Impact on Crime</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that these restrictions will not reduce crime and questioned whether violent crimes have \nbeen committed with registered NFA items, or by responsible persons of a trust or legal entity. Several commenters \nasked if ATF could provide the statistics demonstrating the need for the regulations and direct link between the \nproposed rule and enhanced public safety.\n\n \n\n  Many other commenters observed that NFA items are expensive, already heavily regulated, and \u201cvirtually unheard \nof\u201d in the hands of criminals. Although commenters disagreed on the number of crimes they believe have been \ncommitted with registered NFA weapons, those addressing the subject agreed that the number was small, and \nargued that the proposed rule would accordingly have little to no effect on public safety.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department disagrees that it must show a direct link between the proposed rule and enhanced public safety. \nCongress has directed the Department to ensure that individuals who are prohibited from possessing NFA firearms \ndo not obtain them, even if those individuals have no intention of using them in an unlawful manner. See 26 U.S.C. \n5812(a) (\u201cApplications shall be denied if the transfer, receipt, or possession of the firearm would place the \ntransferee in violation of law\u201d); 26 U.S.C. 5822 (\u201cApplications shall be denied if the making or possession of the \nfirearm would place the person making the firearm in violation of law.\u201d). The Department regards the appropriate \nquestion to be whether the rule will better ensure that prohibited individuals do not unlawfully possess NFA \nfirearms, not whether individuals who possess firearms are likely to use them to commit crimes.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Additionally, the Department notes that some individuals who own NFA firearms do in fact commit crimes. A \nreview of trace data and criminal records from 2006 to 2014 disclosed twelve incidents in which owners of NFA \nfirearms were convicted of crimes; however, there is no evidence that these crimes were committed with NFA \nfirearms. Convictions include attempted homicide, conspiracy to commit felony offenses of firearms laws, operating \na drug involved premises, possession of unlawful firearms, possession of marijuana, intent to distribute \nmethamphetamine, possession of a firearm during commission of drug trafficking, domestic violence, theft, dealing \nfirearms without a license, and possession of an unregistered NFA firearm.\n\n \n\n  In one instance the purchaser was arrested 9 days after the purchase of the firearm. In another instance the \npurchaser was arrested within 3 months of the purchase of the firearm. Both purchasers were convicted of drug \nrelated charges.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that the majority of firearms traced are handguns. However, between 2006 and \n2013, local or Federal law enforcement recovered and ATF traced 5,916 NFA firearms. ATF is authorized to trace a \nfirearm for a law enforcement agency involved in a bona fide criminal investigation. There were also at least seven \ninstances in which the possessor of the firearm at the time it was traced was not the person it was registered to in \nthe NFRTR. Under Federal law, possession of an NFA firearm by a person to whom it is not registered is unlawful \n(26 U.S.C. 5861(d)).\n\n \n\n  The Department also emphasizes that NFA weapons are dangerous weapons that can empower a single \nindividual to take many lives in a single incident. Therefore, a low incidence of the use of NFA firearms in crimes \ndoes not reflect the threat to public safety that they pose. A low usage of NFA firearms in crime may also bespeak \nthe success of the NFA in preventing such weapons from reaching the hands of prohibited persons in the past. The \nlarge increase in transfers in which no background check takes place, however, increases the risk that NFA \nfirearms will reach prohibited persons. The Department does not believe it is reasonable to wait for an NFA firearm \nto be used in a significant criminal incident before crafting procedures reasonably calculated to carry out its \nregulatory mandate to prevent prohibited persons from obtaining NFA firearms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. The NFA and Associated Background Checks for Transactions Involving a Trust or Legal Entity</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule is misleading because it suggests that there are no background \nchecks currently required for trusts or legal entities when, in fact, the person who picks up an NFA item from a \nlicensed dealer on behalf of a trust or legal entity must complete a Form 4473 and undergo an individual NICS \nbackground check prior to taking possession of the NFA item. Some of these commenters provided specific \nlanguage from ATF's NFA Handbook as support for their point.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that ATF procedures currently require that FFLs run a background check on any \nperson picking up a firearm on behalf of a trust or legal entity. However, this ensures only that the direct recipient \nfrom the FFL is not a prohibited person. It does not verify the status of the other responsible persons associated \nwith a trust or legal entity who will have access to the firearm. Thus, this rule will help ensure that many persons \nwith access to the firearm are neither prohibited possessors nor otherwise ineligible for such access. With the \n\n\n\nimplementation of the rule, responsible persons for trusts and legal entities will undergo a background check as \npart of the application process. Therefore, a responsible person will not have to undergo a background check at \nthe time of the transfer from the FFL.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Individuals Do Not Create Trusts or Legal Entities to Avoid Background Checks</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule mistakenly contends that individuals create trusts or legal entities \nsolely to avoid background checks when acquiring NFA items. These commenters offered other valid reasons \n(e.g., for estate planning; to comply with laws and regulations associated with the NFA, especially by preventing \naccusations or criminal charges involving constructive possession; as the only available mechanism for acquiring \nNFA items for individuals who reside in a locale where CLEO certification is unobtainable).\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department is unable to assess the reason(s) for the recent exponential growth in the use of trusts, in \nparticular, to acquire NFA firearms, and the proposed rule made no claim about the extent to which such trusts are \nbeing used predominantly to circumvent the background check requirement for individuals, as opposed to for \nother reasons. But the use of trusts has grown exponentially, and as a result so have the number of persons \ngaining access to NFA firearms without undergoing a background check. Regardless of their motive, the \nDepartment does not believe that responsible persons of trusts or legal entities should be excluded from the \nbackground check and other requirements that seek to ensure prohibited persons do not gain access to NFA \nfirearms.\n\n \n\n  Additionally, the Department notes that it believes that even if individuals are not frequently exploiting the potential \nloophole in the statute, the existence of the loophole invites future exploitation. The Department regards it as wise \nto close the loophole to eliminate the opportunity for future evasion of the individual background check \nrequirement, even if the tactic has not yet come into common use.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Rule Differs From NFATCA Petition</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Some commenters noted that NFATCA's petition asked ATF to amend \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85 to, among other \nthings, require photographs and fingerprints of persons responsible for directing the legal entity, eliminate the \nrequirement for CLEO approval of Forms 1 and 4 for natural persons, and require notification to CLEOs for all Form \n1 and Form 4 applicants. One commenter noted that the proposed rule differed from the petitioner's request by \nadding CLEO certification requirements, not removing them. Another commenter observed that the proposed rule \ndid largely what the petitioner requested by expanding requirements for all responsible persons involved with \ncorporations and trusts; however, the proposed rule lessened\u2014but did not entirely eliminate\u2014CLEO certification \nrequirements. Several commenters referenced NFATCA's letter, dated August 31, 2013, in which NFATCA said \nthat it supports the elimination of the CLEO certification requirement, but does not support the proposed rule in its \ncurrent form. The NFATCA letter states, in part, that \u201c[t]he Executive Branch proposals unduly burden the law-\n\n\n\nabiding public, will restrain lawful commerce and bury an already overwhelmed agency with an administrative \ninfrastructure that will not serve the public safety interest.\u201d\n\n \n\n  NFATCA also submitted a public comment to the rulemaking, stating that the proposed rule bears little \nresemblance to its petition, or to changes that NFATCA discussed with ATF and that were published in \u201cATF's \nUnified Agenda repeatedly over the past several years\u201d\u2009 (3)  for Regulation Identification Number (RIN) 1140-AA43.\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that in proposing to extend CLEO certification rather than notification \nrequirements, and not eliminating all CLEO involvement, the proposed rule differed not only from material contained \nin the published abstracts of RIN 1140-AA43 in the 2011 and 2012 Unified Agendas, but also from what the petition \nrequested. See supra note 3. However, the Department notes that the intent of the Unified Agenda is to provide \ndata on regulatory and deregulatory activities under development throughout the Federal Government. The \nactivities included in individual agency agendas are primarily those currently planned to have a proposed rule or a \nfinal rule issued within the next 12 months. This does not mean that ATF, or any other agency, cannot change the \ndirection of a proposed rulemaking if circumstances warrant. In addition, when ATF issued the proposed rule, ATF \nbelieved that the proposed requirements to extend CLEO certification would enhance public safety without overly \nburdening the public. However as is discussed infra in section IV.C.1, the Department has reassessed the need for \nCLEO certification and has implemented a new approach that focuses on notifying CLEOs, and requires \nresponsible persons of a trust or legal entity to submit fingerprint cards and undergo a background check. See \nsection IV.C.1 for discussion of the reasons for this change.\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees that a change from a CLEO certification to CLEO notification will require a change to the \nForms 1, 4, and 5. See section IV.C.1 for further discussion.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Constitutional and Statutory Arguments</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Violates the Second Amendment</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Hundreds of commenters stated that the proposed rule violated and infringed their Second Amendment rights. \nMany commenters stated the proposed rule further eroded and encroached on such rights as they believe that the \nNFA\u2014with some also adding the GCA\u2014is unconstitutional and already unconstitutionally infringes the rights \nprotected by the Second Amendment. Many commenters referenced the Supreme Court's decision in District of \nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), which found that the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2014not a \ncollective\u2014right to keep and bear firearms.\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters specifically connected the perceived Second Amendment infringement to the CLEO \ncertification requirement, as some CLEOs are represented as being unwilling to sign off on applications, regardless \nof the applicant's background, or the legality of the NFA item in the applicant's jurisdiction. See infra section \nIV.C.1.c for a detailed discussion of this issue. These same commenters pointed out that the proposed rule, by \nextending the CLEO certification requirement to responsible persons of trusts or corporations and legal entities, \n\n\n\nremoves the \u201cgun trust\u201d option, which does not require CLEO certification and thereby effectively bans law abiding \ncitizens from exercising their Second Amendment rights, i.e., constitutes a de facto ban.\n\n \n\n  A commenter focused particularly on silencers, which are included in the definition of firearm under the NFA. 26 \nU.S.C. 5845(a). This commenter provided data showing the benefits of silencers (e.g., hearing protection), and that \nthe situation is different from when the NFA was enacted\u2014that is, silencers are no longer dangerous or unusual \nand are typically possessed by law-abiding citizens\u2014and accordingly, merit constitutional protection under the \nSecond Amendment. This commenter stated that 39 States permit private citizens to own and possess silencers, \nand more than 30 States permit their use in some form of hunting. This same commenter argued that short-\nbarreled shotguns (SBSs), short-barreled rifles (SBRs), and any other weapons (AOWs) should not be controlled \nunder the NFA because they are no more dangerous than conventional shotguns and rifles, they are commonly \nused by law enforcement and the military, and are favorably suited for law-abiding citizens to use in self-defense.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department notes that the NFA regulates weapons such as machineguns, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled \nshotguns, silencers, destructive devices, which include such items as grenade launchers, as well as firearms \nmeeting the definition of \u201cany other weapon,\u201d which include disguised devices such as penguns, cigarette lighter \nguns, knife guns, cane guns and umbrella guns. See 26 U.S.C. 5845.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not believe that the proposed regulation violates, erodes, or otherwise infringes any rights \nprotected by the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court and several Courts of Appeal have recognized, \u201cthe right \nto keep and bear arms has never been unlimited.\u201d Nat'l Rifle Ass'n (NRA) v. ATF, 700 F.3d 185, 200 (5th Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 626). The Supreme Court noted explicitly in Heller that the Second Amendment did not \nextend to \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d not in \u201ccommon use.\u201d 554 U.S. at 627; see also United States v. \nMiller, 307 U.S. 174, 178-79 (1939) (regarding short-barreled shotguns). Courts of Appeals have consistently found \nNFA weapons to be \u201cdangerous and unusual.\u201d See United States v. Henry, 688 F.3d 637, 640 (9th Cir. 2012); \nHeller v. District of Columbia (\u201cHeller II\u201d), 670 F.3d 1244, 1263 (D.C. Cir. 2011); United States v. Marzzarella, 614 \nF.3d 85, 94 (3d Cir. 2010); Hamblen v. United States, 591 F.3d 471, 473-74 (6th Cir. 2009); United States v. Tagg, \n572 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir. 2009); United States v. Fincher, 538 F.3d 868, 874 (8th Cir. 2008). Moreover, even \nif one assumes that NFA weapons are of the type protected by the Second Amendment, the Department believes \nthat NFA statutory requirements imposed on the these weapons would be considered longstanding presumptively \nlawful regulations or restrictions and permissible under the Second Amendment given the Supreme Court's rulings \nin Heller, 554 U.S. 570, and Miller, 307 U.S. 174, and circuit court rulings, such as in NRA, 700 F.3d 185. Finally, \neven if the NFA's statutory requirements\u2014or the requirements imposed by this regulation\u2014are not considered \nlongstanding, the Department believes that they would withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n \n\n  The Department's position is that the Second Amendment, properly construed, allows for reasonable regulation of \nfirearms. Heller emphasized the importance of \u201cprohibiting the carrying of `dangerous and unusual weapons'\u2009\u201d in \ndefining the limitation on the Second Amendment right, explaining that the Second Amendment would not prevent \nthe ban of the \u201cweapons that are most useful in military service\u2014M-16 rifles and the like. . . .\u201d Heller, 554 U.S. at \n627; id. at 627-28.\n\n \n\n  In addition, although the Court did not purport to define the full scope of the Second Amendment right in Heller, \nthe Court did consider United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, which \u201cupheld against a Second Amendment challenge \ntwo men's federal indictment for transporting an unregistered short-barreled shotgun in interstate commerce, in \nviolation of the National Firearms Act.\u201d Heller, 554 U.S. at 621-22 (citation omitted). Heller explained that the Miller \n\n\n\nCourt's \u201cbasis for saying that the Second Amendment did not apply\u201d was that the type of weapon at issue was not \neligible for Second Amendment protection.\n\n \n\n  In the absence of any evidence tending to show that the possession or use of a [short-barreled shotgun] at this \ntime has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, we cannot say \nthat the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly . . . it is not within \njudicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the \ncommon defense.\n\n \n\n  Id. at 622 (quoting Miller, 307 U.S. at 178) (emphasis in Heller). Of particular importance to this rulemaking, the \nHeller Court further stated:\n\n \n\n  We may as well consider at this point (for we will have to consider eventually) what types of weapons Miller \npermits. Read in isolation, Miller' s phrase \u201cpart of ordinary military equipment\u201d could mean that only those weapons \nuseful in warfare are protected. That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the \nNational Firearms Act's restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, \nmachineguns being useful in warfare in 1939. We think that Miller' s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must \nbe read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were \nexpected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d The \ntraditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like \nself-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolutionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons \nused in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d Indeed, that is precisely the way in which the \nSecond Amendment's operative clause furthers the purpose announced in its preface. We therefore read Miller to \nsay only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding \ncitizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\n\n \n\n  Id. at 624-25 (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Heller thus explicitly recognized an \n\u201cimportant limitation on the right to keep and carry arms . . . the sorts of weapons protected [are] those `in common \nuse at the time.'\u2009\u201d Id. at 627 (quoting Miller, 307 U.S. at 179).\n \n\n  In NRA, the Fifth Circuit acknowledged Heller' s \u201cnon-exhaustive list\u201d of \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory \nmeasures,\u201d 700 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing 554 U.S. at 626-27). The Fifth Circuit held that firearm \nrestrictions that are longstanding, like the NFA, are not likely to burden a person's rights under the Second \nAmendment. See id. at 196; see also Heller II, 670 F.3d at 1253 (\u201c[A] regulation that is `longstanding,' which \nnecessarily means it has long been accepted by the public, is not likely to burden a constitutional right; \nconcomitantly the activities covered by a longstanding regulation are presumptively not protected from regulation by \nthe Second Amendment.\u201d).\n\n \n\n  Like the restrictions on machineguns, the Department believes that other longstanding Federal restrictions on \nmaking and transferring SBSs, SBRs, silencers, and AOWs are \u201cfirmly historically rooted\u201d and will not burden \nSecond Amendment rights given the Court's holding in Heller regarding presumptively lawful regulatory measures. \nSee NRA, 700 F.3d at 204; United States v. One Palmetto State Amory PA-15 Machinegun, No. 15-2202, 2015 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 95302 (E.D. Penn. 2015) (holding that the Second Amendment does not create a right to possess \na machinegun), and Hollis v. Lynch, No. 3:14-CV-03872-M, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103656 (N.D. Tex. 2015) \n(holding that the Second Amendment does not create a right to make machineguns).\n\n\n\n \n\n  Finally, even if a court were to conclude that the NFA and its implementing regulations are not \u201cpresumptively \nlawful,\u201d they would nevertheless pass constitutional muster under existing Second Amendment jurisprudence. The \nNFA and this final rule are not a ban on NFA items, as some commenters suggest. Rather they are reasonable \nregulations on the possession of such weapons that the Department believes are consistent with the Second \nAmendment.\n\n \n\n  In response to those commenters who seek the repeal of the NFA and a different treatment for certain NFA \nweapons, like silencers, the Department cannot repeal the NFA, nor can it choose to ignore provisions of the act for \ncertain weapons, or minimize the burden of the statutory language for certain weapons, such as, silencers, SBSs, \nSBRs, and AOWs. The statute neither requires nor is best read as permitting disparate treatments of NFA firearms \nin the manner suggested by the comments.\n\n \n\n  Assuming, arguendo, that silencers are within the protection of the Second Amendment in the first place, they do \nnot qualify for heightened Second Amendment protection. To the contrary, silencers were included in the original \ndraft of the NFA in 1934, and have a long regulatory history. See United States v. Gonzales, No. 2:10-CR-00967 \nCW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127121 (D. Utah 2011) (describing legislative history surrounding 1934 enactment of \nthe NFA). Because silencers, SBSs, and SBRs are statutorily defined as NFA firearms, they are regulated in the \nsame manner as the other NFA weapons.\n\n \n\n  Although the CLEO certification process has been upheld by courts as a reasonable regulation (see, e.g., Lomont, \n285 F.3d 9), the Department is not requiring such a certification in this final rule. Instead, the final rule contains a \nCLEO notification provision, requiring applicants to provide notification to the CLEO. Thus, the concern expressed \nby many commenters that the CLEO certification provision in the rulemaking will effectively ban the transfer and \nmaking of NFA weapons is moot; likewise, commenters' concerns about the alleged arbitrary and capricious nature \nof the CLEO certification process in some jurisdictions are also moot.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Violates the Fourth Amendment</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  One commenter stated that the wait time for ATF to approve NFA transfers is excessive, and that the proposed \nrule imposes additional restrictions. The commenter stated that these restrictions deprive him of the use of his \nlegally obtained property, and violate the Fourth Amendment as they are a \u201cde facto seizure.\u201d Another commenter \nprovided an example in which a county sheriff publicly stated that he would possibly provide CLEO certification, on \nthe condition that the applicant \u201cpass a background check\u201d and \u201callow the Sheriffs (sic) Department to inspect the \nhome where the weapon will be stored.\u201d This commenter stated that this \u201csafety inspection\u201d blatantly violated the \nFourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that the law provides that applicants do not have a property interest in the NFA firearm \nsought during the application period. Therefore, an NFA firearm is not the property of a transferee until the \ntransferor receives a properly approved NFA Form 4.\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department takes the view that individuals, trusts, and legal entities do not obtain a property interest in an \nNFA firearm until the Department has approved an application to make or transfer one. A \u201cprotected property \ninterest simply `cannot arise in an area voluntarily entered into . . . which, from the start, is subject to pervasive \nGovernment control.'\u2009\u201d Dennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 272 (5th Cir. 2012); see also \nHearts Bluff Game Ranch, Inc. v. United States, 669 F.3d 1326, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (same). In light of the \ncomprehensive scope of Federal firearms regulation, the NFA and GCA delineate such an area of pervasive control \nwhen it comes to the acquisition or manufacture of such firearms. See Mitchell Arms, Inc. v. United States, 7 F.3d \n212, 216 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Moreover, several courts have held that a property interest is lacking where the alleged \nproperty is not accompanied by the \u201ccrucial indicia of property rights,\u201d such as the right to assign, sell, or transfer \nthe property at issue. Gonzalez v. NOAA, 695 F. Supp. 2d 474, 504 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (finding no legally cognizable \nproperty interest in Federal shrimping permits); see also Melancon, 703 F.3d at 269 (describing these indicia as \n\u201cthe right to possess, use, and dispose\u201d); Hearts Bluff Game Ranch, 669 F.3d at 1330 (identifying \u201cthe ability to sell, \nassign, transfer, or exclude\u201d as the crucial indicia of a property right). Because the statutory language in the NFA \nmakes it clear that applicants do not have the right to make or transfer an NFA firearm until a properly approved \nForm 1 or 4 is issued, the applicant does not have a property interest in the NFA firearm until a properly approved \nForm 1 or 4 is issued. See 26 U.S.C. 5812 and 5822. See Hollis, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103656 (holding \u201cthat \nPlaintiff had no property interest in either the machine gun or the erroneous approval of the Form 1 application\u201d).\n\n \n\n  The Department therefore disagrees that delaying or preventing the transfer of an NFA firearm constitutes a \n\u201cseizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. As explained above, individuals, trusts, and legal entities do not have a \nproperty interest in an NFA firearm until a properly approved Form 1 or 4 is issued. They therefore lack standing to \nassert a Fourth Amendment claim because they cannot assert \u201can interest in the property seized.\u201d Rakas v. Illinois, \n439 U.S. 128, 148 (1978).\n\n \n\n  As to the comment regarding the home inspection that one CLEO purportedly required of citizens before granting \na CLEO certification, the Department notes that the final rule will not include a CLEO certification requirement so \nthere will be no further need to consent to such home inspections. Instead, the final rule will contain a CLEO \nnotification provision, which should ease commenters' concerns.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Violates the Fifth Amendment</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. Due Process Clause</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters expressed a concern that local CLEOs would refuse to certify applications for little or no \nreason, amounting to a violation of due process under the Fifth Amendment. Several commenters also stated that \napplicants primarily use \u201cgun trusts\u201d due to their CLEOs' arbitrary and capricious refusal to provide certification, \nand expressed concern that the proposal essentially removes this option.\n\n \n\n  In addition, a few commenters noted that Federal appellate courts have recognized the validity of trusts \nestablished with a prohibited person as the settlor, which allows the prohibited person to maintain the prohibited \nperson's \u201cownership\u201d interest in the property while surrendering the prohibited person's right to the \u201cpossessory\u201d \ninterest to a trustee, see United States v. Zaleski, 686 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2012); United States v. Miller, 588 F.3d \n418, 419-20 (7th Cir. 2009); Cooper v. City of Greenwood, 904 F.2d 302, 305-06 (5th Cir. 1990). One of these \ncommenters also stated that trusts provide a well-established method to maintain regulatory compliance without \nexercising possession, and provided the common example of beneficiaries who are minors. This commenter \n\n\n\npredicted that the proposed rule, if finalized, would most certainly be challenged as a \u201ctaking\u201d under the Fifth \nAmendment.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that most of the commenters' concerns are addressed with the change from CLEO \ncertification to CLEO notification. Moreover, this rule does not eliminate or significantly burden the use of trusts or \nlegal entities by persons who may wish to employ them as part of the NFA firearm acquisition process.\n\n \n\n  The Department disagrees with commenters asserting that the proposed regulations would lead to a violation of \nan applicant's due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Recently, at least two courts considered whether a \ndenied NFA applicant had a property interest in the denied Form 1 application or in the NFA weapons he sought to \nmake. Both district courts ruled that the applicant had no property interest in the ATF Form 1 or firearm at issue. \nHollis, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103656; and One Palmetto State Armory PA-15 Machinegun, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n95302.\n\n \n\n  Procedural due process challenges must demonstrate that the \u201c\u2009`state has deprived a person of a liberty or \nproperty interest.'\u2009\u201d Wilson v. Birnberg, 667 F.3d 591, 601 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Welch v. Thompson, 20 F.3d 636, \n639 (5th Cir. 1994)). If it has, then the Court \u201cmust determine whether the procedures relative to that deprivation \nwere constitutionally sufficient.\u201d Id. As explained in the preceding section regarding whether this rule will effect a \n\u201cseizure\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment, individuals do not have a property interest in an NFA firearm until a \nproperly approved Form 1 or 4 is issued.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, most, if not all, NFA applicants who will be impacted by the proposed change in the definition of a \n\u201cperson,\u201d which requires \u201cresponsible persons\u201d for a trust or legal entity to undergo a background check, will have \nno legally cognizable property interest in either the NFA firearm sought or the NFA application form. Several courts \nhave held that a property interest is lacking where the alleged property is not accompanied by the \u201ccrucial indicia of \nproperty rights,\u201d such as the right to assign, sell, or transfer the property at issue. Gonzalez v. NOAA, 695 F. Supp. \n2d at 504 (finding no legally cognizable property interest in Federal shrimping permits). Further, the fact that it is \nunlawful to possess a firearm before ATF approves the relevant form reinforces the Department's conclusion that \nthere is no property interest in such firearms until such forms are properly issued. See Hollis, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n103656.\n\n \n\n  As for the comments expressing concerns about protecting the property interest of minors, the proposed \nregulation will allow trusts to possess the NFA weapon until the minor comes of age. Once the minor is of age, the \nminor can then complete the transfer application and background check and, if not otherwise prohibited from \npossessing an NFA firearm, take possession of the NFA weapon. The only change the rule makes is that it requires \nthat responsible persons in trusts undergo background checks and not be prohibited persons. If anything, \ntherefore, the rule will provide trust beneficiaries with an added measure of protection by ensuring that trust \nproperty is held in the hands of a law-abiding person who is not prohibited from possessing firearms under Federal \nor State law.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, to the extent that courts have recognized a felon's ability to employ a trust or other device to maintain \nan ownership interest, so long as there is no ability to physically possess or control the firearm, those cases have \nno application here. Trust beneficiaries who cannot physically possess or control firearms held in trust for them will \n\n\n\nnot typically be responsible persons under the rule. Additionally, this rule pertains to the acquisition of a firearm, not \nthe disposition of a firearm already owned by someone who later becomes prohibited.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Self-Incrimination</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Fifth Amendment provides a right against self-incrimination, which permits an individual to refuse to disclose \ninformation that could be used against such individual in a criminal prosecution. One commenter argued that a \ncriminal who desired to obtain an NFA weapon would not go through the appropriate routes of submitting to ATF \nthe required forms, paying the associated tax, and waiting for the forms to be approved. This commenter cited case \nlaw, Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968), as support for the proposition that felons and other prohibited \nindividuals are not required to register NFA weapons due to the Fifth Amendment and self-incrimination.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  This comment has no relevance to the rule. Haynes does not stand for the proposition that a felon is entitled to \nobtain an NFA weapon without undergoing a background check because to do so would violate the felon's rights \nunder the Fifth Amendment. While individuals cannot be compelled to give incriminating information against \nthemselves during the NFA application process, they do not have the right to opt out of the background check \nprocess. Nor do they have the right to provide false information during the process. Further, they do not have a right \nto an approval of their application or to possess the firearm without an approved application.\n\n \n\n  Commenters should be aware that Haynes was based on an earlier version of the NFA where transferees were \nrequired to notify ATF of their possession of firearms regardless of whether possession was legal. The pre-1968 \nversion of the NFA was \u201crepeatedly . . . attacked on self-incrimination grounds,\u201d United States v. Gullett, 322 F. \nSupp. 272, 273 (D. Colo. 1971). \u201cIn Haynes the Supreme Court ruled that a timely assertion of the privilege was a \ndefense to a prosecution for violation of former section 5851, which forbade the possession of certain classes of \nfirearms not registered with the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate. The court found that the \ncrime created by section 5851 was not meaningfully distinguishable from the section 5841 crime of failure to \nregister possession of certain firearms and that compliance with the registration provision would have compelled \npetitioner to provide evidence facilitating his prosecution for violation of either the making or transfer clauses of \nsection 5851.\u201d Id.\n\n \n\n  In response to Haynes, Congress amended the NFA and enacted, among other provisions, 26 U.S.C. 5848, which \nprovides that registration information may not be used, directly or indirectly, against a registrant in a criminal \nproceeding for an offense occurring prior to, or concurrent with, the registrant's registration. Because Congress \nspecifically drafted the legislation to protect a registrant from criminal prosecution due to the registrant's act of \nregistration, it follows that registration information cannot be used in a Federal or State prosecution for illegal \nacquisition of a registered firearm, a past crime involving the use of a registered firearm, or illegal possession of a \nregistered firearm. 26 U.S.C. 5848(a). However, if the government obtains independent evidence of the offense, \nthere is no immunity from prosecution. Also, section 5848 does not preclude the use of registration information in a \nfalse statements prosecution under 26 U.S.C. 5848(b). The Supreme Court approved the current statute on Fifth \nAmendment grounds in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 604-07 (1971).\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Violates the 14th Amendment</h5>\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  The 14th Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Many commenters \nstated that CLEOs categorically or arbitrarily refuse to sign any ATF forms, even though the NFA firearm is \ncompletely legal in their jurisdiction. Further, according to other commenters some CLEOs impose additional \nburdensome and arbitrary conditions not consistent with the law, or even common sense, to obtain their signature. \nA few commenters believed that, as written, the proposed rule allows CLEOs to exercise an \u201cadministrative veto\u201d in \na selective and arbitrary, and not uniform, manner across the United States, thereby violating the 14th \nAmendment's Equal Protection Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  As previously stated, the final rule will not require CLEO certification or approval, but will instead require CLEO \nnotification. This change moots the concerns\u2014whether valid or not\u2014that a CLEO's refusal to grant an individual a \ncertification would violate the 14th Amendment.\n\n <h5>\n\n  e. Federalism Concerns</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters argued that the proposed rule unnecessarily interferes with State law in several ways, \nincluding by: (1) Undermining State law by granting CLEOs de facto arbitrary power to establish policies directly \ncontrary to State law; (2) intruding on State law governing corporations, trusts, and LLCs by defining \u201cresponsible \npersons\u201d of such entities; (3) undermining State laws limiting disclosure of information regarding ownership of \nfirearms by mandating that an applicant share such information with a CLEO to obtain CLEO certification; and (4) \nimposing an unfunded mandate on CLEOs by expanding the CLEO certification requirement.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Given that the final rule will not require CLEO certification but rather only CLEO notification, the Department \nbelieves that any Federalism concerns raised by this rule are moot.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, this rule defines \u201cresponsible person\u201d for purposes of NFA registration, and for no other purpose. Nor \ndoes this rule purport to impose any dissemination obligations or restrictions upon CLEOs with respect to the \nnotifications they receive. Accordingly, this rule does not infringe upon legitimate State prerogatives in those areas.\n\n <h5>\n\n  f. Exceeding Statutory Purpose Concerns</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters asserted that the original purpose of the NFA was to use the tax code solely to provide a basis \nfor prosecuting \u201cgangsters\u201d who possessed untaxed, unregistered firearms, and not to prohibit NFA firearms, or \n\n\n\neliminate the ability to transfer them to law-abiding citizens who paid the tax and followed the registration \nprocedures. One of these commenters further asserted that by passing the Firearm Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), \nPublic Law 99-308, 110 Stat. 449 (1986), Congress made clear that \u201cATF's regulations and enforcement activities \nof legal owners of firearms\u2014like those who seek to register firearms under the NFA\u2014had already gone too far.\u201d \nSpecifically, this commenter quoted section 1(b) of FOPA, as prohibiting the Department from placing \u201cundue or \nunnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or \nuse of firearms\u201d when implementing the GCA. These commenters asserted that the proposed rule exceeds the \nstatutory purpose as it is not a provision to ensure the payment of NFA tax, and it imposes additional undue and \nunnecessary burdens on law-abiding citizens.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), \nasserted that the proposed rule represented an \u201caggrandizement of executive power\u201d and a violation of the \nseparation of powers doctrine because it would function as an amendment to existing legislation.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF lacked statutory authority to promulgate a regulation creating a new class of \npersons (i.e., responsible persons)\u2014and to require that a transferee provide additional information (i.e., for the \npurposes of background checks) to be submitted by principal, agents, or employees of the transferee. This \ncommenter maintained that Congress is familiar with the term \u201cresponsible person\u201d and cited two statutory sections \nwhere the term was used (i.e., 18 U.S.C. 841, where \u201cresponsible person\u201d means \u201can individual who has the power \nto direct the management and policies of the applicant pertaining to explosive materials,\u201d and 21 U.S.C. 379aa, \nwhich refers to the \u201cresponsible person\u201d as \u201cthe manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name . . . appears on \nthe label of a nonprescription drug marketed in the United States.\u201d). This commenter maintained that Congress has \ndebated, on numerous occasions, background checks for firearms and has chosen, \u201cthrough its act of omission,\u201d \nnot to create a responsible person definition for the NFA or firearms. This commenter argued that the proposed rule \nwas an \u201cend run\u201d around Congress.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with comments that this rulemaking exceeds its authority to issue regulations for \nadministration of the NFA. Congress granted the Attorney General\u2009 (4)  express authority to establish, by regulation, \nthe procedures to be used for the transfer of NFA weapons, including the manner in which transferees and \ntransferors are identified on NFA application forms. See 26 U.S.C. 5812(a). The Attorney General has, in turn, \ndelegated that authority to ATF. See 28 CFR 0.130(a) (delegation of authority to ATF to administer laws related to \nfirearms under 18 U.S.C. chapters 44 and 53). This rulemaking is being undertaken by ATF under its authority \ndelegated by Congress and the Attorney General. See 18 U.S.C. 926(a); 26 U.S.C. 7801(a)(2)(A)(i), 7805(a); 28 \nCFR 0.130(a).\n\n \n\n  To the extent commenters assert that the proposed rule is inconsistent with the purpose underlying the NFA, the \nDepartment respectfully disagrees. The history of the NFA makes clear that Congress intended to use its tax \nauthority to ensure the transfer of certain firearms was subject to a transfer tax and registration requirement to help \nprevent violent criminals from obtaining those firearms.\n\n \n\n  During the Great Depression, the Nation faced the difficulty of controlling violence by gangsters. Representative \nRobert L. Doughton noted that \u201cfor some time this country has been at the mercy of the gangsters, racketeers, and \nprofessional criminals.\u201d 78 Cong. Rec. 11,400 (1934). The Attorney General, Homer Cummings, warned Congress \nthat \u201cthere are more people in the underworld today armed with deadly weapons, in fact, twice as many, as there \nare in the Army and the Navy of the United States combined.\u201d Nat'l Firearms Act Hearings on H.R. 9066 Committee \n\n\n\non Ways and Means, 73d Cong. 4 (1934). In reviewing the legislative history, modern courts have noted, for \nexample, that \u201cthe emergence of organized crime as a major national problem led to the enactment of the National \nFirearms Act of 1934.\u201d Lomont, 285 F.3d at 11. In 1934, Congress passed the NFA requiring everyone, including \ncriminals, to register NFA firearms or face prosecution for failing to do so. In this way, Congress intended to keep \ncriminals from obtaining NFA firearms or, if they obtained these firearms, to provide a powerful tool with which to \nprosecute them. When questioned about the impact of the tax and registration requirements on law-abiding citizens, \nthe Attorney General testified that the requirement is \u201cnot an irrational request to make of the honest citizen who \nwants the criminal class stamped out.\u201d Nat'l Firearms Act Hearings on H.R. 9066 Committee on Ways and Means, \n73d Cong. 25 (1934).\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule's definition of \u201cresponsible person,\u201d and its requirement that such persons undergo a \nbackground check prior to making or receiving an NFA firearm, are fully consistent with this legislative history and \nwith the intended purpose of the NFA. The proposed rule serves Congress's intent in passing the NFA because it \nfurther denies criminals the ability to obtain NFA firearms. The proposed rule does not meaningfully limit the \navailability of firearms to the law-abiding public.\n\n \n\n  A similar response applies to the comments asserting that the proposed rule's requirement that responsible \npersons undergo a background check is inconsistent with Congressional intent underlying FOPA. The Department \nis certainly aware that, in passing FOPA, Congress expressed that it was not its intent to place undue or \nunnecessary restrictions or burdens on law abiding citizens with respect to the lawful private possession of firearms \nfor lawful purposes. FOPA, Public Law 99-308, 100 Stat 449 (1986). However, this expression of intent was set out \nin a section of FOPA amending the GCA, not the NFA. In the context of the dangerous class of weapons regulated \nby the NFA, the Department's assessment is that the background check requirement is within its statutory \nauthority, and the regulatory burden is proportionate and appropriate.\n\n \n\n  In any event, the rule in no way places undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law abiding \ncitizens, but rather imposes regulations reasonably designed to fulfill the purposes of the NFA. The proposed rule is \ncrafted to ensure consistent application of the law and effectuate Congress's preference that criminal background \nchecks be conducted on unlicensed persons to whom firearms are transferred, including those who exert control \nover NFA firearms on behalf of trusts and legal entities. By defining many individuals affiliated with trust and legal \nentities who exert control over NFA firearms as \u201cresponsible persons\u201d and requiring them to undergo background \nchecks, the proposed rule helps achieve the Congressional objective of preventing the transfer of firearms to those \nwho are prohibited or otherwise ineligible to possess or receive them.\n\n <h5>\n\n  g. Miscellaneous</h5>\n\n \n\n  One commenter challenged the adequacy of the industry impact disclosures in the proposed rule, asserting they \nwere inaccurate and incomplete. Another commenter generally asserted that the proposed rule violated the \nconstitutional rights of corporations.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department has undertaken its best efforts to accurately calculate the rule's benefits and costs. The \nDepartment believes the financial impact information contained in the NPRM refutes the commenter's challenge to \nthe adequacy of the financial impact disclosures. The Department fully and accurately assessed the financial impact \nof the cost of this rulemaking on all interested parties, including various segments of the firearms industry; \n\n\n\nbusinesses that depend on the firearms industry; firearm purchasers; State and local police; trust attorneys, and its \nown resource costs in administering the proposed rule. The information set forth in the NPRM with respect to \nfinancial impact meets or exceeds the thresholds required for the proposed rule to become a final rule.\n\n \n\n  The NPRM included the required statutory and executive order review, which fully addressed the financial impact \nof the proposed rule. These reviews concluded that the annual effect of the proposed rule on the economy will not \nexceed $100 million and that the proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector \nof the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or communities. Accordingly, the proposed rule did not reach the threshold of an economically \nsignificant rulemaking under Executive Order 12866.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, because the statutory and executive order reviews in the NPRM included the costs of CLEO \ncertification in their assessments, the cost estimates included in each of those reviews significantly overstate the \ncost that will be associated with the final rule. As noted, the final rule has eliminated the CLEO certification \nrequirement and replaced that requirement with a less burdensome notice requirement. Thousands of commenters \nagreed that CLEO certification was the most expensive and cumbersome aspect of the proposed rule, and asserted \nthat the elimination of the CLEO certification provision would result in substantial cost savings to the public and law \nenforcement. Examples of savings suggested in the comments included: (1) would-be applicants intended to \ncreate trust entities solely for the purpose of avoiding the CLEO certification process will now save the cost of that \ntrust creation; (2) applicants who opt not to create a trust or cannot afford a trust will no longer have to expend time \nand resources obtaining CLEO certification; and (3) State and local law enforcement will not be required to expend \nthe time and resources needed to complete certifications.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree that requiring responsible persons of trusts and legal entities to provide \nidentification information and submit to a background check violates the constitutional rights of those entities. \nBackground checks are lawful as applied to individuals, and the Department believes they are similarly lawful \nwhen applied to the responsible persons behind corporate entities. In fact, responsible persons of FFLs are subject \nto a background check, as are responsible persons of corporate entities that wish to obtain explosives permits or \nlicenses. There is no reason to believe that because NFA weapons are involved, that same approach violates the \nConstitution in this context.\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Consequences of Implementing Rule</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the CLEO certification requirement makes the proposed rule \u201cunworkable\u201d and \ndemonstrates the need to eliminate this requirement for individuals as well. A few other commenters foresaw the \nproposed rule exposing ATF to potential lawsuits filed by law-abiding citizens who could not obtain NFA weapons \nbecause some CLEOs refuse to certify NFA applications, and protested that the proposed rule would eliminate the \noption of obtaining NFA items without a CLEO certification through a trust. See section IV.C.4.c, on general \napplicability, for additional information. Others added that that the certification requirement was an unworkable \nburden on both NFA applicants and State law enforcement agencies and that nothing in the proposed rule \nsuggests that ATF has any intention to expand the size or funding of the NFA Branch to handle the increased \nworkload as the number of individuals and Forms to check would drastically expand.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Several commenters stated generally that the proposed rule would cause \u201cunintended consequences\u201d and have \n\u201cnegative repercussions.\u201d Many commenters stated that the proposed rule has the potential to dramatically increase \nthe processing times and further burden what they regard as ATF's already overwhelmed NFA Branch, which they \nassert presently takes 8 to 10 months\u2014with some commenters stating even longer times, (e.g., 6-15 months)\u2014to \nprocess an application. One commenter stated that the NFA Branch would come to rely more on CLEO signoffs \nand would fail to thoroughly vet transferees as it would struggle to maintain an acceptable rate of transfer \napprovals. The commenter asserted that the CLEO process in its current form is marred by corruption (e.g., bribery; \ncronyism) in many jurisdictions, and feared that a prohibited person could exploit the corruption created by the \nexpanded CLEO requirement to obtain and misuse a NFA firearm, as the ATF would be forced to rely upon the \nCLEO certification to keep pace with review of the number of forms submitted. A few commenters stated that the \nproposed rule would impact trustees' abilities to manage trusts with the proposed requirement for new responsible \npersons to submit a Form 5320.23 as well as obtain a CLEO sign-off within 30 days of the new responsible \nperson's appointment. Another commenter alluded to potential State actions whereby States may enact legislation \nand put in place systems to obtain and sell or transfer machineguns to their citizens\u2014nullifying ATF's authority\u2014\nsince individual gun rights have been afforded greater respect in a number of States after Heller, 554 U.S. 570. The \ncommenter stated that, under 18 U.S.C. 922(o), a State has a clear congressionally-granted power to transfer \nmachineguns to any individual if authorized by State law. Still other commenters stated that the proposed rule \nwould have negative economic effects, including damage to the suppressor\u2009 (5)  industry and related small \nbusinesses, increased costs to local law enforcement agencies, and potential loss in tax revenue and funding to \nATF. See section IV.E.1.g.i for full discussion of lost tax revenue.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would impact an applicant's ability to file \napplications electronically.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  As previously stated, in response to the concerns expressed by commenters, the final rule will no longer include a \nCLEO certification provision; instead, the final rule will include a CLEO notification provision that will require \napplicants simply to notify the CLEO in writing of the application in accordance with the language of the final \nregulation. Thus, the many concerns expressed by commenters regarding the CLEO certification are moot. The \nDepartment also believes that with the shift to CLEO notification, there will be cost and time-saving benefits for all \napplicants.\n\n \n\n  Likewise, concerns about the Department's reliance on CLEO certification to complete background checks on \nNFA applicants are moot. The Department will continue to conduct background checks in accordance with \nestablished procedures.\n\n \n\n  The Department believes it has considered all reasonably foreseeable consequences and possible repercussions \narising from the rule. As with most meaningful changes to regulations or laws, the new rule may cause some \noperational or procedural changes, and may alter the workload and costs for industry members and Government \nworkers. The Department acknowledges that this final rule may increase the time required to process applications \nreceived from trusts and legal entities, as well as for individuals, as an increased number of applications undergo \nmore complete checks. The Department estimates that this final rule initially will increase processing times of these \napplications from the current four months processing time to six to eight months for processing. The Department \nanticipates that this time will be reduced once the NFA Branch adjusts to the new process. In addition, ATF will \nwork to increase its resources and staffing to process the applications. Of course, continued increases in the \nnumber of applications submitted may correspondingly continue to place pressure on processing times. The \n\n\n\nDepartment has done its best to consider all possible consequences arising out of the final rule and has considered, \namong other things, the increased operational cost for the Government and industry members; the increased cost \nassociated with additional fingerprint cards and photographs for responsible persons; and the increased labor cost \nassociated with the time it takes for applicants and industry members to complete the required forms. Having \nconsidered all of the reasonably foreseeable costs and benefits, the Department has determined that the benefits of \nensuring NFA weapons are less easily obtained by persons prohibited from possessing them outweigh the cost of \nimplementing the rule.\n\n \n\n  In response to commenters who believe that this rulemaking may \u201cgoad\u201d States into passing firearm laws that \nattempt to \u201cnullify ATF's authority\u201d in this area, the Department has two responses. First, the Department does not \nbelieve that State efforts to interfere with the rule's effectiveness lessen the need for it. The Department believes \nthat the rule will help to fulfill the purposes of the NFA and help to ensure public safety even if State efforts might \nmake it somewhat less effective than it would otherwise be.\n\n \n\n  Second, the Department believes that, to be valid, State firearms laws must be consistent with Federal law. The \nSupremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the laws of the United States \u201cshall be the \nsupreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Since McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 427 (1819), it has been settled that \nState law that conflicts with Federal law is \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981). When \ndetermining if such a conflict exists, the \u201cpurpose of Congress\u201d is the ultimate touchstone. Cipollone v. Liggett \nGroup, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992 ). The purpose of the NFA is to enhance public safety and ensure that \nprohibited persons do not obtain firearms. State laws that conflict with the NFA's purpose may therefore be \npreempted.\n\n <h5>\n\n  5. General Alternatives to Rule</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated the proposed rule failed to consider more cost effective and practical alternatives that \nwould enhance public safety and enable ATF to better meet administrative obligations under the NFA, and \nsuggested other mechanisms that ATF should consider. The majority of commenters suggested that ATF eliminate \nthe CLEO certification requirement for all NFA transactions, for reasons discussed in section IV.C.1. Many \ncommenters also proposed general alternatives. These proposed alternatives included eliminating the NFA \naltogether; removing some categories of items subject to NFA regulation (such as silencers); varying the regulatory \nrequirements depending on the nature of the NFA item; amending NFA transaction forms to more strongly \nemphasize criminal liability for possession by a prohibited person; developing and improving enforcement efforts; \nand improving the administrative process.\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Eliminate the NFA Altogether</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters suggested that the NFA transfer procedures be repealed. Some of these commenters \nsuggested replacing NFA transfer procedures with the issuance of \u201cNFA cards,\u201d that would allow the card-holder to \npurchase any NFA weapon. One of these commenters recommended that card applicants be required to undergo \nbackground checks and submit fingerprints and photographs.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Several commenters, including FFLs, who urged repeal of the NFA, suggested that transfer of NFA firearms \nshould be handled in the same manner as GCA transfers, with either the $200 tax and registration requirements \nbeing abolished or having the tax collected at the point of sale by the FFL. One of these commenters asserted that \na simple and effective background check by the FBI's National Crime Information Center would serve the same \nfunction as the current NFA procedure at greatly reduced cost. Another commenter characterized NFA regulations \nas \u201carchaic\u201d and argued that they should be repealed and changed in light of \u201cadvances in technology and linked \nNICS databases.\u201d Another commenter urged that ATF abolish the requirements for fingerprints, photographs, and \nCLEO certification for all NFA transfers and add a requirement that the NFA Branch process and return all new \napplications in no more than 10 business days from date of receipt.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department does not have the authority to repeal the NFA or any of its provisions; the NFA is a statute that \nonly Congress may repeal or alter. Only Congress can remove a weapon from the purview of the NFA, or alter, \nincrease or decrease, the making or transfer tax on a NFA weapon. ATF does not have the authority to change any \nof the requirements mandated in the statute. The NFA provides very limited authority to permit exemptions from the \ntransfer tax, and commenters' requested exemptions do not fall within that authority.\n\n \n\n  Specifically, the NFA provision governing the making of an NFA firearm, 26 U.S.C. 5822, requires that a person \nwho seeks to make an NFA firearm (a) apply to make and register \u201cthe firearm,\u201d (b) pay applicable taxes on such \nfirearm, (c) identify the firearm to be made, (d) identify himself, and if an individual, \u201cinclude his fingerprints and his \nphotograph\u201d and (e) obtain \u201capproval of the Secretary to make and register the firearm.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 5822. The \nstatutory provision governing the transfer of NFA weapons, 26 U.S.C. 5812(a), is substantively similar to section \n5822, requiring (a) an application for the specific firearm, (b) the payment of relevant taxes, (c) identification of the \nfirearm, (d) identification of the applicant (with fingerprints and a photograph required for individuals), and (e) \napproval of the transfer of the firearm. The Department therefore cannot abolish the fingerprint and photograph \nidentification requirements, nor issue blanket permits to individuals to make or transfer NFA firearms.\n\n \n\n  To the extent commenters would like the Department to change how it conducts its background checks, or not \nrequire fingerprints and photographs for applicants that are not individuals, the Department believes that its current \nprocedures for background checks are the best means of ensuring that prohibited individuals do not obtain NFA \nfirearms, and that it would be administratively burdensome and encourage circumvention to create different \napplication requirements for individuals, on the one hand, and trusts and legal entities on the other.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Remove Certain Categories of Items Subject to NFA Regulation or Subject Them to Minimal Regulation Within \nthe NFA Framework</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters suggested that certain categories of NFA-regulated items should be removed. A few \ncommenters stated that silencers, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and weapons falling within the \nNFA's \u201cany other weapon\u201d (AOW) definition should be regulated in the same manner as non-NFA firearms\u2014\nrequiring only a NICS background check when transferred from an FFL. Another commenter suggested that there \nbe a more nuanced approach to regulating NFA items\u2014not a one-size-fits-all approach\u2014and that some could have \nfewer regulatory requirements than others. The suggestions for treatment of the particular categories are separately \naddressed.\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. SBRs, SBSs, and AOWs</h5>\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters argued that SBRs and SBSs are functionally no different than handguns. The same \ncommenters noted that a criminal could easily make an SBR or SBS by cutting down a long gun, and stated that \nSBRs and SBSs should be treated the same as handguns. Several commenters argued that SBRs and SBSs are \nless accurate than handguns. These commenters asked how SBRs and SBSs are more deadly or more dangerous \nthan AR-15-style pistols and other handguns that are more readily concealable.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters stated that ATF should deregulate SBRs and SBSs and remove them from the NFA. These \ncommenters suggested that ATF allow FFLs to sell SBRs and SBSs in over-the-counter transactions, in the same \nmanner as GCA long guns (rifles and shotguns). A few commenters stated that there is no reason to regulate SBRs \nand SBSs when these items are not normally used in crimes. A few other commenters stated that continuing to \nregulate these items will have no impact on crime.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters also believed that AOWs do not warrant NFA classification, and should also be handled under \nGCA transfer standards. These commenters noted that AOWs generally pique the interest of collectors\u2014not \ncriminals\u2014and are therefore owned by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. Another commenter suggested that \nATF increase taxes on machineguns, and remove SBRs and SBSs from NFA regulations. Another commenter \nsuggested that ATF direct its investigative energies toward AOW and machinegun applications, and apply lesser \ntreatment for SBRs and silencers (i.e., NICS check only). Other comments pertaining to silencers are addressed in \nsection IV.B.5.b.ii, below.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  As noted, only Congress can bring a weapon under the purview of the NFA, and only Congress can repeal or \nremove a weapon from the purview of the NFA. All of the weapons referenced in these comments (SBSs, SBRs, \nsilencers, AOWs, and machineguns) have been designated NFA weapons since the statute was enacted in 1934. \nWith the exception of the reduced transfer tax on AOWs, no statutory provision in the NFA specifically provides for \ndiffering treatment of NFA firearms. While ATF has the authority to remove some firearms from the purview of the \nNFA due to certain factors that make them primarily a collector's item and not likely to be used as a weapon, ATF \ndoes not have the authority to change the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under 26 U.S.C. 5845(a). To the extent that \ncommenters would like the agency to take a more flexible approach to regulating NFA firearms, for example, by \nreducing or eliminating background checks, the Department takes the position that uniform measures best fulfill \nthe NFA's statutory purposes and benefit public safety.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Silencers</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department received a number of comments concerning silencers (commonly known as \u201csuppressors,\u201d see \nsupra note 5). Many commenters pointed out that silencers do not measurably contribute to gun violence and are \nimportant and popular safety devices within the hunting and shooting sports communities to protect from hearing \nloss and reduce noise pollution, and may also be used for home protection. A few commenters stated that multiple \nstudies have clearly shown that earmuffs, even when used together with earplugs, do not adequately protect \n\n\n\nagainst hearing loss when firing most calibers of weapons. A few commenters pointed out that silencers do not \nmake a gun silent, and provided information showing the silencers' goal is simply to reduce the sound to a certain \ndecibel level to avoid hearing damage. One commenter provided in-depth research and data on noise-reducing \nbenefits and superiority of silencers to ear-level devices. This commenter asserted that the proposed rule \nrepresents a step backward in protecting against hearing loss. Many commenters stated that several other \ncountries with much stricter gun regulation than the United States (e.g., United Kingdom, Finland) sell silencers \nwithout restriction and directly \u201coff the shelf.\u201d Another commenter stated that many countries encourage the use of \nsilencers to keep noise down and improve hearing safety. Many commenters observed that silencers are legal in \nseveral States (e.g., North Carolina, Washington, Texas). Many commenters advocated that silencers should only \nrequire a NICS check. Another commenter suggested that if ATF retains the CLEO certification requirement, \nsilencers be exempted from such a requirement. Another commenter suggested that ATF reduce the tax stamp cost \nfor silencers to $5.00 or to remove silencers from the NFA altogether. Another commenter stated that silencers \nshould not need a tax stamp in States that permit silencers.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The NFA defines silencers as firearms. 26 U.S.C. 5845(a)(7). The NFA defines the word \u201csilencer\u201d by reference to \nsection 921 of title 18, see id., which defines the terms \u201cfirearm silencer\u201d and \u201cfirearm muffler\u201d to mean \u201cany device \nfor silencing, muffling, or diminishing the report of a portable firearm, including any combination of parts, designed \nor redesigned, and intended for use in assembling or fabricating a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, and any part \nintended only for use in such assembly or fabrication.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(24). Thus it is the NFA statute, and not the \nDepartment, that defines silencers (or \u201csuppressors\u201d) as firearms for purposes of the NFA. And because silencers \nare \u201cfirearms\u201d for purposes of the NFA, they are subject to the restrictions on making and transferring firearms in \nthe NFA. See 26 U.S.C. 5812(a), 5822.\n\n \n\n  As noted, only Congress can remove a class of weapons from the purview of the NFA. ATF does not have the \nauthority to remove silencers from the NFA and does not believe it would be prudent to make different types of \nfirearms subject to different background check requirements. The NFA provides very limited authority to permit \nexemptions from the transfer tax, and commenters' requested exemptions do not fall within that authority. ATF also \nlacks the authority to reduce tax stamp costs associated with NFA firearms, as those costs are fixed by statute. \nFinally, given that the Department is not requiring CLEO certification for any items covered by the NFA, the \ncomments relating to removing the CLEO certification requirement for silencers are moot.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Ways for ATF To Stress Criminal Liability for Possession by a Prohibited Person</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter suggested that ATF amend all forms associated with NFA transactions to add warnings indicating \nthat any individual or any member of a legal entity that permits a prohibited person access to any NFA item has \ncommitted a criminal act. The added language should also state that for a legal entity, the criminal responsibility for \npermitting such access rests with the legal entity and all of its individual members. The commenter further asserted \nthat legal entities are not widely used by prohibited persons to acquire or possess NFA items because the NFA \nforms submitted to ATF identify all members of the legal entity involved in the transfer, and a prohibited person \nwould likely fear being identified from the form and prosecuted. The commenter asserted that no evidence exists \nthat ATF actually uses these names to identify, investigate, and prosecute criminal acts, and he suggested that ATF \nshould do more to develop efforts to identify, investigate, and prosecute possession of NFA items by prohibited \n\n\n\npersons. If ATF were to institute such efforts, ATF could establish an information baseline to show the extent of any \nillegal practices, which could support any necessary regulatory or legislative changes.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that current NFA transfer forms (ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5) adequately convey information \nabout the penalties for unlawful possession of an NFA weapon. With respect to the assertion that legal entities are \nnot widely used by prohibited persons to circumvent background checks, the absence of background checks for \ntransfers involving trusts or legal entities renders it extremely difficult to assess how often prohibited persons have \nobtained NFA firearms through such transfers. Finally, ATF enforces the criminal laws within its jurisdiction, and if it \nbecomes aware of any firearm\u2014including NFA firearms\u2014in the possession of persons prohibited from having it, it \nwill take appropriate actions.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Miscellaneous General Comments</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters requested that ATF reopen the NFRTR to permit the legal ownership of machineguns \nmanufactured after 1986 (post-1986 machineguns). A few other commenters suggested revising the requirements \nby simply eliminating the \u201ccut off\u201d date in the NFA to allow for newly manufactured NFA weapons (e.g., \nmachineguns, automatic rifles) as the current stock is very limited, and to replace worn and unsafe weapons with \nnew guns when \u201cold weapons become nothing more than high-priced collector items.\u201d A commenter stated that this \nchange would reduce the purchase price due to increased market availability and would increase tax revenue. This \nsame commenter supported a higher cost tax stamp for the post-1986 machineguns, and for these guns to continue \nto be heavily regulated. Another commenter stated that having new firearms available would greatly increase the \nincome of both government and private firearms manufacturers, which benefits local governments through sales \ntax.\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF needs to rewrite the proposed rule to comply with the Plain Language Act of 2010. \nAnother commenter suggested that, prior to drafting regulations, ATF should start a dialogue to enable \u201csound and \nrational\u201d regulations to promote safety without the \u201canimosity and conflict\u201d that has divided the country on so many \nissues. Another commenter expressed his willingness to work with ATF to conduct geographic information system \nresearch to help devise a common sense approach to crime reduction. One commenter suggested that ATF delay \nthe final rule's effective date to allow ATF to process its backlog of NFA applications.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters asked general questions and for additional information about other terms used in the proposed \nrule. For example, a commenter requested that ATF define the term \u201cmake\u201d and asked if the proposed rule applied \nto all firearms or only to fully automatic weapons. Another commenter stated that the term \u201ccertain other firearms\u201d \nwas so vague that most semi-auto cartridge firing mechanisms would be considered illegal. Another commenter \nasked about a \u201cdestructive device.\u201d This commenter asked what \u201cconstitutes\u201d a destructive device, and for guidance \nto ensure that this term is not open-ended.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  ATF does not have the authority to remove the general prohibition on the transfer and possession of machineguns \nthat were not lawfully possessed on May 19, 1986. This is a statutory prohibition and therefore only Congress has \nthe authority to remove this prohibition. 18 U.S.C. 922(o). Further, the statute requires that any machinegun be \nlawfully possessed by May 19, 1986. ATF does not have the authority to permit nongovernmental entities the ability \nto possess machineguns or other NFA firearms that are not lawfully registered in the NFRTR.\n\n \n\n  With respect to commenters who believe that the Department should engage in additional dialogue or gather more \ndata before issuing this rule, the Department disagrees. The Department has complied with the notice and \ncomment procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act, other requirements imposed by statute, and relevant \nprocedures required by the President for the promulgation of rules. The Department invited public comment to \nimprove and refine the proposed rule and it has used public comments to do so. But the Department is not \npersuaded that further delay in promulgating the rule is likely to improve it or is otherwise in the public interest.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with the comment asserting that the final rule's effective date should be delayed \nuntil the backlog of NFA applications has been cleared. ATF's capacity to process NFA applications during a given \ntimeframe is limited by resource constraints; absent a dramatic reduction in the number of applications ATF \nreceives, it will likely continue to have some number of applications that await processing (i.e., a \u201cbacklog\u201d). That \nsaid, ATF has substantially reduced the backlog of pending applications over the course of the past year.\n\n \n\n  The terms in the proposed rule about which the commenters sought clarification, such as \u201cmake\u201d and \u201cdestructive \ndevice,\u201d are defined by the NFA and in its supporting regulations. The definitions may be found in 26 U.S.C. 5845 \nand 27 CFR 479.11.\n\n <h4>\n\n  C. Comments Addressing Specific Portions of the Rule</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. CLEO Certification</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. CLEO Certification Is Unnecessary and Unreasonable</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters stated that ATF's access to NICS and other databases provides a more accurate \nbackground check than a CLEO certification. These commenters stated the CLEO signoff is \u201cworthless,\u201d as the \nCLEO's signing or refusing to sign is in most cases based on the CLEO's personal political preferences; the CLEO \nsignature has potential for abuse with the signature given for political support or other compensation; and that even \non the limited occasions CLEOs perform background checks, they use NICS or the State equivalent for this type \nof check. Many commenters, noting that the CLEO certification requirement predated NICS, asserted that the \nCLEO certification no longer serves its original purpose. One commenter described the certification as \u201cantiquated \nand a gross waste of resources.\u201d Another described it as \u201coutdated, redundant, and superfluous,\u201d and urged ATF to \neliminate it under the guidance provided in Executive Order 13610 of May 10, 2012, \u201cIdentifying and Reducing \nRegulatory Burdens.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Several other commenters noted that ATF acknowledged in the proposed rule that even without CLEO \ncertification, ATF already has a \u201cfuller picture of any individual than was possible in 1934.\u201d Many commenters also \ngenerally noted that technological and societal changes have made it less likely that a CLEO is the best source for \n\n\n\ninformation indicating an individual may be prohibited from firearm possession. One commenter observed that \nmany applicants never previously interacted with their local CLEOs, and, consequently, CLEOs do not serve the \nfunction they once did to assess the character or potential of an individual to misuse an NFA item. Many \ncommenters agreed with this assessment as they personally never had any interactions with their local CLEOs.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters asserted that the sign-off creates an insurmountable challenge and an unreasonable burden on \napplicants and CLEOs. Hundreds of commenters agreed that the consequence of retaining CLEO certifications for \nindividuals and extending this requirement to responsible persons associated with legal entities would result in a de \nfacto ban of NFA firearms, because they report that some CLEOs will not provide the necessary certification.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters raised privacy concerns with the CLEO certification requirement, and asserted it should be \ncompletely eliminated in the interest of protecting personal tax information. These commenters considered the $5 \nor $200 tax paid to manufacture or transfer a NFA firearm or device to be \u201cprotected\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d tax \ninformation, and stated that the mere application before paying the tax should not be reported to or involve any local \nCLEO or other government official. Another commenter questioned why his private tax information must be subject \nto law enforcement inspection and approval. This commenter worried that his personal, nonpublic information might \nbecome public record if the local law enforcement agency received a Freedom of Information Act request. The \ncommenter stated that ATF has a \u201cwell structured system for protecting [his] applications;\u201d however, he did not \nknow of any Federal or State guidelines applicable to local law enforcement protecting his personal tax information. \nA few other commenters also raised concerns with some CLEOs retaining copies of the forms they sign. These \ncommenters stated that they cannot object to such retention or they would never receive signoff from the CLEOs. A \nfew commenters believed that sharing Federal tax information involuntarily with local agencies was against the law. \nAnother commenter expressed concern that his personal privacy was also invaded by permitting local government \nofficials to know what firearms are in his home.\n\n \n\n  In addition, several commenters asked general questions about why CLEO certification was needed at all or why \nCLEO certifications are not required on all firearm transfers. Another commenter noted that there is no CLEO \ncertification requirement for SOT-licensed manufacturers of NFA items to obtain their licenses, and such \nmanufacturers merely need to send an \u201cintent letter\u201d informing local police agencies of their intent to manufacture \nNFA items in their local areas. This commenter asked how ATF determines SOT manufacturers are \u201ctrusted\u201d \npersons with no CLEO certification. Further, this commenter opined that manufacturers of NFA items \u201cpose greater \nrisk\u201d and should have \u201cconsiderably more scrutiny\u201d than an individual or legal entity desiring to possess a few items.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that some trusts and legal entities would be unable to obtain a CLEO certification, \nfor reasons other than a responsible person being prohibited or local ordinances prohibiting such firearms, which \nwould result in those trusts and legal entities being unable to obtain an NFA firearm. As the proposed rule was not \nintended to deny those trusts and legal entities the opportunity to acquire such firearms where permitted by law, the \nDepartment has changed the CLEO certification to a CLEO notification. Additionally, the Department believes that \nwith the shift to CLEO notification, there will be cost and time-saving benefits for all applicants, including those who \nfind the current CLEO certification process daunting.\n\n \n\n  The Department disagrees with the concern that providing the application to make or transfer NFA items to local \nlaw enforcement as part of CLEO notification is an unlawful release of tax information. Since the application has not \nbeen received by ATF at the time of CLEO notification, it does not constitute \u201creturn information.\u201d See Lomont, 285 \n\n\n\nF.3d at 15. Additionally, while it is unlawful for employees of the Federal Government to release an individual's tax \ninformation, see 26 U.S.C. 6103(a), in this instance it is the individual that shares the information. Therefore, even if \nsuch information were \u201creturn information,\u201d no employee of the Federal Government would be disclosing it. Lomont, \n285 F.3d at 15.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with commenters that ATF does not have the authority to formulate regulations \nenforcing the provisions of the NFA. Congress expressly delegated authority to the Attorney General in section \n5812 and 5822, among other sections. Congress provided the Attorney General with the authority to require certain \nidentification procedures for transferors and transferees. See 26 U.S.C. 5812(a) (providing, inter alia, that \u201c[a] \nfirearm shall not be transferred unless . . . the transferee is identified in the application form in such manner as the \nSecretary may by regulations prescribe, except that, if such person is an individual, the identification must include \nhis fingerprints and his photograph . . . .\u201d (emphasis added)); 26 U.S.C. 5822 (same with respect to making \nfirearms). These sections require fingerprints and photographs for individuals at a minimum, but the information that \nthe Attorney General can seek is not limited to these things. Finally, the Attorney General has delegated the \nauthority to the Director of ATF to investigate, administer, and enforce the Federal firearms laws. See 28 CFR \n0.130.\n\n \n\n  Finally, the Department has the authority to require CLEO notification for the same reason that it has the authority \nto require CLEO certification. Sections 5812 and 5822 give the Department broad authority to promulgate \nregulations governing application forms, including regulations pertaining to the identification of a firearm and its \nmaker or, in the case of a transfer, its transferee and transferor. See 26 U.S.C. 5812(a), 5822. Both sections \nprovide that applications \u201cshall be denied\u201d if the transfer, receipt, making, or possession of the firearm would place \nthe transferee or person making the firearm in violation of law. See id. Neither, however, \u201crestricts the Secretary's \nbroad power to grant or deny applications in any other respect.\u201d Lomont, 285 F.3d at 17. The notification \nrequirement thus falls within the Department's authority to request information from individuals who seek to make or \ntransfer NFA firearms that helps it to fulfill its statutory mandate to prevent prohibited individuals from obtaining NFA \nfirearms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Authority To Require CLEO Certification</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed extension of the CLEO certification requirement exceeds ATF's \nstatutory authority. A few commenters noted that ATF cites to 26 U.S.C. 5812 and 5822 of the NFA as the statutory \nauthority for the proposed rule, but disputed that these statutory provisions provided ATF with authority to impose a \nCLEO certification requirement on individuals, much less a responsible person of a legal entity. These commenters \nargued that section 5812 authorizes ATF to prescribe the form of NFA applications with the limited purpose of \nidentifying the transferor, transferee and firearm, and that seeking opinions from local CLEOs goes beyond \nestablishing the actual identity of the applicant.\n\n \n\n  One commenter asserted that the Attorney General cannot delegate the duties of the office to a CLEO\u2014a non-\nFederal agency\u2014as a CLEO's arbitrary or capricious actions, or failure to act, are not subject to review under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-559). Other commenters stated that ATF cannot delegate this authority \narbitrarily to itself or to a third party without authorization from Congress and that requiring CLEO certification gives \n\u201cabsolute and unchecked discretion\u201d to local CLEOs. Another commenter stated that no provision in the NFA \nprovides ATF the authority to refuse to issue a \u201cstamped application form\u201d when the applicant can be identified by \na method other than CLEO certification. This commenter stated that section 5812(a)(3) only requires that an \n\n\n\nindividual be identified by fingerprints and photographs, not by CLEO certification. All these commenters contended \nthat the local CLEO certification should be eliminated not expanded.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Although the Department does not agree with the assertions that ATF lacks statutory authority to require CLEO \ncertifications, for other reasons described herein at section IV.C.1.a-d, the Department has removed the CLEO \ncertification requirement from the final rule. Since removal of the CLEO certification requirement is the ultimate \nresult advocated by these commenters, in-depth discussion of their assertions is not necessary to the final rule.\n\n \n\n  In addressing the comments, it must be noted that Congress provided the Attorney General with the authority to \nrequire certain identification procedures for transferors and transferees. See 26 U.S.C. 5812(a). These sections \nrequire fingerprints and photographs for individuals at a minimum, but the information that the Attorney General can \nseek is not limited to these things. CLEO certification and CLEO notification are also identification procedures \nauthorized by section 5812(a).\n\n \n\n  Under the proposed regulation, ATF would not have delegated the application process to the CLEO. ATF merely \nproposed to extend to the responsible persons of trusts and legal entities the CLEO certification requirement, which \nwas the same process that had been in place for many years with individuals. A certification was just one step \ninvolved in the process of determining if an application could be approved. These issues are moot, however, as \nATF will adopt a CLEO notification process instead.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. CLEO Issues With Certifying</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters, including trade associations and individuals, discussed the reasons some CLEOs refused \nto approve NFA applications. These commenters disputed ATF's statement in the proposed rule that liability \nconcerns are a primary reason some CLEOs refuse to approve NFA applications. A commenter stated that ATF \nwas wrong to rely on this \u201cfalse premise,\u201d and requested that ATF perform a \u201csystematic study and survey of \nCLEOs to develop a solution to the actual problem at hand rather than disrupt established procedures for entities \ndeveloped over the past 80 years.\u201d Many commenters stated that CLEOs often refuse to sign based on personal or \npolitical concerns, not civil liability concerns. Some of the stated political reasons include that the transferee did not \ndonate to their political campaigns; general political liability\u2014as opposed to civil liability\u2014 concerns; and the \nCLEO's personal disagreement with the policy choices of the CLEO's States and Congress to permit private \nownership of NFA firearms. Another commenter stated that there are jurisdictions where CLEOs collectively refuse \nto sign, exercising their \u201cpersonal fiat.\u201d Many commenters related personal experiences purporting to show that \nCLEOs in certain regions and jurisdictions refuse to sign due to political party affiliation and ideological beliefs. \nSeveral commenters urged ATF to place time limits within which CLEOs would be required to act on certifications \nrequests; if the CLEO failed to act on the certification request within the time limit, ATF would be required to \nproceed as if the certification had been approved. Many commenters referenced newspaper articles and other \nsources that provide quoted statements from local CLEOs regarding their reasons for refusal and their publicly \nannounced policies to no longer consider applications for silencers, short-barreled shotguns, explosives, etc. \nAnother commenter asked if ATF has proposed guidelines that CLEOs must follow to ensure no discrimination. This \ncommenter also asked if ATF will establish a system to prosecute and reprimand CLEOs who refuse to provide \ncertification when there are no issues preventing such certification.\n\n\n\n \n\n  NFATCA's comment noted that in the NPRM ATF had accurately cited a quote from NFATCA's 2009 petition \nregarding CLEO concerns over liability (\u201c[s]ome CLEOs express a concern of perceived liability; that signing an \nNFA transfer application will link them to any inappropriate use of the firearm\u201d), but asserted that this point was \nsecondary to its primary concern that the CLEO certification requirement was unlawful. NFATCA further asserted \nthat in focusing on liability, ATF had failed to acknowledge that many CLEOs would not sign NFA certifications for \nreasons other than liability, such as budgetary concerns and opposition to private ownership of NFA firearms, or \nfirearms in general.\n\n \n\n  NFATCA, the American Silencer Association (ASA),  (6)  and a majority of other commenters, all advocated \ncomplete elimination of the CLEO certification requirement.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that there are many reasons why a CLEO may not sign an NFA application. \nTaking these concerns and other factors into consideration, the Department has removed the CLEO certification \nrequirement from the final rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department notes, however, that its decision to remove the certification requirement from the final rule does \nnot reflect agreement with assertions, such as those put forward by NFATCA in the comments, that the CLEO \ncertification requirement is unlawful.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Alternatives to CLEO Certification</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  The majority of commenters were opposed to the expanded CLEO certification requirement, and many suggested \nalternatives to this requirement. The most commonly cited alternative was to completely eliminate the requirement \nfor all NFA transfers. Many commenters suggested that instead of CLEO certification, ATF could require notification \nwhereby the individual or the responsible person executing the form in the name of the legal entity must provide the \nlocal CLEO with a copy of Form 1, 4, or 5 submitted to ATF, and provide the CLEO a reasonable time for review. If, \nby the end of that time period, the CLEO has not provided ATF with information showing cause for denial, ATF \nshould consider the application cleared at the CLEO level and proceed with the application. The commenters \nbelieved this alternative would meet the statutory requirements of sections 5812 and 5822 of the NFA without \nallowing CLEOs to arbitrarily deny applications. The time period that commenters considered \u201creasonable\u201d varied, \nwith suggestions for periods of 7, 15, 30, and 60 business days. A commenter noted that a similar process is \nalready used with Form 7. Several commenters noted that NFATCA had recommended this alternative in its \npetition (i.e., eliminating the CLEO certification requirement and replacing it with notification to the CLEO of the \npending transfer, combined with ATF conducting a NICS check of an individual and principle officers of a trust or \nlegal entity). Several commenters noted that ATF previously indicated its intent\u2014per published abstracts in the \nUnified Regulatory Agenda in 2011 and 2012\u2014to propose notification instead of CLEO certification and eliminate \nsuch certification altogether.  (7)  At least one of these commenters requested that ATF provide a reasoned \nexplanation for changing course from a regulatory alternative that would be more \u201ccost effective, serve legitimate \nstatutory objectives, and avoid legal vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n  A few commenters suggested ways to amend \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85, as well as Forms 1, 4, and 5, to provide for a \nnotification process similar to the one the Department has chosen to adopt. One commenter provided specific \nlanguage to replace the CLEO certification on Form 1. Another commenter suggested replacing the CLEO \ncertification language on Form 4 with a certified statement\u2014under penalty of perjury or falsification of an official \ngovernment form\u2014by the individual or the responsible person of the legal entity executing the form. This statement \nwould indicate that such individual or responsible person has \u201cconferred with their attorney and/or the local law \nenforcement officials and that the individual or the entity and each `responsible person' in the entity are not \nprohibited by local or state law from owning or possessing the items being transferred to them on the form and that \nthey are not a prohibited `alien' who cannot own or possess the items.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Many commenters supported eliminating CLEO certification and instead requiring all members of a trust, once the \napplication is returned \u201capproved\u201d from ATF, to undergo a NICS check prior to the transfer of the NFA firearm. One \ncommenter suggested that ATF keep the NICS check requirement for the individual or responsible person \ncompleting Form 4473 to obtain the transferred item. This commenter also suggested that ATF keep the current \nprocess where only the individual or one of the responsible party(s) of a legal entity complete and sign the transfer \nform.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters suggested that if the objective is to prevent restricted persons from owning NFA items, a \nsimpler solution would be to substitute fingerprinting and background checks for the CLEO certification \nrequirement for all NFA transfers. Many other commenters concurred with eliminating CLEO certification and \nmaking NFA weapons point-of-sale items as they saw no difference between the background checks performed \nby ATF's NFA Branch and those performed by FFLs.\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that the best alternative is to either keep the status quo\u2014requiring CLEO certification for \nindividual applicants\u2014or eliminate the CLEO certification requirement for trusts while retaining the need for a \nstandard \u201cNFA-style\u201d background check for each individual. Other commenters requested that ATF consider either \nno change to ATF's stance on trusts and legal entities regarding CLEO certification or remove the CLEO \ncertification requirement for all NFA items. Other commenters urged ATF to eliminate the CLEO certification \nrequirement for all transfers, replacing it with various forms of automated background checks. Another commenter \nsuggested an \u201cequitable solution\u201d would be to have an applicant's local police department provide a \u201cletter of good \nconduct,\u201d which states that \u201cyou are who you say you are and provides a list of any criminal offenses you may have \nhad.\u201d This commenter named a local police department that issued these letters quite regularly.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters questioned the intention of CLEO certification. If the objective is to verify the applicant's \nidentity (i.e., that the applicant is the one signing the form and is the person in the provided photograph), these \ncommenters maintained that any Notary Public could accomplish this objective. Other commenters supported \nmethods used by other Federal agencies to verify identification, such as local police departments, State police, or \nfingerprinting companies. Another commenter suggested that instead of CLEO certification, that local ATF offices \ntake the applicants' photographs and fingerprints, perform background checks, and approve applications on the \nspot. This commenter suggested that the local ATF offices could additionally perform a NICS check as required by \nForm 4473.\n\n \n\n  Many other commenters suggested alternatives under which ATF could require individual applicants and \nresponsible persons to provide various forms of government-issued identification with photographs to verify identity. \nOne commenter suggested revising the application forms to include a page for individuals and all responsible \npersons of legal entities to attach photograph(s) showing the front and back of a currently valid State-issued \nidentification or driver's license. Another commenter stated that ATF only needs a full name, date of birth, and \n\n\n\nSocial Security number to perform background checks. Another commenter suggested that instead of having \nCLEOs verify fingerprints and photographs, there be a database containing an approved set of fingerprints and \nphotograph of each applicant. Another commenter questioned the rationale for relying on CLEO approval for \nFederal law, and suggested for improving efficiency to either make the entire process Federal or have the entire \nprocess rely on \u201clocal/state\u201d law.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested that ATF reform the process to have the $200 tax either be an \u201cexcise tax\u201d payable \nat the point of sale or, with the advances in technology, have the retailer print out a tax stamp at the point of sale. \nThis would enable the purchaser to complete a Form 4473, enable a NICS check to be performed, and enable \nremittance of the taxes through the retailer.\n\n \n\n  Although many commenters preferred that the CLEO certification requirement be completely eliminated, they also \nprovided compromise positions if ATF were set on keeping and expanding the CLEO certification requirement. \nThese commenters suggested that ATF make the CLEO certification a \u201cshall issue\u201d and require CLEOs to decide \nbased on legal restrictions and obligations, and sign off on the certification, if the background check is \u201cclean\u201d \nunless there is a valid reason not to sign (e.g., criminal or mental health history).\n\n \n\n  If ATF were to maintain the certification, a few commenters suggested changing the sequence of CLEO review by \nrequiring ATF to provide the application information to the CLEO only after conducting a review. Many commenters \nsuggested that ATF provide for judicial review of instances where CLEOs would not sign off on the certification; \nothers requested that the CLEO be required to state the reason for the denial and provide \u201creal tangible evidence\u201d \nand state \u201cspecific, objective and legally relevant reasons\u201d for the non-concurrence or denial.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters suggested that Forms 1, 4, and 5 be revised to provide an area indicating that the local \nCLEO would not sign off on the form, and in such instances ATF could require more information or perform a more \nextensive background check. For example, one commenter suggested adding three signature lines on the forms: \n(1) First line\u2014for the CLEO to sign and state \u201cno disqualifying information;\u201d (2) second line\u2014for the CLEO to sign \nand state \u201cinformation indicating disqualification\u201d and for the CLEO to explain the disqualification; and (3) third \nline\u2014for the applicant to certify \u201cI certify I submitted this to this CLEO (name address) over 30 days ago and \nreceived no response.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Many commenters recommended that ATF broaden the list of officials who could provide certifications, to include \nlocal district attorneys, judges, officials in local ATF offices, or a designated official in each State, among others.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters suggested that individual applicants and responsible persons of legal entities who hold a \nconcealed carry permit or license in the State where they reside\u2014authorizing them to purchase, obtain, or carry \nweapons\u2014should be exempt from the CLEO certification requirement, as well as the photograph and fingerprint \nrequirements, since State and Federal background checks have already been performed and verified.\n\n \n\n  One commenter requested that ATF consider not requiring CLEO certification for active and retired law \nenforcement officers, active and retired military officers, including Guard and Reserve officers, and any government \nemployee with a security clearance, as well as FFLs. Other commenters suggested that the CLEO certification \nrequirement be removed for silencer ownership. Another commenter recommended requiring CLEOs to sign off on \nforms in States where SBRs, machineguns, and silencers were legal. Another commenter recommended that ATF \n\n\n\nrequire differing levels of CLEO certification per NFA item, and that silencers and \u201cany other weapons\u201dshould not be \nsubject to CLEO certification.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested simply that a large red \u201cF\u201d be placed on the driver's license of a convicted felon to \nensure that criminals do not obtain or use firearms, and proprietors of gun ranges and sellers of ammunition could \neasily ascertain who is permitted to do business with them and who is not.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Although the Department does not agree with all of the concerns expressed or suggestions made in the above-\nsummarized comments, it does concur with the conclusion of many commenters that the benefits of CLEO \ncertification do not outweigh the costs of the CLEO certification requirement, and that alternate procedures will \nsatisfy the statutory requirements of section 5812 and 5822. Consequently, as previously noted, the Department \nhas removed the CLEO certification requirement from the final rule. As an alternative to certification, the final rule \nadopts a CLEO notification requirement that is similar to that suggested by many commenters. In conjunction with \nthe mandatory background check required of all applicants, including responsible persons of trusts and legal \nentities, the requirement of CLEO notice fulfills the primary objectives that have supported the certification \nrequirement: It provides the CLEO awareness that a resident of the CLEO's jurisdiction has applied to make or \nobtain an NFA weapon and affords the CLEO an opportunity to provide input to the ATF of any information that may \nnot be available during a Federal background check indicating the applicant is prohibited from possessing \nfirearms. As noted in the NPRM, although the NICS provides access to a substantial number of records to verify if \nan individual is prohibited from possessing firearms, CLEOs often have access to records or information that has \nnot been made available to NICS. Providing notice to the CLEO of a prospective NFA transfer with instructions on \nhow to relay relevant information to ATF will help fill possible information gaps in NICS by affording the CLEO a \nreasonable opportunity to provide relevant information to ATF.\n\n \n\n  To effectuate the CLEO notice requirement, the Department is revising the regulations in \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85 to \nrequire the applicant or transferee, and all responsible persons, to provide a notice to the appropriate State or local \nofficial that an application is being submitted to ATF, and conforming changes will be made to ATF Forms 1, 4, and \n5. In addition, responsible persons for trusts or legal entities will be required to provide CLEO notification on ATF \nForm 5320.23, NFA Responsible Person Questionnaire.\n\n \n\n  Consistent with the recommendation of many commenters, the changes to Forms 1, 4, and 5 will also include a \ncertification requirement by the applicant or transferee under penalty of perjury, that the applicant or transferee \nhas provided notification to the CLEO; a corresponding change will be made to Form 5320.23 for certification by \nresponsible persons of trusts and legal entities. Applicants will also be required to provide the name and location \nof the CLEO to whom the form was sent, and date the form was sent. Removal of the CLEO certification \nrequirement also means that CLEOs will no longer need to attest to the authenticity of the applicant's or \ntransferee's photographs and fingerprints. To ensure verification of identity, however, the official taking the \napplicant/transferee's fingerprints must sign the fingerprint card to certify the official has verified identity of the \napplicant/transferee. In reaching the decision to substitute CLEO notification for certification, the Department \ndetermined that the proposal to have local ATF offices process NFA applications and conduct background checks \nwas neither efficient nor feasible due to other mission requirements and resource constraints. For a discussion of \nother suggested alternatives the Department has elected not to implement, see section IV.C.3.c (addressing \nrecommendations that background checks be conducted only at time of transfer) and section IV.B.1.b (addressing \nrecommendations that NICS checks alone are sufficient for NFA transfers).\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department recognizes comments received suggesting that the Department (1) require that CLEOs certify \nforms, (2) require that CLEOs provide reason for not certifying forms, (3) make judicial review available when a \nCLEO does not certify a form, and (4) expand the number and types of officials who may provide certifications. As \nthe certification has been replaced with a notification, the suggested changes are no longer a necessary part of the \nprocess. Additionally, the Department rejects comments proposing that ATF, rather than the applicant, provide a \ncopy of the application to the CLEO; ATF is prohibited from releasing an individual's tax return information.\n\n \n\n  The Department rejects the suggestion of collecting the \u201cexcise tax\u201d and printing out the tax stamp at the point of \nsale. The Department believes that allowing nongovernmental entities to issue tax stamps could lead to fraud and \nabuse.\n\n \n\n  The Department has not adopted suggestions that the fingerprints and photograph requirement be replaced by \nState permitting or licensing because such State-issued documents may not meet the biometric fingerprint check \nrequirements of 26 U.S.C. 5812 and because the background check process for each State-issued concealed \ncarry permit or license is different and not all permits or licenses qualify as an exception to a background check. \nAdditionally, it is unclear to what extent the Department has the legal authority to require local and State officials to \naid it in implementing Federal firearms regulations.\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes comments regarding exempting certain categories of persons and certain types of \nNFA firearms from CLEO certification. While CLEO certification has been replaced with a CLEO notification, all \napplicants, including active and retired law enforcement, active and retired military officers, and government \nemployees with security clearances, and all types of NFA firearms, including silencers, will be subject to the \nnotification requirement.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not adopt the suggestion of special markings on a driver's license for convicted felons. The \nDepartment does not have the authority to require this information on State-issued identification documents.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Fingerprints and Photographs for Background Checks</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Authority To Require Submission of Fingerprints and Photographs of Responsible Persons for Trusts and Legal \nEntities</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority to require photographs or \nfingerprints of responsible persons. One of these commenters, NFATCA, acknowledged that its 2009 petition \nrequested a requirement that responsible persons of legal entities submit photographs and fingerprints, but advised \nthat it has changed its conclusion as to the statutory authority of ATF to impose this requirement, and was \nwithdrawing its 2009 recommendation. A few commenters argued that the provision of the NFA that ATF cited as \nauthority for extending the photograph and fingerprint requirement to responsible persons of legal entities, section \n5812, does not support ATF's position because the text of that section extends the photograph and fingerprint \nrequirement only to individuals, and not to legal entities.  (8)  Because section 5812 of the statute specifically \nnames only one class of transfers covered by this requirement (i.e., individuals), they argue, ATF is without \nstatutory authority to extend it to any other type of transfer (i.e., those involving legal entities).\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with comments that this rulemaking exceeds its authority by requiring \nphotographs or fingerprints of responsible persons. Information that the Attorney General can seek is not limited to \nfingerprints and photographs for individuals. The inclusion of individual transfers as a specific category that requires \nthe submission of fingerprints and photographs in 26 U.S.C. 5812 does not equate to a limitation on the authority of \nATF to extend that requirement to transfers involving trusts or legal entities. See 26 U.S.C. 5812.\n\n \n\n  The Department believes it may require trusts and legal entities to submit identifying information regarding their \nresponsible persons as a component of the identifying information it requires a trust or legal entity to submit prior to \nobtaining authorization to receive or make an NFA firearm. Sections 5812 and 5822 provide broad authority for the \nDepartment to require the identifying information of any applicant to make or transfer an NFA firearm. Section 5812 \nprohibits the transfer of a firearm \u201cunless . . . the transferee is identified in the application form in such manner as \nATF may by regulations prescribe.\u201d Similarly, section 5822 prohibits the making of any firearm unless the maker \nhas \u201cidentified himself in the application form in such manner as ATF may prescribe.\u201d The Department views the \nidentities of responsible persons associated with trusts and legal entities as a vital aspect of the identities of those \nentities themselves. The very purpose of the NFA would be undermined if a criminal could use a trust or legal entity \nthe criminal controls to obtain an NFA firearm without submitting any personally identifying information to the \nDepartment.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Alternatives To Requiring All Responsible Persons To Provide Fingerprints and Photographs</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters asserted that all NFA applicants, including legal entities, should be required to undergo \nbackground checks and submit fingerprints and photographs. Some of these commenters differed, however, as to \nwhich individuals associated with a legal entity should be subject to these requirements. Several commenters \nsupported background checks for trustees only. A few commenters asserted that successor trustees and other \nmembers of trusts (other than the original trustee) should be excluded. Many commenters stated that beneficiaries \ndo not have actual possession and should also be excluded. Another commenter suggested requiring all \nresponsible persons to submit a background check annually to the \u201chead of the trust\u201d to be maintained on file, and \nto make that head person responsible for all law enforcement approvals. A few commenters supported \nbackground checks on the \u201cmain person\u201d in the trust or legal entity. Other commenters supported background \nchecks on a single responsible person only. Several commenters supported background checks only on the \nperson in the legal entity picking up the firearm.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters suggested requiring a one-time fingerprinting and background check of responsible persons \nassociated with a trust at the creation of the trust, not on every transfer of regulated items contained in the trust. \nAnother commenter suggested requiring only the executor to provide fingerprints and photographs and undergo a \nbackground check one time, and that this process be repeated whenever the executor dies or forfeits the \nexecutor's position to the next person appointed as executor or owner of the corporation. Another commenter \nsuggested only requiring fingerprints and photographs from trustees once, or perhaps once every ten years upon a \nnew NFA item form. This commenter urged that ATF also adopt the \u201conce every ten years rule\u201d for individuals, too.\n\n \n\n  In addition to recommendations specific to trusts and legal entities, several commenters suggested that ATF \ndevise alternative methods to identify individuals. Some commenters recommended the use of digital technology to \nsubmit photographs and fingerprints, citing as examples other Federal agencies such as the Securities and \n\n\n\nExchange Commission (which uses a digital fingerprinting service) and the Transportation Security Agency (which \nuses a digital service to perform background checks on its employees).\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with comments that beneficiaries should not generally be included in the definition of \nresponsible person and has removed beneficiaries from the definition in the final rule. The Department does not \nagree with comments that background checks should only be conducted on the \u201cmain person\u201d in the trust or legal \nentity, a single responsible person for the trust or legal entity, or only the person picking up the firearm. These \nrecommendations fail to account for multiple individuals within a trust or legal entity that will exercise control over \nNFA firearms. The \u201cresponsible person\u201d definition in the final rule accounts for such individuals, and requires them \nto meet the same requirements that apply to all other individuals who apply to make or possess an NFA firearm.\n\n \n\n  The Department concludes that proposals involving one-time or periodic background checks and submission of \nfingerprints and photographs\u2014for example at the creation of a trust or legal entity or only once every ten years\u2014do \nnot meet the NFA's requirement that each NFA transaction must be accompanied by an individual application and \nregistration. See 27 CFR 479.62 and 479.84. Moreover, such proposals do not adequately ensure that an \napplicant is not prohibited at the time each NFA weapon is made or acquired; a background check in conjunction \nwith each application is needed to ensure no change in status has occurred. With respect to allowing a single-\nsubmission of fingerprints and photographs, the NFRTR is a tax registry that does not have the technical capacity \nor statutory authorization to track such documents. The Department acknowledges that other Federal agencies \nutilize electronic fingerprinting technology. However, ATF does not currently have the resources to utilize this \ntechnology.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Legal Entities</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Purposes of Trusts and Legal Entities</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule ignored or misunderstood the common circumstances \nsurrounding the creation of an NFA trust, and did not account for the \u201cmyriad of innocuous and legitimate\u201d reasons \nwhy a trust would own an NFA item, for example to pass the NFA item to one's heirs. Several commenters stated \nthat the proposed rule, by naming a beneficiary as a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d deprived individuals from common estate \nplanning techniques (e.g., using living trusts and naming their minor children as beneficiaries). In addition, a few \ncommenters stated that the proposed rule intruded upon the traditional uses of trusts and upon the rights of settlors \nto manage their estate plans by proposing that any new responsible person must submit a Form 5320.23 as well as \na CLEO signoff within 30 days of the responsible person's appointment.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that trust use is on the increase as many people live in areas where the CLEO simply \nwill not sign an NFA certification, causing law-abiding citizens to use trusts and corporations to bypass the CLEO \ncertification requirement in order to lawfully make or obtain an NFA weapon. One of these commenters added, \n\u201c[t]he simple truth is, corporations and trusts are formed NOT to circumvent background checks, but to take power \naway from an antiquated unfair system of CLEO signoff.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n  Many commenters stated that a trust's main purpose is to hold assets, property, and expensive collector \ninvestments for inheritance, and as such is a critical estate planning and management tool. Other commenters \nstated that trusts are being used to lawfully permit multiple people and families to share access to, and use, legally \nowned and registered NFA items. These commenters noted that without a trust, only the person who directly \npurchased the NFA item can lawfully possess it. Another commenter asserted that absent ownership by a trust the \nNFA item must always be in the registered individual's possession when it is out of the safe. Several commenters \nnoted that the NFA makes it unlawful for any person \u201cto possess a firearm that is not registered to him in the \nNational Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 5861(d). Hence, if the item is registered only to an \nindividual, and not a trust or legal entity, then family members of the registrant who possess or use the NFA item \nare exposing themselves to serious criminal charges. See 26 U.S.C. 5871, 5872. Several commenters provided \npersonal examples where trusts prevented legal complications by allowing possession of the NFA item by \nindividuals named in a trust during life changing events (e.g., military deployment or death).\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that a trust eases the burden of transferring NFA items upon the death of the \ngrantor/settlor. Other commenters stated that a trust prevents the need to pay a $200 transfer tax, amounting to a \n\u201cdouble tax,\u201d and file another Form 4 to transfer and retain the property, should one of the family members die \nbefore the other family member. Other commenters stated that trusts are used to ensure that remaining family \nmembers could not be prosecuted for being in possession of an illegal firearm upon death of the person who \nobtained the NFA tax stamp. Several other commenters stated that another benefit to a trust is that a settlor can list \nthe settlor's children as beneficiaries, and after the settlor's death, a trustee will continue to oversee the items until \nthe children are of legal age to possess the items. Many commenters also stated that these beneficiaries should not \nhave to submit to their civil liberties being violated simply because they inherited private property.\n\n \n\n  Two commenters stated that most (NFA) trusts are being used to lawfully obtain silencers. These commenters \nstated that if ATF really desired to reduce the use of trusts, it should remove silencers from the NFA \u201clist.\u201d Several \ncommenters noted that trusts are established in a variety of contexts (e.g., voluntary or mandated by law; by a \ndecedent's will or during the lifetime of a settlor), and some of the contexts should \u201camelioriate\u201d concerns regarding \npotential misuse. These commenters, and others, noted that many trusts are specialized and designed as \u201cgun \ntrusts\u201d with safeguards, pertinent to the settlor, trustees, and beneficiaries, to ensure compliance with the regulation \nof NFA firearms.\n\n \n\n  A commenter noted that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that a trust is a proper legal entity for holding a \nfirearm where the settlor was prohibited, provided that the trust included proper safeguards to ensure that a \nprohibited person did not possess the firearm. Miller, 588 F.3d 418. Some commenters noted that trust agreements \nmay exclude prohibited persons. Several commenters provided examples of language and provisions in trusts \ndesigned specifically to hold NFA items that required full compliance by all members and trustees with laws \ngoverning possession of NFA firearms. For example, one commenter cited to provisions in her trust stating that \n\u201cany trustee that is or becomes an ineligible person as defined by Federal law or State law must be deemed as to \nhave immediately resigned and must immediately surrender all NFA items held on behalf of the trust.\u201d Several \ncommenters asserted that ATF should set a wide variety of requirements necessary for a trust to hold NFA items.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that, if necessary, ATF could add additional language to the transferee's certification, \nsimilar to that already found in Forms 1, 4, and 5, to ensure that the responsible person understands that it is \nunlawful to make the firearms available to prohibited persons, and could add a definition of \u201cprohibited person\u201d \nconsistent with 18 U.S.C. 922(g) in the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section of the application. This commenter proposed specific \nlanguage for this purpose.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department is aware of the legitimate reasons individuals may choose to utilize a trust or legal entity to \nacquire an NFA item. These include facilitating the transfer of an NFA item to a decedent's heirs and providing a \nmechanism that allows several individuals to lawfully possess the same NFA item. To the extent that courts have \nrecognized a felon's ability to employ a trust or other device to maintain an ownership interest, so long as there is \nno ability to physically possess or control the firearm, trusts have been employed. The Department also recognizes \nthat some trusts created to hold NFA assets contain provisions seeking to ensure that Federal, State, and local \nlaws regarding possession and transfer of NFA firearms are not violated.\n\n \n\n  The final rule that the Department is promulgating is not designed or intended to reduce the use of trusts for estate \nplanning or other lawful purposes. Instead, provisions of the final rule are intended to facilitate the ability of trusts \nand legal entities to comply with the statutory requirements of the NFA through the establishment of tailored \nmechanisms that help ensure prohibited persons are not able to misuse such entities to illegally obtain NFA \nfirearms. The final rule accomplishes this objective by defining as responsible persons those individuals associated \nwith a trust or legal entity who are able to control firearms, and requiring those individuals to undergo the \nbackground checks and submit fingerprints and photographs required by statute and ATF's regulations.\n\n \n\n  With respect to the concerns voiced by many commenters regarding the impact a new rule may have on estate \nplanning, the provisions of the final rule do not materially alter long-existing procedures ATF has established to \nfacilitate the registration of NFA firearms to legal heirs. Those procedures take into account that a decedent's \nregistered NFA firearm(s) must be managed by the executor or administrator of the estate, and provide for a \nreasonable amount of time to arrange for the transfer of the firearms to the lawful heir. They further provide that a \ndecedent's registered NFA firearm(s) may be conveyed tax-exempt to lawful heirs as an \u201cinvoluntary transfer\u201d \nresulting from the death of the registrant.\n\n \n\n  In promulgating the final rule, the Department has also evaluated the assertions by several commenters that:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   New Federal regulations are not necessary because many trusts designed to hold NFA assets contain voluntary, \nself-imposed, provisions designed to preclude prohibited persons from acquiring NFA weapons through the trust\n\n  \n\n   ATF should set requirements mandating provisions in trust agreements for trusts that acquire NFA weapons\n\n \n\n \n\n  With respect to the assertion that trust self-regulation renders new regulation unnecessary, the Department notes \nthat ATF has no authority to enforce private trust agreements, nor may private trusts have the authority to obtain \nNICS background checks of associated individuals. Hence, self-regulation does not adequately ensure statutory \ncompliance. With respect to suggestions ATF should regulate the terms of trust agreements for trust holding NFA \nfirearms, ATF believes it is more efficient and effective simply to require responsible persons to submit to \nbackground checks than to dictate the language in trust documents.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Finally, the Department does not agree with commenters' assertions that additional language needs to be added \nto the certification in ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5 regarding firearm possession by prohibited persons. The instructions \non these Forms already include specific information on who is considered a prohibited person.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Number of Trust and Legal Entity Form 1, 4, and 5 Applications</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter desired more information and clarification concerning the number of legal entities that file Form 1, 4, \nand 5 applications. This commenter stated that the NFATCA petition\u2014as described by the NPRM, section II. \nPetition\u2014contends that the number of applications to acquire NFA firearms via a legal entity has increased \nsignificantly. This commenter noted that this same section of the NPRM also provided ATF research data showing \nthat the number of Form 1, 4, and 5 applications submitted to ATF by legal entities that are not FFLs have \nincreased from \u201capproximately 840 in 2000 to 12,000 in 2009 and to 40,700 in 2012.\u201d This commenter could not \ndetermine ATF's statistical methodologies, as they were \u201cneither stated nor explained\u201d in the NPRM, and ATF's \nanalyses did not seem to allow for the same legal entity filing multiple Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during the \nreporting periods CY 2000, CY 2009, and CY 2012. The commenter contended that it was not uncommon for a \nlegal entity (or an individual) to file multiple Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during a single calendar year. In addition, \nthis commenter noted that ATF did not provide corresponding data to show how many non-legal entities or natural \npersons submitted to ATF Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during the same reporting periods (i.e., CY 2000, CY 2009, \nand CY 2012). As a result, this commenter maintained that ATF's methodologies used in the NPRM left many \nimportant questions unanswered, including:\n\n \n\n  (1) What are the actual number of separate and distinct Legal Entities that submitted ATF Form 1, 4, and 5 \napplications during these same reporting periods, including CY 2000, CY 2009, and CY 2012?\n\n \n\n  (2) What are the actual number of separate and distinct non-Legal Entities or natural persons that submitted ATF \nForm 1, 4, and 5 applications during these same reporting periods, including CY 2000, CY 2009, and CY 2012?\n\n \n\n  (3) What is the increase (or decrease) in the actual number of separate and distinct Legal Entities that submitted \nATF Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during these same reporting periods, including CY 2000, CY 2009, and CY \n2012?\n\n \n\n  (4) What is the increase (or decrease) in the actual number of separate and distinct non-Legal Entities or natural \npersons that submitted ATF Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during these same reporting periods, including CY 2000, \nCY 2009, and CY 2012?\n\n \n\n  (5) How does the increase (or decrease) in the actual number of separate and distinct Legal Entities that \nsubmitted ATF Form 1, 4, and 5 applications compare with the increase (or decrease) in the actual number of \nseparate and distinct non-Legal Entities or natural persons that submitted ATF Form 1, 4, and 5 applications during \nthese same reporting periods, including CY 2000, CY 2009, and CY 2012?\n\n \n\n  Another commenter also desired information regarding parties that file multiple applications, and asked how many \nof the applications received during the CY 2012 represent parties who have applied for more than one NFA-\nregistered item.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that there was an \u201cunexplained discrepancy\u201d between the numbers that ATF used in \nTable A of the NPRM for the number of applications for legal entities received in 2012 and the numbers ATF used \nin its \u201cFirearms Commerce in the United States Annual Statistical Update 2013\u201d (ATF's 2013 Statistical Update), \navailable at https://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf-files/052013-firearms-commerce-in-the-us-annual-\nupdate.pdf. This commenter provided statistics from Exhibit 7 of this statistical update, which showed the number of \napplications for CY 2012 as totaling 230,937 with the number of applications for Form 1 as 7,886; Form 4 as \n52,490; and Form 5 as 170,561. This commenter noted that ATF's 2013 statistical update did not break down the \napplication numbers for legal entities, individuals, or qualified FFLs (Gov/FFLs) so the commenter did not have any \nnumbers to compare with the breakdown done in the NPRM, Table A. However, this commenter compared the \nnumbers provided in Table A of the NPRM with those in ATF's 2013 Statistical Update Exhibit 7 as follows:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    \u2003\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Table A CY 2012 # applications\n\n     \n\n      Statistical Update CY 2012 # applications\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 1: 9,662\n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 1: 7,886.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 4: 65,085\n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 4: 52,490.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 5: 9,688\n\n     \n\n      ATF Form 5: 170,561.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total: 84,435\n\n     \n\n      Total: 230,937.\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  This commenter stated that ATF has not explained why it excluded over 146,500 legal entity applications in its \nbasis for rationalizing the proposed rule change, as well as its cost and economic impact analyses. As a result, this \ncommenter stated that ATF's inaction called into question the \u201cvalidity and integrity of the assumptions, arguments, \nanalyses, and conclusions\u201d in the proposed rule. Therefore, this commenter asked ATF to clarify and revise, if \nneeded, its statistical methodology.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department has carefully considered all commenters' concerns relating to the number of legal entities that file \nForm 1, 4, and 5 applications. For purposes of the NPRM, ATF conducted an analysis of all applications actually \nreceived in the NFA Branch in CY 2012.\n\n \n\n  The total number of transfers to trusts, corporations, governmental entities, and individuals cited in the NPRM \nwere taken from the total number of all applications received. When an application is received in the NFA Branch it \nis counted one time. Additionally, each application covers the transfer of a separate firearm with a separate and \nunique serial number. Thus, the transfer or making of an NFA firearm is counted each and every time an application \nis submitted. There is no system in place that counts the number of applications received at different times from the \nsame applicant. However, such a system would have been irrelevant for purposes of the NPRM. The key fact is \nthe number of transfers made by legal entities without a background check. The fact that legal entities may have \nmade more than one transfer does not lessen the concern. Also, for purposes of the final rule, new numbers for CY \n2014 have been compiled. Those new numbers will cover only those applications that have been processed with a \nfinal determination, as opposed to all applications received regardless of a final determination.\n\n \n\n  The Department did not prepare an analytical impact statement concerning non-legal entities as the definition of \n\u201cPerson\u201d in section 479.11 does not use the term. Applicants who submit Forms 1, 4, and 5 are identified as trusts, \nlegal entities, governmental entities, FFLs and individuals. Further, as some commenters noted, the NPRM did not \nreflect any increase or decrease in the number of individuals (natural persons), government entities, or FFLs who \nsubmitted Form 1, 4, or 5 applications for CY 2000 or 2009 because the NPRM in part was a response to inquiries \non legal entities as identified in the petition from NFATCA. The NPRM in Table A does reflect a breakdown of the \ntype of forms received by corresponding categories in order to compare the costs to those applicants who are \ncurrently required to submit fingerprints, photographs, and CLEO certifications with the costs reflected in the final \nrule that will require each responsible persons of a trust or legal entity to submit the same personal information to \nATF before a trust or legal entity is allowed to make or have transferred to it an NFA firearm.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Some comments noted a possible discrepancy between ATF's 2013 Statistical Update and Table A of the 2012 \nNPRM. The difference appears to be attributable to the fact that the NPRM counted the number of applications \nreceived in CY 2012, whereas the Statistical Update counted the number of firearms processed in CY 2012. ATF \nprocessed fewer Forms 1 and 4 than it received in CY 2012, which is why there are fewer firearms processed than \napplications received in those categories. The 170,561 number used in relation to Form 5 in ATF's 2013 Statistical \nUpdate reflects the total number of firearms processed on Form 5 applications for CY 2012 from all applicants to \nmake or transfer firearms, i.e., trusts, individuals, government entities, etc. The total does not reflect an actual \nnumber of separate and distinct legal entities or \u201cnon-legal entities\u201d; however, the NFRTR contains each registered \nNFA firearm by serial number. As an example, the NFA Branch may receive one Form 5 from a transferor (FFL) to \ntransfer 20-40 NFA firearms at one time to a large governmental entity, i.e., a police department, at one time. Each \nindividual firearm that is transferred is counted. See section VI.A.2 for additional details about the numbers of \npersons who submit ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Alternative Approach to Legal Entities</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters stated that ATF's \u201cone-size-fits-all solution\u201d failed to consider that trusts and legal entities \nvary widely and differ in purposes and structure. These commenters asserted that ATF should engage in a \nproactive assessment of each trust and legal entity, first reviewing the documentation establishing each trust or \nlegal entity and determine whether the creators and operators of a particular trust or legal entity have taken \nappropriate safeguards to prevent prohibited persons from using the trust or legal entity to acquire NFA firearms. If \nATF finds that the particular trust or legal entity did not take appropriate safeguards, only then should ATF subject \nthat trust or legal entity to additional scrutiny and impose default requirements such as \u201cspecially designed \nprovisions addressing firearms issues.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Another commenter recommended excluding specific trust roles from the \u201cresponsible person\u201d definition, including \nsuccessor trustees, beneficiaries, and contingent beneficiaries and that successor trustees should be expressly \nexcluded until they become a trustee. Another commenter described the types of individuals who are generally trust \nbeneficiaries (e.g., children), which, although not specifically stated by the commenter, leads one to the conclusion \nthat beneficiaries should not be deemed responsible persons.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters recommended exemptions or clarifications for trust members and executors. For instance, a \ncommenter suggested exempting members of the trust that are related by lawful marriage and adoption, and \nthrough the commonplace definitions of family. Another commenter suggested that if ATF removes the option for a \ntrust that ATF \u201camend the classification of individual to include immediate family\u201d as he would \u201clove to pass down \n[his] NFA items to [his] children.\u201d Another commenter suggested clarifying wording to allow the executor or an \nestate temporary possession and that would not be considered a transfer, which according to the commenter is \nmuch needed for those with trusts.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested requiring that trust members include their Social Security numbers when \nsubmitting a Form 1 or Form 4. In addition, when a new member is added to a trust, the trust must include that new \nmember's Social Security number when a new Form 1 or Form 4 is submitted.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter believes that only the main person in the trust should be held responsible for the others \nnamed in the trust. This same commenter also supported doing a background check on the main person in the \ntrust when the trust is formed but was against having to recheck background checks every single time they get an \n\n\n\nNFA item. Another commenter suggested only requiring photographs and fingerprints for the settlor/grantor of the \ntrust. This commenter stated that the settlor/grantor is the person who completes the Form 4473, undergoes the \nbackground check at the time of transfer, and is ultimately responsible for how the trust items are disposed of and \nused.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters suggested other alternative processes for legal entities. A commenter suggested that ATF \nautomate Form 1 and Form 4 transactions to tie them into the Form 4473 background check process, and that all \nlisted trustees or legal entities be included in this process. Another commenter suggested that if the issue is with \ntrusts and having all trust members submit their information to ATF, that ATF create a new FFL classification and \nfollow the \u201cwell established and functioning process\u201d of the FFL system. Another commenter suggested that ATF \ncould achieve its goals through establishing an NFA equivalent of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Global \nEntry System. Such a system would enable ATF to perform a \u201csingle extensive\u201d background check on each trust \nmember and would simplify background checks for future trust purchases.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested that ATF allow corporations or trusts to file the necessary information separately, \nand not be included in the Form 1 or Form 4 submission. The legal entity could then electronically file (e-file) the tax \nstamp request. Another commenter suggested that, for any NFA item that a trust or legal entity purchases, the \ntransaction include either a NICS check or the presentation of a State-issued carry permit to complete a Form \n4473.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter recommended that for trust applications, ATF accept the Affidavit of Trust instead of requiring \nthe full trust document be submitted. This commenter contended that the full trust document is not relevant for \nfirearm approval, and would lessen the paperwork for the applicant and improve the processing times and reduce \nthe burden for ATF. Another commenter asked that ATF consider requiring members of trusts to be issued a license \nsimilar to the process for a concealed carry weapon license.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested that ATF permit trusts, partnerships, and other corporate entities to transfer any \nNFA items to an individual on a tax-free basis for a one year period.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department is aware that there are differences in purpose and structure among various trusts and legal \nentities; these differences, however, do not provide an appropriate basis to apply different standards when applying \nthe provisions of the NFA.\n\n \n\n  The Department rejects the suggestion that it review the documentation establishing each trust or legal entity and \ndetermine whether the creators and operators of that trust or legal entity took appropriate safeguards to prevent \nprohibited persons from using the trust or legal entity to acquire NFA firearms. The Department believes that it is \nmore efficient and effective to ensure, at a minimum, that all trusts and legal entities do not have any responsible \npersons who are prohibited from possessing NFA firearms. The Department believes that it is the responsibility of \nthose trusts and legal entities to take all other appropriate measures to ensure that they comply with State and \nFederal law. Additionally, requiring that the Department determine whether trusts and legal entities had sufficient \nsafeguards in place to prevent NFA firearms from coming into the possession of prohibited persons would be costly \nand time consuming.\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department does not agree with the suggestion that it should require only the acting trustee to submit \nfingerprints and photographs and receive a CLEO signature. Depending on the terms of the trust, additional people \nbeyond the acting trustee may have the power and authority, directly or indirectly, to direct the management and \npolicies of the entity insofar as they pertain to firearms.\n\n \n\n  The Department also does not agree with performing the background check at the time of the NFA transfer, as \nthis would necessarily take place after the application is approved. Such a process is not consistent with the \nstatutory requirements of section 5812(a) (providing that applications shall be denied if the transfer, receipt, or \npossession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of the law) and section 5822 (providing that \napplications shall be denied if the making or possession of the firearm would place the person making the firearm in \nviolation of law). Prior to approving the application, ATF must verify that the person is not prohibited from making, \nreceiving, or possessing the firearm. This cannot be accomplished by having the FFL conduct the background \ncheck at the time of the transfer. See section IV.C.4 for responses relating to the definition of \u201cresponsible \npersons.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The Department rejects the suggestion that it exempt family members from the definition of \u201cresponsible persons\u201d \nas these are the individuals most likely to be named as grantors, trustees, or beneficiaries in the trust, and family \nmembers may be prohibited persons. However, the Department agrees that certain individuals associated with \ntrusts should not generally be considered responsible persons, including beneficiaries. As previously stated, the \nfinal rule includes an amended definition of responsible person to make clear that beneficiaries and certain other \nindividuals typically fall outside the definition.\n\n \n\n  The Department has chosen not to require Social Security numbers on the Form 5320.23 for responsible persons, \nnor on Forms 1, 4, and 5. The Department believes such information is not necessary to be included on these forms \nbecause the information is already requested on the FBI Form FD-258 (fingerprint card) used for conducting the \nnecessary background checks.\n\n \n\n  The Department rejects the suggestion that it only require the Affidavit of Trust to verify that an applicant is a \ngenuine trust. That document does not contain all the information necessary to verify that it is a valid trust and may \nnot contain all the information necessary to verify who is a responsible person for the trust.\n\n \n\n  Regarding alternate means of conducting background checks, the Department believes that using NICS in \nconjunction with a fingerprint-based background check provides the best option. The NICS has access to several \nFederal databases that contain information relevant to determining whether a person is prohibited from possessing \na firearm, and since its inception has identified over two million prohibited persons attempting to purchase firearms \nand denied transfers to those individuals. Additionally, the fingerprint-based background check may identify a \ndisqualifying criminal record under another name.\n\n \n\n  The transfer tax is fixed by statute, see 26 U.S.C. 5811(a), and ATF does not have the authority to waive transfer \ntaxes except in very limited circumstances not applicable to the types of transfers commenters wish to see \nexempted.\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Definition of \u201cResponsible Person\u201d</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Ambiguous and Poorly Reasoned Definition</h5>\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. Definition Is Overly Broad and Includes, by Title, Many Individuals Associated With Trusts and Legal Entities \nThat May Have No Power or Authority</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters stated that the interpretation of the definition of responsible person could mean that any person \nwho has possession of a firearm could be required to get CLEO certification. The commenters also stated that \n\u201cnowhere in the law is every member of an organization held accountable for every action of the organization.\u201d A \nfew other commenters stated that every employee of an FFL is not required to be listed as a responsible person on \nthe license, so there is no reason to require everyone associated with a legal entity to be designated as a \nresponsible person. Two other commenters stated that by requiring fingerprints, photographs, and CLEO signature \nfor each responsible person, it increases the burden to both applicants and CLEOs, and could become an \nadministrative nightmare. One of the two commenters also asked, since ATF anticipates a requirement for \nnotification in changes of responsible persons, \u201c[w]ill trustees be aware of such a requirement and practically be \nable to comply?\u201d Another commenter, an attorney, stated that every corporation has shareholders and that \nextending the definition of responsible person to include all shareholders defeats the purpose of the corporation and \n\u201coverrides well developed statutory case law relating to corporate governance and property ownership rights.\u201d The \ncommenter also stated that the proposed rule eliminates the advantages of corporations and their ability to exercise \ntheir right to own property. Another commenter asked whether beneficiaries who are under the age of 21 years old, \nwho may live in different States, and who do not have any authority to possess, transport, or acquire NFA firearms, \nwould be required to obtain photographs, fingerprints, and the CLEO signature. Another commenter, a licensed \nNFA dealer, stated that given the broad definition of responsible person as related to trusts, and the possible \ncriminal consequence of non-compliance, entities have no choice but to err on the side of over-inclusion, which \nplaces a burden on both the entity and ATF. The commenter suggested that there might be hundreds or thousands \nof responsible persons for a single entity, and gave the example of a corporation with headquarters in Maryland \nwith over 4000 employees located in 38 States. A few commenters, including a licensed manufacturer, stated that \nthe definition is too broad and exceeds both what is reasonable and the definition of responsible person currently \nused for FFLs.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters noted that the definition for responsible person appears to extend to beneficiaries of a trust \nholding NFA firearms, and even to successor trustees, remainder beneficiaries, and trust protectors. The \ncommenter noted, however, that in a typical trust document, the trustee is the only person with legal title to any \nitems in such a trust, and that the \u201cbeneficial interest\u201d of the beneficiary does not vest until the time specified in the \ntrust.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that the proposed definition for responsible person exceeds the definition of \nresponsible person used for handling explosives. This commenter asked if ATF intended to extend the CLEO's \n\u201cveto\u201d to explosives workers. Another commenter stated that the proposed definition was very vague on which \n\u201centity\u201d could decide who would be a responsible person. This commenter expressed concern that any government \nagency could be capable of making that decision. Another commenter recognized the need to define responsible \nperson; however, this commenter expressed concern that if the government alone defined the term that it might \nallow them more power over which persons could exercise their right to bear arms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department has reviewed the definition in the proposed rule and amended it to address concerns about its \nbreadth while maintaining the important objective of ensuring background checks for relevant parties associated \nwith a trust or legal entity. As in the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d in the NPRM, the definition of \u201cresponsible \nperson\u201d in this final rule applies to those who possess the power or authority to direct the management and policies \nof an entity insofar as they pertain to firearms. This addresses commenters' concerns that shareholders and others \nwho are associated with an entity are not always in a position to possess the entity's firearms. It should be noted \nthat if an individual has the power or authority to direct the management and policies for a legal entity, that \nindividual would fall within the definition of \u201cresponsible person.\u201d Trusts differ from legal entities in that those \npossessing the trust property\u2014trustees\u2014are also the individuals who possess the power and authority to direct the \nmanagement and policies of the trust insofar as they pertain to trust property, including firearms.  (9)  As it applies \nto trusts, the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d in this final rule serves the dual purpose of requiring these \nindividuals to undergo background checks while also addressing the commenters' concerns about unnecessarily \nrequiring background checks of individuals who would not, or could not, possess the firearms. Depending on how \nthe trust is set up, the identity of trust beneficiaries may remain uncertain for a period of time or may include \nindividuals who will not possess the firearms. Therefore, the Department believes that it is not necessary to \npositively identify a beneficiary as a \u201cresponsible person\u201d within the definition.  (10)  However, under the amended \ndefinition, beneficiaries and other individuals will be considered responsible persons if they meet the criteria for \ndesignation as responsible persons because of their capacity to control the management or disposition of a relevant \nfirearm on behalf of a trust or legal entity.\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d in this final rule appropriately addresses \nconcerns that the necessary individuals receive background checks before receiving NFA firearms, and that the \npotentially large number of individuals who are merely associated with the trust or legal entity, but will not possess \nfirearms, are not required to submit applications. Further, the Department notes that under 18 U.S.C. 922(g), it \nremains unlawful for a prohibited person to possess firearms. Similarly, under section 922(d) it remains unlawful for \nany person to sell or deliver a firearm to any prohibited person if that person knows or has reasonable cause to \nbelieve the person is prohibited. For responses to comments on CLEO certification see section IV.C.1. As noted \npreviously, ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5 will be updated to reflect the definition of responsible persons in the final rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree that including shareholders in the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d defeats the \npurpose of a corporation, as a shareholder will only be a responsible person if the shareholder possesses, directly \nor indirectly, the power or authority to direct the management and policies of the entity insofar as they pertain to \nfirearms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Beneficiaries Are Often Minors or Not Yet Born, Presenting a Challenge to Proposal That Beneficiaries Submit \nFingerprints, Photographs and a CLEO Certification</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated in a form letter that the proposed rule interferes with the lawful use of trusts for estate \nplanning. These same commenters stated that the overly broad definition of a responsible person means \ncontemplating the \u201cabsurd possibility of fingerprinting, photographing, and securing CLEO sign-offs for unborn \nchildren.\u201d Another commenter, who holds a trust, stated that the proposed rule places a hardship on his family and \ntrust by possibly requiring fingerprints of his elderly grandmother and his two-year-old and five-year-old children. \nAnother commenter, a trust holder, asked how the definition of responsible persons applies to minor beneficiaries in \na trust, and asked if ATF is proposing the fingerprinting and photographing of minor children who lawfully cannot \npossess a firearm. Other commenters also asked about the need for CLEO certification, as well as fingerprints and \nphotographs, for children and minors. At least one commenter specifically argued that his CLEO would not provide \n\n\n\na certification for beneficiaries. Many commenters questioned the practicality of requiring fingerprints and \nphotographs for minors, and wondered how this would be done, in particular on babies and young children. Many \ncommenters stated that a background check for beneficiaries is more appropriately conducted at the time an item \nin the NFA trust is actually transferred to them from the trust. Another commenter questioned whether doing a \nbackground check on a minor beneficiary would have any benefit, and asked if a background check would show \nthe chances of committing a felony or domestic violence in the future. Another commenter asked if the \nrequirements for photographs, fingerprints, and CLEO certification do not apply to minors, would the minor upon \nturning 18 need to submit these required items?\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  As noted, the Department agrees that beneficiaries should not generally be included in the definition of \nresponsible person. The definition of responsible person has been amended and no longer includes beneficiaries \nas a typical example of a \u201cresponsible person.\u201d\n\n <h5>\n\n  iii. Challenge in Determining Who Qualifies as a Responsible Person</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters, most of whom have trusts, and an FFL, noted in a form letter that the Department's definition \nof responsible persons is different for different types of entities. They stated that based on the Department's general \ndefinition of a responsible person, and the complexity of trust laws, they would need to speak to a lawyer to \ndetermine who in their trust would be considered a responsible person. Ninety-eight of the same commenters, all of \nwhom have trusts, also stated that their trust includes beneficiaries who are under 18 years old and that they would \nneed to speak to a lawyer to get a clear answer about whether they fall under the responsible person definition.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters asked various questions concerning companies that own NFA firearms and how they are to \ndetermine who counts as responsible persons. A commenter asked if such companies would have to \u201cphotograph, \nfingerprint, and complete a favorable background check\u201d on each individual before accepting that individual as an \nemployee or partner. This commenter also asked if a stockholder would be viewed as having ownership of the \ncorporate assets such that they would need to be fingerprinted. Another commenter stated that the proposed rule \nleft many unanswered questions concerning its definition of a responsible person, including whether and when \nminor trust beneficiaries would qualify.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The final rule incorporates a new definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d that addresses many of the questions and \nconcerns raised by these comments, including the concerns about trust beneficiaries who are minors. That said, the \nDepartment agrees that in some cases persons may need to seek legal counsel to determine who is a responsible \nperson for purposes of this rule. The Department notes, however, that many of the trust applications it currently \nreviews were prepared with the advice or assistance of a lawyer. As a result, it is not clear whether the overall need \nfor legal counsel will increase or decrease because of this rule. The Department anticipates, for example, that \npersons who have used a trust in the past to avoid the CLEO certification requirement may well choose to acquire \nfuture NFA firearms as individuals once the CLEO certification requirement has been modified to a notification \nrequirement, thereby diminishing the overall need for legal counsel among makers and transferees.\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Proof of Citizenship for Responsible Persons</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several hundred commenters objected to the proposed requirement that any responsible person of a legal entity \nprove citizenship as part of submitting an application to transfer or possess NFA items. The bases for this objection \nvaried from an ideological opposition to ever having to prove citizenship to an observation that not all aliens are \nprohibited from possessing firearms under Federal law. Other commenters approved of the requirement to \ndemonstrate citizenship, even though they were otherwise opposed to the rule.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Under Federal law (18 U.S.C. 922(g)(5)(B)) it is generally unlawful for any alien admitted to the United States \nunder a nonimmigrant visa to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting \ncommerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition that has been shipped or \ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce. This prohibition extends to NFA firearms. Federal law (18 U.S.C. \n922(y)(2)) also provides certain exceptions to this prohibition. As a result, before ATF can approve an NFA \nregistration request it must determine if the applicant or transferee is a U.S. citizen, and if the applicant or \ntransferee is not a citizen, whether the applicant or transferee falls within the prohibition or exceptions described \nabove. This requirement is not unique to NFA transfers. For example, the ATF Form 4473 requires the transferee or \nbuyer to respond to questions to determine if the transferee or buyer is an alien admitted under a nonimmigrant \nvisa, and if so, whether the transferee or buyer qualifies for an exception to the section 922(g)(5)(B) prohibition. On \nthe ATF Form 7 (5310.12), Application for Federal Firearms License, the applicant is required to provide the \napplicant's country of citizenship and nonimmigrant aliens are required to certify compliance with 18 U.S.C. \n922(g)(5)(B). This rule simply applies the same requirement to NFA registration documents in order to assure \ncompliance with Federal law.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. General Applicability Questions</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule gave rise to many unanswered questions, especially about the \noperation of the CLEO certification requirement in jurisdictions where CLEOs were reluctant or refused to provide \nthe certification, regardless of the applicant's background. Another commenter asked how the rule would apply \nwhen, following the transfer, some or all of the responsible persons are replaced, and whether the answer would be \ndifferent based upon the type of legal entity involved.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  As indicated in section IV.C.1 the Department has replaced the CLEO certification requirement with a CLEO \nnotification requirement. This change renders moot many of the hypothetical questions submitted by commenters, \nincluding those that focus on jurisdictions in which obtaining CLEO certification is hindered for \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons.\n\n \n\n\n\n  With respect to issues raised by the prospect of a post-transfer change in responsible parties, this rule does not \nrequire that ATF be notified of such changes. In the NPRM, the Department indicated that it was considering a \nrequirement that new responsible persons submit Form 5320.23 within 30 days of a change in responsible persons \nat a trust or legal entity. After receiving several public comments on this issue, the Department is not requiring in \nthis final rule that new responsible persons submit a Form 5320.23 within 30 days of any change in responsible \npersons.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Alternatives to Definition</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A number of commenters took issue with the proposed definition of \u201cresponsible person.\u201d Some found it vague and \noverly broad. Others argued for a more finite definition, with some suggesting specific alternative definitions. Quite a \nfew argued that, depending on the nature of the trust or legal entity, and the roles performed by persons associated \nwith the trust or legal entity, ATF should permit designation of a sole or primary responsible person, thereby \nminimizing the burden associated with processing the application.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that whether an individual meets the definition of a responsible person will depend \non the structure of the trust or legal entity acquiring the firearm and who within that structure has the power and \nauthority to direct the management or policy of the trust or legal entity pertaining to firearms. The final rule provides \nguidance to persons seeking to acquire an NFA firearm for a trust or legal entity about who qualifies as a \nresponsible person under most routine circumstances. For example, under the terms of a trust, if a minor child does \nnot have the power and authority to direct the management and policy of the trust, and is not authorized under any \ntrust instrument, or under State law, to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a \nfirearm for, or on behalf of, the trust, the minor child would not meet the definition of a responsible person. \nAdditionally, beneficiaries do not appear in the non-exclusive list of possible \u201cresponsible persons\u201d in the definition \nand will not be considered responsible persons unless they meet the definition set out in the final rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees that trusts and legal entities may have complex structures. However it is the responsibility \nof each trust, association, partnership, LLC, or corporation to determine which individuals within its structure are \nresponsible persons under this rule. The Department does not agree with comments limiting the responsible person \nto only one individual per trust or legal entity because multiple individuals may have the power and authority to \nmake decisions for the trust or legal entity, or otherwise meet the definition of \u201cresponsible person.\u201d This includes \nco-trustees, members of the board of directors, or controlling members of an LLC.\n\n \n\n  The Department has amended the originally proposed definition of \u201cresponsible person,\u201d see supra section \nIV.C.4.a, and the Department believes those revisions provide the clarity that many of the commenters requested, \nalbeit without accepting some of their specific suggestions.\n\n \n\n  The Department further believes that it is the duty of individuals having the power or authority to direct the \nmanagement and policies of the trust or legal entity to ensure that prohibited persons do not have access to \nfirearms.\n\n <h4>\n\n  D. Comments on Proposed Rule's Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  1. Executive Order 12866</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters argued that the proposed rule violated or failed to comply with Executive Order 12866, an \norder which a few of these commenters noted was \u201crevived by\u201d Executive Order 13497. In general, these \ncommenters took issue with ATF's cost-benefit analysis of the rule, finding that analysis to be lacking for a host of \nreasons including that ATF (1) failed to identify the existence of a problem the proposed rule was intended to solve; \n(2) failed to credibly assess costs and benefits of the proposed rule or consider more cost effective alternatives; (3) \nfailed to properly estimate the full economic costs; (4) failed to properly weigh those costs against the expected \nbenefits; (5) relied upon \u201cspurious and anecdotal incidents\u201d and \u201cspeculative logic\u201d to justify the proposed rule; and, \n(6) by failing to conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis, improperly considered the rule not to be a significant \nregulatory action. Several commenters requested that ATF conduct an \u201cin-depth,\u201d \u201cdetailed\u201d financial impact study \nto assess the rule's costs and \u201cactual, tangible benefits.\u201d\n\n \n\n  In addition, a few commenters argued that, in particular, the rule's extension of the CLEO certification requirement \nviolated sections 1(b)(9) and (11) of Executive Order 12866 by failing to adopt the least burdensome effective \nalternative.\n\n \n\n  A commenter supported the estimates in the proposed rule, and concluded that the public safety benefits\u2014\nexpanding background checks to legal entities and ensuring fewer firearms would be possessed by prohibited \npersons\u2014were \u201cmassive\u201d and far outweighed any minor monetary or time costs to potential makers or acquirers of \nNFA firearms.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that the proposed regulations extending the CLEO certification requirements would \nincrease the processing workload for the NFA Branch by nine times, and that this would further add to the NFA \nBranch's backlog of one year. The commenter thus concluded that wait times would approach a decade.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes it has thoroughly considered the costs and benefits of the rule. Commenters have not \nprovided the Department with data or information that would alter or refine the Department's estimates of the rule's \ncosts and benefits. The Department has done its best to consider all relevant costs and benefits traceable to the \nrule, including, among other things, the benefits to public safety that will stem from the rule; the increased \noperational cost for the Government and industry members; the increased cost associated with additional fingerprint \ncards and photographs for responsible persons; and the increased labor cost associated with the time it takes for \napplicants and industry members to complete the required forms. Having considered all of the reasonably \nforeseeable costs and benefits, the Department has determined that the benefits of ensuring NFA weapons are less \neasily obtained by persons prohibited from possessing them outweighs the cost of implementing the rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges the commenters' concerns with the Department's assessment of costs and \nbenefits of the proposed rule in the NPRM. The final rule reflects that after careful consideration of all comments, \nthe Department has elected to eliminate the CLEO certification and replace it with a CLEO notification that will \nlessen the burden to CLEOs and applicants for registration. See section IV.C.1 for the in-depth discussion of the \nDepartment's decision to adopt a CLEO notification requirement in lieu of CLEO certification.\n\n \n\n\n\n  This final rule also identifies important benefits to public safety and security that will be achieved by the rule. For \nexample, by conducting background checks on persons who meet the new definition of a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d \nATF will be better able to ensure that responsible persons within trusts and legal entities are not prohibited from \npossessing NFA firearms. Presently, only individuals are required to submit fingerprint cards and undergo \nbackground checks to ensure that they are allowed to possess and receive an NFA firearm.\n\n \n\n  Further, the CLEO notification will ensure that CLEOs are aware of NFA firearm acquisitions in their jurisdictions \nand have an opportunity to provide input to ATF, but will reduce costs because they will no longer be responsible \nfor signing certifications or conducting background checks for individual applicants. This final rule will require all \napplicants and responsible persons within trusts and legal entities to notify their local CLEO by either forwarding a \ncompleted copy of Form 1, 4, or 5, or a completed copy of Form 5320.23, if applicable. ATF estimates that the time \nfor a CLEO to review the notification is 15 minutes per applicant/responsible person. Because not all responsible \npersons within a trust or legal entity may live in the same location as the applicant trust or legal entity, a different \nCLEO may review the ATF Form 1, 4, or 5 from the CLEO that reviews a Form 5320.23 for each responsible \nperson. However, if a CLEO determines that there is any reason why an applicant or transferee should not have an \nNFA firearm, the CLEO should notify ATF. While there will be additional costs to ATF, the Department has \ndetermined that the benefits will significantly outweigh any costs.\n\n \n\n  The NPRM identified a few instances when a prohibited person nearly erroneously acquired an NFA firearm; \nhowever, the transaction did not occur because the responsible person within the particular trust or legal entity had \nundergone a background check. Those examples show that there is a tangible risk of a prohibited person \nacquiring an NFA firearm through a trust or legal entity. The Department has not relied on those instances to \nconclude that there are presently a large number of erroneous transfers. However, the fact that some individuals \nhave been prevented from obtaining firearms supports the Department's position that a risk exists that should be \naddressed.\n\n \n\n  The Department stands by its determination that this rule will neither have a significant annual effect on the \neconomy of $100 million or more, nor adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, \nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or \ncommunities.\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes that the final rule will affect processing times and is implementing processes to keep \nthe impact to a minimum.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Executive Order 13132</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter quoted text that ATF used in section IV.B of the NPRM (78 FR at 55023), from which the Attorney \nGeneral concluded that the NRPM did not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant ATF's preparing a \nfederalism summary impact statement, and accordingly complied with section 6 of Executive Order 13132 \n(Federalism). This commenter noted that ATF acknowledged that the proposed expansion of the CLEO certification \nrequirement to all responsible persons of a legal entity had the potential for increased utilization of State and local \nagencies' resources for processing CLEO certifications. This commenter questioned ATF's statement that such \nutilization would be \u201cvoluntary\u201d and was \u201cexpected to be minimal.\u201d This commenter stated ATF needs to further \nclarify this \u201cvoluntary\u201d utilization, and perform proper cost-benefit analyses to clarify its \u201cclaim\u201d of minimal impact, or \nelse abandon its proposal to extend the CLEO certification requirement to responsible persons of a legal entity.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  After considering the objections of numerous commenters concerning the extension of the CLEO certification \nrequirement to trusts and legal entities, the Department has decided not to expand the CLEO certification \nrequirement to include responsible persons of trusts and legal entities. Instead, the Department has elected to \nremove the CLEO certification requirement entirely\u2014for both responsible persons and individuals\u2014and adopt \nCLEO notification in its place. This decision will lessen the burden on State and local agencies' resources in \npreparation and review of applications for responsible persons and individuals. Regardless of whether the rule \nmight have required a federalism summary impact statement before, the decision to eliminate the CLEO \ncertification requirement means that there is no need for one now. Because CLEOs will continue to be informed \nabout the NFA firearms present within their jurisdictions, the Department also believes that this change will not \nmaterially degrade public safety.\n\n \n\n  The Department continues to maintain that the proposed rule did not have sufficient federalism implications to \nwarrant a federalism summary impact statement. The Department noted in the proposed rule that the impact on \nresources used by State and local agencies would be \u201cvoluntary\u201d and was \u201cexpected to be minimal.\u201d As many \ncommenters have observed, CLEOs voluntarily decide to sign or not to sign off on any particular application, and \nwould have continued to be able to do so under the proposed rule.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h5>\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters stated that ATF did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-\n612. According to most of these commenters, there was no indication in the proposed rule that ATF adequately \nconsidered the needs of small businesses and the costs that were likely to be associated with the rule, especially \nthe costs imposed on small businesses directly and indirectly associated with the manufacture, distribution, \npurchase, and use of NFA firearms. Numerous commenters suggested that the proposed rule would dramatically \nincrease the cost of acquiring NFA firearms, especially silencers. They also suggested that the proposed rule would \nlikely force a number of small businesses out of business, resulting in job loss and economic turmoil. Many of these \ncommenters focused on the proposed requirement that CLEO certification be obtained for all acquisitions, \nregardless of the nature of the trust or legal entity, but some also identified the burden that would be imposed by \nrequiring responsible persons for trusts and legal entities to have background checks run as part of the \nacquisition process. In addition, many commenters argued that ATF's estimated increased costs to legal entities \nwere too low, as ATF estimated the number of responsible persons as two, a figure commenters regarded as an \nunderestimate. Further, a commenter requested that ATF clarify the research and methodology it used to determine \nthat the proposed rule complied with the RFA and perform further research, analyses, and clarification before \nimplementing the final rule.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters explained that under the RFA and (as amended by) SBREFA, when \u201cpromulgating a rule, an \nagency must perform an analysis of the impact of the rule on small businesses, or certify, with support, that the \nregulation will not have a significant economic impact on them.\u201d Nat'l Mining Assoc. v. Mine Safety and Health \nAdmin., 512 F.3d 696, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2008). According to these commenters, the regulatory flexibility analysis must \n\u201cdescribe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities\u201d and, among other things, must contain (1) \u201ca description \nof the reasons why action by the agency is being considered;\u201d (2) \u201ca succinct statement of the objectives of, and \nlegal basis for, the proposed rule;\u201d (3) \u201ca description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small \nentities to which the proposed rule will apply;\u201d and (4) \u201cidentification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal \nrules which may duplicate, overlap or conflict with the proposed rule.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 603. The commenters continued that \nthe \u201canalysis must also include discussion of alternatives to the proposed rule,\u201d and, although an agency head may \ncertify that the rule will not \u201chave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,\u201d such \n\n\n\ncertification must be supported by \u201ca statement providing the factual basis for such certification.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 605. \nUsing this legal framework, these commenters argued that ATF did not follow its obligations under the RFA.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF should clarify the research and methodology it used to determine that the \nNPRM complied with RFA, and that further research, analyses, and clarification is required regarding the proposed \nrule's economic impact. Another commenter disagreed with ATF's estimated cost increase per legal entity being \nonly $293.93, and believed this was far too low. The commenter attributed that result to ATF underestimating the \naverage number of responsible persons as two.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes it has thoroughly considered whether the rule will have a significant impact on small \nbusinesses and has reasonably concluded that it will not have such an impact. Commenters have pointed to no \nflaws in the Department's analysis that would call into question the reasonableness of its conclusion that the rule \nwill minimally impact small businesses. Commenters have identified only two specific issues with the Department's \nanalysis\u2014namely, (1) that the Department underestimated the average number of responsible persons for trusts \nand legal entities, and (2) that the Department failed to consider potential secondary market impacts on small \nbusinesses that sell NFA firearms to trusts and legal entities covered by the rule. As to the first objection, the \nDepartment disagrees that its estimate of two responsible persons per entity was unreasonable. As to the second, \nthe Department believes that any secondary market impacts will be negligible. The Department thus rejects the \nsuggestion that it failed to give careful consideration to the full effect the proposed rule would have had on small \nbusinesses. In any event, this final rule has been revised to eliminate or ameliorate many of the concerns reflected \nin the comments about the RFA, and the rule remains fully compliant with that Act.\n\n \n\n  This final rule primarily affects trusts and legal entities that seek to make or acquire NFA firearms and are not \nmaking or acquiring them as qualified FFLs. The Department believes that the increased cost of implementing the \nregulations will not be significant on trusts or legal entities. ATF has estimated that the cost of implementing the \nregulation will increase the cost for 115,829 trusts and legal entities with an average of two responsible persons by \n$25,333,317 (identification costs for background checks: $23,846,679; CLEO notification costs: $1,487,244) per \nyear.  (11)  Accordingly, the estimated cost increase per trust or legal entity is $218.71 (cost of increase \n($25,333,317) \u00f7 number of trusts and legal entities (115,829)).\n\n \n\n  In reaching this estimate the Department was quite specific in the proposed rule in allowing 10 minutes for each \nresponsible person to complete Form 5320.23 and considered this a reasonable amount of time for responsible \npersons at any business, large or small, to allocate for compliance with regulatory requirements. However, after \nfurther consideration, the Department has adjusted this time estimate to 15 minutes. See section IV.E.1.f for \nadditional discussion. Similarly, ATF projected that it would take only 50 minutes to procure needed photographs\u2014\na generous allocation considering the range of photo-taking technology available in this era of mobile and virtual \ntechnologies. See also section IV.C.1 for details concerning the shift from CLEO certification requirements to CLEO \nnotification requirements.\n\n \n\n  By developing Table B(1)\u2014Cost Estimates of the Time to Comply with the Proposed Rule's Requirements and \nTable B(2)\u2014Cost Estimates of Procuring Photographs, Fingerprints, and Documentation, the Department complied \nwith the requirement that it analyze the impact of the rule on small businesses and documented the anticipated \neffect of the regulation.\n\n \n\n\n\n  In section IV.A.2 of the proposed rule, ATF reported that \u201c[i]n calendar year (CY) 2012, ATF received 84,435 \napplications that were either ATF Forms 1, 4, or 5. Of these, 40,700 applications were for unlicensed trusts or legal \nentities (e.g., corporations, companies) to make or receive an NFA firearm; 29,448 were for individuals to make or \nreceive an NFA firearm; and 14,287 were for government agencies or qualified Federal firearms licensees \n(Gov/FFLs) to make or receive an NFA firearm.\u201d 78 FR at 55020-21. This data taken from actual applications \nreceived provided accurate data as to the number of trusts and legal entities to which the rule applies. Further, the \nDepartment believes that an average of two responsible persons per trust or legal entity is appropriate, especially in \nlight of modifications to the responsible person definition in the final rule. See infra section IV.E.1.a. As explained \nthere, ATF's estimate that each trust or legal entity has an average of two responsible persons is based on ATF's \nreview of 454 randomly selected applications for corporations, LLCs, and trusts processed during CY 2014.\n\n \n\n  The Department disagrees with the comments indicating that the proposed rule would impose substantial \nrecordkeeping obligations and increase the costs to ensure regulatory compliance, thereby resulting in small \nbusinesses being driven from the field. This final rule incorporates information required on ATF Form 5330.20 into \nthe existing Forms 1, 4, and 5 that will reduce the burden upon the applicant or transferee by eliminating an \nadditional form to be completed and filed. The current estimated time to complete the form is 3 minutes. Because \nthe information requested on the forms is the same, savings will result from the applicant not having to attach a \nseparate form. Further, these forms are not kept by the FFL and therefore will result in no increase in small \nbusiness recordkeeping obligations.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters argued that ATF's RFA statement considered only the NFA purchasers and their estimated \nadditional costs of compliance, but ignored the proposed rule's significant effect on manufacturers and \ndistributors/sellers, and the fact that business' customers would have a difficult time obtaining certification via a \nCLEO, therefore hurting sales. The Department notes again that it has changed the certification requirement to a \nnotification requirement. See supra section IV.C.1. Further, the Department notes that the rule's primary focus \nrelates to those responsible persons who have authority to direct firearms policy. The Department believes that \nbecause the rule is unlikely to significantly burden trusts and legal entities that wish to acquire NFA firearms, small \nbusinesses that sell or distribute NFA firearms and components to such trusts or legal entities will see a negligible \nor non-existent impact on their sales.\n\n \n\n  Finally, the Department emphasizes that this rule will primarily affect trusts and legal entities that are seeking to \nmake or acquire NFA firearms and are not making or acquiring them as qualified FFLs. Many commenters have \nobserved that the increased use of trusts during the last decade has been in response to increased CLEO refusals \nto provide the certification required for individual NFA acquisition applications. If that is true, the Department's \nrevision of that requirement can be expected to dramatically decrease the use of trusts to acquire NFA firearms in \nthe future, meaning that the rule's impact on small businesses may be even less than it estimates. In any event, the \nincreased cost of implementing the rule will not be significant on trusts or legal entities, even if the number of trusts \nand legal entities remains the same. The Department has estimated that the cost of implementing the regulation will \nincrease the cost for 115,829 entities with an average of 2 responsible persons by $25,333,317 per year \n(identification costs: $23,846,679; notification costs: $1,487,244).  (12)  Accordingly, the estimated cost increase \nper trust or legal entity is $218.71 (cost of increase ($25,333,317) \u00f7 number of trusts and legal entities (115,829)).\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</h5>\n\n \n\n  Although the proposed rule stated that it did not constitute a \u201cmajor rule\u201d as defined by section 251 of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), 5 U.S.C. 804, several commenters disagreed. \nIn addition, while the proposal stated that it would not result in \u201can annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effect on . . . employment . . .,\u201d 78 FR at 55024, \n\n\n\nseveral commenters disagreed with these assertions as well. One commenter requested that ATF clarify the \nresearch and methodology it used to determine that the proposed rule complied with SBREFA.\n\n \n\n  One commenter asserted that extending the CLEO certification requirement to responsible persons of trusts and \nlegal entities would effectively destroy the market for NFA firearms because \u201c99% of `legal entity' transfers\u201d \nstemmed from the CLEO's refusal to sign an individual application. According to the commenter, the proposed rule \nwould thus eliminate \u201capproximately $54 million dollars of tax generating commerce,\u201d with a corresponding impact \non jobs, with zero value gained in terms of public safety, and, thus would constitute a \u201cmajor rule\u201d under SBREFA. \nOther commenters made similar points concerning the proposed rule's impact under the assumption that CLEO \ncertification would be a larger hindrance to conducting commerce in NFA firearms. Several commenters noted that \nthis would also collaterally impact the Federal fiscal budget through a decreased payment of the Special \nOccupational Tax. Another commenter proposed that the economic impact of the proposed rule would have a \n\u201cchilling\u201d effect on NFA items' sales (especially lower-cost sound suppressors) due to the cost increase incurred by \ntransferees under the proposed rule.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department maintains that it complied with the SBREFA in the proposed rule. Nonetheless, for this final rule, \nthe Department has reassessed burdens and costs to applicants, responsible persons, and CLEOs.\n\n \n\n  In preparing this final rule, the Department looked at the additional impact on licensed manufacturers, dealers, \nlegal entities, applicants, and responsible persons and determined that the changes would not exceed a threshold \ngreater than $100 million or more on the economy. The impact on small businesses should remain minimal.\n\n \n\n  Based upon concerns from commenters that the Department underestimated the number of responsible persons \nin the NPRM, the Department revisited the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d and has amended it in this final rule. \nSee supra section IV.C.4.a.i. Beneficiaries are no longer specified as typical responsible persons in the definition, \nthough they may still be required to submit to a background check if they otherwise meet the definition of \n\u201cresponsible person.\u201d ATF has also has reassessed the number of responsible persons and the number of pages of \nsupporting documentation per legal entity. See section IV.E.1.b for the methodology used. This reassessment \nreflects that the estimated number of responsible persons per trust or legal entity application remains at two, and \nthe number of pages for the supporting documentation is averaged at 16 pages. See section IV.E.1.a and IV.E.1.b. \nSee section VI.A.3 for additional details about the cost to State and local entities.\n\n \n\n  As discussed in section IV.C.1, the Department is eliminating the CLEO certification requirement and \nimplementing a CLEO notification requirement; this will lessen the burden to CLEOs. The CLEOs will have the \ndiscretion and flexibility to review, manage, and maintain this information in the manner that they believe is most \nappropriate to the public safety concerns in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n \n\n  In addressing commenters' concerns that the CLEO extension requirement could force many FFLs out of \nbusiness, ATF did not assess the indirect costs to FFLs, such as manufacturers or dealers, but concentrated on the \ndirect costs to applicants, responsible persons and CLEOs, who have the greatest investment in the making or \ntransfer process. However, as stated, CLEO notification will diminish, if not eliminate, the economic impact on small \nbusinesses, including FFLs, that CLEO certification may have imposed.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  5. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commenters expressed concerns that the proposed rule did not comply with the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995 (UMRA), with two commenters identifying certain areas that they contended called for \nadditional study and justification by ATF to ensure compliance with UMRA. One commenter stated that the proposal \nto extend the CLEO certification requirement shifts a \u201csignificant regulatory burden\u201d onto State and local agencies, \ncausing them to have to undertake additional expenditures, hire new staff, and engage in additional training. This \ncommenter stated that UMRA (2 U.S.C. 1532) requires that an analysis be performed to determine whether \nadditional government funding is needed for State and local agencies to comply with the mandate. Many other \ncommenters questioned or disagreed with ATF's statement that the proposed rule did not impose any \u201cunfunded \nmandates,\u201d again focusing on the proposal to extend the CLEO certification requirement to responsible persons of \ntrusts and legal entities, which, they noted, would significantly burden CLEOs and divert local law enforcement \nresources from other criminal justice priorities. Numerous commenters referenced the U.S. Supreme Court case, \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), which articulated an \u201canti-commandeering principle\u201d and held invalid a \nFederal regulatory regime that mandated that CLEOs perform background checks for handgun transfers. These \ncommenters stated that the proposed rule effectively imposed on CLEOs the burden of conducting background \ninvestigations as part of a Federal regulatory regime, in violation of Printz. These commenters also reiterated their \nview that ATF's estimate of the costs imposed by its proposed rule, especially the costs imposed on CLEOs, were \ntoo low, both with respect to the time it would take to perform a certification and the direct costs associated with the \nprocess. For example, one commenter calculated that for an average legal entity with four responsible persons, \ncertification would involve four hours of CLEO time, equating to $123.20 per entity (4 \u00d7 $30.80 = $123.20). \nExtrapolating further, this commenter calculated that the total costs to CLEOs around the country would be at least \n$5,014,240.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges commenters' concerns that the proposed extension of the CLEO certification \nwould place additional burdens on CLEOs for processing and reviewing additional responsible persons' forms, and \nfor taking and reviewing fingerprints. The Department, however, complied with UMRA in the proposed rule. In any \nevent, for this final rule, the Department reexamined the burdens and costs to CLEOs.\n\n \n\n  In preparing this final rule, the Department based the costs and expenditures upon direct costs to State and local \nagencies, licensees, and ATF. While it acknowledges that there may be several indirect costs or resources that may \nbe associated with complying with the rule, the Department believes that the amount would still not be greater than \n$100 million or more.\n\n \n\n  For this final rule, the Department prepared an additional analysis of approved applications in response to several \ncomments that it provided a \u201clow estimate\u201d of the number of responsible persons per applicant, and the number of \npages of chartering documents at those entities, which directly affects the time and resources required by the CLEO \nto review applications. As discussed in section IV.C.1, the Department is eliminating the CLEO certification \nrequirement and replacing it with a CLEO notification requirement that will significantly lessen the burden to CLEOs. \nThe CLEOs will have the flexibility and discretion to review and maintain the information they obtain as a result of \nthis rule in the manner that best enhances public safety in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the commenters who referenced Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), the Department notes \nthat current Federal regulations do not require CLEOs to provide a CLEO certification for an applicant, a fact that \n\n\n\nmany commenters pointed out as the primary reason for the proliferation of the use of NFA trusts. Unlike in Printz, \nthis final rule imposes no obligations on CLEOs but does provide them with the ability to obtain information that is \npotentially useful to accomplishing their missions and the opportunity to provide relevant information to ATF. \nHistorically, the CLEO certification was designed to assist in maintaining public safety and was established to \ngather any information on the local level that might require denial of an application to make or receive an NFA \nfirearm. Prior to the advent of comprehensive criminal history databases, CLEO certification was critically important. \nThat role is less important today, and public safety concerns can still be addressed with CLEO notification without \nimposing unnecessary burdens upon local CLEOs.\n\n \n\n  As a result of ATF's review of public comments received in response to the proposed rule, the Department will \nremove the CLEO certification and replace it with a notification obligation upon the applicant/transferee, including \nresponsible persons of a trust or legal entity. This notification will reduce the burden on State and local agencies \nbecause notification does not involve signing off on applications. This will also simplify the process for CLEOs as \nthe same criteria will apply to both unlicensed trust, legal entity, and individual applicants/transferees. Finally, ATF \nwill continue to receive fingerprint cards along with applications for the purpose of conducting background checks \nto ensure that responsible persons of an applicant or transferee are not prohibited from possessing an NFA \nfirearm. ATF will continue to conduct these activities and therefore these activities will impose no additional costs on \nCLEOs.\n\n \n\n  Because CLEO notifications will require only those resources that the CLEOs themselves decide to devote to \nnotification management, additional funding to assist State, local, and tribal governments in complying with this rule \nis unnecessary.\n\n \n\n  The Department has determined that this rule is not an unfunded mandate because it does not meet the criteria \nunder UMRA. Specifically, it does not result in the expenditure of funds by State, local, and tribal governments, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any one year. See section VI.A.3 for additional \ndetails about the Department's estimate of costs to State and local entities.\n\n <h5>\n\n  6. Paperwork Reduction Act</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule, with its proposal to expand the CLEO certification requirement to \nresponsible persons, imposed an increased information collection burden (i.e., additional paperwork) on the public, \nand violated the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Some commenters mentioned the impact in terms of the PRA \ngenerally; others focused on the PRA of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511, 94 Stat. 2812, codified at 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) as \nan Act designed to reduce the \u201ctotal amount\u201d of the paperwork burden the Federal Government imposes on private \nbusinesses and citizens. Others mentioned the PRA of 1995, which confirmed that the authority of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u201cextended over not only \nagency orders to provide information to the government, but also agency orders to provide information to the \npublic.\u201d A few commenters argued that the CLEO certification requirement, regardless of the proposed expansion, \nplaces an \u201cunnecessary burden\u201d of paperwork on the public as there is no \u201cjust reason\u201d for CLEO certification given \nATF's access to the FBI's national criminal history databases. Others observed that the rule would complicate and \nperhaps degrade applicants' opportunities to submit their NFA applications by electronic means, thereby \nincreasing the paperwork burden. Some commenters observed, however, that eliminating the CLEO certification \nrequirement for individuals and legal entities, and instead requiring a NICS check with a Form 4473 at the time of \nphysical transfer of the NFA firearm, would enable applicants to e-file all NFA transfer forms, greatly reducing \npaperwork and streamlining the approval process at ATF. A number of commenters offered additional suggestions \ndesigned to increase application processing efficiency and speed; for example, having ATF maintain a database of \n\n\n\napproved applicants, having ATF permit electronic payments, and reducing the redundancy in ATF's processing \nsystem associated with multiple applications.\n\n \n\n  One commenter suggested further ways to decrease paperwork and reduce the redundancy in ATF's processing \nsystem associated with multiple applications submitted by the same person or legal entity. This commenter \nsuggested that ATF consolidate applications from repeat applicants, maintain and use a database of approved \napplicants, and perform background checks on new applications from the date of the last approval. In this way, \nthe commenter contended, the process would be shortened but maintain its integrity.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges the commenters' concerns that the proposed expansion of the CLEO certification \nrequirement, as well as the CLEO certification requirement for individuals, imposed paperwork burdens on the \npublic and on ATF. The Department also acknowledges that the proposed expansion may have limited the use of \nthe ATF eForms system for many NFA applications because of the manual submission of fingerprint cards, etc. As \ndiscussed in section IV.C.1, the Department is removing the CLEO certification requirement for individuals, and \nreplacing it with a notification requirement for both individuals and trusts or legal entities. This change will help \nreduce paperwork and increase efficiency for the public and ATF. Section VI.G of this rule fully discusses the \npaperwork burdens.\n\n \n\n  Regarding commenters' other suggestions for streamlining the process (e.g., permitting electronic payments and \nreducing redundancy with multiple applications), the Department addresses those comments in section IV.G. The \nDepartment continues to maintain that requiring background checks for responsible persons, which includes a \nrequirement that they submit photographs and fingerprint cards to ATF, increases public safety. See section IV.C.4 \nfor discussion of benefits.\n\n <h4>\n\n  E. Comments on Costs and Benefits</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. Implementation Costs of Rule are Underestimated</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Number of Responsible Persons per Legal Entity</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  In the proposed rule, ATF estimated an average of two responsible persons associated with a legal entity. Many \ncommenters stated that ATF grossly underestimated this number and that having more than two responsible \npersons was not calculated into the cost. A number of objections were raised as to the sample size ATF used to \nobtain its estimate, which commenters argued was too small and not determined through statistically rigorous \nanalysis. One of these commenters stated that if ATF's estimate of two responsible persons was inaccurate, it \nshould propose another comment period with a revised number of responsible persons and associated costs.\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters also noted that given the breadth of the definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d in the proposed \nrule, it was likely that the average number per legal entity was much higher than two. Commenters, including \npersons with experience preparing NFA trusts, opined that two was more likely to be the minimum number per legal \n\n\n\nentity, not the average. For corporations or LLCs, in particular, commenters observed that the number could be \nhigher still, potentially in the \u201chundreds to thousands.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Commenters noted that if, as they believed, ATF's estimated average number of responsible persons was \nunreasonably low, its cost estimate was equally unreliable. One commenter opined that the total annual direct \nimplementation costs to citizens involved in NFA transactions should be at least three times higher than ATF's \nestimate (i.e., $35,889,261 instead of $11,963,087). This commenter stated that the estimated annual costs to ATF \nand local law enforcement agencies also should be adjusted (i.e., ATF annual costs: $5,423,682 instead of \n$1,807,894; local law enforcement annual costs: $3,790,680 instead of $1,263,560). Therefore, this commenter \nestimated the total implementation costs at $45,103,623 ($35,889, 261 + $5,423,682 + $3,790,680 = $45,103,623), \nthree times higher than ATF`s total implementation costs of $15,007,541 ($11,963,087 + $1,807,894 + $1,263,560 \n= $15,007,541).\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  For this final rule, the Department reviewed a random sampling of 454 forms to determine the average number of \nresponsible persons per legal entity. The random sample was pulled from the 115,825 Forms 1, 4, and 5 processed \nin CY 2014. The forms to be reviewed were generated using established sampling methods based on ATF criteria \nof a 95 percent confidence level with a 2 percent sampling error, and represented a mixture of legal entities \nincluding trusts, corporations, and LLCs. The random sample showed that the average number of responsible \npersons was approximately two. Additionally, the random sample showed that the most frequent number of \nresponsible persons was one (with 226 instances), followed by two (with 124 instances). This represents 78 percent \nof the forms reviewed. The highest number of responsible persons in the sample was 11. Based on its random \nsample, the Department continues to estimate that each trust or legal entity has an average of two responsible \npersons. Moreover, the criteria used for determining who would be a responsible person in the most recent random \nsample review was based on a definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d materially similar to the revised definition of \nresponsible person in this rule. See supra section IV.C.4.a. The Department acknowledges that the cost estimates \nfor this final rule are based on an estimated average number of two responsible persons, but that individual \nexperiences may vary.\n\n \n\n  To be considered a responsible person, the individual must possess, directly or indirectly, the power or authority to \ndirect the management and policies of the entity insofar as they pertain to firearms. This power or authority will be \nlimited by the terms of the trust or the structure of a legal entity. Therefore, not every individual named in a trust \ndocument will be considered a responsible person, but any person who has the capability to exercise such power \nand possesses, directly or indirectly, the power or authority under any trust instrument, or under State law, to \nreceive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf of, the trust, \nwill be considered a responsible person of the trust.\n\n \n\n  With respect to the definition of responsible person that was used to determine the average number of responsible \npersons at trusts and legal entities, the definition used was materially similar to the definition that appears in this \nfinal rule. The Department has thus concluded that, under the definition of responsible person that appears in this \nfinal rule, the best estimate of the average number of responsible persons at trusts and legal entities is two. The \nDepartment notes that none of the trust documents reviewed in the sampling gave beneficiaries the power or \nauthority to direct the management and policies of the trust, including the capability to exercise such power and \npossess, directly or indirectly, the power or authority under any trust instrument, or under State law, to receive, \npossess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf of, the trust.\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  b. Number of Pages of Supporting Documents</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A few commentators questioned the sampling methodology ATF used to determine that the documents chartering \na legal entity averaged 15 pages in length and thought it was \u201chighly suspect.\u201d These commenters noted that ATF \nreviewed a different sample size to determine the average length of documentation than it used to compute the \naverage number of responsible persons per legal entity (i.e., ATF reviewed 50 applications to determine the \naverage number of constitutive documents for trusts and legal entities and 39 applications to determine the average \nnumber of responsible persons). Without access to ATF's methodology, these commenters believe that the \nunexplained difference strongly suggests sampling or selection bias. One of these commenters stated that ATF has \nnot addressed his request\u2014through counsel\u2014for information about the methodology used. In addition, these \ncommenters, and a few others, alleged that the sample size was too small. Another commenter stated that for the \naverage length to be 15 pages, that would mean, statistically, that half of the trusts have fewer than 15 pages of \ntrust documents, which the commenter did not consider believable.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that his own experiences as the owner and founder of Gun Trust Lawyer\u00ae, a \nnationwide network of lawyers, confirm what many other commenters observed, namely, that ATF underestimated \nthe document length and other costs associated with the proposed rule. This commenter and several other \ncommenters stated that the document length of a sample revocable trust used by Gun Trust Lawyer\u00ae, including \nexhibits and attachments, is almost double the length that ATF estimated when the trust has four to six trustees, a \ntypical number of trustees. These commenters stated that the sample revocable trust, used by this network includes \na 19-page trust document, with additional pages for assignment of property and recording contributions, witnessed \nstatements from each trustee and the settlor, and the signed \u201cTrustee Declaration\u201d and notarized signature page. \nAnother commenter stated that documents associated with sophisticated estate plans or complicated trusts can be \nquite lengthy with trust instruments and entity formation documents ranging from a few pages to hundreds of pages \nwhen their schedules, exhibits, and attachments\u2014all of which must be filed with ATF\u2014are included. Another \ncommenter stated that the gun trusts he creates are at least 65 pages long, and that he knows a substantial \nnumber of other attorneys who also create trusts of this length. Another commenter stated that his trust comprises \n18 articles and over 70 pages. This commenter stated that ATF needed to reevaluate the sample and revise the \ncost assumptions.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF did not consider corporations and LLCs when estimating the average \ndocument length, and asked about the average length of document pages that a corporate entity and its \nshareholders would submit. Another commenter stated that the type of documents needed to evidence the \nexistence and validity of partnerships, companies, associations, corporations, and trusts is governed by \u201cformation \nand continuation\u201d rules, which vary among the 50 States and are \u201ccomplex, state-specific, and diverse in purpose.\u201d \nThis commenter stated that it is highly unlikely that ATF will be able to examine \u201chundreds or perhaps thousands of \npages of trust or entity documents\u201d due to lack of time and expertise.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  For this final rule, the Department reviewed a random sampling of 454 applications to determine the average \nnumber of pages in the corporate or trust documents. The random sample was derived from 115,825 Forms 1, 4, \nand 5 processed in CY 2014. The forms to be reviewed were generated using established sampling methods based \non criteria of a 95 percent confidence level with a 2 percent sampling error and represented a mixture of trusts and \ncorporations, LLCs, and other legal entities. Based on its review of the random sample, ATF now estimates an \n\n\n\naverage length of sixteen pages. Thirty-eight percent of the random sample had between six and ten pages. \nTwenty-nine percent of the random sample had between eleven and twenty pages. The highest number of pages in \nthe random sample was fifty-five. Only two percent of the random sample had more than 50 pages and only three \npercent of the random sample had more than 40 pages. The Department acknowledges that the cost estimates are \nbased on an average number of pages, including attachments, and that individual experiences may vary.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that each State is specific in the documentation required for partnerships, \ncompanies, associations, corporations, and trusts. ATF examines all submitted documents when trusts and legal \nentities apply for a Federal firearms license.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Costs for Photographs and Fingerprints</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF estimated that photographs would cost $8.00 and take an average of 50 minutes to obtain, and that \nfingerprints would cost $24.00 and take 60 minutes to obtain. Many commenters stated that ATF's estimates for \nphotographs and fingerprints were unrealistically low, and, in their experiences, the costs and times were \u201chigher\u201d \nand even \u201csignificantly higher.\u201d The costs and times provided by the commenters for photographs ranged from \n$8.00 to $125 and 5 minutes to two weeks, respectively. The costs and times provided by the commenters for \nfingerprints ranged from no cost\u2014complimentary service\u2014to $120, and from 10 minutes to three weeks. A \ncommenter stated that since ATF did not provide any supporting documentation for the estimated costs and times, \nit was not clear whether ATF surveyed only service providers in \u201chighly-competitive, urban markets.\u201d This \ncommenter referenced the experiences of another commenter, who lived in a rural area and had to contact six \npolice departments, taking several hours, before finding someone willing to fingerprint him. Other commenters \nmentioned additional costs in obtaining photographs and fingerprints that they believed ATF did not take into \nconsideration such as work time missed, drive time, \u201cfuel, wear and tear on my personal vehicle,\u201d and \u201cvalue of my \ntime.\u201d Another commenter stated that the stores offering in-house photography are dwindling and that applicants \nwill spend 15 minutes locating a store, an average of at least 40 minutes for travel to and from the store, 20 minutes \nwaiting for copy machines to warm up at the store, and additional time getting pictures taken and printed, totaling 75 \nminutes. This commenter referenced a nationwide chain's price for passport photographs at $11.99 plus tax, \ntotaling $12.71, plus an $11.30 cost of driving to the store, computed by estimating an average roundtrip of 20 miles \nat the Federal mileage rate. This commenter summed up costs and time at $24.01 and 75 minutes, respectively, to \nobtain photographs. This commenter accepted ATF's estimate of $24.00 to obtain fingerprints but considered ATF's \nestimate of the associated time as 60 minutes to be low. This commenter estimated the time at 100 minutes (70 \nminutes total travel time plus 30 minutes on site to obtain fingerprints) plus an average round trip of 40 miles costing \n$22.60, determined at the Federal mileage rate. This commenter tallied the fingerprint costs and time at $46.60 \n($24.00 + 22.60 = 46.60) and 100 minutes, equating to $97.93 per responsible person. As support for his position \nthat ATF underestimated the fingerprint costs, another commenter provided a link to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Transportation Security Administration Web page\u2009 (13)  to show listed fingerprint service costs.\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Fingerprints may be taken by anyone who is properly equipped to take them (see instructions on ATF Form 1, \nForm 4, Form 5, and Form 5320.23). Therefore, applicants may utilize the service of any business or government \nagency that is properly equipped to take fingerprints. Depending on where the fingerprints are taken, the service \nmay require an appointment, and appointment availability may be limited. Some businesses provide evening and \nweekend appointments and a number of private companies provide mobile fingerprinting services at a location \n\n\n\nchosen by the customer to be fingerprinted. Additionally, some mobile fingerprinting services offer special pricing to \ngroups of individuals who need to be fingerprinted.\n\n \n\n  ATF reviewed 254 Web sites that published the cost of fingerprint service. Information was obtained from \nbusinesses and government agencies located throughout the United States, in both urban and rural areas. The \nreview disclosed a cost from zero to $75.00 for two fingerprint cards. One hundred thirty-eight of the Web sites \nlisted a cost between $10.00 and $20.00. Based on its review, ATF estimates the average cost to be $18.66.\n\n \n\n  The estimated time to obtain fingerprints set forth in the proposed rule was 60 minutes. This estimate was derived \nfrom information ATF submitted to OMB as part of the renewal approval process for ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5. The \ntime estimate has been accepted by OMB as an appropriate estimate of the time needed to obtain fingerprints. A \nreview of twenty-two Web sites that published an approximate amount of time to obtain fingerprints disclosed time \nestimates ranging from 5 minutes to 120 minutes, with the average time being 22 minutes. As not all the Web site \nestimates include wait time to obtain fingerprints, the Department believes the estimate of 60 minutes is a \nreasonable time approximation. The Department recognizes that individual experiences may vary from the \nestimated time.\n\n \n\n  Photographs must be a size of 2 inches x 2 inches of a frontal view taken within one year of the date of the \napplication (see 27 CFR 479.63 and 479.85). There is no requirement that the applicant/transferee use a \nprofessional photographer to acquire the photographs, provided that they meet the stated requirements. The \nphotographs may be taken at home with a digital camera and printed out in the required size using a color printer or \nthe applicant/transferee may use a Web site that provides this service. In addition, the applicant/transferee may \nchoose to obtain passport photographs, which meet the required specifications.\n\n \n\n  Numerous businesses offer passport photograph services including national chain stores. Generally, there is no \nappointment necessary to obtain passport photographs from these types of businesses.\n\n \n\n  ATF reviewed 57 Web sites that published the cost of passport photographs. Information was obtained from \nbusinesses located throughout the United States, in both urban and rural areas. The review disclosed a cost for two \npassport photographs that ranged from zero to $25.00. Thirty-five of the Web sites listed a cost between $10.00 \nand $15.00. Based on its review, ATF estimates the average cost is $11.32. The Department recognizes that the \ncosts associated with individual experiences may vary from the estimated cost.\n\n \n\n  The estimated time of 50 minutes to obtain photographs was obtained from information ATF submitted to the OMB \nas part of the renewal approval process for ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5. The time estimate has been accepted by OMB \nas an appropriate estimate of time to obtain photographs. A review of fifteen Web sites that published an \napproximate amount of time to obtain photographs disclosed time estimates ranging from 5 to 15 minutes with the \naverage time being 10 minutes. As the Web site estimates include only the time necessary to have the photograph \ntaken and printed, ATF believes the estimate of 50 minutes (accounting for travel time and possible wait time) is a \nmore accurate time approximation. The Department recognizes that individual experiences may vary from the \nestimated time.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Time To Obtain CLEO Certification</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n\n\n \n\n  ATF estimated that the time needed for a responsible person to procure the CLEO certification was 100 minutes \n(70 minutes travel time and 30 minutes review time with the CLEO). Several commentators stated that in their \nexperiences, ATF's estimate was inaccurate, too low, \u201cway off-base,\u201d and did not include additional associated \ncosts. A few of those commenters stated that ATF did not consider the large number of instances where multiple \nCLEOs were unwilling to sign and an applicant needed additional time to \u201chunt\u201d for a CLEO willing to sign the \ncertification, which may have included visiting several different government offices, making appointments with \nmultiple CLEOs, and educating and persuading the CLEO to sign the certification. A commenter stated that his \nCLEO would not review the form with him, and instead advised the commenter to mail in the form with an estimated \nwait of over 30 days for the CLEO to decide whether to sign the form. Another commenter expressed knowledge of \nmany CLEOs who require that the applicant leave the form with their offices, and return later to pick it up, doubling \nATF's estimated travel time of 70 minutes to 140 minutes. This commenter also stated that a typical process is for \nthe CLEO's assistant to first review the form\u2014taking 30 minutes\u2014and then for the CLEO to review the form\u2014taking \n15 minutes\u2014so that the total CLEO review time is 45 minutes. This commenter also estimated applicants' drive \ntime to average 40 miles, twice, to obtain the CLEO certification with a total mileage cost of $45.20 at the Federal \nmileage rate. This commenter tallied the costs at $140.17 per responsible person. Another commenter estimated \nthat he spent over 240 minutes calling and writing letters to try and obtain CLEO certification to no avail, far \nexceeding ATF's estimated 100 minutes.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF did not justify or substantiate its estimate of 100 minutes. This commenter \nrequested that ATF sample a statistically relevant number of NFA item owners to determine how long it actually \ntakes to obtain CLEO certification. This commenter also requested that ATF consider the additional costs that some \nCLEOs arbitrarily impose on applicants as a condition to providing certification. According to the commenter, these \nconditions may include acquisition of an FFL03 Curio and Relic license or Concealed Weapons Permit, attendance \nat police fundraisers, volunteer service with the CLEO's department, or contributions to political campaigns.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that individual experiences to obtain CLEO certification have varied from the time \nestimate. However, the time estimate is no longer relevant as the CLEO certification has been replaced with a \nCLEO notification requirement. See supra section IV.C.1.\n\n <h5>\n\n  e. Time Valuation Costs on Civilian Workers</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A trade organization commenter stated that by basing all of its time valuations on $30.80\u2014the current average \nhourly compensation for all civilian workers in the United States\u2014ATF failed to consider that NFA firearms are often \nvery costly, and that even the least expensive ones are discretionary purchases and unlikely to be made by low-\nincome individuals. This commenter also noted that these items typically have a $200 making or transfer tax, and \nthat people using legal entities to make or acquire NFA firearms will already have incurred other expenses to create \nthe legal entities, such as legal fees and corporate filing fees. This commenter suggested that ATF base its cost \nburden estimates on the actual characteristics of those who would be considered responsible persons. Other \ncommenters stated that an individual purchasing NFA firearms would have higher than average disposable income \nand is not an average civilian worker.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Department does not have access to confidential information such as the salary or disposable income for \nindividuals purchasing NFA firearms. Commenters have not suggested a methodology or dataset that would permit \nthe Department to more accurately estimate the time-value of responsible persons than the one it has adopted. The \nDepartment thus continues to believe that it is appropriate to base the time valuations for individuals and \nresponsible persons of trusts and legal entities on the civilian hourly rate, as determined by the U.S. Department of \nLabor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2015, the hourly earnings for civilians was $33.19. See section VI.A.1 of \nthis rule for further discussion and the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor, Web site at            \nhttp://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf.\n\n <h5>\n\n  f. Other Incorrect Costs</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF's time estimate of 10 minutes for a responsible person to complete Form 5320.23 \nwas too optimistic. This commenter thought that ten minutes might be reasonable if the person completing it was \nfamiliar with the form, but that additional costs would be incurred to learn how to complete the form. This \ncommenter asserted 15 minutes would be a more accurate estimate, equating to $7.70 per responsible person. \nAnother commenter asked how ATF could accurately estimate a \u201cmere\u201d 10 minutes, on average, per responsible \nperson to complete Form 5320.23, when the form had not yet been created. This commenter disagreed with ATF's \nstatement that there would be no increased costs associated with mailing the application package to ATF, and \ncalled such a statement \u201ceither willfully false, or woefully ignorant.\u201d This commenter argued that the proposed rule \nwould add weight and increased cost to mail an application, which now must contain a \u201csignificant\u201d number of paper \npages (i.e., forms 5320.23, fingerprint samples, photograph samples, and CLEO certifications). This commenter \nalso noted that the U.S. Postal Service recently announced a rate increase, which ATF did not factor into its cost \ncalculations. This commenter also questioned how ATF could maintain that it would incur no additional costs to \nreview this new paperwork when the proposed rule would result in more CLEO certifications, fingerprints, and \nphotographs with each application.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter considered ATF's estimate of cost to copy documents, associated with a legal entity, at $0.10 \nper page, a fair estimate; however, this commenter stated that the average trust, if properly drafted, would have 20 \npages, not the estimated 15 pages. Additionally, this commenter stated that ATF's time estimate of 5 minutes to \nmake copies was low. This commenter stated that many legal entities do not have a copy machine on site and \nwould need to travel to a commercial facility to make copies. This commenter estimated such a round trip to be 30 \nminutes and cover 15 miles on average, costing the applicant $8.48 (using the Federal mileage rate). This \ncommenter stated that making copies and paying for those copies would take 10 minutes. Tallying the total times \nand costs, this commenter estimated that the entity would spend \u201c$16.95 to travel, $2.00 on copies, and 40 minutes \nto travel and acquire the copies. In dollars, this equates to $39.48 per entity.\u201d\n\n \n\n  A commenter questioned ATF's estimated cost of $14.50 to process fingerprints. This commenter stated that \n$14.50 is the cost ATF pays but may not be the actual cost to the FBI. This commenter expressed interest in \nhearing from the FBI on the \u201ctrue\u201d cost transfer from ATF to the FBI.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with the suggestion that allowing 15 minutes to complete Form 5320.23, 5 minutes more \nthan the estimate in the proposed rule (78 FR at 55022), is a fair estimate. With respect to mailing costs, the \naddition of a CLEO notification requirement will result in the mailing of an additional form to the CLEO (if the \n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf\n\n\napplicant/transferee or responsible person(s) opts to use mail delivery) but the associated costs are minimal. \nMoreover, any additional mailing costs will be offset by cost and time savings resulting from the elimination of the \nCLEO certification requirement. Further, postage costs are already included in the costs of completing and mailing \nForms 1, 4, or 5 to ATF. As discussed in the proposed rule (78 FR at 55022), individuals, trusts, and legal entities \nmust complete and mail Forms 1, 4, or 5 to ATF. This final rule should not change the costs associated with that \nprocess. Even if there are multiple responsible persons associated with a trust or legal entity, the trust or legal entity \nstill will be completing and mailing one Form 1, 4, or 5. Similarly, because CLEO notifications have replaced CLEO \ncertifications, ATF's internal costs will remain as discussed in the proposed rule (78 FR at 55022).\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with the commenter who referenced ATF's estimate of cost to copy documents \u201cat $0.10 \nper page a fair estimate.\u201d Further, a more recent analysis of 454 random samples available to ATF suggests that 16 \npages approximates the mean length for properly drafted trust documentation. In addition, the Department concurs \nwith the estimate of ten minutes to make and pay for copies. Current data indicates that ATF pays the FBI $12.75 to \nprocess fingerprints, which is the appropriate cost for inclusion in this final rule.\n\n <h5>\n\n  g. Costs Not Considered</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. Lost Tax Revenue</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that ATF failed to account for the significant loss of tax revenue by ATF from fewer NFA \ntransfers, and on the income tax lost on the sale of NFA firearms by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. \nSeveral of these commenters noted that ATF estimated 40,565 ATF Forms 1 or 4 were submitted in 2012 for non-\nFFL legal entities (78 FR at 55021). Several commenters stated that the proposed rule would \u201cdiscourage\u201d or \u201cscare \noff\u201d individuals from purchasing or making NFA firearms because the rule will make the application process for legal \nentities more difficult. These commenters stated that for every Form 1 and Form 4 that is not submitted to ATF, a \n$200 tax payment loss will result (unless the application is submitted for an \u201cAny Other Weapons\u201d weapon, in which \ncase the tax payment loss would only be $5). Several commenters provided estimates of the decreased volume in \nNFA applications that they asserted would result from implementation of the proposed rule, and corresponding \nlosses in NFA tax stamp revenue. These estimates of reduced applications ranged from a 50 percent reduction \n(attributed primarily to predicted refusal of CLEOs to sign certifications for legal entity responsible persons) to a 75 \npercent reduction (attributed primarily to a decrease in legal entity applications), with corresponding estimated \nlosses in NFA tax stamp revenue of $6.1 to $8.1 million. Several commenters stated that the proposed rule would \nmake it harder for people to legally purchase silencers, and asked, \u201cis ATF trying to eliminate $12,000,000+ in \nannual tax revenue?\u201d Several commenters asserted tax revenue losses would occur in addition to lost NFA tax \nstamp revenue. They stated that if the business of selling NFA firearms declined and caused small FFL dealers and \ncustom manufacturers to cease dealing in NFA firearms, such dealers and manufacturers would surrender their \nSOT status and stop paying at least $500 annually to the U.S. Treasury. If small custom manufacturers determined \nit was no longer profitable to stay in business and were forced to shut their doors, such manufacturers would stop \nannual payments of at least $2,400 to the U.S. Treasury under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. See 22 \nCFR 122.3. There would also be a less direct effect, as the entity operating the FFL, as well as the individual \nowners and employees, would lose income, which would result in a reduction in income tax revenue.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  As noted, the final rule eliminates the CLEO certification requirement. Consequently, comments asserting tax \nrevenue losses resulting from the refusal of CLEOs to sign certifications for legal entities are now moot. Moreover, \nthe Department does not anticipate a decline in Form 4 applications. The Department has not observed, and does \nnot anticipate, reduced demand for NFA firearms or a decline in the filing of applications (Forms 1 and 4). \nApplications have generally increased each year and the Department expects this trend to continue as more States \nloosen restrictions on the use, in particular, of silencers for hunting or target shooting.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, because the CLEO notification requirement and the requirements for fingerprint and photograph \nsubmission will be the same under the final rule for individual applicants and trusts and legal entities, applicants \nmay choose to forgo the formation of a trust or legal entity and acquire firearms as individuals. A number of \ncommenters have observed that the proliferation of NFA trusts is a direct result of the CLEO certification \nrequirement for individual applicants. It is therefore fair to predict that eliminating the certification requirement will \nreverse that trend. Applications submitted by an individual are less complex because they do not require \ndocumentation evidencing the existence and validity of a trust or legal entity, such as articles of incorporation.\n\n \n\n  Contrary to the assertions of several commenters, the Department does not anticipate that implementation of the \nfinal rule will result in an increase in the number of FFLs or FFL/SOTs going out of business. The number of FFLs \nthat also paid SOT to manufacture, import, or deal in NFA firearms increased 117 percent between 2009 and 2014. \nThe Department estimates that the number of FFLs that also pay SOT will increase an additional 30 percent by the \nend of 2015.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Hearing Loss</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that the proposed rule completely overlooked the cost of hearing loss due to the \nunavailability of silencers. Many commenters stated that many citizens desire to make or acquire silencers to \nprotect their hearing while engaged in lawful, recreational shooting, as well as in self-defense situations. These \ncommenters stated that the proposed rule imposed obstacles to making and acquiring silencers, and a significant \nnumber of shooters who desire to use silencers will be unable to do so. Several commenters provided data and \nstatistics showing: The level of impulse noise generated from unsuppressed firearm discharge; that firearm \ndischarge is a leading cause of noise induced hearing loss; the efficacy of silencers at protecting hearing; and the \nimpracticality of using means other than silencers in certain situations (e.g., ear protectors in a home-defense \nsituation). These commenters also provided data estimating that a 7 percent hearing loss may result for every five \nyears spent hunting. These commenters stated that over time many recreational shooters, who are continually \nexposed to the noise, will have permanent hearing loss. A few commenters stated that those impacted hunters will \nbear \u201csubstantial medical costs and partial disability resulting in lost productivity.\u201d Another commenter provided data \nfrom a specialist who put a specific dollar estimate on firearm related hearing-loss costs (the commenter stated the \nestimate was supported by the \u201cValue of a Statistical Life\u201d method). This specialist estimated a minimum cost of $15 \nmillion, considering only the direct costs of medical care, testing, and hearing aids, and stated that the estimate is \nlikely to exceed $100 million when one adds disability to the direct medical costs. A few commenters generally \nmentioned a National Shooting Sports Foundation study that showed that in 2011 there were 14,630,000 paid \nhunting license holders and that total recreational shooters exceeded 30 million.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department recognizes that the use of a silencer while shooting a firearm may help to reduce hearing loss. \nNeither the proposed rule nor the final rule prohibit the manufacture or sale of silencers; the primary premise of the \ncomments is that silencers will become less available as a result of the proposed rule, thereby increasing societal \ncosts from shooting related hearing loss. The Department disagrees that the final rule will significantly reduce the \navailability of silencers. The final rule no longer requires CLEO certification, the aspect of the proposed rule most \ncommonly cited by commenters as an impediment to consumers obtaining silencers and other NFA weapons (from \neither retailers or private transfers). With the elimination of the CLEO certification requirement for all NFA \napplications, including individuals, the process for individuals who wish to purchase a silencer to protect from \nhearing loss becomes less, not more, burdensome. Moreover, as is noted in several sections of this final rule, the \nsilencer industry has experienced significant growth largely as the result of several States legalizing the ownership \nof silencers for hunting and other purposes under State law. This legalization trend among the States is likely to \ncontinue, strengthening demand for silencers, thus driving additional industry growth and increased product \navailability. Finally, with respect to assessing the societal costs of firearms-related hearing loss, the Department is \nunaware of any peer reviewed study calculating an average value for hearing loss attributable only to the use of \nfirearms without silencers.\n\n <h5>\n\n  iii. Attorney Costs</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that ATF failed to consider the costs that individuals associated with trusts or legal \nentities would incur to consult with attorneys to accurately determine the number of individuals associated with their \ntrusts or legal entities that would fall under the proposed \u201cresponsible person\u201d definition. Another commenter stated \nthat the proposed rule did not address the interstate nature of corporations, and that an individual would need to \nconsult an attorney\u2014at $150 per hour\u2014to determine what jurisdiction the CLEO certification would be required to \nbe obtained in. A few commenters provided their total attorney fees to consult with lawyers specializing in NFA \nlegal matters and to form an NFA trust that complied with all the relevant laws; these fees ranged from $200 to over \n$1,500. Another commenter stated that if the proposed rule were implemented, applicants would need to obtain \nrevised trust documents from a licensed attorney. This commenter, a licensed attorney, conservatively estimated \nthe average cost and time at $200 per trust and at least two hours of the applicant's time, respectively. After \nassuming that 20 percent of the approximately 100,000 NFA related trusts or other entities would require revision, \nthis commenter estimated the costs to trusts for legal fees to be $4,000,000 plus 40,000 client hours.\n\n \n\n  This same commenter stated that ATF did not estimate the costs for attorneys to revise forms, attend continuing \nlegal education, and perform other uncompensated work needed to comply with the proposed changes. This \ncommenter estimated five hours for each attorney to perform these activities. After assuming 1000 attorneys are \ninvolved nationwide in NFA matters and a conservative hourly rate of $200, this commenter estimated the total cost \nat $1 million.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF did not estimate the cost to ATF for a State licensed attorney to review the \nsubmitted trust documentation to ensure the trust's validity and that all responsible persons are included. This \ncommenter estimated the annual cost to ATF at $1,628,000 after assuming 40,700 trust documents, half an hour of \nthe attorney's time to review each trust, and an $80 hourly rate.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  There is no requirement to form a trust or legal entity to acquire an NFA firearm. In fact, all of the legal fees \nincluded in the comments may be avoided if the NFA firearm is acquired by an individual. Therefore, when an \napplicant voluntarily decides to register a firearm to a trust or legal entity, the applicant assumes all \nresponsibilities for determining the responsible persons\u2014including legal fees associated with making that \ndetermination. Additionally, as noted, the final rule no longer requires CLEO certification; the final rule requires only \nCLEO notification. Moreover, both the text of the final rule (when incorporated into a regulation) and instructions on \nrevised ATF forms will provide specific directions as to who must provide notification to the CLEO. Therefore, it may \nnot be necessary to consult an attorney to determine this information.\n\n \n\n  As the attorney-commenter did not specify why trust documents would need to be revised, the Department cannot \ndirectly address this concern. There is no requirement, existing or proposed, to form a trust or legal entity to acquire \nan NFA firearm or to satisfy any CLE requirement. The cost of CLE is therefore outside the scope of the cost of this \nfinal rule.\n\n <h5>\n\n  iv. Costs To Update Publications/Resources</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF did not estimate the costs to revise various publications, informational brochures, \nindustry Web pages, and other miscellaneous resources relied upon by NFA applicants and potential applicants \nfor NFA information such as those published by hobbyists, industry, retailers, local law enforcement, and Federal \nagencies. The commenter could not estimate such costs but imagined that such costs could easily be $1,000,000 \nor more nationally.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF's cost analysis did not address the cost of implementing the forms and \napplications in the NFA Branch that have a \u201cpending\u201d status when the rule changes are implemented.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF updates its publications, Web site, and forms on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so each time there \nare changes to Federal firearms laws or regulations. FFLs, other law enforcement agencies, trade associations, and \nother entities are not required under Federal law or regulation to provide information on the NFA or on how to \nacquire an NFA firearm. Therefore, these comments are outside the scope of this rulemaking. Additionally, such \ncosts are difficult to estimate, and informational resources provided by other entities are routinely updated as a \nmatter of course, making it difficult to trace what update costs are specifically attributable to ATF's new rule. The \ncommenter did not suggest a methodology by which ATF could readily quantify such costs, and ATF believes any \nsuch costs directly traceable to the promulgation of this final rule will be negligible.\n\n \n\n  With regard to the comment regarding applications that have a \u201cpending\u201d status when the rule is implemented, all \napplications postmarked prior to the effective date of the rule will be processed under the current regulations. The \nsame is the case for any applications that have a pending status at the time the rule is implemented. Consequently, \nno additional costs will be incurred by ATF to process pending applications.\n\n <h5>\n\n  v. Litigation Costs</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n\n\n \n\n  Several commenters stated that ATF omitted the costs to ATF, DOJ, and local law enforcement of litigation that \ncould potentially arise if the proposed rule were implemented. These commenters stated that ATF must expect \nsignificant judicial challenges to the proposed CLEO certification requirements for responsible persons as many law \nabiding citizens will no longer have a \u201cwork-around\u201d or mechanism to avoid CLEO certification, will consequently \nface arbitrary refusal by CLEOs, and will be unable to own or possess otherwise legal NFA items. A few of these \ncommenters stated that citizens who live in jurisdictions where every local CLEO refuses to sign off on the NFA \npaperwork would have no recourse other than to sue ATF or DOJ. Another commenter referenced Lomont, 285 \nF.3d 9, and stated that ATF's proposal to extend the CLEO certification would survive a \u201cfacial challenge\u201d under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. However, this commenter predicted that in cases where every qualified CLEO \nrefuses to provide the certification even though the applicant is not prohibited by State or local law from making or \nreceiving the firearm, such an applicant could bring an \u201cas-applied challenge\u201d and win.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter expressed the opinion that the rule was too vague to withstand legal scrutiny and would result \nin expensive litigation. Another commenter stated that DOJ will spend millions of taxpayer dollars \u201cin vain\u201d trying to \ndefend this rule in various courts. Another commenter agreed that taxpayers would \u201cfoot the bill\u201d for the litigation \nthat citizens allegedly denied their constitutional rights would bring against local and State governments, and the \nFederal Government, and that this would place a huge burden on local departments and agencies.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The change from CLEO certification to notification addresses the substance of the concerns expressed in these \ncomments and will reduce the likelihood of litigation.\n\n \n\n  Additionally, the Department regards the possible costs of potential future legal challenges as difficult to quantify. \nCommenters did not suggest a methodology by which the Department could accurately measure such costs. \nMoreover, the Department already must maintain a legal staff to defend its rules that it must fund whether or not \nany particular legal challenge is brought. It would thus be difficult to determine the extent to which litigation about \nthe rule would add to the Department's legal costs.\n\n \n\n  Finally, the Department does not regard the potential cost of defending the lawfulness of its rule as appropriate to \ninclude in an assessment of the costs and benefits of the rule. Such costs are imposed by third parties that choose \nto file suit regardless of the potential legal merit of their claims. If the costs of defending suits formed part of the cost \nof a rule, opponents could claim that they would file suit, regardless of the merits of their claims, and thereby drive \nup the estimated cost of the rule. If an agency were required to factor litigation threats into the cost of a rule, \nopponents threatening litigation could exercise a sort of veto over agency rulemaking by artificially increasing the \nrule's costs.\n\n <h5>\n\n  vi. Miscellaneous Costs</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF severely underestimated the time and costs to trust participants arising from the \nrule. This commenter stated that the proposed rule would take trust participants an additional 30 days to properly \ncoordinate and submit the required documentation for each NFA item requiring approval by the NFA Branch.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that neither ATF nor any other component within DOJ provided \u201ccredible information, \nstudies, or analysis\u201d showing details of the estimated annual fiscal costs and the feasibility of implementing the \nproposed rule. This commenter asked that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) perform an \u201cindependent, \nnon-partisan review\u201d of the proposed rule and its current and potential fiscal impact, as well as its feasibility, and \nsubmit the findings to Congress so Congress could review to determine if the proposed rule complied with the \n\u201cpolicies, rules, and standards\u201d governing ATF.\n\n \n\n  One commenter noted that ATF calculated the costs of the proposed rule based on the number of legal entity \napplications from previous years, and further noted that ATF listed a large increase in legal entity applications from \n2000 to 2012 as evidence, in the commenter's words, that these applications \u201care serving as a mask for individuals \nwho otherwise would be prohibited from owning guns.\u201d This commenter stated that if the proposed rule's purpose is \nto target and reduce such activity, then ATF's cost calculations should reflect a reduction in the number of \napplications by legal entities.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with the commenter that the proposed rule would add an additional 30 days to the \nprocess of acquiring an NFA firearm. The commenter provided no empirical evidence or analysis supporting this \nassertion, and the Department is unaware of any aspect of the final rule that would lead to an increase in time \nexpended by applicants on this scale. Under the revised definition of responsible person, the average number of \nresponsible persons is estimated at two. Those two responsible persons may reside in the same household (e.g., \nhusband and wife) or work in close proximity to each other, which would ease coordination of the collection of \nfingerprints and photographs required for the application. Furthermore, because responsible persons are no longer \nrequired to obtain CLEO certification, no delay will result from that issue.\n\n \n\n  Proposed changes to ATF regulations, including the proposals set forth in the NPRM and this final rule, undergo a \nrigorous review process by both the Department and the Office of Management and Budget. These reviews include \nclose scrutiny of the estimated annual fiscal costs associated with the proposed and final rules. Finally, the \nproposed rule and this final rule have been published for public comment and scrutiny. In light of all these review \nprocedures, the Department does not believe additional review of this rule by the GAO, as requested by a \ncommenter, is necessary or warranted.\n\n \n\n  The Department also does not agree with the commenter who asserts that the purpose of the proposed rule is to \ntarget and reduce NFA applications filed by trusts. The objective of the final rule is instead to ensure all applicants, \nregardless of whether they are an individual applying in an individual capacity or applying in a representative \ncapacity on behalf of a trust or legal entity, are subject to the same approval process to help ensure that prohibited \npersons do not obtain NFA firearms.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, the Department's decision to base its estimate of the costs of the rule on the number of trusts and legal \nentities that currently apply to make and transfer NFA firearms is appropriate because it likely accurately estimates \nthe overall number of background checks and information submissions that will need to be undertaken as a result \nof the rule. To the extent individuals presently create single-person trusts and legal entities to circumvent \nbackground check requirements, they may now choose simply to submit individual applications. To be sure, that \nwould result in a decrease in the number of applications from trusts and legal entities. But it would be accompanied \nby a concomitant increase in the average number of responsible persons at the trusts and legal entities that remain. \n\n\n\nThe overall number of information submissions and background checks is therefore likely to remain roughly \nequivalent to the Department's estimate. Commenters have not suggested a method of estimating the costs of the \nfinal rule that is superior to the methodology the Department has chosen.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Financial Impact on Firearms Industry</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Impact on the NFA and General Firearm Industry, Specific Types of NFA Manufacturers, and Related \nBusinesses (Including Law Firms)</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A large percentage of commenters asserted that the proposed rule will negatively impact NFA industry participants \n(including manufacturers, dealers, and employees) as well as related businesses such as suppliers. The \ncommenters characterized their assessments of the financial impact on business in a number of different ways: The \nimpact on NFA manufactures; the impact on specific NFA manufacturers such as silencer manufacturers; the \nimpact on firearm dealers; the impact on related industries such as suppliers to manufacturers; the impact on \ngeneral lawful commerce in firearms; the impact on \u201csmall businesses;\u201d the impact on employees of various \nbusinesses in the form of lost jobs and wages; and general claims of \u201creduced revenue\u201d for industry and affiliated \nbusiness.\n\n \n\n  Most of the commenters focused their assessment of the proposed rule's negative impact on the provision in the \nproposed rule extending the CLEO certification requirement to trusts and legal entities. These commenters \nemphasized that, for numerous reasons, some CLEOs will not sign the NFA certifications even if the applicant is \nnot prohibited by law from acquiring a firearm, freezing the application approval process. Because no process exists \nto override a CLEO's refusal to sign a certification, the refusal to sign functions as a denial of the application, \npreventing the applicant from purchasing the NFA item, and thereby depriving NFA manufacturers and dealers of \nlaw-abiding customers. A second recurring theme in the comments was that the proposed rule would decrease \ndemand for NFA firearms, and thereby negatively impact businesses, because the rule will require a greater \nnumber of NFA applicants to undergo background checks (i.e., individuals affiliated with trusts and legal entities \nwho fall within the proposed rule's definition of \u201cresponsible persons\u201d).\n\n \n\n  Examples of comments from the various categories of characterization used by the commenters include the \nfollowing:\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. Manufacturers and Dealers</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters reasoned that the proposed rule would make it more difficult to obtain NFA items and as a \nresult would drive manufacturers out of business; one such commenter characterized the impact as jeopardizing the \nentire, booming \u201ccottage industry\u201d of NFA manufacturers. Similarly, an employee of a silencer manufacturer, that \nhas been in business for more than 20 years, commented that the proposed rule would \u201ccripple\u201d his employer's \nbusiness. One commenter listed multiple negative impacts he predicted the proposed rule would have on NFA \nmanufacturers: (1) Lost investment in machines; (2) lost investment in unsellable inventory; (3) lay-offs of \nmanufacturing and sales staff; and (4) no market for their product. Several commenters argued that the proposed \nregulation would make wait times for customers to obtain ATF approval even longer, resulting in frustrated \ncustomers and reduced sales.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Many commenters directly linked predictions that the proposed rule would negatively impact NFA manufacturers \nand dealers to the CLEO certification requirement. They asserted that extending the certification requirement to \nlegal entities will drastically inhibit sales of NFA items, particularly silencers, causing reductions in business, \nbusiness closure, and loss of employees. Several FFL commenters asserted that the proposed rule would \u201cdestroy\u201d \ntheir businesses because CLEO certification was difficult or impossible to obtain in their counties. One of these \nFFLs stated he had researched the impact of CLEO certification in his State, Texas, and determined that \napproximately \u201c70% of Texans\u201d will not be able to obtain a CLEO signature; therefore, he predicted, \u201c70% of his \ncustomer base\u201d would be eliminated by the proposed rule. Another FFL asserted that he anticipated a 75 percent \nloss in sales due to the CLEO requirement, and two other FFLs stated that they anticipated a 20 percent loss in \nrevenue due to the CLEO certification requirement.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters opined that the proposed rule would place significant financial burdens on firearm dealers by \nprolonging the transfer process for trusts and legal entities because under the responsible person definition the trust \nor legal entity will need to obtain the fingerprints and photographs of all members of the trust or legal entity. These \ncommenters maintained that the proposed rule will require dealers to reserve inventory without payment until the \ntransfer process is complete\u2014which currently takes in excess of nine months. Several other commenters stated \nthat further delays encountered in the transfer process place NFA dealers at a significant financial disadvantage, \nnoting that by the time a transfer is approved, often the item being transferred is a previous production model. \nFinally, a number of commenters focused on their belief that the proposed rule would negatively impact \nemployment in the firearms industry, causing lay-offs and increased unemployment among employees of firearm \nmanufacturers and sellers.\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Small Businesses</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated generally that the proposed rule will hurt, hinder, or make it harder for small business \nowners, particularly firearm related businesses, by increasing transaction costs and transaction times. Several \ncommenters emphasized that small firearms related businesses are engaged in lawful commerce, and expressed \nthe view the government was seeking to unfairly target such businesses with regulations increasing the cost of \ndoing business. Other commenters hypothesized that the proposed rule will destroy small businesses because it \nwould limit or prevent law-abiding citizens from acquiring NFA items.\n\n <h5>\n\n  iii. Specific Types of NFA Manufacturers and Markets</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters focused on the proposed rule's negative effect on specific NFA market segments such as the \nmarkets for silencers, short-barreled rifles, machineguns, and military surplus firearms. A large number of \ncommenters claimed the proposed rule would significantly reduce the sale of silencers, driving silencer \nmanufacturers out of business and potentially causing the entire silencer industry segment to collapse. Another \ncommenter predicted the proposed rule would cause the collapse of the military surplus firearms market. Some \ncommenters expressed concerns that the proposed rule could harm technical innovations for silencers, with one \ncommenter asserting that advancements in silencer technology will grind to a halt, affecting the military firearms \nsupplied to \u201cour troops overseas who deserve and require the best we have to offer.\u201d One commenter reasoned \nthat the proposed rule will limit the availability of NFA items, thus making the value of silencers, machineguns, and \nshort-barreled rifles increase for those who own them. This commenter anticipated that this effect would make \ncurrent owners \u201chappy.\u201d\n\n <h5>\n\n  iv. Impact on Related Businesses (Including Law Firms)</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  Several commenters expressed concerns that the proposed rule will negatively impact firearms related-industries, \nnot only those businesses directly involved in the sale and manufacture of firearms. Many of these commenters \nasserted that the proposed rule's CLEO certification requirement will have the effect of halting the sale of all NFA \nitems in many areas (because, they assert, certain CLEOs will not sign certifications), which, they assert, will have \na cascading effect: Reduced sales will result in substantial losses for NFA manufacturers and dealers (particularly \nthose involved in the silencer market), which, in turn, will negatively impact businesses that contribute to the \nmanufacturing process or derive business from firearms dealers and manufacturers. One commenter stated that the \nproposed regulation will cause well paying, American jobs to be lost in machining, manufacturing, marketing, and \nretail sales. Examples provided of related businesses that commenters believe would be negatively impacted also \nincluded: Ranges, materials suppliers, computer numerical control and milling operations and manufacturers, third \nparty processors (such as Cerakote coating, powder-coating, anodizing, black oxide, metal sales, tooling, laser \nmarking, and engraving), office supply stores, trade shows, and various NFA shooting events (such as machinegun \nshoots).\n\n \n\n  Other commenters asserted that the proposed rule will negatively impact law firms that handle trust matters \ninvolving NFA items because demand for creation of trusts solely used to obtain and hold NFA firearms will \ndecrease as a result of the proposed rule's provision defining responsible persons for legal entities and requiring \nsuch persons to undergo background checks. These commenters asserted that the decreased demand for firearm \ntrusts will cause a loss of revenue to law firms and layoffs of law firm employees.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that this rulemaking will have some modest impact on the firearms industry; the \nDepartment does not agree, however, with the assessment of the many commenters who assert that this \nrulemaking will have a substantial negative economic impact on NFA industry participants (including manufacturers, \ndealers, and employees), and on related businesses such as suppliers. The comments asserting that the proposed \nrule will have substantial negative (and even catastrophic) impacts on the industry are primarily premised on two \nconclusions, neither of which, in the Department's view, are supported by the facts and circumstances underlying \nthis final rule. The first conclusion is that the CLEO certification requirement in the proposed rule will deter potential \npurchasers who previously would have chosen to obtain an NFA firearm through a trust or legal entity because they \ncould do so without the need for CLEO certification. This conclusion is largely based on assertions that many \nCLEOs (1) refuse to sign NFA certifications even when the applicant is not prohibited from possessing a firearm; \n(2) too slowly process certification requests due to resource constraints; or (3) seek to extract political or economic \nfavors from applicants in exchange for signing a certification. As a result of the impediments posed by CLEO \ncertification, the commenters assert, the proposed rule would have resulted in a drastic reduction in the sale of \nNFA weapons (particularly silencers), thus decimating the NFA industry and greatly harming related industries. The \nsecond conclusion is that the demand for NFA firearms will dramatically decrease if a greater number of NFA \napplicants are required to undergo background checks and to submit fingerprints and photographs. This \nconclusion is directly linked to the rule's definition of \u201cresponsible persons\u201d affiliated with trusts and legal entities; \npersons meeting that definition will be required under this final rule to undergo background checks and submit \nfingerprints and photographs when the trust or legal entity they are affiliated with files an NFA application or is a \ntransferee.\n\n \n\n  The conclusion regarding the impact of CLEO certification has been rendered moot by this final rule. In response \nto the concerns expressed by commenters relating to CLEO certification, the Department has eliminated that \nrequirement, and replaced it with a less burdensome CLEO notification requirement. Hence, obtaining CLEO \ncertification is no longer a hurdle for individuals, trusts, or legal entities acquiring an NFA firearm, and therefore the \n\n\n\nproblems identified by the commenters with respect to the CLEO certification process are no longer a factor \nthreatening the economic health of NFA manufacturers, dealers, and related businesses.\n\n \n\n  With respect to the commenters' conclusion regarding background checks, the Department believes the reality of \nthe firearms marketplace refutes the conclusion that background checks will deter individuals from acquiring NFA \nfirearms. Background checks, a vital law enforcement tool that ensures prohibited persons will not unlawfully \nobtain firearms, are already conducted on virtually all non-licensed individual persons who purchase either a GCA \nor NFA firearm from an FFL or FFL/SOTs. Notwithstanding these checks, both the GCA and NFA firearms markets \nare flourishing. Background checks do not significantly deter non-prohibited individuals from purchasing firearms \nfrom licensed dealers, including NFA dealers and manufacturers.\n\n \n\n  Other market conditions also refute the concerns about the proposed or final rule threatening the viability of NFA \ndealers and manufactures. Many States have been relaxing prohibitions on ownership of silencers, SBRs, and \nSBSs, thus expanding the market for these NFA firearms. In addition, the firearms industry is constantly introducing \nnew and improved models. As evidence of this, the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show is attended \nannually by more than 62,000 industry professionals from the United States and many foreign countries, seeking \ninformation on new firearms and shooting products. This is a clear market signal that demand for innovation and \ndevelopment of new firearms and shooting products, including NFA products, is strong, and will continue to support \nNFA manufacturers and dealers regardless of whether or when the final rule is implemented. Additionally, demand \nfor silencers has continued to increase as several States have recently legalized ownership of silencers for hunting \nand self-defense; the trend of States legalizing silencer ownership appears likely to continue. Consequently, the \nDepartment anticipates demand for silencers will continue to rise. Finally, some States have recently relaxed laws \nrestricting the possession of SBRs and SBSs, thereby increasing the potential market and demand for these NFA \nitems.\n\n \n\n  The Department also disagrees with comments that FFLs will be hurt because they reserve inventory without \npayment during the application process. An FFL may choose, as part of its business practice, to require payment in \nfull on an NFA firearm before an application may be submitted. Additionally, ATF posts the processing time for NFA \nitems on its Web site so a purchaser may determine the approximate time necessary to process the application. \nDue to the nature of the application process, some risk that a new model will be introduced prior to the approval of a \ncustomer's purchase is inherent; the new rule, however, does not materially increase that risk.\n\n \n\n  The Department also rejects comments asserting that this rulemaking is intended to limit or prevent ownership of \nNFA items by persons who are not prohibited from receiving or possessing them. This final rule is intended to \nensure only that persons acquiring and having access to NFA firearms are not prohibited from receiving or \npossessing them. Furthermore, in response to commenters who asserted that the decreased demand for firearm \ntrusts will cause a loss of revenue to law firms and layoffs of law firm employees, a formation of a trust or other legal \nentity is not required to acquire an NFA firearm. Therefore, comments on the loss of income for attorneys who draft \nthese documents is outside the scope of this rulemaking.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Burden of Implementation</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters took issue with ATF's assertion that the proposed rule would cause only a minimal burden to \nindustry. In sum, these commenters explained that the proposed rule will be more than minimally financially \n\n\n\nburdensome to the industry because it will cause customers to stop buying NFA items due to the extended wait \ntimes and increased regulatory burdens created by the rule, thus making it less profitable for licensees to hold their \nSOT status.\n\n \n\n  According to some commenters, as a result of the proposed regulation, some retailers are facing shutdowns, \nothers face employee lay-offs, and all licensees and related-industries are bracing for revenue reduction. Some \ncommenters stated the proposed rule unreasonably burdens commerce because of the cost of fingerprinting and \npassport photographs for every purchase. A commenter stated the proposed rule will make it more difficult for local \nbusinesses to sell items that are already difficult to obtain. Finally, a commenter argued that the proposed rule is so \nburdensome it will deter citizens from acquiring NFA items through the approved government process, and \nencourage the rise of a black market in NFA items. Several commenters claimed it will take about two or three \nadditional hours of customer service assistance per transaction to handle the additional fingerprint cards, \nphotographs, and application paperwork should the NPRM be implemented. One commenter estimated three \nadditional customer service hours would be needed while others estimated two hours would be needed.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Applicants who purchase NFA firearms in an individual capacity have long paid the costs of fingerprints and \nphotographs; the final rule equitably extends these costs to trust and legal entity applicants, and reasonably limits \nthe photograph and fingerprint requirements to responsible persons of the trust and legal entity applicants. The \nOffice of Management and Budget, when granting the renewal of the ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5, has determined that \nthe cost of fingerprints and photographs is not an unreasonable burden. To the extent commenters have asserted \nthat requiring responsible persons to submit fingerprints and photographs is more burdensome than the \nrequirement for individuals because a trust or legal entity may have multiple responsible persons, the option exists \nfor the applicants who have formed trusts or legal entities for the express purpose of acquiring NFA firearms to \nforego use of a trust or legal entity and acquire the NFA firearm in an individual capacity. The formation of a trust or \nlegal entity is not required to purchase an NFA firearm. For corporate applicants, the costs associated with \nsubmitting fingerprints and photographs for responsible persons is a reasonable cost of doing business; for trusts or \nlegal entities that acquire NFA firearms to allow multiple individuals to possess and use the same firearm (each of \nwhom will therefore be a responsible person), the cost of submitting fingerprints and photographs for each of those \npersons is directly related to the statutory goal of ensuring prohibited persons do not possess and use NFA \nfirearms.\n\n \n\n  The Department also notes that, as has been explained elsewhere, the Department predicts that the rule's impacts \non demand for NFA firearms will be minimal and the costs to trusts and legal entities will be low.\n\n \n\n  The final rule also simplifies the process of acquiring an NFA firearm by eliminating the CLEO certification \nrequirement for all applicants or transferees and replacing it with a less burdensome notification requirement. \nSimilarly, the final rule has clarified the \u201cresponsible person\u201d definition to ensure it does not extend to all members \nof a trust or legal entity (e.g., by excluding from the definition corporate shareholders who do not control the \nmanagement or policies of the entity with respect to firearms).\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Assessment of the NPRM Implementation Cost</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  A commenter observed that the proposed rule will be expensive to implement for the firearms industry. Another \ncommenter warned that ATF failed to take into account the fact that the proposed rule will also have an adverse \nfinancial impact on those who manufacture and sell or transfer NFA firearms. At least one commenter stated ATF \nfailed to consider the significant revenue losses the proposed rule would impose on small businesses. Another \ncommenter disagreed with ATF's assertion that the proposed rule will not affect small businesses. A commenter \nwho works for a firearms business stated, \u201c[I] manage a small business that holds an FFL and deals in NFA \ndevices. . . . All (100%) of our customers utilize legal entities to lawfully obtain NFA firearms. Since the proposed \nrule change our business in selling NFA firearms has dropped to zero as our customers do not want to spend \nmoney with the risk that they may not be able to take delivery of the NFA item. That drop translates into loss of \nrevenue for my small business, distributors I buy from, manufacturers of the devices and manufacturers of related \nequipment.\u201d A commenter who is an employee of a silencer manufacturer stated that the proposed regulation will \n\u201csurely cripple if not disable our business.\u201d Finally, another commenter asked the question, \u201cwhat about the \nmanufacturers and vendor of these controlled items who would inevitably lose a substantial amount of business?\u201d \nThat commenter argued that it is foreseeable that businesses involved in the manufacturing and selling of NFA \nitems will suffer from the implementation of the proposed regulation.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that any impact on the firearms industry arising from the proposed rule will be \ninsignificant. As noted, the CLEO certification requirement has been changed to a notification requirement, and the \ndefinition of responsible person has been clarified. These changes will ensure that the impact on the firearms \nindustry is minimal. Applications postmarked prior to the implementation of the final rule will be processed under the \ncurrent regulations. Only those applications postmarked on or after the implementation of the final rule will be \nsubject to the new regulations. Therefore, individuals who refuse to purchase NFA items on the basis of their belief \nthat the rule will interfere with their ability to complete the transfer process are mistaken.\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Commenters' Assessments of Implementation Cost</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter challenged ATF's assessment of the implementation cost of the proposed regulation, saying that \nATF failed to assess the loss of revenue from several sources; this commenter continued that ATF failed to \nconsider all of the monetary loss manufacturers, wholesalers, dealers, individuals, and \u201ccorporate/trust\u201d entities will \nincur as a result of the proposed rule. This commenter argued that there will be \u201cperceptional monetary loss\u201d as \nwell. According to this commenter, when law abiding buyers perceive that the transaction will require CLEO \ncertification that cannot be obtained in their area, the potential buyers will not attempt to buy the NFA items \nbecause they will believe the CLEO will not approve the sale. The commenter continued that this perception will \nultimately lower the number of purchasers, thus creating a monetary loss for the NFA industry.\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that the proposed regulation does not adequately address the economic impact to small and \nmedium businesses. This commenter stated that no assessment of this type could be valid without conservative \nassumptions on the number of lost sales due to these increased restrictions; these restrictions will have a significant \nand material impact on the number of silencers and other NFA items sold in the United States. This commenter \nstated that this is likely to cause many businesses (including large, medium, and small businesses) to close and \nwould have a \u201cdownstream ripple effect to their suppliers and local communities.\u201d At least one commenter asked \nthe following questions: \u201ccan you imagine the damage this will cause to the NFA market? What happens to the \nvalue of our items when you indirectly prohibit 90 percent of potential customers from obtaining the item? What \n\n\n\nhappens to the R&D budget for our arms manufacturers when they don't sell anywhere near the volume to their \nmost abundant customer base?\u201d\n\n \n\n  Another commenter noted that ATF failed to identity the cost associated with lost time from the backlog of \napplications for both existing and future employees of any company. Another commenter stated the proposed rule \nwill have a considerable and obvious negative impact on the industry by stifling sales and adding significant \nburdens relating to long term secure storage of pending NFA items. Another commenter stated that the proposed \nrule will decimate the industry that makes these NFA products for the military and the police because the NPRM will \nput these companies out of business, making product warranties that the military and police rely on invalid.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees that CLEO certification for all responsible persons of trusts or legal entities is not \nnecessary; consequently that requirement has been eliminated in this final rule and replaced with a less \nburdensome notification requirement. The change from certification to notification will reduce the impact on the \nfirearms industry. The Department believes that the impact on demand for NFA firearms arising from the rule will be \nslight. Please see section IV.E.2.a above for additional detail regarding the Department's response to claims this \nrule will negatively impact NFA manufacturers, dealers, and related businesses.\n\n \n\n  The Department does not agree with the commenters who assert that the proposed rule would have a negative \neffect on NFA firearms suppliers to the military and police. Government entities are exempt from the requirements \nin the rule and therefore neither the NPRM nor the final rule affects this industry. Moreover, because the impact of \nthe rule on the market for NFA firearms will be slight, the Department does not anticipate that military and police \nsuppliers will go out of business as a result of the rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes that the final rule will affect processing times and is implementing processes to keep \nthe impact to a minimum. However, processing times do not appear to reduce the demand for NFA firearms. ATF \nreceived more than ninety thousand applications in 2014 when processing times were approximately nine months.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Quantification of the Rule's Expected Benefits</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several commenters noted that the proposed rule provided only three \u201canecdotal\u201d examples occurring over the 80-\nyear life of the NFA to support the need for the proposed rule; they asserted that these examples failed to quantify \nany expected benefits, raised many questions, and could just as strongly justify a claim that the current procedures \nare working. Two commenters stated that ATF likely did not quantify any benefits or assign an economic value to \nsuch benefits because the NPRM predominantly addressed conduct already criminalized and prohibited by statute \nand regulations, and also noted that none of ATF's examples illustrated or supported the problem that ATF \nspeculated existed. Many commenters stated that the proposed rule presented no benefit to public safety or to \nATF's ability to execute its responsibilities relating to the NFA. Several commenters stated that the overall benefits \nwere inconclusive, nonexistent, and insignificant. A few commenters stated that simply speculating as to some \n\u201cmarginal\u201d benefit without estimating the size or value of that benefit made a \u201ccharade\u201d of the rulemaking process, \nand asserted that a \u201crather unlikely combination of circumstances\u201d would need to exist for the rule to produce any \nbenefits at all. Another commenter believed changes were needed to the current regulations; however, this \ncommenter stated that the changes should actually balance implementation costs with the desired effect. Another \n\n\n\ncommenter wanted more specifics, and asked, \u201c[w]hat are the metrics of success for this proposed rule? How many \nlives will it save for the cost of actual implementation using the numbers I provided [for responsible persons] rather \nthan the (no offense) ludicrous number of `2' propounded by ATF?\u201d Another commenter asked if ATF could show \nhow these proposed changes would improve public safety, and how the NFA's current rules are unsafe.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters stated that the problems with the proposed rule far outweigh any perceived benefits. One \ncommenter acknowledged the benefit of increasing public safety by preventing prohibited persons from obtaining \nfirearms, but requested that ATF expand its explanation of the benefits the proposed revisions would deliver. This \ncommenter stated that this additional information on benefits would be useful when considering and offsetting the \nincrease in costs from the proposed rule.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters stated that ATF's assumptions lacked statistical validity. Other commenters stated that the \nproposed rule lacked evidence to support the proposition that the proposed changes were needed to enhance \nsafety by preventing criminal use of highly regulated NFA items. A commenter asked ATF to provide statistical \nevidence that the proposed rule would reduce violent crime, and to provide a list of all violent crimes committed with \nregistered NFA weapons by the actual owner of the firearm where these proposed changes would have deterred \nthe crime. Another commenter similarly asked for current statistics on crimes committed by NFA weapons, and how \nthe proposed rule would make citizens safer. This commenter also asked for the studies that ATF did \u201cin \nconjunction with this legislation,\u201d and asked ATF to provide the studies and specific statistics that support the \nproposed regulations. Another commenter asked if ATF's three provided examples represent the only examples \nthat ATF has identified since the origin of the NFA in 1934. This commenter requested that ATF clarify its analyses \nused to support a public safety benefit for the proposed rule since this commenter, and many others, contend that \nthere is no documented violent criminal activity associated with NFA firearms. These commenters noted that the \nproposed rule would not have applied to the few rare occurrences of violent crime with legally owned NFA \nregistered firearms, as those activities were committed by a non-prohibited person in possession of a properly \nregistered NFA item. Another commenter asked ATF to have \u201can unbiased third party\u201d show a real risk to public \nsafety through past harms from the use of NFA items acquired via a living trust or legal entity, as well as project \nfuture risk trends from the use of such items.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter referenced a 2001 survey of inmates that showed that less than two percent of inmates used \nsemi-automatic or fully automatic rifles to commit their crimes. This commenter contended that the proposed rule's \neffect of \u201ctightening restrictions on law abiding citizens\u201d would not reduce this rate, and that ATF did not need to \n\u201cpass greater legislation to reduce the access of law abiding citizens to weapons and accessories which are \nregistered, carefully monitored, and taxed.\u201d\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Between 2006 and 2014, there were over 260,000 NFA firearms acquired by trusts or legal entities where no \nindividual associated with the trust or legal entity was subject to a NFA background check as part of the \napplication process. NFA firearms have been singled out for special regulation by Congress because they are \nparticularly dangerous weapons that can be used by a single individual to inflict mass harm. The Department does \nnot agree that a mass shooting involving an NFA firearm obtained by a prohibited person through a legal entity \nmust occur before these persons must be subject to a background check.\n\n \n\n  The GCA, at 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(1), requires FFLs to run a NICS check \u201cbefore the completion of the transfer\u201d of a \nfirearm, and verify the identity of the transferee. There is a limited exception under 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(3)(B) when a \nfirearm is transferred \u201cbetween a licensee and another person . . . if the Attorney General has approved the transfer \n\n\n\nunder section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\u201d The purpose of this exception is to avoid multiple \nbackground checks on the same individual by exempting a person from a NICS check at the point of transfer \nwhen that same person has already been the subject of a background check during the NFA registration process. \nCongress did not intend for NFA firearms to be transferred to individuals who avoided the background check \nprocess altogether. Between November 30, 1998, and August 31, 2015, the FBI's Criminal Justice Information \nServices Division conducted 216,349,007 background checks using NICS. Of the background checks conducted \nduring this time period, 1,229,653 resulted in a denial. The 99.4 percent \u201cproceed\u201d rate does not negate the public \nsafety associated with the 0.6 percent denied. While the number of NFA applications that are denied due to the \nbackground check is small, because even one prohibited individual with an NFA firearm poses an enormous risk \nto the lives of others, that small number does not negate the public safety associated with denying a prohibited \nperson access to an NFA firearm. Furthermore, requiring a background check on responsible persons of trusts \nand legal entities during the application process is consistent with Congressional intent for these individuals to \nundergo a background check to be eligible for the limited exception under 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(3)(B).\n\n \n\n  Additionally, even though 70 percent of all crime gun traces are on handguns, Federal law (18 U.S.C. 922(t)) \nrequires FFLs to conduct background checks prior to the transfer of long guns (rifles and shotguns) as well as \nhandguns (pistols and revolvers) to unlicensed persons. Thus, Congress did not intend to exclude certain types of \nfirearms from background checks simply because those firearms may be less frequently involved in criminal \nactivity. The Department does not agree that further research is needed to show that a responsible person for a \nlegal entity purchasing a machinegun should be subject to a background check. There is a tangible risk to public \nsafety whenever a prohibited individual has the power to exercise control over an NFA firearm. For additional \nresponses to comments on public safety see section IV.B.1, which specifically addresses the sufficiency of current \nregulations.\n\n \n\n  See sections IV.E.1.a and E.1.b for responses to comments on the methodology for determining the number of \nresponsible persons and number of pages of supporting documents. See section IV.D.1 regarding responses to \ncomments on Executive Order 12866.\n\n <h4>\n\n  F. Comments on Rulemaking Process</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. Availability of Background Information</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF did not make the NFATCA petition available for public inspection at any time before \nor during the public comment period for ATF 41P. This commenter noted that ATF cited the NFATCA petition as its \nbasis for the NPRM, and that the petition formed the \u201ccentral and critical foundation\u201d of ATF's argument for the \nproposed changes. Noting that ATF did not explain why it withheld this vital information, this commenter called \nATF's lack of transparency inexcusable, and stated this inaction warrants further investigation and clarification by \nATF.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that the NPRM indicated that the proposal rested on certain studies and other \nunderlying information, but that such underlying documents (seven categories, including the rulemaking petition; \nalleged \u201cnumerous statements\u201d from CLEOs that ATF received regarding \u201cpurported reasons\u201d for denying CLEO \ncertifications, details regarding the instances that prompted the decision that the regulation was needed; and the \nmethodology employed in random samples to estimate the number of responsible persons and the documentation \npages) were not placed in the rulemaking docket and, thus, the commenter had requested such documents (and \n\n\n\nany other documents that ATF replied upon when preparing the NPRM) \u201c[i]n order to ensure an adequate \nopportunity to comment on the ATF proposal.\u201d The commenter asserted that ATF declined to make public the \nrequested information, and that ATF neither posted materials to the eRulemaking site, nor made them available in \nATF's reading room. The commenter also requested the documents via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \nrequest without receiving such documents. The commenter stated its concern that omitting these items raised the \nquestion of what other pertinent materials may have been excluded. The commenter quoted several legal cases \nexplaining that interested parties should be able to participate in a meaningful way in the final formulation of rules, \nwhich would require an accurate picture of the agency's reasoning, which should be done with the agency providing \nthe data used and the methodology of tests and surveys relied upon to develop the NPRM. The commenter \ncontinued that case law provides that an agency commits serious procedural error when it fails to reveal the basis \nfor a proposed rule in time to allow for meaningful commentary. Thus, the commenter reasoned that providing \naccess to materials like those it requested has long been recognized as essential to a meaningful opportunity to \nparticipate in the rulemaking process. The commenter concluded that the lack of access to the requested materials \nhindered the ability of interested persons to address the assertions in the NPRM, and that if ATF intends to revise \npart 479 in the manner proposed, ATF should first lay the foundation for a proposal and then expose that \nfoundation to meaningful critique.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  In response to the assertion that the Department withheld the NFATCA petition, the Department references \nsection II of the NPRM that details each of NFATCA's four categories of concern\u2014amending \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and 479.85; \ncertifying citizenship; providing instructions for ATF Forms, 1, 4, and 5; and eliminating the CLEO certification \nrequirement. 78 FR at 55016-55017.\n\n \n\n  The NPRM explained those aspects of the NFATCA petition that were relevant to the rulemaking. The Department \nprovides the following excerpt from section II.A of the NPRM:\n\n \n\n  The NFATCA expressed concern that persons who are prohibited by law from possessing or receiving firearms \nmay acquire NFA firearms through the establishment of a legal entity such as a corporation, trust, or partnership. It \ncontends that the number of applications to acquire NFA firearms via a corporation, partnership, trust, or other legal \nentity has increased significantly over the years. ATF has researched the issue and has determined that the \nnumber of Forms 1, 4, and 5 involving legal entities that are not Federal firearms licensees increased from \napproximately 840 in 2000 to 12,600 in 2009 and to 40,700 in 2012.\n\n \n\n  This passage illustrates, with complete transparency, how ATF approached and researched the rulemaking \nprocess. Such detail not only lays \u201cthe foundation for a proposal\u201d but also exposes \u201cthat foundation to meaningful \ncritique.\u201d Moreover, the NFATCA petition was readily available through the internet. Thus, all relevant aspects of the \nNFATCA petition that were used in the development of the proposed rule were available to commenters and clearly \ndiscussed in the NPRM.\n\n \n\n  In response to the commenter who indicated that ATF did not provide certain documents related to seven \ncategories of information that the commenter deemed essential to meaningfully commenting on the rule, the \nDepartment acknowledges that ATF received requests for disclosure of the information from the commenter. Those \nrequests were processed by ATF's Disclosure Division and a copy of the NPRM was provided to the commenter in \nresponse to the commenter's request. The response did not include the requested seven categories of information. \nThe Department believes, however, that all of the requested information was discussed and addressed in the \nNPRM to a degree sufficient to provide the commenter with the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the \n\n\n\ndiscussion and final formulation of the final rule. The Department did not rely on any data, methodologies, \npredictions, or analysis that it did not clearly explain in the NPRM. The Department provided commenters \u201can \naccurate picture of the reasoning that . . . led the agency to the proposed rule\u201d and \u201cidentif[ied] and ma[de] available \ntechnical studies and data that it . . . employed in reaching\u201d its decisions. Connecticut Light & Power Co. v. NRC, \n673 F.2d 525, 530-31 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n\n \n\n  For example, the Department explained the source and number of samples it used to determine the average \nnumber of constitutive documents and responsible persons at trusts and legal entities. The Department cited and \nrelied upon the NFATCA petition that prompted the rulemaking. The Department gave examples of instances in \nwhich background check requirements were nearly evaded to show that a risk of circumvention existed. The \nDepartment openly discussed the benefits and drawbacks of the CLEO certification requirement and its proposed \nexpansion. Further, specific details about public safety concerns, including specific instances, were included in the \nNPRM. The Department believes that the details provided in the NPRM were sufficient and, as such, no additional \ninformation needed to be placed in the docket.\n\n \n\n  With respect to CLEO certification specifically, the Department believes that the NPRM amply conveyed ATF's \nknowledge of various reasons that CLEOs deny CLEO certifications. This is knowledge gained from the field and \ninteractions that the NFA Branch has had with CLEOs, as well as with applicants and transferees, during the \napplication process and at other times. In any event, the Department notes that any failure in this regard caused \ncommenters' no prejudice, as the Department was persuaded to change the CLEO certification requirement to a \nnotice requirement. See Am. Radio Relay League, Inc. v. FCC, 524 F.3d 227, 236-37 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n \n\n  Finally, the Department emphasizes that it remained open to persuasion throughout the rulemaking. In response \nto comments critical of the CLEO certification requirement, the Department adopted a CLEO notification \nrequirement. In response to comments critical of various aspects of its statutory and regulatory review and its cost-\nbenefit analysis, the Department expanded and strengthened its analysis and revised its estimates where \nappropriate. The Department believes that the analysis and responses to comments in this preamble conclusively \nshow that commenters were provided a meaningful opportunity to support, challenge, and critique the proposed rule \nand help to shape the Department's decision.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Public Submissions</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. ATF Posted Unrelated Materials to the Docket During the Public Comment Period</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter noted that ATF posted an unrelated final rule in the docket for this NPRM at www.regulations.gov, \nand asked ATF to remove it. This same commenter noted that two weeks after the comment period opened for this \nNPRM, ATF's Web site entitled \u201cATF Submissions for Public Comments\u201d also contained references to two \nunrelated matters, and requested this be clarified. This commenter expressed concern that this \u201cextraneous \nmaterial\u201d confused the public to think that the comment period for ATF 41P had ended, and referenced MCI \nTelecommunications Corp v. FCC, 57 F.3d 1136 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n  The Department is unaware of any \u201cextraneous material\u201d in the docket. A Department review of the            \nwww.regulations.gov site reveals that there are no documents to support this comment included in this docket. The \nonly document available is the subject NPRM. The Department also notes that on its public Web site, ATF's link to \n\u201cATF's Submissions for Public Comment\u201d directs users to the Bureau's FOIA library, with resources appropriate to a \nfull array of regulatory and policy issues.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. ATF Failed To Accept or Post Public Comments</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. ATF Failed To Include \u201cPertinent\u201d Submissions to the Docket</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that \u201cATF has a statutory duty to provide public access to members of the public and where . . \n. access is denied during the very period when the public are supposed to be able to investigate matters as a basis \nfor submitting comments on a proposed rule, ATF has denied a meaningful opportunity to participate in the notice \nand comment rulemaking process.\u201d The commenter expressed concern regarding the closure of the reading room \nfrom November 8, 2013, until November 15, 2013, while ATF was open. The commenter questioned how such a \nclosing was consistent with ATF's duty under FOIA. The commenter also expressed concern that ATF mandated \nthat counsel for commenter submit documentation regarding race, ethnicity, employment history, and other matters \nbefore ATF would permit access to its reading room.\n\n \n\n  This same commenter stated that it physically inspected the docket at ATF's reading room, but that it appeared \nthat only the public comments were available for review. The commenter expressed concern that the physical \ninspection of the docket also revealed that ATF had \u201cselectively excluded correspondence clearly related to the \nrulemaking proceeding.\u201d The commenter stated that it identified six items that had not been entered into the docket \nand requested that all pertinent material be placed in the docket. One such item was posted, but the other five \nreferenced items were not added to the docket prior to commenter's second physical inspection of the docket. The \ncommenter stressed concern that ATF either delayed posting items or ignored its requests.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department notes that on September 12, 2013, ATF posted the first comment relative to this NPRM on            \nwww.regulations.gov. ATF posted the final comment on February 7, 2014. In total, ATF posted 8,433 comments out \nof 9,479 received. Given the volume of comments and the resources available to ATF, the Department contends \nthat ATF strived to post all comments that met the criteria in the Public Participation section of the NPRM (78 FR at \n55025) in the order they were received and reviewed. For this final rule, all comments received are included in the \nfinal rule's administrative record.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the commenter's portrayal of ATF's reading room being closed November 8, 2013, until November 15, \n2013, this is not accurate. The Department acknowledges that a few days elapsed between the commenter's \nrequest and his counsel gaining access to ATF's reading room. Regarding the commenter's concern that ATF \nrequested that his counsel provide certain documentation before gaining access to the reading room, ATF notes \nthat this documentation is part of its standard procedures that have been implemented to address public safety \nconcerns and does not meaningfully interfere with access to all of the materials available in the ATF reading room.\n\n <h5>\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n  ii. ATF Failed To Permit a 90-Day Public Comment Period</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter pointed out problems inhibiting access to public to public comments through, for example, (1) the \nreading room being unavailable, (2) the            www.regulations.gov site malfunctioning, (3) the government \nclosure, (4) ATF's slowness to post submitted comments, and (5) ATF's staffing. This commenter previously \nrequested that ATF extend the comment period, and noted that other commenters made similar requests to ATF. \nThis same commenter also noted that others raised concerns about ATF's delay in posting comments to the \ndocket. This same commenter stated that other agencies granted extensions of comment periods due to the \ngovernment shutdown. Several commenters requested an extension for public comment by at least one day for \neach day that either ATF was closed or the            www.regulations.gov site was inaccessible.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department determined that an extension of the 90-day comment period was not warranted because it had \nreceived a large volume of diverse comments and additional time was unlikely to result in the submission of \ncomments identifying new concerns. Many of the comments ATF received were a repetition or duplication of \nprevious comments. Further, using all resources available, ATF followed the guidelines for public participation that \nappeared in the NPRM and posted \u201cAll comments [that referenced] the docket number (ATF 41P), [were] legible, \nand [included] the commenter's name and complete mailing address.\u201d The            www.regulations.gov Web site is \nmaintained by the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither the Department nor ATF has control of the \nfunctionality of an external agency's Web site.\n\n <h5>\n\n  iii. ATF Selectively Delayed Reviewing and Posting Comments Received</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter noted ATF's delays in posting comments and that the delays were not uniform. This commenter \ncontended that ATF \u201cconveniently\u201d delayed the posting of the comment the commenter prepared for another \nindividual, which critiqued flaws in the NPRM, while ATF simultaneously \u201capparently seeded the docket with \nsubmissions from proxies.\u201d The commenter stated that once the comment it prepared for another individual was \nposted, the cause for delays in posting comments, in general, was ameliorated and that comments were continually \nposted. This commenter also expressed concern that ATF continued to exclude its submissions or delayed posting \nthem to the docket while processing correspondence and comments from other interested persons, which raised a \nquestion regarding \u201cwhat other material submitted for the docket by other interested persons was not properly \nposted.\u201d The commenter stated that its communications to ATF regarding the rulemaking only occasionally received \na reply, only sometimes were placed in the docket, and only sometimes were posted promptly. Despite \ncommenter's inquiries, ATF declined to provide any explanation for the \u201cseemingly arbitrary management of the \ndocket.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that ATF repeatedly delayed posting comments, and that this significantly impacted his \nability to meaningfully participate in the comment process. This commenter observed that well past the government \nshutdown, 25-50 percent of the comments received had not been posted; during other periods when the \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\ngovernment was not shutdown, four or five days passed without ATF posting any comments even though the total \ncomments received increased every day.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department stresses that it posted all comments that followed the public participation guidelines in the NPRM. \nATF followed its processes for reviewing and posting comments.\n\n <h5>\n\n  iv. ATF \u201cDistorted\u201d the Public Comment Process by \u201cApparently Submitting Hearsay Information via Proxies\u201d</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF had proxies submit comments \u201cin an effort to bolster the suggestion of prior misuse \nof legal entities\u201d and listed examples of comments from ATF Special Agent Gregory Alvarez and John Brown, \nPresident of NFATCA. This commenter stated that ATF did not disclose its relationship with John Brown or reveal \nthat the only information John Brown offered in his public comment is \u201cwhat ATF leaked to him.\u201d\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  Neither the Department nor ATF uses or recruits \u201cproxies.\u201d Both the Department and ATF are committed to a \nrobust, candid rulemaking process and have an interest only in authentic public comments.\n\n <h5>\n\n  v. ATF's Previous \u201cLack of Candor\u201d Shows a Heightened Need for Procedural Regularity</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter stated that ATF has a well-documented record of \u201cspinning\u201d facts and engaging in outright deception \nof the courts, Congress, and the public. As a result, this commenter believes there is even more reason for ATF to \nprovide the documentation showing its basis for characterizing the issues in the NPRM, that it fairly considered \nalternatives, that it only inadvertently provided potentially misleading information or omitted pertinent information \nfrom the docket, that it only accidentally failed to consider requests for extension of the comment period, and that it \nhad no knowledge that commenters with a connection to ATF would act to bolster \u201cATF's unsupported assertions.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The commenter purported to provide instances where: (1) ATF committed blatant \u201cinstitutional perjury\u201d in the \ncontext of criminal prosecutions and in support of probable cause showings for search warrants; (2) ATF delayed \nanswering questions or provided deceptive answers to congressional inquiries about NFRTR inaccuracies and the \n\u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-walking operation, for example, and published proposed rules in flagrant disregard to \nlimitations on appropriations; and (3) ATF misled the public about the accuracy of the NFRTR.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department notes that ATF has committed available resources to develop this NPRM and respond to \ncomments as part of the rulemaking process. In developing this rulemaking and responding to comments, ATF has \nfollowed all established regulatory procedures and complied with all relevant policies and requirements.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Timetable for Final Rule</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  A commenter identified prior communications with ATF employees in August 2013, prior to the proposed rule's \npublication in September 2013, regarding whether a rule finalizing the proposed changes in the NPRM would only \napply to applications submitted after the effective date of the regulation, and stated that these communications \nindicated that such would be the case. However, this commenter stated that the text of the proposed rule was not \nclear on this matter and ATF had \u201cneedlessly confused the public\u201d and potentially falsely reassured persons \ninterested in filing comments. This commenter noted that several commenters expressed concern with the \n\u201cgrandfathering\u201d or transition issues. A few commenters specifically asked whether ATF would grandfather any \ntrusts or legal entities where the applications have been sent in, the $200 tax stamp check has been cashed, and \nthe application is \u201cpending\u201d prior to the effective date of the final rule. A few commenters asked what would happen \nto pending or \u201cin limbo\u201d applications, and if the applications would be sent back to the applicants. Several \ncommenters suggested\u2014or would want to ensure\u2014that ATF \u201cgrandfather in\u201d (i.e. not apply the requirements of the \nfinal rule to) all applications already submitted. A commenter stated that ATF could just as likely grandfather the \npending applications as reject them on the grounds that they were not submitted on a new form. If ATF does not \ngrandfather these applications, another commenter asked how ATF would handle them, and about the involved \ncosts. Another commenter asked if the pending applications would have to be resubmitted, and if so, whether they \nwould go to the back of the line for processing. Another commenter specifically asked whether ATF would refund \nthe transfer tax for the applications pending approval. A few commenters asked about retroactive changes to \npreviously completed transfers. Another commenter urged ATF to publish a notice clarifying that ATF has no intent \nto return pending applications to applicants for resubmission to conform with any new regulation.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters asked if existing legal entities and trusts holding NFA items must submit to ATF fingerprints, \nphotographs, and CLEO certifications for each responsible person or if they would be grandfathered. Another \ncommenter pointed out that the proposed rule did not provide a cost estimate to bring the \u201cmany thousands\u201d of \nexisting trusts and corporations into compliance with the new rule, and therefore surmised that past transfers would \nbe grandfathered. If this is not the case, this commenter suggested that ATF publicly disclose such a cost estimate. \nThis commenter stated that it could take months for a large corporation, which routinely purchases and sells NFA \nweapons, to establish policies and bring the entire workforce into compliance. This commenter asked whether \nemployees who have been approved as responsible persons could continue conducting business while other \nemployees were pending approval as responsible persons, and presumed that ATF would answer affirmatively. \nFinally, this commenter asked if ATF has estimated, even internally, the ATF staffing level and expansion of staff \nrequired to implement these new rules considering that the current wait time for Form 4 transfers and Form 3 \n(dealer to dealer) transfers is six to nine months, and three months, respectively, and the proposed rule, if finalized, \nwould result in a \u201clikely substantial\u201d additional workload for ATF.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The final rule is not retroactive and therefore the final rule will not apply to applications that are in \u201cpending\u201d status, \nor to previously approved applications for existing legal entities and trusts holding NFA items. The Department has \nconsidered the additional costs to ATF as a result of this rule, which are detailed in section VI.A below.\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Commenters Urge ATF To Withdraw Proposed Rule and Request a Public Hearing</h5>\n\n \n\n  Several trade association commenters, as well as individuals, encouraged ATF to withdraw the proposal. One of \nthese commenters, a trade association, suggested that ATF work with makers, sellers, and users of NFA firearms \nto develop a rule that is more realistic and addresses the real needs of all those concerned. Another trade \nassociation urged ATF to withdraw or substantially rewrite the rule. Both trade associations requested that ATF hold \na public hearing to ensure that all views and comments are fully heard. An individual commenter requested a \nhearing, or series of hearings around the country. In addition, another of these commenters advised ATF to focus \non streamlining the NFA application process and reducing the stress on local law enforcement.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department does not believe that soliciting additional information and views from the public, either through \ninformal meetings to further refine the scope of the rulemaking, or through public hearings, are necessary or \nappropriate.\n\n \n\n  The Department notes that the proposed rule included four direct, clear objectives:\n\n \n\n  1. Defining the term \u201cresponsible person,\u201d as used in reference to a trust, partnership, association, company, or \ncorporation;\n\n \n\n  2. Requiring responsible persons of such legal entities to submit, inter alia, photographs and fingerprints, as well \nas a law enforcement certification, when filing an application to make an NFA firearm or function as the transferee \non an application to transfer an NFA firearm;\n\n \n\n  3. Modifying the information required in a law enforcement certification to relieve the certifying official from \ncertifying that the official has no information indicating that the maker or transferee of the NFA firearm will use the \nfirearm for other than lawful purposes; and\n\n \n\n  4. Adding a new section to ATF's regulations stipulating that the executor, administrator, personal representative, \nor other person authorized under State law to dispose of property in an estate may possess a firearm registered to \na decedent during the term of probate without such possession being treated as a \u201ctransfer\u201d under the NFA, and \nspecifying that the transfer of the firearm to any estate beneficiary may be made on a tax-exempt basis.\n\n \n\n  ATF received nearly 9,500 responses from diverse public commenters, including professional associations, \nlobbying groups, and individuals, and the Department has afforded full consideration to these comments in \nformulating this final rule. Further, the Department's receipt and review of this volume of comments provides the \nDepartment with a complete array of comments likely to arise in a public hearing, making additional public events \nredundant. A public hearing, or even a series of them, will only serve to provide the Department information it has \nalready collected without delivering new insights.\n\n <h4>\n\n  G. Comments on NFA Registration and Processing</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stated that there is nothing wrong with the current system, and believed that the only change \nneeded is to speed up the NFA approval process. Many remarked on the huge backlog of pending NFA \napplications and that it takes months to well over a year for the NFA Branch to process Form 1 and Form 4 \napplications. A commenter thought that speeding up the process was especially essential for a person trying to \nregister a second item. Several commenters stated that if ATF and the Department really wanted to improve the \nNFA process, they should modernize the current process and upgrade their systems to permit electronic forms that \nneed to be filled out only once, and \u201cupgrade systems\u201d and utilize technology so that after the initial NFA approval, \nATF could access and use \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cbackground checks\u201d already on file to further speed up the process for \nsubsequent transfer requests.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters stated that ATF needed to hire more people (e.g., agents, inspectors, examiners, \nprocessors) to process the applications more efficiently. A few other commenters requested that more funding be \ngiven to ATF to hire additional staff; another commenter suggested that ATF figure out how to use the tax stamp \nmoney for this purpose. Several commenters believed that the NFA Branch is already overworked and \nunderstaffed, and that the proposed rule change would exponentially increase its workload and cause approval wait \ntimes to further increase. A commenter stated that the proposed rule's requirements would cause a \u201c912% increase \nin the number of papers and forms\u201d the NFA Branch has to process, and that increasing its workload more than \nnine times translates to wait times approaching a decade. One of these commenters stated that, at one time, Form \n1 and Form 4 applications took less than 3 months from submission to approval; however, in the past several \nyears, the workload has increased resulting in dramatically slower approval times. Another of these commenters \nnoted that ATF's own Web site shows that \u201cNFA applications increased 250% from 2005 to 2011, while the number \nof NFA examiners decreased 25%.\u201d This commenter contended that ATF is not meeting its \u201ccustomer service\u201d \ngoals. Another commenter stated that ATF should address and correct its internal deficiencies before proposing \nregulatory changes that will only exacerbate administrative challenges, without enhancing public safety at all.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that the process should only take a few days at most to process instead of the current \n\u201cmonths\u201d processing time. Another commenter suggested that ATF implement a maximum approval time of 30 \ndays, and that if ATF has taken no action in that time, the application should be automatically approved. Another \ncommenter suggested that the process be no longer than three months by default.\n\n \n\n  In addition to their suggestions on speeding up the process, a few commenters suggested that ATF decrease the \ntax stamp costs. A commenter asked, \u201cif I have an individual tax stamp why do I have to pay again to move it to a \ntrust that I set up?\u201d Another commenter suggested that ATF draft new regulations to change the tax stamp costs for \nall NFA items from $200 to $5. Another commenter suggested that ATF either reduce the $200 tax stamp cost to \n$50 or eliminate it altogether. Another commenter added that a reduction of the tax stamp cost would increase \nATF's revenues and the \u201ctax basis\u201d of the firearms industry.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department and ATF are committed to processing NFA forms as efficiently and expediently as possible \nconsidering that an ever-increasing number of forms are submitted. In FY 2010, ATF's NFA Branch processed \nalmost 92,000 forms (Forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 5320.20). In FY 2014, the number of forms processed \nincreased to over 236,000, an increase of 250 percent. As a result of this increase, ATF has dedicated more \nstaffing to the NFA Branch, increasing the number of legal instruments examiners from 9 to 27. Research assistants \n\n\n\nwere provided to the examiners to research and resolve problems. Data entry staffing has been increased. \nSimilarly, customer service representative staffing has been increased so that examiners are not pulled away from \ntheir tasks, and can respond quickly to the public and industry.\n\n \n\n  ATF has approved overtime in an effort to increase the forms processing rate and has brought in staffing on detail \nto process forms. In February 2014, the forms backlog was over 81,000 forms. As of October 7, 2015, the backlog \nhas been reduced to just over 51,000. The time frame for the processing of each type of form has also decreased \n(note: since each form has a different purpose, the processing times vary). Processing times for Forms 1 and 4, for \nexample, have been reduced from nine months to approximately five months.\n\n \n\n  ATF has used technology to help make the process quicker and more efficient. In 2013, ATF introduced an \nelectronic filing system (eForms) designed to allow forms to be filed more accurately, and more quickly, with \nimmediate submission into the NFA system for processing. This reduces data entry demands otherwise required \nwith paper forms. The eForms system, however, was not designed to allow the filing of forms where fingerprints, \nphotographs, and the law enforcement certification were required. However, it did allow the filing of forms by trusts \nor legal entities, such as LLCs. After several months of operation, the system encountered complications. It was \ntaken out of service for a brief period and then brought back up over a period of time. To preclude further \ncomplications, the highest volume forms submitted, Forms 3 and 4, have been kept out of service while ATF seeks \nto implement a new system with a more robust platform to process these forms and others in the existing eForms \nsystem. This process continues at the present time.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters stated that ATF should modernize the process and utilize technology so that data and \nbackground checks can be used for subsequent transfer requests. The Department agrees and, resources \npermitting, will look to design systems that will utilize information on file.\n\n \n\n  Budget allowing, the Department and ATF anticipate a staffing increase for the NFA Branch in FY 2016. As stated \nabove, over the past two years, ATF has committed additional resources to address the increase in applications \nsubmitted to the NFA Branch. The legal instrument examiner staffing has been tripled to 27 positions. However, the \nrate of submission continues to increase from almost 164,000 forms in CY 2013, to 236,000 in CY 2014 and a \nprojected total of 322,000 in CY 2015.\n\n \n\n  Because the tax rate is set by statute, ATF has no authority to change it. The NFA provides very limited authority \nto permit exemptions from the transfer tax, but commenters' requested exemptions do not fall within that authority. \nATF is also precluded by law from utilizing the taxes generated, as the making, transfer, and special (occupational) \ntax revenues are deposited into a general Treasury fund. In regard to a transfer between an individual and a trust, \nthe NFA imposes a tax on the transfer of an NFA firearm. A trust is a separate \u201cperson\u201d and, thus, the transfer from \nthe individual to a trust is a taxable \u201ctransfer\u201d under the statute and is subject to tax.\n\n <h4>\n\n  H. Comments on Efficiencies and Priorities</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  The majority of commenters thought that the proposed rule would do nothing to lessen crime and gun violence and \nsuggested that ATF first focus its efforts in other directions. A few commenters stressed educating children about \ngun safety, and stated that this could be done by parents and not on a Federal level. A few commenters urged the \n\n\n\nreduction or elimination of gun-free zones. A few commenters suggested that gangs are a problem for gun violence \nand crime, and that more time be spent addressing the causes of gang violence. Other commenters mentioned \n\u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d and suggested that ATF focus on \u201cclean[ing] up [its] own house before attacking \nlawful gun owners.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Several commenters believed that mental health issues greatly needed more attention, including more accessible \nand affordable resources and better screening, with commenters calling the mental health system \u201ccrippled\u201d and a \n\u201cfailure.\u201d A few commenters noted that the problem in the most recent mass gun murders has been mental health, \nand that the focus of prevention efforts should be on the \u201cunrestricted mental capacity\u201d of citizens who cannot \nunderstand and obey laws, not the tool (firearms) used in the crime. A commenter suggested that the Department \ndevote time and efforts to enact regulations for mental health; another commenter suggested working on the \n\u201cmental health aspect\u201d of people obtaining firearms. Another commenter suggested that gun purchasers take a \nmental exam. Another commenter suggested spending money to educate people about the signs of severe mental \nillness. Another commenter desired a national database, consisting of criminal offenders and mental health \npatients, released to each State's police force and the FBI.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters also stated that the administration, the Department, and ATF should better enforce the laws \nalready on the books, modify the current NICS instant check system to include mental health mandatory reporting, \nstiffen penalties, and stop handing out plea deals to people who violate the laws. Another commenter noted the \nitems listed in the NFA constitute less than one percent of all firearm felonies, and questioned why ATF would go \nafter the \u201csmallest portion of a problem.\u201d This commenter suggested that ATF go after the criminals and not law-\nabiding citizens. Another commenter suggested that ATF focus on repeated felonies. Another commenter \nquestioned where ATF would obtain the funding for the additional checks of NFA applications, and suggested \napplying this funding source toward improving efficiency and reducing the six- to eight-months-plus backlog of \nexisting applications.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter suggested that an NFA passport book be issued to each individual or trust that has completed \nan NFA background check. This passport book would be presented after paying the tax, at the time of the item's \npurchase. A stamp would immediately be placed in the passport book and the customer could leave with the \npurchased item. This commenter added that the check would then be mailed to ATF, and ATF could conduct yearly \naudits to regulate the passport books.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department's ultimate objective in the promulgation of this final rule is to enhance public safety by ensuring \nprohibited persons do not possess and use NFA weapons\u2014 the primary statutory goal of the NFA. Contrary to the \ncomments submitted suggesting otherwise, the objective of this final rule complements, rather than detracts from, \nthe numerous other public safety efforts that the Department and ATF engage in every day.\n\n \n\n  With the numbers of transactions involving trusts or legal entities increasing, the Department believes the \npossibility of a prohibited person obtaining an NFA firearm also increases. For example, currently, it is possible that \none or more responsible persons at a trust or legal entity are prohibited persons, yet that person could obtain \naccess to an NFA firearm by having someone at the trust or legal entity who is not a prohibited person serve as the \nsubject of the point-of-transfer background check. As noted above, the costs to ATF are detailed in section VI.A, \nbelow. ATF is dedicating resources to the processing of the forms currently submitted, and will continue to apply \nresources to ensure improvements in the process.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Department considered alternatives, such as the implementation of \u201cpassport books\u201d or similar systems, but \ndetermined that implementing them would require a statutory change.\n\n <h4>\n\n  I. New Responsible Persons and Form 5320.23</h4>\n\n <h5>\n\n  Comments Received</h5>\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, ATF stated that it was considering a requirement that new responsible persons submit Form \n5320.23 within 30 days of a change in responsible persons at the trust or legal entity, and sought opinions and \nrecommendations. See 78 FR at 55020. A commenter provided three reasons why this change is unnecessary, \nunworkable, and would lead to chaos within legal entities. First, ATF only has authority under the NFA to identify \napplicants, which applies to responsible persons before the transfer has occurred, and is not an ongoing obligation \nonce the transfer has occurred. Second, companies today face many situations that would make it very difficult and \noverly burdensome to determine who is a responsible person and submit the required information (e.g., high \nemployee turnover, shifting management responsibilities and roles, temporary management changes, overlaps in \nmanager authority). In addition, many small legal entities would not have the administrative personnel to handle this \nrequired process. Third, this requirement would create much confusion and raise many questions if a potential new \nresponsible person could not obtain the CLEO certification.\n\n \n\n  This commenter further stated that a continuing obligation to obtain approval from ATF to add each new \nresponsible person would magnify the burdens related to the proposed CLEO certification requirement and the \n\u201cresponsible person\u201d definition, particularly because legal entities have less control over managerial structure \nchanges than they do over a decision about whether and when to acquire or make a new NFA firearm. This \ncommenter believes that non-firearm related factors overwhelmingly dictate changes in personnel and managerial \nstructure, and that complications relating to ensuring compliance with an ongoing designation obligation under the \nimplementing regulations should not impact the personnel and managerial structure of a legal entity.\n\n \n\n  A few commenters did not recognize that ATF was only considering this change, and thought that this change was \nbeing proposed; they included their comments on the issue with comments on the proposed change to CLEO \ncertification for responsible persons. For example, a few commenters stated that the NPRM would impact trustees' \nabilities to manage trusts because of the proposed requirement that new responsible persons submit a Form \n5320.23 and obtain a CLEO sign-off within 30 days of their appointment. A few other commenters stated that, by \nproposing that any new responsible person submit a Form 5320.23 and obtain a CLEO signoff within 30 days of the \nnew responsible person's appointment, the proposed rule intruded upon the traditional uses of trusts and upon the \nrights of settlors to manage their estate plans.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter, noting ATF's long-held position that certain activities, such as the sale of a company, hiring \nnew employees, or adding new trustees are not \u201ctransfers\u201d of firearms, stated that the rule change would improperly \nextend ATF's authority. This commenter stated that ATF and DOJ incorrectly relied on their authority under 26 \nU.S.C. 5812(a) for the proposed change, because that section only authorizes ATF to collect information on the \ntransferee during a transfer, not to continue collecting information on the transferee (or persons who act on behalf \nof the transferee) after the application is approved. This commenter asserted that the 30-day rule requirement \nwould enable CLEOs and ATF to veto private decisions that are not the business of the government, and that \nCongress has not authorized such veto rights. This commenter asked ATF to consider the negative unintended \nconsequences of the 30-day rule requirement, because its imposition would effectively mean a CLEO has to \napprove the sale of a company where buyers reside, the addition of trustees where trustees reside, the hiring of \n\n\n\nemployees where employees reside, and the membership of an association. Further, this commenter stated that if \nATF implemented this change, ATF would be violating First and Second Amendment rights, as well as rights of \nprivacy, when ATF's objective could be achieved by any licensed FFL performing a \u201cdiscreet, confidential NICS \ncheck.\u201d Further, this commenter stated that requiring a legal entity to request and receive permission for all \npersonnel changes would be cumbersome, impacting personnel decisions and greatly increasing hiring costs.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that a requirement for all responsible persons to submit Form 5320.23 and comply with \nthe CLEO certification within 30 days would be a \u201cradical\u201d departure from trust law and estate planning. As a result, \nthis commenter cautioned ATF to expect long and costly court battles, that ATF would lose, as the proposed \nrequirements would infringe property rights and the ability to pass trust property to legal heirs.\n\n <h5>\n\n  Department Response</h5>\n\n \n\n  The Department notes that it did not propose to make any changes on this issue in the proposed rule. Rather the \nDepartment requested input and guidance relative to identification of new responsible persons who receive, \npossess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf of, an entity. The \nDepartment is not requiring, in this final rule, that new responsible persons submit a Form 5320.23 within 30 days \nof any change of responsible persons at a trust or legal entity.\n\n \n\n  The Department further notes that nothing in this rulemaking has altered the requirement for trusts and legal \nentities to submit new applications to make or transfer (as applicable) if the trust or legal entity intends to possess \nadditional NFA items, or if there is a sufficient change in control or ownership of the trust or legal entity such that it \nis considered a new or different entity under relevant law. In either case, at the time of such application, the trust or \nlegal entity will need to identify current responsible persons, who will submit photographs and fingerprints, and \nundergo a background check.\n\n \n\n  Refer to section IV.C.1 in this document to review ATF's shift from CLEO certification to CLEO notification\u2014a \nprocess that alleviates the potential for administrative backlogs as a result of personnel changes, and any concerns \nthat a CLEO may dictate the operation of an entity.\n\n <h3>\n\n  V. Final Rule</h3>\n\n \n\n  For the reasons discussed above, this final rule has been revised from the proposed rule to eliminate the \nrequirement for a certification signed by a CLEO and instead add a CLEO notification requirement. The final rule \nalso clarifies that the term \u201cresponsible person\u201d for a trust or legal entity includes those persons who possess the \npower or authority to direct the management and policies of an entity to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, \ntransfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf of, the trust or entity. In the case of a trust, those with \nthe power or authority to direct the management and policies of the trust includes any person who has the capability \nto exercise such power and possesses, directly or indirectly, the power or authority under any trust instrument, or \nunder State law, to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on \nbehalf of, the trust. The Department has removed \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d from the final non-exclusive list in the definition of \n\u201cresponsible person.\u201d However, a beneficiary or any other individual actually meeting the definition of a \u201cresponsible \nperson\u201d in the final rule shall be considered one.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Accordingly, because the law enforcement certification will no longer be required, the regulations in \u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63 and \n479.85 are being revised to require the applicant maker or transferee, as well as each responsible person, to \nprovide a notice to the appropriate State or local official that an application is being submitted to ATF. The \nDepartment also agrees that a change from a CLEO certification to CLEO notification will require a change to the \nForms 1, 4, and 5.\n\n \n\n  This final rule clarifies proposed \u00a7\u2009479.62(b)(2) to denote that the required employer identification number for an \napplicant, other than an individual, may be \u201cif any.\u201d This final rule makes a minor change to proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7\u2009479.63(b)(2)(ii) and 479.85(b)(2)(ii) by removing \u201cSocial Security number (optional)\u201d and \u201cplace of birth\u201d from the \n\u201ccertain identifying information\u201d required to be submitted on the Form 5320.23 in both of these sections, and \nclarifying that the \u201ccountry of citizenship\u201d must only be provided if other than the United States. In addition, this final \nrule removes \u201cplace of birth\u201d from proposed \u00a7\u2009479.62(b)(2) for the required Form 1 applicant identity information. \nThis final rule adopts all other proposed changes in the NPRM.\n\n <h3>\n\n  VI. Statutory and Executive Order Review</h3>\n\n <h4>\n\n  A. Executive Order 12866 and 13563\u2014Regulatory Review</h4>\n\n \n\n  This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with section 1(b) of Executive Order 12866 \n(\u201cRegulatory Planning and Review\u201d) and with section 1(b) of Executive Order 13563 (\u201cImproving Regulation and \nRegulatory Review\u201d). The Department of Justice has determined that this final rule is a significant regulatory action \nunder section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and, accordingly, this final rule has been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n\n \n\n  This final rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; nor will it adversely affect in \na material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public \nhealth or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. Accordingly, the final rule is not an \neconomically significant rulemaking under Executive Order 12866. The estimated costs and benefits of the final rule \nare discussed below.\n\n <h5>\n\n  1. Summary of Costs and Benefits</h5>\n\n \n\n  This rule requires certain trusts and legal entities (partnerships, companies, associations, and corporations) \napplying to make or receive an NFA firearm to submit information for each of its responsible persons to ATF in \norder for ATF to ensure that such persons are not prohibited from possessing or receiving firearms. ATF estimates \na total additional cost of approximately $29.4 million annually for trusts and legal entities to gather, procure, and \nsubmit such information to ATF and for ATF to process the information and conduct a background check on \nresponsible persons. These provisions have public safety benefits in that they will enable ATF to ensure that the \nestimated 231,658 responsible persons within trusts or legal entities that request to make or receive NFA firearms \neach year are not prohibited from possessing such firearms.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that this final rule may increase the time required to process applications received \nfrom trusts and legal entities, as well as for individuals, as an increased number of applications undergo more \ncomplete checks. The Department estimates that this final rule initially will increase processing times of these \napplications from four months to six to eight months. However, the Department anticipates that this time will be \n\n\n\nreduced once the NFA Branch adjusts to the new process. In addition, ATF will work to increase its resources and \nstaffing to process the applications. Of course, continued increases in the numbers of applications submitted may \ncorrespondingly continue to place pressure on processing times.\n\n \n\n  This final rule eliminates the current requirement that all individual applicants obtain a certification from the CLEO \nfor the locality. Instead, under the final rule, applicants seeking to make or receive an NFA firearm are required to \nnotify their local CLEO before they submit the ATF application to make or receive an NFA firearm. Similarly, the \nfinal rule does not adopt a requirement that responsible persons obtain a CLEO certification, as was discussed in \nthe proposed rule; instead, the final rule extends the same notification requirement to all responsible persons for \neach trust and legal entity applicant. ATF estimates the total cost of the CLEO notification requirement in this final \nrule to be approximately $5.8 million annually ($0.5 million for individuals; $5.3 million for legal entities), as \ncompared to the approximate costs of $2.26 million annually for the current requirement that individuals obtain a \ncertification from their local CLEO. Therefore, the estimated net cost increase of this final rule relating to CLEO \nnotification is approximately $3.6 million annually. However, the final rule's estimated cost reduction for individual \napplicants is approximately $1.8 million annually.\n\n <h5>\n\n  2. Costs and Benefits of Ensuring Responsible Persons Within Trusts and Legal Entities Are Not Prohibited From \nPossessing NFA Firearms</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Methodology for Determining Costs</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF estimated the cost of the provisions to ensure responsible persons within trusts and legal entities are not \nprohibited from possessing NFA firearms by: (1) Estimating the time and other resources that would be expended \nby legal entities to complete paperwork, obtain photographs and fingerprints, and send this information to ATF; and \n(2) estimating the time and other resources that would be expended by ATF to process and review the materials \nprovided by the trusts and legal entities and to conduct background checks of responsible persons.\n\n \n\n  ATF estimated the cost of the time for trusts and legal entities to complete these tasks using employee \ncompensation data for June 2015 as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS). See            http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf.  (14)  The BLS determined the hourly \ncompensation (which includes wages, salaries, and benefits) for civilian workers to be $33.19, and for State and \nlocal government workers to be $44.22. In addition, ATF estimates that each trust or legal entity has an average of \ntwo responsible persons, an estimate that is based on ATF's review of 454 randomly selected applications for \ncorporations, LLCs, and trusts processed during calendar year CY 2014.\n\n \n\n  ATF used data from CY 2014 to estimate the number of trusts, legal entities, and individuals that would be \naffected by the final rule. In CY 2014, ATF processed 159,646 applications that were either ATF Forms 1, 4, or 5. \nOf these, 115,829 applications were for unlicensed trusts or legal entities (e.g., corporations, companies) to make \nor receive an NFA firearm; 29,191 were for individuals to make or receive an NFA firearm; and 14,626 were for \ngovernment agencies or qualified Federal Firearms Licensees (Gov/FFLs) to make or receive an NFA firearm. The \nnumbers of applications, by Form and submitting individual or entity, are set forth in Table A.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table A\u2014Numbers of Applications Processed\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf\n\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      CY 2014\n\n     \n\n      Trust & legal entity\n\n     \n\n      Individual\n\n     \n\n      Gov/FFL\n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Form 1\n\n     \n\n      21,879\n\n     \n\n      3,360\n\n     \n\n      477\n\n     \n\n      25,716\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Form 4\n\n     \n\n      93,739\n\n     \n\n      25,343\n\n     \n\n      4,257\n\n     \n\n      123,339\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n      Form 5\n\n     \n\n      211\n\n     \n\n      488\n\n     \n\n      9,892\n\n     \n\n      10,591\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      29,191\n\n     \n\n      14,626\n\n     \n\n      159,646\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  ATF estimated the cost of complying with the final rule's requirements by estimating the cost of undertaking each \nof the steps necessary to complete an application. Under this final rule, a trust or legal entity is required to complete \nthe following steps in addition to completing the applicable Form 1, 4, or 5 before it is permitted to make or receive \nan NFA firearm:\n\n \n\n  1. Complete and submit Form 5320.23 for each responsible person;\n\n \n\n  2. Submit fingerprints and photographs for each responsible person; and\n\n \n\n  3. Submit a copy of the documentation that establishes the legal existence of the legal entity.\n\n \n\n  In addition, under the final rule, information required on the existing ATF Form 5330.20 would be incorporated into \nthe ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Cost to Trusts and Legal Entities of Applying To Make or Transfer</h5>\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  i. Time Cost of Completing a Responsible Person Form</h5>\n\n \n\n  The final rule requires trusts and legal entities to complete and submit to ATF a new form (Form 5320.23), \nphotographs, and fingerprint cards for each responsible person before the trust or legal entity is permitted to make \nor receive an NFA firearm. The information required on Form 5320.23 includes the responsible person's name, \nposition, home address, and date of birth. The identifying information for each responsible person is necessary for \nATF to conduct a background check on each individual to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing \nan NFA firearm under Federal, State, or local law.\n\n \n\n  ATF estimates the time for each responsible person to complete Form 5320.23 to be 15 minutes. Based on an \nestimate of 2 responsible persons per trust or legal entity and 115,829 entities, the estimated time cost to complete \nForm 5320.23 is $1,922,182 (15 minutes at $33.19 per hour \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2).\n\n <h5>\n\n  ii. Cost of Photographs</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF estimates that:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The cost of the photographs is $11.32 (based on the average of the costs determined for 60 Web sites); and\n\n  \n\n   The time needed to procure photographs is 50 minutes.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Currently, only individuals must obtain and submit photographs to ATF. Based on an estimate of 29,191 \nindividuals, the current estimated cost is $1,137,816 (Cost of Photographs = $11.32 \u00d7 29,191 = $330,442; Cost to \nProcure Photographs = 50 minutes at $33.19 per hour \u00d7 29,191 = $807,374). Under the final rule, costs for \nindividuals would remain the same, but trusts and legal entities would incur new costs. Each responsible person of \na trust or legal entity would be required to obtain and submit photographs. Based on an estimate of 2 responsible \npersons per entity and 115,829 entities, the estimated cost for trusts and legal entities to obtain and submit \nphotographs is $9,029,642 (Cost of Photographs = $11.32 \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $2,622,368; Cost to Procure \nPhotographs = 50 minutes at $33.19 per hour \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $6,407,274).\n\n <h5>\n\n  iii. Cost of Fingerprints</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF has reviewed various fingerprinting services. At the present time, ATF is only able to accept fingerprints on \nhard copy fingerprint cards. Thus, the cost estimates are based on the submission of two hard copy fingerprint \ncards for each responsible person.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost of the fingerprints is $18.66 (cost based on the average of the costs determined for 275 Web \nsites); and\n\n  \n\n   The estimated time needed to procure the fingerprints is 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Currently, only individuals must obtain and submit fingerprints. Based on an estimate of 29,191 individuals, the \ncurrent estimated cost is $1,513,553 (Cost of Fingerprints = $18.66 \u00d7 29,191 = $544,704; Cost to Procure \nFingerprints = 60 minutes at $33.19 per hour \u00d7 29,191 = $968,849). Under the final rule, costs for individuals would \nremain the same, but trusts and legal entities would incur new costs. Each responsible person of a trust or legal \nentity would be required to obtain and submit fingerprints to ATF. Based on an estimate of 2 responsible persons \nper entity and 115,829 entities, the estimated cost for trusts and legal entities to obtain and submit fingerprints is \n$12,011,467 (Cost of Fingerprints = $18.66 \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $4,322,738; Cost to Procure Fingerprints = 60 minutes \nat $33.19 per hour \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $7,688,729).\n\n <h5>\n\n  iv. Cost of Documents To Establish Existence of Trust or Legal Entity</h5>\n\n \n\n  A trust or legal entity that is applying to make or receive an NFA firearm must provide to ATF documentation \nevidencing the existence and validity of the entity\u2014e.g., copies of partnership agreements, articles of incorporation, \ncorporate registration, declarations of trust with any trust schedules, attachments, exhibits, and enclosures. \nCurrently, trusts and legal entities may submit this documentation with their application package, although they are \nnot required to do so. Therefore, ATF is treating the costs for documentation as new costs. ATF accepts, and will \ncontinue to accept, photocopies of the documents without notarization. ATF made the cost estimate by determining \nthe average number of pages in the corporate or trust documents for 454 recent randomly selected submissions \nprocessed during CY 2014, which was 16 pages.\n\n \n\n  ATF estimates that:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The cost of the copied documentation is $1.60 ($.10 per page at 16 pages); and\n\n  \n\n   The time needed to copy attachments is 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Assuming 115,829 entities would provide ATF this documentation each year, the estimated annual cost to submit \nthe documentation is $826,053 (Cost of documentation = $1.60 \u00d7 115,829 = $185,326; Cost to copy attachments = \n10 minutes at $33.19 per hour \u00d7 115,829 = $640,727). This cost is not dependent on the number of responsible \npersons associated with a legal entity. ATF notes that the estimated cost is likely to be lower if the entity has \nalready filed the documents with ATF as part of a recent making or transfer application and the information \npreviously provided has not changed. Under these circumstances, the entity can certify to ATF that the \ndocumentation is on file and is unchanged.\n\n <h5>\n\n  v. Cost of Completing and Mailing Form 1, 4, or 5</h5>\n\n \n\n  Currently, individuals, trusts, and legal entities must complete and mail Form 1, 4, or 5. This final rule should not \nchange the costs to individuals, trusts, or legal entities to complete such forms. Even if there are multiple \nresponsible persons associated with a trust or legal entity, the trust or legal entity still will be completing and mailing \none Form 1, 4, or 5. However, ATF estimates that trusts and legal entities will incur increased postage costs to mail \nForms 1, 4, and 5 applications to ATF. Currently, for trusts and legal entities, these applications only contain the \ncompleted form itself; ATF estimates postage costs at $56,756 (115,829 \u00d7 $.49). However, under the final rule, \n\n\n\ntrusts and legal entities must also include Form 5320.23, photographs, and fingerprint cards for each responsible \nperson, as well as documentation evidencing the existence and validity of the trust or entity. ATF estimates postage \ncosts for this complete application package at $113,512 ($115,829 \u00d7 $.98). Therefore, ATF estimates the new \nmailing costs for trusts and legal entities, under this final rule, to be $56,756 ($113,512\u2212$56,756).\n \n\n  The estimated costs to legal entities that are discussed above are summarized in Tables B(1) and B(2). The total \nestimated new cost of the final rule for legal entities to provide to ATF identification information for each of its \nresponsible persons is $23,846,679 annually.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table B(1)\u2014Cost Estimates of the Time To Comply With the Final Rule's Requirements\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Process\n\n     \n\n      Estimated time(minutes)\n\n     \n\n      Number of entities\n\n     \n\n      2 Responsible persons\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Completion of Form 5320.23\n\n     \n\n      15\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      $1,922,182\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Procure Photographs\n\n     \n\n      50\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n\n\n     \n\n      6,407,274\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Procure Fingerprints\n\n     \n\n      60\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      7,688,729\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Copy Attachments\n\n     \n\n      10\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      640,727\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      16,658,885\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table B(2)\u2014Cost Estimates of Procuring Photographs, Fingerprints, Documentation, and Mailing\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Process-related item\n\n     \n\n      Estimated cost\n\n     \n\n      Number of entities\n\n     \n\n      2 Responsible persons\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Photographs\n\n     \n\n      $11.32\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      $2,622,368\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Fingerprints\n\n     \n\n      18.84\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      4,322,738\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Documentation of Legal Entity\n\n     \n\n      1.60\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      185,326\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Increased Application Postage\n\n     \n\n      .49\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      56,756\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      7,187,188\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n <h5>\n\n  c. Cost to ATF</h5>\n\n \n\n  ATF incurs costs to process forms, fingerprint cards, photographs, and to conduct and review background \nchecks. Currently, ATF incurs these costs for the 29,191 applications for individuals to make or receive NFA \nfirearms. Under the final rule, ATF would incur these costs for applications for trusts and legal entities to make or \nreceive NFA firearms. ATF estimates that:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   ATF's cost for the FBI to process a set of fingerprints is $12.75. (The cost is based on the FBI's current fee, which \nis set by statute on a cost recovery basis.)\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost for an examiner at ATF's NFA Branch to conduct and review the results of a background \ncheck is $11.06 (15 minutes at $44.22 per hour); and\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost to print the new 5320.23 forms is $.0747 per form.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Based on an estimate of 2 responsible persons per legal entity and 115,829 entities, the estimated cost for ATF to \nprocess forms, fingerprint cards, photographs, and to conduct and review background checks for applications for \nlegal entities to make or receive firearms is $5,533,082 annually (Cost for processing fingerprints = $12.75 \u00d7 \n115,829 \u00d7 2= $2,953,640; Cost for background checks = $11.06 \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $2,562,137; Cost to print forms \n= $.0747 \u00d7 115,829 \u00d7 2 = $17,305).\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table C\u2014Costs to ATF Under Final Rule\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Process\n\n     \n\n      Estimated cost or time\n\n     \n\n      Number of entities\n\n     \n\n      2 Responsible persons\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      ATF's costs for Processing Fingerprints\n\n     \n\n      $12.75\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      $2,953,640\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Time Needed to Conduct and Review Background Check by ATF\n\n     \n\n      15 minutes\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n\n\n      2,562,137\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Cost of Form 5320.23\n\n     \n\n      $.0747\n\n     \n\n      115,829\n\n     \n\n      17,305\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      5,533,082\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  The estimated total additional cost of the final rule for trusts and legal entities to gather, procure, and submit to \nATF responsible person forms, fingerprints, photographs, documents to establish existence of trust or legal entity, \nand Form 1, 4, or 5, and for ATF to process the information and conduct a background check on responsible \npersons is $29,379,155 annually (Sum of tables B(1), B(2), and C: $16,658,885 + $7,187,188 + $5,533,082 = \n$29,379,761).\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Benefits of Background Checks for Responsible Persons</h5>\n\n \n\n  The background check requirement for responsible persons provides at least two important benefits. First, it \nprovides important public safety and security benefits by helping ATF to prevent individuals who are prohibited from \npossessing firearms from obtaining them. Second, by requiring responsible persons to submit the same information \nand meet same requirements as individuals who seek permission to make or transfer a firearm, the final rule closes \na potential loophole that might otherwise allow individuals to form trusts or legal entities for the purpose of obtaining \na firearm they are prohibited from possessing.\n\n \n\n\n\n  This final rule provides important public safety and security benefits by enabling ATF to ensure that individuals \nwho are prohibited from possessing firearms do not obtain them. Existing regulations do not require the \nidentification of responsible persons of a trust or legal entity. Therefore, ATF lacks the necessary information to \nperform a background check on a person who meets the rule's definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d to determine if \nthat person is prohibited from possessing an NFA firearm. This final rule provides important public safety and \nsecurity benefits by enabling ATF to identify and perform background checks on such persons.\n\n \n\n  For example, there may be a number of responsible persons associated with a corporation, LLC, or trust. As noted \nabove, based on a recent review of applications for corporations, LLCs, and trusts, ATF estimates that there are 2 \nresponsible persons associated with such legal entities. One or more of these persons could be a prohibited \nperson, e.g., a convicted felon. These prohibited persons could be establishing trusts or legal entities as a means of \navoiding a fingerprint-based background check. Therefore, requiring the responsible parties of a trust or legal \nentity to follow the same requirements as individuals will close this loophole. Currently, when an NFA transfer \napplication is approved, a corporate officer or trustee arranges for the receipt of the firearm. If the seller is an FFL, \nthe officer or trustee must complete ATF Form 4473 (5300.9), Firearms Transaction Record. On the Form 4473, the \nofficer or trustee must answer questions that determine if the officer or trustee is a prohibited person. If one of the \nofficers or trustees is prohibited, then one of the other officers or trustees may pick up the firearm and complete the \nForm 4473. Once the firearm is picked up by the officer or trustee, it then becomes corporate or trust property and \ncan be possessed by any of the officers or trustees. As discussed in the NPRM, ATF has encountered situations in \nwhich it lacked the necessary information to conduct any background checks to determine whether the \nresponsible person at an LLC or trust was a prohibited person. See 78 FR at 55023 for more detailed discussion. \nAs discussed in section IV.B.1.c, there are more recent examples. Between 2006 and 2014 there were over \n260,000 NFA firearms acquired by trusts or legal entities where no individual associated with the trust or entity was \nsubject to a NFA background check as part of the application process. As a result, under current regulations, \nprohibited persons can circumvent the statutory prohibitions and receive firearms.\n\n <h5>\n\n  3. Costs and Benefits of Final Rule To Notify CLEOs Before Making or Transferring an NFA Firearm</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Cost of Current Requirement To Obtain Law Enforcement Certification</h5>\n\n \n\n  Under current regulations, the maker or transferee of an NFA firearm typically will bring a Form 1, 4, or 5 to the \nmaker or transferee's local CLEO to obtain the CLEO certification as required on the form and therefore may need \nto meet with the CLEO. The maker or transferee may need to return to pick up the certified form. ATF estimates \nthat the time needed for the maker or transferee to procure the CLEO certification is 100 minutes (70 minutes travel \ntime and 30 minutes review time with the CLEO).\n\n \n\n  For CY 2014, of the 159,646 Form 1, Form 4, and Form 5 applications processed by ATF, 115,829 were for trusts \nor legal entities to make or receive NFA firearms. Trusts and legal entities are not currently required to obtain CLEO \ncertification. However, certification is required for the 29,191 applications for individuals to make or receive NFA \nfirearms. The current cost to obtain CLEO certification is estimated as follows:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost for the individual to obtain the CLEO certification is $1,614,749 (100 minutes at $33.19 per \nhour \u00d7 29,191)\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost for the CLEO to review and sign the certification is $645,413 (30 minutes at $44.22 per hour \u00d7 \n29,191)\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  The total estimated cost of the certification requirement is $2,260,162 (individuals $1,614,749; CLEOs: $645,413).\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table D\u2014Current CLEO Certification Process Costs\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Current CLEO process\n\n     \n\n      Estimated time(minutes)\n\n     \n\n      Number of respondents\n\n     \n\n      Cost\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Procure Certification from CLEO\n\n     \n\n      100\n\n     \n\n      29,191\n\n     \n\n      $1,614,749\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Agency Review and Sign Certification\n\n     \n\n      30\n\n     \n\n      29,191\n\n     \n\n      645,413\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      2,260,162\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Cost of Requirement To Notify CLEOs</h5>\n\n \n\n  The final rule replaces the existing requirement to obtain certification by the local CLEO before submitting an \napplication to make or receive an NFA firearm with a requirement to notify the local CLEO before submitting an \napplication to make or receive an NFA firearm. The notification requirement requires the maker or transferee to mail \na copy of the application to the CLEO with jurisdiction over the area of the applicant's residence or, in the case of a \ntrust or legal entity, the CLEO with jurisdiction over the business or trust. In addition, the notification requirement \nrequires all responsible persons for trusts and legal entities to mail a copy of Form 5320.23 to the CLEO for their \narea of residence, principal office, or business. The effect of this provision is that trusts and legal entities, as well as \ntheir responsible persons, are required to provide notification of the proposed making or transfer to their local \nCLEOs, whereas currently trusts and legal entities and their responsible persons are not required to notify or obtain \ncertification from their local CLEOs. Individuals must only notify their local CLEOs under the final rule, whereas \ncurrently they are required to obtain certification from their local CLEOs.\n\n \n\n  In CY 2014, ATF processed 115,829 applications from trusts and legal entities and 29,191 application from \nindividuals. Under the final rule, each of these applications require CLEO notification. For individuals, the CLEO \nnotification will include a copy of the Form 1, 4, or 5 application, which contains 3 pages for each application. For \ntrusts and legal entities, the CLEO notification will include: (1) For the applicant, a copy of the Form 1, 4, or 5 \napplication, which contains 3 pages for each application; (2) for responsible persons, a copy of Form 5320.23, \nwhich contains 2 pages. Form 5320.23 will contain a \u201ccopy 1\u201d page for ATF and a \u201ccopy 2\u201d page for the CLEO. This \nmeans that trusts and legal entities will not need to make copies of Form 5320.23 when mailing Form 5320.23 to \nthe CLEO. All applicants will need to make copies of the application to mail the application to the CLEO.\n\n \n\n  ATF estimates the cost of CLEO notification for individuals as follows:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost to copy an application to send as a notification to the CLEO is $.30 for each Form 1, Form 4, \nand Form 5 ($.10 per page for 3 pages). Cost is $8,757 ($.30 \u00d7 29,191).\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost to mail an application to the CLEO is $.49 (current postage cost). Cost is $14,304 ($.49 \u00d7 \n29,191).\n\n\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost of the time to copy and mail the application to the CLEO is $5.53 (10 minutes at $33.19 per \nhour). Cost is $161,426 ($5.53 \u00d7 29,191).\n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost of the time for the CLEO to review the notification is $11.06 (15 minutes at $44.22 per hour). \nCost is $322,852 ($11.06 \u00d7 29,191).\n\n \n\n \n\n  ATF estimates the cost of CLEO notification for trusts and legal entities as follows:\n\n <h5>\n\n  Applicants</h5>\n\n \n\n  \n\n   The estimated cost to copy an application to send as a notification to the CLEO is $.30 for each Form 1, Form 4, \nand Form 5 ($.10 per page for 3 pages).

As shown in Table D, the estimated cost of the current requirement to obtain CLEO certification is \n$2,260,162. Therefore, the final rule notification requirement results in an estimated cost increase of approximately \n$3.6 million per year. However, for individuals, the final rule notification requirement results in an estimated \nreduction of approximately $1.8 million per year ($2,260,162\u2212$507,339 = $1,752,823).\n <h5>\n\n  c. Benefits of Requirement To Notify CLEOs</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  The new law enforcement notification requirement provides at least two important benefits. First, by changing the \ncertification requirement to a notification requirement, the final rule reduces the burdens on individuals and entities \nwho seek to possess firearms in jurisdictions whose chief law enforcement officers either process certifications \nslowly or refuse to process them at all. Second, by making the same notification requirement applicable to \nindividuals and responsible persons of trusts and legal entities the rule closes a loophole that incentivized \nindividuals to form trusts and legal entities to circumvent the certification requirement.\n\n \n\n  Under current regulations, individuals must obtain a certification from a CLEO in their jurisdiction stating, inter alia, \nthat the certifying official has no information indicating that possession of the firearm by the individual would be in \nviolation of State or local law, or no information that the individual will use the firearm for other than lawful purposes. \nSome applicants have found the process of obtaining a CLEO certification burdensome. Additionally, local and \nState officials have the option of participating or not, and some CLEOs have refused to issue certifications, thereby \nmaking it more difficult for applicants and transferees to obtain the needed certification. Requiring only notice, \nrather than a certification, will benefit applicants and transferees by removing a potentially burdensome \nimpediment to furnishing ATF with a completed application.\n\n \n\n  Under the current rule, the certification requirement does not apply to trusts and legal entities. Some individuals \nhave therefore created trusts and legal entities to circumvent the certification requirement. This final rule makes the \nrequirements for background checks the same for trusts and legal entities as they now are for individuals. The \nDepartment believes the incentive for makers and transferees to create corporations and trusts solely to avoid the \nCLEO certification requirement will decrease once the certification is no longer required. As noted in the comments \nabove, some CLEOs are reluctant to issue certifications for a variety of reasons. As a result, an individual may \ndecide to establish a trust or legal entity because trusts and legal entities are not required to provide CLEO \ncertifications under current regulations. By eliminating the CLEO certification requirement, this rulemaking will \nreduce the burden imposed on such individuals. Certainly, there are legal reasons to create a corporation or a trust \nunrelated to the desire to avoid the certification. The Department therefore believes creation of these trusts and \nlegal entities will continue.\n\n <h5>\n\n  4. Consolidation of Forms</h5>\n\n \n\n  The incorporation of the information required on ATF Form 5330.20 into the existing Forms 1, 4, and 5 reduces the \nburden upon the applicant or transferee by eliminating an additional form to be completed and filed. The current \nestimated time to complete the form is 3 minutes. Because the information requested on the forms is the same, any \nsavings result from the applicant not having to attach a separate form. ATF estimates the elimination of the form \nwill reduce the industry costs by $240,661 (145,020 transactions for individuals, trusts, and legal entities \u00d7 3 \nminutes per form saved x $33.19 per hour) and ATF's printing costs by $1,451 (145,020 forms \u00d7 .01 cents per form) \nfor a total reduction in costs of $242,112.\n\n <h4>\n\n  B. Executive Order 13132</h4>\n\n \n\n  This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of \ngovernment. The elimination of the CLEO certification reduces the burden on State and local agencies, and its \nreplacement with the notification of the pending application still provides the agency with knowledge of a controlled \nfirearm in its area of jurisdiction. As noted in the benefits section, ATF estimates that the cost of the notification to \nthe agencies will be less than the cost to the agencies of completing the certification. ATF discussed this change \n\n\n\nwith State and local agencies. While agencies will no longer be able to \u201cdeny\u201d an application by not completing the \nlaw enforcement certification, the agencies will receive a notification and can contact ATF with any issues.\n\n \n\n  While there would be an increase in the paperwork filed with ATF and an increase in ATF's processing workload, \nthat is balanced by ATF being able to conduct background checks on persons who do not receive background \nchecks under the current regulations. The overall impact on the States will be positive. Therefore, in accordance \nwith section 6 of Executive Order 13132 (\u201cFederalism\u201d), the Attorney General has determined that this regulation \ndoes not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact \nstatement.\n\n <h4>\n\n  C. Executive Order 12988</h4>\n\n \n\n  This regulation meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 \n(\u201cCivil Justice Reform\u201d).\n\n <h4>\n\n  D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h4>\n\n \n\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to \nnotice and comment rulemaking requirements unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. See 5 U.S.C. 605(b). Small entities include small \nbusinesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and small governmental jurisdictions. See 5 U.S.C. 601. The Attorney \nGeneral has reviewed and approved this rule, thereby certifying that it will not have a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities.\n\n \n\n  This rule primarily affects trusts and legal entities that seek to make or acquire NFA firearms and are not making \nor acquiring them as a qualified FFL. This rule requires responsible persons of trusts or legal entities to undergo \nbackground checks and comply with CLEO notification requirements. For CY 2014, ATF processed 115,829 \napplications from trusts and legal entities that were not qualified FFLs. ATF estimates the cost of implementing the \nrule will increase the cost for 115,829 trusts and legal entities with an average of 2 responsible persons by \n$25,333,317 (identification costs for background checks: $23,846,073; CLEO notification costs: $1,487,244) per \nyear.  (15)  In addition, in a revision to the NPRM, this rule requires that individuals comply with CLEO notification \nrequirements rather than CLEO certification procedures, resulting in a compliance cost reduction of $1,430,262 \nfrom the costs estimated in the NPRM.  (16)  Accordingly, the estimated compliance cost per entity is estimated to \nbe $218.71 (cost of increase ($25,333,317) \u00f7 number of entities (115,829)).\n\n <h4>\n\n  E. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</h4>\n\n \n\n  This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 251 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \nof 1996. See 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a \nmajor increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, \nproductivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based \nenterprises in domestic and export markets.\n\n <h4>\n\n  F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</h4>\n\n \n\n\n\n  This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the \nprivate sector, of $100 million or more in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small \ngovernments. Therefore, no actions are deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct of 1995.\n\n <h4>\n\n  G. Paperwork Reduction Act</h4>\n\n \n\n  Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required \nto respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by OMB. This final rule \nrevises several existing information collections and creates a new information collection. The existing information \ncollections that are revised are in 27 CFR 479.62, 479.63, 479.84, 479.85, 479.90, 479.90a, and 479.91, which are \nassociated with ATF Forms 1, 4, and 5. Forms 1, 4, and 5 have been approved by the OMB under control numbers \n1140-0011, 1140-0014, and 1140-0015, respectively. The new information collection that is being created is \nassociated with ATF Form 5320.23, and is currently in review for approval by OMB prior to the effective date of this \nfinal rule. Form 5320.23 requires certain identifying information for each responsible person within a trust or legal \nentity requesting to make or receive an NFA firearm, including the responsible person's full name, position, home \naddress, date of birth, and country of citizenship if other than the United States. Form 5320.23 also requires a \nproper photograph of each responsible person, and two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 (Fingerprint Card) \nfor each responsible person. In addition, Form 5320.23 requires each responsible person to list the full name and \ncomplete address of the chief law enforcement officer in the responsible person's locality to whom the responsible \nperson has forwarded the responsible person's completed copy of Form 5320.23.\n\n \n\n  The estimated total annual burden hours and related information (number of respondents, frequency of responses, \ncosts, etc.) for the revisions to Forms 1, 4, and 5, as well as the new Form 5320.23, appear below.\n\n \n\n  The current estimated total annual burden hours and related information for Forms 1, 4, and 5 are based upon the \ncurrent CLEO certification requirements, and the number of applications processed in CY 2012. As this final rule \neliminates CLEO certification and adds CLEO notification, the estimated submission times for Forms 1, 4, and 5 for \nindividuals, trusts, legal entities, and Gov/FFL have changed. For example, the revised estimated submission times \nassociated with Form 1 are:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   140 minutes for submission to or by an individual (50 minutes to procure photographs; 60 minutes to procure \nfingerprints, 10 minutes to copy and mail notification; and 20 minutes to complete and mail the form)\n\n  \n\n   260 minutes for submission to or by a trust or legal entity (for 2 responsible persons) (100 minutes to procure \nphotographs; 120 minutes to procure fingerprints; 10 minutes to procure the attachments; 10 minutes to copy and \nmail notification; and 20 minutes to complete and mail the form)\n\n  \n\n   20 minutes (to complete and mail the form) for a submission to or by a government agency or to a qualified FFL\n\n \n\n \n\n  The above estimated times do not reflect that a trust or legal entity must also submit to ATF, as part of each Form \n1, Form 4, or Form 5 application, a completed Form 5320.23 for each responsible person, and must provide a copy \nof completed Form 5320.23 to the CLEO of the jurisdiction for each responsible person. Those times are separately \nreflected in the estimated submission time of 40 minutes for submission to or by a trust or legal entity of Form \n\n\n\n5320.23 (for 2 responsible persons) (30 minutes to complete and include \u201ccopy 1\u201d of Form 5320.23 in the Form 1, \nForm 4, or Form 5 application, and 10 minutes to mail \u201ccopy 2\u201d of Form 5320.23 for notification.\n\n \n\n  With respect to ATF Form 1:\n\n \n\n  Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: 102,808 hours (current estimated total annual \nreporting and/or recordkeeping burden from OMB Information Collection Number 1140-0011: 16,374 hours).
