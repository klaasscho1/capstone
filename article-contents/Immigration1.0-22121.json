{"title": "Advantech Accelerates 8K Virtual Reality Live Streaming at NAB 2017", "body": "\nWashington: International Association of Broadcasting Manufacturers has issued the following news release:  \n\nAdvantech (TWSE: 2395.TW) today unveiled the Virtual Reality capabilities of its VEGA-3304 encoding accelerator \nwhich will be demonstrated at the NAB Show in collaboration with its partner Hyper Immersion Technology as part \nof a Virtual Reality live streaming workflow. The VEGA-3304 is the first commercial-off-the-shelf accelerator to \nsupport 1-channel 8Kp60 or 4-channel 4Kp60 real-time HEVC Main 10 contribution-grade encoding with SDI \nacquisition. 360\u00b0 Virtual Reality solution providers can leverage the VEGA-3304 to build compact, high quality VR \nlive encoders that accelerate the next wave of innovation in the media industry.\n\nVirtual Reality has the potential to fully transform viewers\u2019 experience but real mass adoption is likely to be subject \nto providing life-like quality live content which poses many infrastructure challenges. After stitching, a 360 degree \nvideo can surpass even 8K resolution and the quality of viewer experience will depend on keeping a high resolution \nthroughout the contribution stages. Bandwidth optimization is crucial to carry this back to the central distribution \nprocessing elements over existing networks so HEVC plays a key role on VR live streaming enablement. However, \nthe potential computational load of multiple 4K or even 8K HEVC encoding is a significant hurdle to overcome in \nreal world deployments. Advantech\u2019s VEGA-3304 can help.\n\nThe VEGA-3304 is a commercial-off-the-shelf PCI Express adapter that streamlines development of live 4K and \n8K-based solutions such as 360\u00b0 Virtual Reality streaming by offloading heavy-lifting HEVC encoding tasks in \nserver-based applications. VEGA-3304 is the world\u2019s first video processing accelerator able to perform real time, \nprofessional grade 1-ch 8K or 4-ch 4K HEVC 4:2:2 10-bit encoding in a low power PCI Express accelerator that \nalso features optional SDI acquisition. When fitted with the 16x 3G-SDI capture option, the VEGA-3304 is a \u00be \nlength double-wide PCIE x16 card compatible with standard server GPU slots and comes with Advantech\u2019s SDK \nwhich supports Linux and Windows operating systems. VR developers can leverage the FFmpeg tools provided by \nAdvantech\u2019s SDK as well as its API to easily integrate the VEGA-3304 as if it was another software component.\n\n\u201cThe VEGA-3304 makes significant progress on off-the-shelf available processing acceleration\u201d said Emily Teng, \nVEGA Video Adapters Product Line Manager, Advantech. \u201cIts impressive encoding quality combined with its \nunrivalled 8K capacity provides a powerful tool to Virtual Reality developers that now have a straightforward plug-in \naccelerator to deal with 360 degree video processing struggles.\u201d\n\n\nThe live VR encoding capabilities of the VEGA-3304 will be demonstrated at Advantech\u2019s NAB booth SU11710, in \nLas Vegas, April 24-27, 2017 in collaboration with our partner Hyper Immersion Technology. Live feed from four 4K \ncameras mounted on a 360 degree rig will be acquired and encoded by one single VEGA-3304 to be stitched in \nreal time creating the high quality 360 degree view which will be displayed on an HTC VIVE VR headset powered \nby VIVE Cinema for visitors to experience how hyper immersive VR feels. The demonstration emulates the live \nstreaming cloud workflow proposed by Hyper Immersion Technology to simplify VR productions. Content producers \njust need to setup the 360\u00b0 camera and compact live encoding systems onsite. Storage and real-time stitching are \nhandled on the cloud and provided as a service which streamlines operations when producing VR content in live \nevents such as sports and concerts.\n\n\u201c360\u00b0 Virtual Reality needs to be at least 8K to create an immersive experience but such high resolution video is \ncomplex to manage from a real-time processing perspective\u201d said Chaody Chen, CEO, Hyper Immersion \nTechnology. \u201cBy leveraging Advantech\u2019s VEGA-3304, we are able to provide a cloud-based 8K 360\u00b0 VR live \nstreaming service that simplifies VR production while delivering high-quality content for a truly immersive \nexperience.\u201d\n\nAbout Advantech - Founded in 1983, Advantech is a leader in providing trusted, innovative products, services, and \nsolutions.
