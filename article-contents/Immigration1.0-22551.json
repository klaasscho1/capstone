{"title": "National Briefing  Southwest: Texas: Did You See That Elephant Cross The Border?", "body": "\nA Pennsylvania Congressional candidate and former reality TV personality used an elephant and a mariachi band \nfor a political stunt designed to make a point about border security. The man, Raj Peter Bhakta, who appeared on \nthe ''The Apprentice,'' paraded an elephant and the band through the water near the mouth of the Rio Grande on \nTuesday. ''The elephant never made landfall into Mexico, but I tell you something, he could have made 15 laps \nback and forth, but no one showed up,'' Mr. Bhakta, a Republican, told The Brownsville Herald. Mr. Bhakta, who \nfavors construction of border fence, said he was in Brownsville to raise money when he saw half a dozen men \nswimming under one of the international bridges ''with complete immunity'' and decided to pull the stunt.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto\n"}
