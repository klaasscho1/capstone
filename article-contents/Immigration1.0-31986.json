If so, when?\n\n---Sadie Whitmore, Stockbridge\n\nA: The Associated Press reported that a \"few limited studies on airline passengers with peanut allergies found a \nnumber of people reporting symptoms while flying.\" But Dr. Scott Sicherer, who studies food allergies at the Mount \nSinai Medical Center in New York, said few were severe or life-threatening. He told the AP that there is discomfort. \n\"It's sort of like if you were allergic to dogs and all of a sudden they brought 50 dogs onto the plane,\" he told the AP. \nThe DOT announced in late June that it has backed off from the proposed peanut ban because it would have \nviolated federal law.\n\nQ: The media recently stated that 17 countries offered to help in the oil spill cleanup. This offer has evidently not \nbeen accepted. Why?\n\n---Paul T. White, Smyrna\n\nA: The United States has accepted help from 12 countries to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but has \nturned down offers from at least 18 other countries, The Associated Press reported late last month. Japan, which \nhas contributed two high-speed skimmers and a fire containment boom, is the only country that has been named, \naccording to a State Department statement. The State Department gave no reason why some offers have been \naccepted and others haven't, the AP reported.\n\nLori Johnston wrote this column. Do you have a question about the news?
