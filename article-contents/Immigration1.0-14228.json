{"title": "BARRIERS ON I-8 MEANT FOR IMMIGRANT SMUGGLERS", "body": "\nWorkers began installing two-ton concrete barriers intended to stop immigrant smugglers who have taken to \ndriving the wrong way on Interstate 8 to avoid a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nThe barriers, each 12 feet long and three feet tall, were being placed Wednesday on the I-8 median near the \ncheckpoint, about 40 miles east of San Diego.\n\nThe three-mile line of barriers should be completed in the next week or so, said Tom Nipper, a Caltrans \nspokesman.\n\nOn Aug. 31, a van drove against oncoming traffic on I-8 for about 17 miles before swerving back into the westbound \nlanes. The van spun out of control and crashed, injuring 19 suspected illegal immigrants.\n\nNotes\n\nState News in Brief\n"}
