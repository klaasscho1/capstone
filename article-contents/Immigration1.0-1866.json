This obstinacy has to be the most \nfrightening aspect for everyone during the last three years of political brinkmanship.\n\nThere is an inevitability that the log-jam of Brexit will end up with a people's vote on the kind of Brexit (or non-\nBrexit) that British citizens want. More and more people are coming over to the idea of campaigning for Remain \nduring a second referendum.\n\nWhen that people's vote happens, if the government was very brave it would say that any nation voting to Remain \nin the EU would have the right to follow up with an immediate referendum on remaining or leaving the UK. Unless, \nof course, all the nations voted to Remain which would reunite England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland back \ninto a united kingdom. Happy days.\n\nAlison Hackett D\u00fan Laoghaire, Co Dublin\n"}
