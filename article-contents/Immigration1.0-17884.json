The evaluation also looked at how the VIS is used for the purpose of law enforcement access and the \nuse of biometrics in the visa application procedure.\n\n The purpose of the evaluation was to analyse the performance of the VIS as a system, how the VIS Regulation has \nbeen implemented in practice, the extent to which the VIS has achieved its policy objectives, and whether the VIS \nRegulation remains fit for purpose in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and added value for \nthe EU visa policy.\n\n This was the first time the VIS Regulation was evaluated since it entered into force in 2011.\n\n The evaluation was part of the Commission\u2019s REFIT programme, which underlined the importance of assessing the \nrelevance of the VIS Regulation for its stakeholders, whether its underlying rationale remains valid and the impact \nof the system on the various policies it has\n\n 1 Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa \nInformation System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) \nOJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 60.\n\n 2 Council Decision No 512/2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) OJ L 213, 15.06.2004, p. 5.\n\n 11\n\n supported (visa, border management, migration management, asylum, law enforcement) and on the data subjects \n(third-country nationals obliged to obtain a Schengen visa).\n\n Scope of the evaluation\n\n Article 50(4) of the VIS Regulation requires the Commission to produce a report on the overall evaluation of the \nVIS three years after it was brought into operation and every four years thereafter. The evaluation should examine \nthe results achieved against objectives and assess:\n\n \u2022 the continuing validity of the underlying rationale;\n\n \u2022 the application of the VIS Regulation;\n\n\n\n \u2022 the security of the VIS;\n\n \u2022 the use made of the provisions on the communication of data to third countries or international organisations \nreferred to in Article 31;\n\n \u2022 any implications for future operations.\n\n Article 50(5) of the VIS Regulation requires the Commission to produce a report on the technical progress made \nregarding the use of fingerprints at external borders and its implications for the duration of searches at borders, \nincluding whether the duration of these searches entails excessive waiting time at border crossing points.\n\n Furthermore, in order to ensure the regular monitoring and evaluation of the system put in place by the VIS \nRegulation, Article 57(3) of the Visa Code3 requires the Commission to present, three years after the VIS is brought \ninto operation and every four years thereafter, a report on the implementation of the VIS-related provisions of the \nVisa Code (i.e. Articles 13, 17 and 40-44). Thus, the assessment of how Member States implement the provisions \non the use of biometrics in the visa application procedure and organise procedures relating to applications, \nincluding their practical cooperation, is relevant for and should be considered part of the overall VIS evaluation \ncovering the VIS Regulation and the VIS Founding Decision.\n\n However, a distinction should be made between:\n\n a) the overall evaluation of the implementation of the Visa Code, covered by the \u2018Commission Staff Working \nDocument (SWD(2014) 101 final) on the Evaluation of the Implementation of the Visa Code\u2019, published in April \n2014; and\n\n b) the report to the European Parliament and to the Council referred to in Articles 57(3) and (4) of the Visa Code, \ncovered by the evaluation detailed in this Commission Staff Working Document.\n\n The objective of b) is to verify and monitor:\n\n \u2022 the implementation of the provisions concerning the collection and use of biometric identifiers;\n\n 3 Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a \nCommunity Code on Visas, OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1.\n\n 12\n\n \u2022 the suitability of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard chosen;\n\n \u2022 compliance with data protection rules in visa application procedures;\n\n \u2022 Member States\u2019 experience of cooperation with external service providers, in particular as regards the collection \nof biometric data;\n\n \u2022 the implementation of the 59-month rule for the copying of fingerprints; and\n\n \u2022 the organisation of application procedures.\n\n\n\n As required under Article 57(4) of the Visa Code, the report on the implementation of the provisions on collecting \nand using biometric identifiers also had to address the issue of whether the fingerprints of children under the age of \n12 were sufficiently reliable for identification and verification purposes, and how fingerprints evolve with age.\n\n Finally, Article 17(4) of the Decision on the law enforcement access to the VIS (\u2018the VIS Law Enforcement Access \n(LEA) Decision4\u2019) requires the Commission to produce an overall evaluation of the VIS.\n\n This evaluation is complementary to the evaluation of the European Agency for the operational management of \nlarge-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) which was carried out by the \nCommission in close consultation with the Management Board of eu-LISA, as required under Article 31(1) of the eu-\nLISA founding Regulation.5 The eu-LISA evaluation examined the way and extent to which the Agency effectively \ncontributes to the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, \nincluding the VIS, and fulfils its tasks laid down in its founding Regulation. It also assessed the Agency\u2019s role in the \nUnion strategy aimed at achieving a coordinated, cost-effective and coherent IT environment at Union level that is \nto be established in the coming years. The eu-LISA evaluation was completed in March 20166 and, based on its \nfindings, the Commission, after consulting the eu-LISA Management Board, will issue recommendations regarding \npossible changes to the eu-LISA founding Regulation to bring it further in line with the Union strategy. The \nCommission will then forward its recommendations, together with the opinion of the Management Board, to the \nEuropean Parliament, the Council and the European Data Protection Supervisor.\n\n 4 Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information \nSystem (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, \ndetection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences, OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 129.\n\n 5 Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 establishing a \nEuropean Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and \njustice, OJ L 286, p. 1 of 1.11.2011.\n\n 6 \"Independent external evaluation of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT \nsystems in the area of freedom, security and justice - eu-LISA\", ISBN: 978-92-79-58236-3, Catalogue number, DR-\n01-16-464-EN-N.\n\n 13\n\n 2. BACKGROUND TO THE VIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n Baseline\n\n When establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, the European Union committed to ensuring the free \nmovement of people and a high level of security. In this context, the EU has prioritised the development and \nestablishment of the VIS as a system for exchanging visa data between Member States.\n\n Before the VIS was put in place in 2011, around 12 million Schengen visas were issued every year by the 25 \ncountries of the Schengen area, and numbers were growing (see graph below).\n\n 14\n\n\n\n The Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June 2002 considered the establishment of a common identification \nsystem for visa data a top priority and called for its introduction as soon as possible. In response to this request, the \nCommission presented a feasibility study in May 2003. The Council welcomed the study and invited the \nCommission to continue its preparatory work to develop the VIS. The Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 \nJune 2003 deemed that guidelines should be drawn up for planning the development of the VIS. A legal basis \npermitting establishment of the VIS and engaging the necessary financial means was also to be adopted.\n\n According to the common visa policy developed following the Schengen Agreement of 1985, uniform short-stay \nvisas were to be issued to third-country nationals, allowing them to travel freely throughout the Schengen area. The \ncommon visa policy also harmonised the criteria and conditions for issuing a Schengen visa in a uniform format. \nCitizens from 134 countries were required to apply for a visa before entering Schengen states.7\n\n However, information from the visa application was routinely held only by the Member State which issued the visa, \nmaking it difficult to implement a common visa policy. If a bona fide traveller8 applied for a Schengen visa again, \nbut to the authorities of another Member State, the record of his or her past visa application was not readily \navailable to the consular\n\n 7 This number has since decreased with the number of visa waiver agreements concluded by the EU with third \ncountries. On 1 June 2016, people from 104 countries were still required to obtain a Schengen visa, according to \nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas \nwhen crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.\n\n 8 The term \u2018bona fide traveller\u2019 is used to refer to third-country nationals who travel to the Schengen States for \nleisure or business, have not nor intend to breach their visa and other immigration requirements, and do not \nconstitute a threat to internal security.\n\n 0\n\n 2\n\n 4\n\n 6\n\n 8\n\n 10\n\n 12\n\n 14\n\n 16\n\n 18\n\n 20\n\n\n\n 2007\n\n 2008\n\n 2009\n\n 2010\n\n 2011\n\n 2012\n\n 2013\n\n 2014\n\n 2015\n\n Millions\n\n Schengen visas applied for\n\n Schengen visas issued\n\n * A, LTV and C visas considered\n\n 15\n\n authorities of that Member State. Some important visa data were exchanged, but the exchange was partial, \ninefficient and time consuming.\n\n As shown in the impact assessment leading to the establishment of the VIS9, the system for delivering, monitoring \nand verifying visas was struggling to cope with such big numbers. A sizeable proportion of people tried to obtain a \nSchengen visa on dubious grounds. It was not always easy to prevent fraud and abuse, and the application \nprocess was often cumbersome for those legitimately seeking a short-stay visa for travel within the EU.\n\n Member States also had difficulties in ascertaining whether a visa applicant was using a false identity to obtain a \nSchengen visa. Statistics showed high levels of travel document fraud.\n\n Another phenomenon developing at that time was \u2018visa shopping\u2019, i.e. bypassing the criteria for determining which \nMember State is responsible for examining the visa application. If one Member State refused to issue a Schengen \nvisa, the same applicant could apply to another Member State for a visa, even from within the same country of \napplication. This is because there was no formal information system for authorities to check whether the applicant \nhad applied and been refused, or had previously failed to pursue a Schengen visa application, or indeed whether a \nvisa had been granted to the individual in the past.\n\n\n\n In 2001, around 360,000 people illegally present in the EU were apprehended. In the same year around 390,000 \npeople illegally present in the EU were removed and around 1.2 million non-EU citizens were refused entry10. \nStatistics indicated that overstayers were the biggest category of illegal immigrants.\n\n In addition, there were problems with the subsequent implementation of the Dublin II Regulation, which determines \nwhich Member State is responsible for examining an asylum claim. One of the criteria for establishing responsibility \nis that the Member State issuing the visa is also responsible for examining the asylum claim. At that time, Member \nStates did not have an efficient means of checking whether an asylum seeker had been issued a visa by another \nMember State.\n\n On 8 June 2004, the Council adopted Council Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the Visa Information System \n(VIS).11 This constituted the legal basis defining the architecture of the VIS and giving the Commission the \nmandate to develop the VIS at technical level. The national infrastructures had to be adapted and/or developed by \nthe Member States. A comprehensive legal framework was needed to further develop and establish the VIS.\n\n 9 Commission Staff Working Document, Annex to the Proposal for a Regulation to the European Parliament and to \nthe Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on \nshort stay-visas \u2014 extended impact assessment COM(2004) 835 final \u2013 SEC(2004) 1628, p. 5.\n\n 10 Idem, p. 6.\n\n 11 Referred to in footnote 2 above.\n\n 16\n\n Given the potentially significant impact of action in this field, the Commission carried out an extended impact \nassessment12 to ensure that economic and social impacts could be taken into account as early as possible in the \nprocess. This impact assessment was presented in 2004, accompanying the proposal for a Regulation to the \nEuropean Parliament and to the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data \nbetween Member States on short-stay visas.\n\n It assessed various policy options:\n\n \u2022 no VIS;\n\n \u2022 an entry-exit system\u2019 similar to the US-VISIT;\n\n \u2022 VIS without biometrics;\n\n \u2022 VIS with biometrics.\n\n The option of VIS with biometrics was chosen because it had the potential to bring the most substantial \nimprovements in most domains.\n\n The VIS Regulation was adopted in 2008. It sets out the purpose, functionalities and responsibilities of the VIS, as \nwell as rules for setting up and maintaining the system. The Regulation also stipulates the procedures and \n\n\n\nconditions for exchanging data on short-stay visa applications between Member States to strengthen the \nexamination of such applications and the related decisions.\n\n The VIS central system was developed by the Commission and handed over to eu-LISA as of December 2012, \naccording to the legal basis setting up this Agency.13\n\n Law enforcement access to the VIS\n\n In March 2005, the Council adopted conclusions stating that \u2018in order to achieve fully the aim of improving internal \nsecurity and the fight against terrorism\u2019, Member State authorities responsible for internal security should be \nguaranteed access to the VIS, \u2018in the course of their duties in relation to the prevention, detection and investigation \nof criminal offences, including terrorist acts and threats\u2019, \u2018subject to strict compliance with the rules governing the \nprotection of personal data\u2019.\n\n Consequently, the VIS LEA Decision was adopted in June 2008.\n\n 12 See footnote 9.\n\n 13 See footnote 5 above. For the Commission\u2019s specific role in the VIS see section in Annex 2 \u2018Detailed \nexplanation of the initiative\u2019.\n\n 17\n\n The VIS and the visa application procedure\n\n In 2009, the Regulation establishing a common Visa Code was adopted as a \u2018recast\u2019 and consolidated all legal \nacts governing the conditions and procedures for issuing short-stay visas (i.e. visas for intended stays of no more \nthan 90 days in any 180 days).\n\n The Visa Code provided, among other things, for measures to improve consular organisation and cooperation \n(partly in view of the roll-out of the VIS14). Consequently, VIS-related rules on collecting biometric identifiers and on \nfacilitating the visa application procedure, including through forms of cooperation among Member States, were \nincluded in the Visa Code.\n\n 2.1. Objectives of the VIS\n\n The VIS was set up to:\n\n \u2022 improve the implementation of the common visa policy;\n\n \u2022 ensure smooth consular cooperation and the consultations between central consular authorities to prevent threats \nto internal security and \u2018visa shopping\u2019;\n\n \u2022 facilitate the visa application procedure, the fight against fraud and checks both at external border checkpoints \nand within the Member States,\n\n\n\n \u2022 help identify and return illegal immigrants; and\n\n \u2022 facilitate application of the Dublin Regulation.15\n\n By improving the assessment of visa applications, including the consultation between central authorities and the \nverification and identification of applicants at consulates and at border checkpoints, the VIS helps strengthen the \ninternal security of the Member States. It also helps combat terrorism which, along with the fight against illegal \nimmigration, constitutes a cross-cutting objective and basic criterion for the common visa policy.\n\n The VIS should also benefit bona fide travellers by improving the procedures for issuing visas and for checks \nincluding in terms of simplification and administrative burden reduction of procedures for identity checks and identity \nverification procedures.\n\n 14 Originally the VIS was to become operational in 2007. This is why the Commission chose to present a separate \nlegal proposal which:\n\n - established the standards for the biometric identifiers to be collected;\n\n - provided for a series of options for the practical organisation of Member States\u2019 diplomatic missions and consular \nposts for the enrolment of biometric data from visa applicants;\n\n - laid down a legal framework for Member States\u2019 cooperation with external service providers.\n\n The content of the adopted Regulation (OJ L 131, 28.5.2009, p. 1) was inserted into and adapted to the structure of \nthe Visa Code adopted in July 2009.\n\n 15 Initially the \u2018Dublin II Regulation\u2019, Regulation (EC) No 343/2003, repealed and replaced by the \u2018Dublin III \nRegulation\u2019, Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 31.\n\n 18\n\n 2.2. Description of the VIS and its functions16\n\n The VIS founding Decision\n\n This Decision sets up the VIS as a system for exchanging data between the Member States, enabling national \nauthorities to enter and update visa data and to consult those data electronically. According to the Decision, the \nsystem was to consist of a central information system, an interface in each Member State and a communication \ninfrastructure.\n\n The measures necessary to develop the central system, the national interfaces and the communication \ninfrastructure were to be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the comitology procedure,17 assisted by \nthe SIS (Schengen Information System) II committee.18\n\n The VIS Regulation\n\n 16 For detailed information see Annex 2.\n\n\n\n 17 The procedure referred to in Decision 1999/468/EC.\n\n 18 Set up by Article 5(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 (OJ L 328, 13.12.2001, p. 4).\n\n 19\n\n The first chapter of the VIS Regulation lays down the object of the act, definitions, the purpose of the VIS, the \ncategories of data and general rules on access and on procedures and protocols for the exchange of visa data.\n\n The second chapter details the obligations on visa authorities and the procedures they must use for entering data. \nIt also specifies which data must be entered when registering an application and the data to be added when a visa \nis issued, refused, annulled, revoked or extended.\n\n The third chapter details the conditions and procedures for the use of data for the specific purposes of the VIS, \nnamely data for:\n\n \u2022 examining applications, including the consultation between central authorities;\n\n \u2022 checks on visas;\n\n \u2022 identification and return purposes;\n\n \u2022 determining responsibility for visa applications;\n\n \u2022 determining responsibility for asylum applications;\n\n \u2022 examining asylum applications; and\n\n \u2022 reporting and statistics.\n\n The authorities which should have access to the VIS vary according to the specific purposes.\n\n The fourth chapter lays down rules on retaining and amending the data recorded in the VIS.\n\n The fifth chapter specifies who is responsible for the VIS, including for the operational management of the VIS, for \nthe use of data and data security, and rules on liability, records and penalties.\n\n The sixth chapter deals with the rights of the data subject and the role of the national supervisory authorities and \nthe Independent Supervisory Authority.\n\n The final chapter covers the implementation approach, the start of transmission, comitology, the evaluation, the \nentry into force and applicability of the VIS Regulation.\n\n The VIS LEA Decision\n\n The LEA Decision provides the legal basis under which Member State authorities responsible for internal security \nand the European Police Office (Europol) may access and consult the VIS for the purposes of preventing, detecting \n\n\n\nand investigating terrorist offences. The Decision also lays down the conditions under which they may do so and \nthe types of crime and the offences in respect of which Europol is competent to act pursuant to Article 2 of the \nEuropol Convention (i.e. \u2018serious criminal offences\u2019).\n\n The provisions of the Visa Code on the functioning of the VIS\n\n The rules governing the collection and use of biometric identifiers and the forms of cooperation for the collection of \nvisa applications are provided in the Visa Code.\n\n 20\n\n 2.3. Scope\n\n The VIS Regulation covers the exchange of data on short-stay visas between Member States \u2018which have \nabolished checks at their internal borders\u2019.19 As such, it constitutes a development of Schengen legislation on the \ncommon visa policy and is subject to specific legal rules as regards the Member States\u2019 participation in the VIS. Not \nall EU Member States are part of the VIS, but the VIS does include the four Schengen associated countries: \nIceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\n\n Denmark:\n\n Pursuant to Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty \nestablishing a European Community, Denmark does not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and is \ntherefore not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n However, Article 4 of Protocol No 22 does apply. This is because the Regulation is an act which aims to build upon \nSchengen legislation in accordance with the provisions of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of \nthe European Union. In line with this Article, Denmark notified the Council and the Commission within six months \nafter the adoption of the VIS Regulation of its intention to implement it in national law. Consequently, at present, \nDenmark applies the VIS Regulation and participates fully in the exchange of data on the basis of this Regulation.\n\n United Kingdom and Ireland:\n\n According to Articles 4 and 5 of Protocol No 21 integrating Schengen legislation into the framework of European \nUnion and Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great \nBritain and Northern Ireland,20 and Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland\u2019s \nrequest to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis,21 the United Kingdom and Ireland are not \ntaking part in the adoption of the Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania (Member States not yet fully applying Schengen legislation):\n\n The VIS builds on the Schengen acquis or otherwise is related to it within the meaning of the relevant provisions of \neach country\u2019s Act of Accession. However, the VIS Regulation will only apply in these Member States once the \nrelevant Council decisions on the full application of the Schengen acquis to these countries have been passed.\n\n 19 Point 2 of the Annex to the Council Conclusions of 19.2.2004.\n\n 20 OJ L 131, 1.6.2000, p. 43.\n\n\n\n 21 OJ L 64, 7.3.2002, p. 20.\n\n 21\n\n Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (Schengen associated countries):\n\n This Regulation builds on the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the respective Association Agreements22 \nconcluded with the Schengen associated countries, and the procedures laid down in these Agreements are \napplicable.\n\n 3. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND QUESTIONS\n\n The evaluation of the Regulation was undertaken on the basis of the following evaluation criteria and questions:\n\n \u2022 Effectiveness:\n\n o Has the Regulation been effective in meeting the defined objectives?\n\n o Did it facilitate the visa application procedure?\n\n o Has it prevented the bypassing of the criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining \nthe application?\n\n o Did it facilitate the fight against fraud?\n\n o Did it facilitate checks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States by \nsimplification and administrative burden reduction?\n\n o Did it help with the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, \nstay or residence on the territory of the Member States?\n\n o Did it facilitate the application of the \u2018Dublin III Regulation\u2019?\n\n o Did it contribute to the prevention of threats to the internal security of the Member States?\n\n o What effects did the Regulation have on third-country nationals under Schengen visa obligation?\n\n \u2022 Efficiency:\n\n 22 Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement \nconcluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway \nconcerning the latter\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis; \nOJ L 176, 10.7.1999, p. 31.\n\n Council Decision 2008/146/EC of 28 January 2008 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the \nAgreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss \nConfederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis; OJ L \n53, 27.2.2008, p.1.\n\n\n\n Council Decision 2011/350/EU of 7 March 2011 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union of the Protocol \nbetween the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of \nLiechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, \nthe European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association with the \nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, relating to the abolition of checks at internal \nborders and movement of persons; OJ L 160, 18.6.2011, p. 19.\n\n 22\n\n o Has the Regulation delivered its results efficiently in terms of the resources used?\n\n o Does it create or reduce administrative burdens?\n\n o What are the main costs and benefits of the Regulation for (i) the Schengen states and (ii) third-country nationals \nunder a visa obligation?\n\n o Overall, did the benefits of setting up the VIS outweigh its costs?\n\n \u2022 Utility: To what extent did the effects of VIS correspond with the needs, problems and issues to be addressed?\n\n \u2022 Relevance: Are the objectives of the Regulation still relevant today?\n\n \u2022 EU added value and sustainability:\n\n o What is the ongoing added value of EU legislation in this field?\n\n o Is the Regulation still fit for purpose and will it meet its objectives in the future?\n\n o What would happen if the Regulation were to be withdrawn and Member States were free to adjust their national \nregulatory frameworks?\n\n \u2022 Acceptability: To what extent do Schengen states\u2019 administrations and third-country nationals accept the VIS?\n\n \u2022 Coherence: To what extent are positive/negative spill-overs into other policy areas (migration, trade/tourism, \nexternal relations, security) being maximised/minimised?\n\n 4. METHOD AND CONSULTATION\n\n The evaluation assessed the performance of the VIS Regulation, i.e. whether it has achieved its objectives, \nwhether it is efficient, coherent, relevant and has an added value at EU level.\n\n The implementation of the system was assessed based on a broad consultation process based on targeted \nconsultations, which included the 22 EU Member States that are Schengen members, the four Schengen \nassociated countries, as well as the principal agencies involved \u2014 eu-LISA and Europol. Although not directly \nconsulted for the purpose of this evaluation, Frontex data contained in various annual reports were also used.\n\n The objectives of the consultation process were to collect concrete evidence on the functioning of the VIS and to \nenable an assessment of the VIS\u2019s possible future.\n\n\n\n The evaluation criteria and questions focused on both quantitative and qualitative aspects.\n\n 23\n\n The process was carried out internally by the Commission. An inter-service steering group23 was set up to oversee \nthe process.\n\n The data collection phase consisted of gathering primary and secondary data relevant to the consultation process. \nIt covered data related to the functioning of the VIS from its entry into operation in September 2011 until December \n2015.\n\n A number of different data collection tools were used to collect data from a wide variety of stakeholder groups. \nThese included:\n\n \u2022 an extensive documentary review;\n\n \u2022 an e-survey for the Member States and eu-LISA;\n\n \u2022 direct observation of the VIS Management Board and VIS Advisory Group meetings; and\n\n \u2022 observations of the competent working groups in the Council (the Visa working party, Friends of VIS, VISION).\n\n Third-country nationals and governments of countries under visa obligation were consulted indirectly via national \nauthorities.\n\n Considering that several ministries and national authorities are involved in implementing and applying VIS-related \npolicy in the Member States, and since this varies according to national legislation, information regarding the \nevaluation was channelled through the Permanent Representations of the Member States. In addition, information \nwas disseminated through the Visa working party, the Friends of VIS group in the Council, as well as through the \neu-LISA\u2019s VIS Advisory Group.\n\n The evaluation questions were also incorporated into an e-survey (see Annex 5).\n\n The consultation process started in May 2015. Initially planned to last until December 2015, it was extended to mid-\nFebruary 2016 to allow more Member States to contribute.\n\n However, consultations with Member States were not the only source used in this evaluation; it is also based on \nthe Commission\u2019s regular monitoring of the correct implementation of EU legislation. This includes:\n\n \u2022 the evaluations under the SCHEVAL system24;\n\n \u2022 information from petitions addressed to the European Parliament;\n\n \u2022 the questions raised by Members of the European Parliament;\n\n \u2022 complaints and questions from private people.\n\n\n\n 23 The Secretariat General of the Commission, the Legal Service, DG JUST and the European External Action \nService were part of the Inter-service steering group.\n\n 24 Schengen Evaluation Mechanism, established by the Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 to verify the \napplication of Schengen legislation. Initiated in 2015, the Mechanism had been used to monitor application of the \ncommon visa policy in six Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy) by \nthe time this report was drafted (first quarter 2016). Two consulates were visited for each Member State, thus \nresulting in 12 consulates visited worldwide.\n\n 24\n\n Answers to the queries of the European Migration Network25 on this matter were also taken into account.\n\n The viewss of third countries\u2019 authorities and nationals were taken into account in several ways: from opinions \nexpressed in bilateral official contacts with the European Union/the Commission and the Member States and from \nthe practice experienced by national authorities when implementing the VIS. Views on the implementation of the \nVIS Regulation have also been exchanged in the Joint Committees set up under the various Visa Facilitation \nAgreements26 between the EU and a number of third countries, as well as in the ACP-EU Visa Sub-group set up \nunder the ACP/EU Dialogue on Migration and Development.\n\n Information gathered within the local Schengen cooperation \u2014 in place in all locations where Schengen visa-\nissuing consulates of the Member States are present \u2014 also provided feedback on the functioning of the VIS.\n\n On data protection issues, the Commission used input from the \u2018Coordinated Supervision of VIS Activity Report \n2012-2014\u2019 of the VIS Supervision Coordination Group. The report is to be produced every two years by the \nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor in cooperation with the national supervisory authorities/data protection \nauthorities of each Member State.27 The Commission also drew on the European Data Protection Supervisor\u2019s \naudits of the Management Authority\u2019s (eu-LISA) personal data processing activities, which it must carry out every \nfour years.28\n\n 16 EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Latvia, \nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Slovakia) and three Schengen \nassociated countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) contributed to the evaluation (as there are 26 Schengen \nMember States, this gave a 76 % response rate).\n\n eu-LISA contributed substantially to this evaluation and provided quantitative data on all requested items. It should \nbe borne in mind that the statistics provided by eu-LISA cover all the Schengen Member States using the VIS \nsystem (unless specifically mentioned otherwise), and thus make up for the lack of quantitative data by the Member \nStates who did not reply or did not reply in full to the questionnaires.\n\n Europol did not reply to the consultation, given that it has not yet established a connection with the VIS and thus \nhas not been using the system.\n\n 25 Established by Council Decision 2008/381/EC, http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-\ndo/networks/european_migration_network/index_en.htm.\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/index_en.htm\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/index_en.htm\n\n\n 26 Visa facilitation agreements have been concluded with Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nCape Verde, FYROM, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\n 27 Article 43(4) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n 28 Article 42(2) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n 25\n\n Limitations \u2014 robustness of findings\n\n The Commission was called on to deliver an evaluation three years after the VIS began operating. This deadline \ntook into account the political objective of achieving the full VIS roll-out within two years of it starting to operate.\n\n However, by 11 October 2014 (i.e. three years after it started operating) the VIS had been rolled out in only 16 of \nthe 25 world regions, while regions with the highest number of Schengen visa applications (covering countries such \nas Belarus, China, India, Russia and Ukraine) were not yet covered by the VIS. As a result, less than half of the \nvisas issued (and thus visa holders\u2019 fingerprints) were stored in the VIS at the end of 2014. Due to the delay in the \nroll-out, information was insufficient for an in-depth evaluation at that time.\n\n The VIS worldwide roll-out was finalised in November 2015. In February 2016, the system became operational at \nthe Schengen border crossing points.\n\n The data gathered and the ensuing analysis had to take into account this gradual deployment. Therefore, while this \nevaluation took into account data relating to four years of functioning of the VIS, the relevance of the data is \nsometimes limited by the recent experience with the system in most regions of the world (regions covering 70 % of \nthe VIS volume only started using VIS in the last year before the evaluation, while over 50 % of VIS volume is in \nregions where VIS was only deployed 3-4 months before the end of the evaluation).\n\n Member States indicated in their contributions that the recent and sometimes limited experience with the VIS \nnarrowed their assessment given that the worldwide roll-out had barely finished by the time the evaluation was \ncarried out. While this aspect has no impact on the findings or conclusions of this evaluation, which remain valid, it \nmust be taken into account that a longer lifespan of a system of this complexity would naturally trigger a higher \nlikelihood of problems arising from its functioning (e.g. when the volume of the database reaches its upper limits, \nthis could have consequences on its efficiency, which cannot be measured at this point in time).\n\n On law enforcement access, a full evaluation on the basis of the VIS Decision was initially planned as part of the \noverall assessment of the VIS. However, during the data collection period Europol informed the Commission that no \naccess had yet been established to the VIS and hence no experience could be reported. Member States\u2019 feedback \nalso pointed overwhelmingly to little or no use, by December 2015, of the VIS for law enforcement purposes (16 \nMember States had used the VIS for law enforcement purposes, and most of them started doing so in the last \nmonths of 2015). Consequently, the information on the limited use of the system for law enforcement fed into this \noverall evaluation report, but did not provide enough basis for a stand-alone dedicated report.\n\n The input on data protection provided by the European Data Protection Supervisor and the national data protection \nauthorities which could be used for this evaluation did not go beyond\n\n 26\n\n\n\n 2014 (the year the national data protection authorities last evaluated the lawfulness of the Member States\u2019 \nprocessing of personal data in the VIS; this information was communicated to the Commission for this evaluation) \nand the 2012 audit of the Central VIS carried out by the European Data Protection Supervisor. By the time of \npublishing this evaluation, the report on the 2016 audit of the VIS had not yet been published. Moreover, a report by \nthe VIS Supervision Coordination Group on access to the VIS and the exercise of data subjects\u2019 rights was not yet \npublic and could not be quoted in this report.\n\n 5. IMPLEMENTATION STATE OF PLAY (RESULTS)\n\n The VIS founding Decision was adopted in June 2004 and became applicable 20 days following its publication in \nthe Official Journal. The VIS Regulation, setting out the detailed functionalities and responsibilities for the operation \nof the VIS was adopted in July 2008 and became applicable 20 days following its publication in the Official Journal.\n\n In conformity with the VIS founding Decision, the Commission, assisted by the SIS II committee,29 was \nresponsible for developing the Central VIS, the national interface in each Member State and the communication \ninfrastructure between the Central VIS and the national interfaces. Thus, the Commission was mandated to develop \nand carry out the entire implementation process from the first stages of planning in 200430 until the operational \nresponsibility was transferred to eu-LISA.31\n\n At national level, Member States developed or adapted their national infrastructure on visas in order to \naccommodate the VIS.\n\n The VIS project was divided into three phases:\n\n 1. Phase 1 (detailed design) delivered all the documents necessary to fully describe the VIS from a technical \nperspective and was closed in 2006.\n\n 2. Phase 2 (development, testing and deployment) took place in 2007.\n\n 3. During phase 3 (migration and integration) Member States connected their national systems to the VIS central \ndatabase.\n\n The VIS did not start operating on the same date in all Schengen states\u2019 consulates worldwide. The VIS has been \nprogressively deployed, region by region, in the order determined by the Commission on the basis of three criteria \nin the VIS Regulation:\n\n 29 The comitology framework for both the SIS II and VIS projects in the development phase, set up by virtue of \nArticle 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 (OJ L 328, 13.12.2001, p. 4).\n\n 30 According to Article 2 of the VIS founding Decision (see footnote 5).\n\n 31 According to the eu-LISA founding Regulation (see footnote 8).\n\n 27\n\n \u2022 the risk of irregular immigration;\n\n \u2022 the threats to the internal security of the Schengen states;\n\n\n\n \u2022 the feasibility of collecting biometrics from all locations in the region.\n\n The Commission consequently adopted in November 2009 an Implementing Decision determining the first three \nregions for the VIS consular roll-out.32 Furthermore, for each geographical region, the Commission adopted a \nDecision setting the date for the \u2018go-live\u2019 of the VIS in that particular region (although the date could sometimes \ncoincide for several regions). Such decisions were adopted in each case after all Member States had notified their \nlegal and technical readiness to collect and transmit data to the VIS from that particular region.\n\n The VIS first started operating in all Schengen states\u2019 visa-issuing consulates in North Africa in October 2011, in \nthe Near East in May 2012, and then in the Gulf region in October 2012.\n\n On 24 April 2012, the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision determining the second set of regions for \nthe start of operations33: West and Central Africa (start of operations in March 2013); East and Southern Africa \n(June 2013); South America (September 2013); Central Asia, Southeast Asia and the occupied Palestinian territory \n(November 2013).\n\n On 30 September 2013, the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision setting the sequence of the VIS roll-\nout in the remaining regions of the world:34 Central America, North America, the Caribbean, Australasia (May \n2014), the Western Balkans and Turkey (September 2014), the eastern neighbouring countries (June 2015), Russia \n(September 2015), China/Japan and neighbouring countries (October 2015), India/Pakistan and neighbouring \ncountries (November 2015), the European \u2018microstates\u2019, the UK and Ireland, the other EU Member States \n(November 2015).\n\n The Schengen border crossing points are included in the first roll-out Decision as a separate region for the VIS roll-\nout, to cover the use of the VIS to issue visas at the border. The decision to deploy the VIS at Schengen border \ncrossing points for this purpose was made in order to avoid the roll-out in the geographical regions being \ncircumvented by third-country nationals of these regions lodging their applications at the external borders. In \npractice, due to the low figures of visa applications at borders (around 0.7 % in 2015, i.e. 102 110 out of 14 410 \n502 worldwide), the Schengen border crossing points were the last \u2018region\u2019 where the VIS was rolled out, in \nFebruary 2016.\n\n Schengen states have had the possibility to start using the VIS, with or without collecting visa applicants\u2019 \nfingerprints, in any location ahead of the general roll-out, provided that they first notified the Commission. 19 \nMember States notified the Commission that they would roll out the VIS in various locations, without fingerprints, as \nfollows:\n\n 32 Commission Decision 2010/49/EC of 30 November 2009, OJ L 23, 27.1.2010, p. 62.\n\n 33 Commission implementing Decision 2012/274/EU of 24 April 2012, OJ L 134, 25.5.2012.\n\n 34 Commission implementing Decision 2013/493/EU of 30 September 2013, OJ L 268, 10.10.2013, p. 13.\n\n 28\n\n \u2022 Belgium, Estonia and Switzerland notified that they would use the VIS ahead of the general roll-out in all their \nconsulates;\n\n \u2022 Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia notified that \nthey would start VIS operations at external border crossing points without fingerprints;\n\n\n\n \u2022 Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta and Sweden notified that they would roll out the \nVIS at various specific locations.\n\n On 1 December 2012, eu-LISA started operations and took over the operational management of the VIS from the \nCommission, in line with the VIS Regulation.\n\n Monitoring the development of the system\n\n Several structures were put in place to monitor the development and implementation of the VIS.\n\n A \u2018Friends of VIS\u2019 informal group was established by the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union \nin 2008 to follow up on how the Member States were developing national VIS projects, to provide a link between \nministerial and expert levels and ensure that Member States made the necessary arrangements to guarantee that \ntheir visa authorities (or another Member State on their behalf) collect and transmit the visa application data to the \nVIS, according to the regional roll-out. The group had its final meeting on 7 April 2016 following the end of the \nworldwide roll-out of the VIS and thus completing its mandate.\n\n The Change Management Board was established in March 2008 as an informal sub-group of the Schengen \nInformation System and Visa Information System committee (\u2018the SISVIS Committee\u2019) to maintain stable \nspecifications and to give advice about any change requests brought forward that affect the technical specifications \nof the VIS.\n\n The Test Advisory Group was also established as an informal sub-group of the SISVIS Committee for the purpose \nof discussing and agreeing all testing-related issues (preparation, execution and evaluation) with Member States.\n\n The VIS Advisory Group, an integral part of eu-LISA\u2019s management\u2019s structure, assists the Management Board on \ntopics of a rather technical nature, including security, and contributes to the preparation of various documents such \nas the multi-annual work programme and the annual work programme. The VIS Advisory Group is also consulted \non the annual activity report35 of eu-LISA in particular.\n\n 35 In accordance with Article 12(1)(k) of Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011.\n\n 29\n\n In accordance with Article 6 of the VIS founding Decision, between 2004 and 2011 the Commission submitted eight \nprogress reports to the Council and the European Parliament on the development of the VIS.36\n\n 6.

Facilitation of the visa application procedure37\n\n The sizeable majority of contributing Member States concurred in that the introduction of the VIS facilitated the \nvisa application procedure: 61 % of them consider that VIS had a slightly positive impact on the procedure, while 11 \n% consider this impact strongly positive. 16 % of the responding Member States considered that the VIS had no \n\n\n\nimpact on the visa application procedure, and 11 % consider this impact to be negative (5.5 % consider it strongly \nnegative and 5.5 % slightly negative).\n\n All responding Member States concur that the procedure was made slower and lengthier by the introduction of the \nVIS because it obliges them to carry out biometric capture and\n\n 36 See Commission staff working papers on the development of the Visa Information System, SEC(2005) 339, \nSEC(2006) 610, SEC(2007) 833, and the Reports from the Commission to the Council and the European \nParliament on the development of the Visa Information System \u2014 COM(2008) 714 final, COM(2009) 473 final, \nCOM(2010) 588 final, COM(2011) 346 final, COM(2012) 376 final.\n\n 37 For detailed analysis and reporting see also Section 3.1 of Annex 2.\n\n 1 MS\n\n 1 MS\n\n 3 MS\n\n 11 MS\n\n 2 MS\n\n VIS impact on the visa application procedure\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 1 MS did not answer this question\n\n 30\n\n maintain biometric equipment38. Consequently, it is more cumbersome for applicants as well. At the same time, \nMember States consider the procedures for entering and using the VIS data sufficient and effective for the purpose \nof further processing the application. However, all responding Member States agree that the VIS has also made the \nprocedure more secure in terms of due diligence and that applicants are better protected against identity theft.\n\n Moreover, those who consider the impact of the VIS positive emphasise how it has facilitated the decision-making \nprocess, which was simplified by setting-up a common system to store and exchange data between Member States \non applications and related decisions39. The visa history of the applicants is now easily available to visa \n\n\n\nauthorities throughout the Schengen area, and centralised in a single database which can be easily accessed and \nanswers a search in a matter of seconds.40\n\n Eu-LISA statistics from the system show that from 1 August to 15 October 2015 the average time taken to \ncomplete an examination procedure (from the moment a visa application is admitted and until a visa is issued41) \nwas four days. Most Member States take on average five days to complete the procedure, though experiences \nvary, ranging from within the same day for one Member State to 13 days for another Member State. With the Visa \nCode requirement that applications be decided on within 15 calendar days, the average time of five days currently \ntaken by the Member States to complete this procedure indicates that the VIS has helped reduce the overall length \nof the visa application procedure.\n\n Some Member States consider that the impact of the VIS cannot be fully evaluated at this point because the VIS \ndoes not currently contain enough data about applicants and their visa history to simplify the visa procedure. When \nthe VIS contains more information, more elements will be available for analysis and this will further simplify the \nvisa procedure.\n\n 6.1.2. Preventing applicants from bypassing the criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for \nexamining the application\n\n The prevailing view among the contributing Member States (63.2 %) was that the introduction of the VIS had no \nimpact on preventing applicants from bypassing the criteria for determining the Member State responsible for \nexamining their visa application. Only 31.5 % of the responding Member States considered that the VIS had a \npositive impact, either slightly positive (21 %) or strongly positive (10.5 %). However, none of the responding \nMember States considered that the introduction of the VIS had worsened the situation.\n\n 38 See details in Section 1.1. Facilitation of the visa application procedure in Annex 2.\n\n 39 See also Sections 1.1 and 2.1 of Annex 2.\n\n 40 See also Section 6.1.4 below.\n\n 41 Data on the length of visa processing-related operations towards VIS is extracted directly from the VIS technical \nrecords (logs). The date/time of the start and the end of the visa application procedure per Member State is then \ncompared. The average response per Member State is calculated by comparing when the Member State created \nthe application file and when it registered the visa decision (i.e. visa sticker) in the VIS.\n\n 31\n\n The advantage given by the possibility to check previous applications (especially recently rejected ones) in the VIS \nis considered rather marginal. The history of applications helps determine the main destination, which is very useful \nin cases where the applicant uses a new (blank) passport for a new application. However, the criteria for \ndetermining the Member State responsible follow from the information citing the main destination for the visit as \nprovided in the application form, rather than from the history of applications. Moreover, a previous rejection does \nnot necessarily call for a rejection of the current application, nor does it imply that the current application should not \nbe handled by a given consulate.\n\n\n\n Responding Member States underlined that in order for the system to work satisfactorily it is extremely important \nthat all Member States perform the searches and the linking of individual files in the VIS central system correctly \nand that the biometrics taken are of sufficient quality.\n\n 6.1.3. Facilitating the fight against fraud42\n\n A substantial majority of the responding Member States \u2014 89 % \u2014 agreed that the introduction of the VIS \nfacilitated the fight against visa fraud (50 % found this impact slightly positive, while 39 % found it strongly positive). \n11 % considered that the VIS has had no impact on visa fraud. Notably, no Member State seems to consider that \nthe VIS would in any way have facilitated fraud.43\n\n 42 See also Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3 of Annex 2 and Section 1 of Annex 3.\n\n 43 See also Section 1.3 of Annex 3.\n\n 12 MS\n\n 4 MS\n\n 2 MS\n\n VIS impact on preventing the bypassing of the criteria for the determination of the Member State responsible for \nexamining the application\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 1 MS did not answer this question\n\n 32\n\n Due to their nature and function, visas are checked mainly on entry to the Schengen zone at border crossing \npoints. Thus, detections at border crossing points are the main indicators of visa fraud. Frontex\u2019s \u2018Annual Risk \nAnalysis 2016\u2019 reports a constant decline in the number of fraudulent visas detected at external borders between \n2012 and 2015, from over 1 800 false visas detected in 2012, to around 1 500 in 2013, 1 100 in 2014 and 776 in \n2015 (a 32 % decline on the previous year).\n\n The main VIS feature contributing to the fight against fraud is the storage of fingerprints in the VIS. When a new \nvisa application is lodged, the system provides a secure link to the identity of the applicant through biometrics and \nno look-alike fraud is possible.\n\n\n\n Thus, a major turning point in the identification of fraudulent visas at borders was the obligation, as of October \n2014, for border authorities to check visa holders by using fingerprints (checking the visa sticker number was \nsufficient before). This made it virtually impossible for a person to cross the border using a forged or falsified visa \nsticker, as the system would immediately identify that the person was not registered with such a visa sticker \nnumber.\n\n The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis 2016 also showed that there was an increase in detections of false visas at \nborders in the period immediately following the introduction of the VIS checks at borders (2012). The VIS checks \nalso constituted a deterrent, in the longer run, to the use of false visas to enter the EU territory.\n\n However, the effectiveness of the check relies on the requirement that the correct searches are made, that files are \nsystematically linked, and that the biometrics taken are of sufficient quality.\n\n 2 MS\n\n 9 MS\n\n 7 MS\n\n VIS impact on the fight against visa fraud\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 1 MS did not answer this question\n\n 33\n\n In addition, VIS cannot prevent fraud with documents/false passports presented during application. The obligation \nto check the visas using fingerprints reduces the possibility for fraudsters to cross the border using fraudulent visa \nstickers. A possible knock-on effect could have been a shift from the use of fraudulent visa stickers towards the use \nof visas obtained under false pretence in consulates (at the time of applying for a visa), and thus an increase in the \nlikelihood of fraud with other types of documents (such as travel documents). To prevent this, consulates have to be \nsure about the identity of the applicant before taking the fingerprints.\n\n 6.1.4. Facilitating checks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States44\n\n A vast majority of the responding Member States (73.5 %) considered that the introduction of the VIS facilitates the \nchecks both at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States. 52 % considered the \nVIS to have a slight positive effect in this sense and 21 % considered that the VIS had a strongly positive effect. 16 \n% of the responding Member States considered that the VIS had no impact on these checks at external border \ncrossing points and within the territory, and 5 % consider that the impact was slightly negative.\n\n\n\n The three main positive impacts of the VIS are:\n\n 44 See also Section 3.2.1 of \u2013Annex 2.\n\n 2 MS\n\n 1 MS\n\n 13 MS\n\n 1 MS\n\n VIS impact on checks at Schengen border crossing points and within the territory\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 2 MS did not answer this question\n\n 34\n\n \u2022 the fact that it has improved the quality of the visa checks (thanks to the use of centralised data making it \npossible to verify within seconds the identity of the visa holder and the authenticity of the visa, including when \nissued by another Member State);\n\n \u2022 the increase in the information accessible to relevant authorities (by allowing access to the visa history and \ninformation input by 26 states);\n\n \u2022 its contribution to detecting and fighting the use of fraudulent documents (made useless by a system carrying \nidentity checks based on fingerprints).\n\n A turning point in performing checks at borders using the VIS45 was, as in the case of fraud detections, the \nobligation as of October 2014 to carry out these checks using fingerprints. While slightly adding to the length of the \nborder check procedure, the comparison using fingerprints greatly facilitates the procedure by providing an \nirrefutable element to the decision regarding whether someone fulfils the conditions necessary to cross the external \nborder.\n\n As regards the rapidity of the system, data logs indicate that, even with fingerprints, the VIS enables border checks \nto be performed within seconds, as evidenced in the table below (source eu-LISA).\n\n\n\n The few responding Member States who did not notice any impact or considered that the system has had a slightly \nnegative impact were mainly concerned about the increased time required for border checks. The low quality of the \nfingerprints and the missing information in the VIS files were also mentioned as issues faced at external border \ncrossing points. According to one Member State, the evaluation was also negatively impacted by the difficulty in \nevaluating the system before the roll-out was fully completed, meaning the VIS may be viewed more positively in \nthe future.\n\n The evaluation of technical progress on the use of fingerprints at external borders46 found that, overall, Member \nStates have made progress on the use of fingerprints at external borders. Outside the first months of running the \nnew system, Member States have experienced very few technical problems with the technology used and only \ninfrequent administrative impediments in checking fingerprints at external borders. Cases where multiple scans \nwere needed to collect fingerprints of sufficient quality and attempts at spoofing have been reported\n\n 45 For further details see also Annex 4 on the technical progress made regarding the use of fingerprints at external \nborders as well as Sections 1.4 and 3.2.1 of Annex 2.\n\n 46 See Annex 4.\n\n 1st Line with FP1st Line without FP2nd Line with FP2nd Line without FPAvg time (s)Avg time (s)Avg time (s)Avg \ntime (s)1.360.3113.780.28VIS Border business statistics : 01/10/2015 - 31/12/2015\n\n 35\n\n as sporadic. Situations where capturing devices and the VIS are unavailable are managed using appropriate \nalternative procedures.\n\n 6.1.5. Assisting in the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, \nstay or residence on the territory of the Member States47\n\n A vast majority of responding Member States \u2014 78 % \u2014 were of the opinion that the introduction of the VIS helped \nthem identify people who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to or stay or residence in the territory of \nthe Member States. 50 % consider this impact slightly positive, while 28 % consider that the VIS had a strongly \npositive impact. 17 % of the responding Member States consider that the VIS had no impact on the identification of \nthese persons and 5.5 % consider the impact of the VIS to have been slightly negative.\n\n Most Member States consider that the VIS gives them the possibility to assess in an unambiguous and timely \nmanner whether a person fulfils the conditions for entry to or stay in the territory of the Member States. One \nMember State insisted on the positive impact of fingerprints on the ability to identify someone who has no identity or \ntravel document. The main concerns of the few Member States who consider that the system has no, or a slightly \nnegative, impact on the identification of these people referred to the length of the identification procedure, although \nsome Member States have already noticed an improvement in that respect. The fact that the police lack equipment \nfor identification during checks within the territory was also raised48.\n\n 47 See also Section 3.2.3 of Annex 2.\n\n 48 See also Section 1.5 Annex 2.\n\n 1 MS\n\n 3 MS\n\n\n\n 9 MS\n\n 5 MS\n\n VIS impact on the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay \nor residence on the territory of the Member States\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 1 MS did not answer this question\n\n 36\n\n 6.1.6. Facilitating the application of Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 (as replaced by Regulation 604/2013, the \u2018Dublin \nIII Regulation\u2019)\n\n The majority of the responding Member States \u2014 63 % \u2014 consider that the introduction of the VIS supported the \napplication of the Dublin Regulation by determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum \napplication where a visa has been issued by a Member State to the asylum applicant. Almost 31.5 % consider the \nimpact of the VIS to have been slightly positive, and 31.5 % consider it strongly positive. Almost 26.5 % of the \nresponding Member States consider that the introduction of the VIS had no impact on the Dublin procedure and 11 \n% did not provide any answer. None of the respondents found this impact to be negative.\n\n The VIS was used for asylum purposes by 12 Schengen Member States in nearly 400 000 cases between \nNovember 2011 and end December 2015 to help determine the Member State responsible under the Dublin \nRegulation. Since October 2011 it has been used by 15 Member States in 1 384 988 cases to support the \nexamination of asylum applications. The vast majority of those VIS searches were carried out by four Member \nStates. Feedback from Member States shows that VIS data provide evidence for determining the Member State \nresponsible and facilitate take charge requests. The data are also used to assess the identity and credibility of \napplicants when examining an asylum application.\n\n In a questionnaire carried out by the Commission in April 2015 on the use of the VIS for asylum purposes, the 11 \nMember States who had used the VIS for Dublin purposes at that time stated that they experienced little or no \ndifficulties in obtaining acceptances to transfer requests based on VIS-hits. This shows that the VIS is overall well \naccepted by Member States as an instrument of proof in the Dublin procedure.\n\n 5 MS\n\n 6 MS\n\n 6 MS\n\n\n\n VIS impact on the application of the Dublin Procedure\n\n Strong negative impact\n\n Slightly negative impact\n\n No impact\n\n Slightly positive impact\n\n Strong positive impact\n\n * 2 MS did not answer this question\n\n 37\n\n 6.1.7. Contributing to the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States49\n\n Almost half of the responding Member States \u2014 47 % \u2014 considered that the introduction of the VIS had a positive \nimpact on preventing threats to the internal security of the Member States. For 42 % this impact was slightly \npositive and for 5 % it was strongly positive. For 10.5 % of the respondents the introduction of the VIS had a limited \nimpact and for 16 % no impact. 26 % of the respondents did not rate the contribution of the VIS to the prevention of \nsecurity threats.\n\n The mitigated response can be due to the fact that access to the VIS data by law enforcement authorities is recent \n(the VIS LEA Decision became applicable in September 2013) and very fragmented among the countries using the \nVIS. Of 26 Member States, eight never accessed the VIS for this purpose. However, the use of VIS for law \nenforcement purposes has recently been increasing.\n\n 6.1.8. Ensuring appropriate protection of data subjects in the visa application process50\n\n The rights of data subjects are an important part of data protection law. Ensuring that data subjects can access, \nrectify and erase data held about them increases the transparency of data\n\n 49 On the basis of Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa \nInformation System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the \nprevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences. For detailed \ninformation on the evaluation of this Decision see section 1.7 of Annex 2.\n\n 50 For details see section 3.6. of Annex 2.\n\n 38\n\n processing for them, helps to uncover unlawful processing and increases data quality for lawful processing.\n\n The evaluation found that only a very limited (a few dozens51) requests were ever made by visa applicants to \naccess their VIS data, and hardly any one to correct or erase such data. All Member States have in place \nprocedures to request access to data, most of them allowing direct requests to the VIS data controller52. During the \nperiod under evaluation, there has been no there has been no reported situation in which a request to correct or \n\n\n\ndelete data was refused and which led to actions or complaints before the national competent authorities, and \ntherefore, no case either when Member States should have exercised their duties to assist and advise the person \nconcerned in proceedings before a court or competent authority\n\n The lawfulness of the processing of personal data by Member States is monitored by the national data protection \nauthorities (DPAs), while the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is responsible for supervising the \nmanagement authority (eu-LISA), mainly through inspections and audits53.\n\n DPAs monitoring showed that the relevant staff members of the competent authorities dealing with the VIS have a \nsatisfactory level of awareness regarding their obligation to safeguard data subjects\u2019 rights. Training covering data \nsubjects\u2019 rights is provided to the relevant staff in some Member States. The VIS SCG54 noted the absence or very \nlow number of requests made by data subjects to exercise their rights of access, correction or deletion of their \npersonal data stored in the VIS. This could be due to data subjects not being aware of their data protection rights, \nbut also to the lack of information about the way to exercise them (e.g. to whom data subjects should address their \nrequests). In this sense, the EDPS invited national DPAs to carry out quality controls regarding the information \nprovided to data subjects by diplomatic missions, consular posts and ESPs.\n\n In its almost three years of operation, eu-LISA has not received any complaint related to data protection. The \nEDPS has performed inspections on the spot to monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data and \nperformed two security audits of the VIS central system to date (in 2011 and 201555).\n\n 6.2. Efficiency\n\n The roll-out of the VIS was initially planned to take three years, but in fact it took over four years to be fully rolled \nout worldwide. However, given the magnitude of the project and its\n\n 51 For details see section 3.6.2 of Annex 2.\n\n 52 In accordance with Article 41(4) of the VIS Regulation and with Article 2(d) of Directive 95/46/EC.\n\n 53 Required every four years on the basis of Article 41(2) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n 54 The VIS Supervisory Coordination Group established by the EDPS on the basis of Article 43 of the VIS \nRegulation.\n\n 55 For findings and follow up to these inspections see section 3.6.6.2 of Annex 2.\n\n 39\n\n unique nature, the delay was not considerable or of a length that would create any negative consequences for the \nvisa examination processes. On the contrary, the set up and launch of the VIS brought a gradual benefit compared \nwith the baseline situation where there was no centralised system enabling Member States to compare national \ndata and trace back applicants\u2019 visa history.\n\n As regards the main financial costs for developing the system, the 2004 VIS impact assessment56 estimated that \nthe one-off investment costs for the EU would be around EUR 93 million and EUR 186 million for all the Member \nStates. As regards operational costs, the annual costs for the EU were estimated at between EUR 14-16 million, \nwhile the costs for the Member States\u2019 national systems were estimated at around EUR 49 million.\n\n\n\n In reality, the cost of setting up the VIS57 totalled nearly EUR 151 million spread over a period of six years from \n2005 to 2011. The cost breaks down as follows:\n\n \u2022 Development contract (without fingerprints) \u2014 EUR 39.9 million (25 %)\n\n \u2022 Development contract (with fingerprints) \u2014 EUR 37.4 million (23 %)\n\n \u2022 Technical assistance \u2014 EUR 9.4 million (6 %)\n\n \u2022 Network infrastructure (including Member States\u2019 connection) \u2014 EUR 46.2 million (29 %)\n\n \u2022 Site preparation \u2014 EUR 4.7 million (9 %)\n\n \u2022 Other, including security \u2014 EUR 13.1 million (8 %)\n\n 56 See footnote 8.\n\n 57 See also Section 3.5 of Annex 2.\n\n 40\n\n Quantifying the costs incurred by the Member States to set up national systems is more complicated due mainly to \nthe way in which systems are organised at national level. Most often the national systems were not built from zero, \nrather existing systems were upgraded and adapted to enable them to connect with the VIS. Since the verification \nand identification of third-country nationals were shifted to the Central VIS system, in certain cases the VIS helped \nenforce synergies at European level, hence limiting costs at national level.\n\n Depending on their consular network and the level of equipment used, the costs incurred by Member States in \nsetting up the system vary between EUR 1-2 million and EUR 30 million.58 A total high-level rough estimate of \nMember States\u2019 expenditure is approximately EUR 600 million, including maintenance costs for the first years.\n\n It is not easy to calculate the financial benefits of setting up the VIS given that it is a non-profit instrument. \nMoreover, its benefits (listed below) are unquantifiable:\n\n 58 For detailed national expenses see Tables 15 and 16 in Section 3.5 of Annex 2.\n\n 41\n\n \u2022 the contribution to enforcing a common Schengen visa policy and consular cooperation and providing an easily \navailable and secure means of consultation between central visa authorities;\n\n \u2022 the possibility to identify any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay or \nresidence in the territory of the Member States;\n\n \u2022 the facilitation of the application of criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for \nexamining an asylum application;\n\n \u2022 the contribution to preventing, detecting and investigating serious criminal offences.\n\n\n\n These benefits are of societal value in terms of enhancing internal security, fighting irregular migration and \npreventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious crime.\n\n The areas where Member States have acknowledged greatest impact are:\n\n \u2022 prevention of \u2018visa shopping\u2019:\n\n \u2022 the facilitation of checks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States;\n\n \u2022 the fight against fraud.\n\n The reliability of fingerprint-based identifications means visa shopping is no longer reported as a significant \nphenomenon during the visa application procedure. Similarly, the reliability of fingerprint-based verifications at \nborders deters travellers from crossing the borders with forged visa stickers. In the context of growing international \nmigration pressure, this favourable trend is particularly noteworthy, although not financially quantifiable.\n\n The impact assessment for the 2014 recast of the Visa Code59 showed that it is rather difficult, if not impossible, to \nhave specific statistics on visa revenues, although some Member States have estimates of the revenues generated \nfrom visa fees.\n\n However, modelling and approximation could be developed, taking into account that the visa fee charged by the \nSchengen states under the Visa Code is set at EUR 60 per application and that by end February 2016 nearly 23 \nmillion applications are stored in the VIS. This means that more than EUR 1 380 million was collected by Member \nStates for processing these applications.60\n\n At the same time, it must be taken into account that the revenues thus obtained do not only cover the costs of \nconnecting to the VIS. Several other elements contribute to the overall cost of processing a Schengen visa, \nincluding the use of staff, usually (expatriate) civil servants,\n\n 59 Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the document \u2018Proposal for a Regulation of the European \nParliament and of the Council on the Union Code on Visas (Visa Code) (recast), SWD(2014) 68.\n\n 60 A rough estimate of EUR 60/application was applied. However, it can be reasonably assumed that some of \nthese applications must have been collected in third countries subject to visa facilitation agreements i.e. in \ncountries where the visa fee was reduced to EUR 35/application and the fee applicable to certain categories \n(children under 12, pensioners etc.) is waived. Given that the percentage of these categories in the total number of \nvisa applications is unknown, the overall estimate of EUR 1 380 million should be treated as an estimate only.\n\n 42\n\n who need to be extensively trained, and other various inventories (such as visa stickers, stamps and paperwork). \nSome Member States even argued that there is not always a direct link between consulates\u2019 work and visa \nrevenues because revenues go straight to either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs budget or the Treasury.61\n\n\n\n On the other hand, the calculation above leaves out the service fee applied by the external service providers. The \nfee, which can reach EUR 30 per application, covers the administrative cost of collecting visa data (including \nbiometrics) and all other front office relations with the applicants. Using external service providers (which is \ncommon practice in most locations throughout the world62) relieved Member States of a heavy administrative \nburden in terms of handling the visa application procedure. It can therefore reasonably be deduced that a large \nshare of the visa revenues could be used to develop the national VIS.\n\n Comparing these figures shows that the financial costs of setting the system would be largely exceeded by the fees \ncharged for the visa applications stored in the system. In this respect, we could assume that the costs of setting up \nthe system have, by and large, already been amortised by the Member States.\n\n The operational costs, i.e. the contractual expenses necessary for the Managing Authority to monitor and adapt the \nVIS, ranged from EUR 5 million to slightly more than EUR 24 million between 2011 and 2015. These operation \ncosts must be compared with the annual costs for the EU, which were estimated at between EUR 14 and 16 million \nin the 2004 impact assessment. After the first two years, the expense increases mirrored the capacity upgrade of \nthe VIS needed to enable it to match the growing visa issuing activity resulting from the worldwide roll-out. Overall, \nvisa issuing activity increased significantly between 2004 and 2014. For example, the number of applications for \nuniform short-stay Schengen visas increased by 48 % between 2009 and 2012.63 The operational costs include \nthe development of new technical features to adapt to changes such as the replacement of the Schengen \nConsultation Network by a specific consultation mechanism streamlining exchanges between Member States.64\n\n 61 Section 2.3.1.3 of SWD(2014)68 \u2014 footnote 47, Impact Assessment accompanying the Visa Code proposal for \na Regulation.\n\n 62 For details see Section 2.2 of Annex 3.\n\n 63 Source: Overview of Schengen visa statistics 2009-2012 (           http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-\ndo/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/docs/overview_of_schengen_visa_statistics_en.pdf).\n\n 64 See Articles 46 and 16 of the VIS Regulation ((EC) No 767/2008).\n\n 43\n\n Figure 1: VIS operating costs (2011-2015)\n\n To conclude, the main benefits of setting up the VIS are in operational and policy terms. Although unquantifiable, \nthe policy benefits clearly justify the costs, especially given that developing the system was a one-off event which \nwill continue to produce benefits for a long time, far beyond that needed for the system to be amortised.\n\n 6.3. Utility\n\n The Member States\u2019 contributions to the evaluation showed that the VIS fully addresses the needs, problems and \nissues which it was set up to tackle. Member States need a system that facilitates the visa application procedure, \nthe fight against fraud and checks at external borders or within the territory. They need a system that enables them \nto quickly and reliably identify people who may otherwise not have appropriate identification documents or may \nhave false ones, in order to ascertain their right to be or to remain on the territory.\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/docs/overview_of_schengen_visa_statistics_en.pdf\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/docs/overview_of_schengen_visa_statistics_en.pdf\n\n\n The VIS provides all these services in a quick and reliable manner and is therefore a useful tool in improving the \nmanagement of the external borders of the Schengen Area. The Member States which used the VIS for asylum \npurposes confirmed that it could be used not only to support application of the Dublin Regulation (between October \n2011 and November 2015, nearly 400 000 searches in the VIS were carried out for this purpose), but also to \nexamine individual asylum applications to identify and check the credibility of applicants.65 Between October 2011 \nwhen the VIS began operating, and November 2015, nearly 1.5 million searches had been carried out for this \npurpose.\n\n 65 See Sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 of Annex 2 for details.\n\n 44\n\n 6.4. Relevance\n\n 6.4.1. Assessment of the continuing validity of the VIS as an instrument for supporting the implementation of the \ncommon EU visa policy\n\n All responding Member States consider the VIS as essential for the good functioning of the common visa policy \nand that it supports the common area of free movement. The system has further streamlined and harmonised the \nvisa application procedure, albeit rendering it lengthier and more cumbersome. It has minimised fraud and visa \nshopping and enhanced the global security features of visa procedures. It facilitates and encourages \ncommunication between Member States.\n\n By introducing increased transparency in the visa process, especially by linking applications, the VIS is an \nincentive for Member States to seek common practice when assessing applications, thus leading to more \nharmonised procedures. The VIS has also made cooperation between the Member States both easier and quicker. \nThe biometric identifiers are reliable and immediately available. This gives consulates and central visa authorities \nthe information they need to check whether the applicant in question has previously been issued with a visa.\n\n The VIS is useful both in consulates and centrally to analyse how the common rules are applied and to receive \nearly indications of the level of abuse of visas issued in specific locations (e.g. visas used for other purposes than \nthose declared, for example to access the EU territory for asylum or work purposes). Although exact figures on the \nlevel of abuse of Schengen visas in the form of overstaying cannot be currently collected, the future entry/exit \nsystem (Entry/Exit System EES66) will address this issue, as it will be able to systematically and reliably identify \n\u2018overstayers\u2019 and periodically produce a list of people who have overstayed. At the same time, some Member \nStates indicated that regional disparities exist in the way the VIS obligations are implemented, for example when \napplying the exemptions from the rule to enrol biometrics, depending on the economic and diplomatic opportunities \nthat exist in each region. While Member States need to take measures to correct such uneven application of the \ncommon rules on visas, the scope of these cases remains limited and does not call into question the validity of the \nVIS as an instrument supporting the implementation of the common EU visa policy.\n\n The VIS also has the potential to make the visa process and its end result more predictable for visa applicants, \nregardless of which Member State assessed the application. The possibility for the Member States to conduct \nsearches against the VIS offers bona fide travellers a simplified procedure when applying for a visa.\n\n 66 See Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Entry/Exit System \n(EES) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third country nationals crossing the external \n\n\n\nborders of the Member States of the European Union and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law \nenforcement purposes and amending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011, \nCOM(2016) 194 final.\n\n 45\n\n If the VIS search on asylum applicants is done properly, it should lead to a more effective and uniform practice of \nproviding evidence for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application. It should \nalso help check the identity and credibility of asylum seekers.\n\n However, Member States also underlined the need to make better use of the information held in the VIS: firstly, by \nmaking more use of its under-exploited functionalities, for example for asylum, return or law enforcement purposes, \nand secondly by developing it and integrating it with the EES67 and improving data quality68 (including \nalphanumeric data), which is essential to obtain full and reliable information for the queries in the VIS. More \ndetailed information on the reasons for refusing69 or withdrawing70 an application and on revoking or annulling \nvisas would be welcomed.\n\n Another suggestion from the Member States contributing to this evaluation is that eu-LISA\u2019s mandate needs to be \nextended to allow it to access the VIS for data analysis (trends) and biometrics quality reporting. The current legal \nbasis confining the right to access the VIS data for the purpose of statistics exclusively to the Member States (with \nthe exception of statistics on logs related to processing operations) is sub-optimal, in that it does not ensure a \ncentralised way of reporting.71 This limitation is further aggravated by the fact that the eu-LISA founding Regulation \ndoes not explicitly provide a basis for eu-LISA to deliver statistics on data quality, despite these being key to \nensuring the VIS functions properly. Sharing statistics on the basis of the VIS data would also provide evidence of \nany need to change the common visa policy.\n\n 6.4.2. Assessment of the continuing validity of the VIS for performing biometric matching, primarily of fingerprints, \nfor identification and verification purposes\n\n Member States consider the VIS an essential tool in detecting identity theft and visa shopping and that biometric \nchecks are key to an efficient VIS. Biometric matching is considered the cornerstone of the common identification \nand verification procedure. A biometric Schengen visa means identity theft is no longer an option for those \nattempting to cross the EU border fraudulently, as the fingerprint check would immediately expose the fraudster. \nThe VIS works by dissuasion and its applications in the visa, asylum, migration and return policies are very much \nappreciated by practitioners.\n\n 67 The interconnectivity with EES is already provided for in the Proposal for the EES Regulation (see footnote 63).\n\n 68 For more details and analysis on data quality see Sections 1.3 and 2.2.5 of Annex 3, and Sections 3.2.1 and \n3.4.11 of Annex 2.\n\n 69 Article 12(2) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n 70 Article 10(2) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n 71 For further details on reporting and statistics see Section 3.1.4 of Annex 2.\n\n\n\n 46\n\n The biometric match provides a strong means of identification and prevents the misuse of applications and \nfraudulent behaviour.\n\n The VIS helps identify third-country nationals who are staying irregularly and is a very useful tool for return \npurposes. As regards asylum, the VIS is a fast and reliable source of information to establish whether an asylum \napplicant has been granted a visa and check the identity of an asylum applicant and the identification document the \nperson in question has submitted for his/her visa application.\n\n At the same time, many Member States emphasised the need to do more about the quality of the biometric \ndata.72 Though rare, cases of 100 % biometric match of two different people have been observed in practice by \nnational authorities, resulting from low quality of fingerprints. Bad quality fingerprints discourage Member States \nfrom carrying out border checks against the VIS. For example, the asylum authorities reported some cases where \nthere was no match in the VIS despite the fact that the asylum applicant had applied for a visa. In some cases the \nauthorities found the applicant in VIS via an alphanumeric search, but the fingerprints search did not find the person \nin the VIS.\n\n On the other hand, the system is performing very well in terms of keeping files. Thus, between October and \nDecember 2015, 97.2 % of the NIST73 files in the VIS were complete (i.e. they contained all 10 fingerprints). Only \n0.23 % of facial images and 2.64 % of fingerprints required were missing out of the 20.5 million applications.74\n\n In order to address these issues at the most appropriate level, Member States recommended that eu-LISA\u2019s legal \nbasis should be supplemented to give it the mandate to assist them in improving the quality of biometrics.\n\n Some Member States suggested adding in the VIS the possibility to automatically check against other databases, \nin particular the SIS, and the upcoming EES,75 in order to increase the efficiency of searches.\n\n 6.5. Acceptability\n\n The VIS was set up at the request of the Member States. It did not raise acceptability issues from the national \nauthorities dealing with it. However, the evaluation has showed that some of its functions are not used by the \nMember States to the level required. For example, despite frequent calls at political level for better use of the VIS, \nmonitoring of usage in the past few years showed that the VIS is not fully used for asylum purposes, or not as \nfrequently as it\n\n 72 For more details on this please see Sections 1.1, 1.3 of Annex 3.\n\n 73 Standardised file containing fingerprint information. The name comes from the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) which is a measurement standards laboratory, also known as a National Metrological \nInstitute, which is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce.\n\n 74 Source: eu-LISA.\n\n 75 Interoperability between VIS and the future EES is already provided for in the \u2018smart borders\u2019 proposals \n(footnote 48).\n\n 47\n\n\n\n should be by all Member States.76 By December 2015 the VIS had been used only by 12 Member States to \ndetermine the Member State responsible under the Dublin Regulation, and by 15 Member States to support the \nexamination of asylum applications. By March 2015 only one in two visas were checked against the VIS at the \nexternal border crossing points.\n\n Some resistance to the deployment of the VIS was met in certain third countries (Russia, Ukraine, the Gulf \ncountries). This was expressed either at the highest political level or at individual level, usually by applicants \nresisting fingerprinting. The reason for the negative perception is mainly related to the taking of fingerprints, which is \nsometimes perceived in certain societies as linked to a criminal record, while other concerns were also highlighted \n(e.g. the requirement of personal appearance resulting in travels of long distances to nearest consular services to \nlodge visa applications or in complaints by travel agencies that have been in many places important intermediaries \nin visa application processes). Concerns expressed at the highest political level (as with Ukraine) led to delays in \nthe roll-out of the VIS.\n\n However, none of these concerns lead to long-term rejection. To alleviate the possible negative impact of the \nprocedure at individual level and make the system more acceptable, the level of discretion of the procedure was \nincreased, mainly by setting up individual booths in the consulates and visa application centres of certain countries. \nAdditionally, the Member States checked on their consular presence in third countries to facilitate opportunities for \nfingerprint-taking, and information sessions were organised with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that accurate \nfactual information was being shared in the public domain with the visa applicants.\n\n 6.6. Coherence with other EU policies\n\n Current trends show that the VIS is becoming more consistent with other EU policies in the field of home affairs. \nMember States have made very little use so far of the provisions in Article 31 of the VIS Regulation (relating to \ncommunication of data to third countries or international organisations to prove the identity of third-country nationals \nfor the purpose of return). However, the recent enhanced political focus on return policy, collaboration with \ncountries of origin and renewed focus on the transit of irregular migrants will only increase the use of the VIS, \nallowing it to properly identify people in a return procedure.\n\n The evaluation also showed that while access to the VIS for law enforcement purposes77 currently remains quite \nfragmented and limited among the Member States,78 the high level of satisfaction and real or expected benefits \nfrom VIS access indicate that the number of users and requests should only increase in the future.\n\n 76 See section 1.6 of Annex 2.\n\n 77 For details see Chapter IV of Annex 2.\n\n 78 As revealed by the evaluation, 8 out of 26 Member States never accessed the VIS for this purpose and out of \nthe 18 using the system, eight have regularly done so. One single Member State generated more than half of all \nthe requests.\n\n 48\n\n The reports received from the local Schengen cooperation in third countries, as well as statistics gathered \nfollowing the roll-out of the VIS in any given location, indicated that the VIS has had no negative impact on the \n\n\n\namount of visa applications. Introduction of the VIS did not cause a drop in tourism or business travel to the \nMember States.\n\n 6.7. EU added value\n\n A return to a state of affairs in which national systems are used to ensure the security of the external borders, fight \nirregular migration or assist in the fight against terrorism and other serious crimes does not seem to be an option \nthis point in time. The added value of the EU legislation in this field is only increasing. The recent calls by the \nCouncil of Ministers of the EU in the field of justice and home affairs to step up checks at external borders including \nby \u2018carrying out a systematic registration, including fingerprinting, of third-country nationals illegally entering the \nSchengen area, whether migrants or applicants for international protection, and performing systematic security \nchecks by using relevant databases, in particular SIS II, Interpol databases, VIS and national police databases, with \nthe support of Frontex and Europol (\u2026)\u201979 are a strong appeal to more systematic and wider use of the VIS and to \nmaking it more interoperable with existing and possibly new EU databases.\n\n Member States also confirmed that the VIS is an important tool that supports asylum authorities in determining the \nMember State responsible and in examining asylum applications.\n\n 7. CONCLUSIONS\n\n The findings of this evaluation allow for a clear assessment of the key evaluation criteria and questions, especially \ngiven the abundance of quantitative and qualitative data. This clear assessment is possible despite certain \nlimitations in the degree of response of the stakeholders.\n\n The VIS seems to have been effective in achieving its main objective, namely to facilitate the visa application \nprocedure. The costs of setting up the VIS were reasonable and in certain cases the VIS contributed to enforcing \nsynergies at European level, hence limiting costs at national level. The Regulation created only a limited \nadministrative burden, which was outweighed by the gains brought by the system in terms of simplifying the visa \nprocedure. At the same time, the VIS creates benefits in operational terms by facilitating checks at external borders, \ncombating visa fraud and enabling the rapid identification of people who may not or no longer fulfil the conditions \nfor entry or stay in the territory of the Member States. It also supports asylum authorities by providing relevant \ninformation for determining the Member\n\n 79 Conclusions of the Council of the EU and of the Member States meeting within the Council on Counter-\nTerrorism on Strengthening controls of external borders, 20.11.2015.\n\n 49\n\n State responsible and for examining asylum applications. Thus, overall, the VIS is efficient in general terms of \ncosts and benefits.\n\n However, the Member States need to do more to implement the VIS in order to reap the full benefits of the VIS. In \nthis respect, the use of the VIS for the purpose of checks at external borders or within the territory, and for asylum, \nreturn or law enforcement purposes, needs to be enhanced and/or intensified.\n\n The objectives of the VIS Regulation remain relevant and the Regulation continues to be important for the area of \nfree movement. Recent developments mean the relevance of the VIS can only increase in the future.\n\n\n\n Member States need to improve their practical implementation of the LEA Decision. The results of the evaluation \ndemonstrate that urgent action is needed in some Member States to bring the national measures into line with the \nprovisions of the Decision. Specific attention should be focused on the recording of access operations and on \ntraining authorised staff.\n\n The VIS is coherent with other policies in the field of migration and borders and with international relations. Its \nadded value is consolidation. Given the general political objective of increased cooperation between Member States \nin the field of migration and borders and in stepping up controls at external borders, including through increased \ninteroperability between the systems, it now appears hard to imagine that a system such as the VIS be withdrawn.\n\n On this basis, it can be concluded that the VIS is fit for purpose. It is recommended that the VIS regulatory \nframework be further developed in the ways described in these conclusions to respond to new challenges in visa, \nborder and security policies.\n\n 50\n\n Annex 1: Procedural information concerning the process to prepare the evaluation\n\n In August 2014, the Commission launched an evaluation of the VIS Regulation.\n\n The evaluation is part of the Commission\u2019s Agenda Planning (2016/HOME/004) and Work Programme \n(COM(2014) 910 final \u2014 Annex 3).\n\n The process developed in four phases:\n\n phase I \u2014 Inception: August 2014-March 2015;\n\n phase II \u2014 Data collection: May 2015-February 2016;\n\n phase III \u2014 Exploitation: February-March 2016;\n\n phase IV \u2014 Completion of Commission internal procedures and final adoption: April-September 2016.\n\n An inter-service group steering group was set up at the launch of the evaluation to oversee the process. The \nSecretariat-General, the Legal Service, DG JUST and the European External Action Service participated in the \ngroup. The group met twice during the evaluation process (16 April 2015 and 15 April 2016).\n\n The evaluation was performed internally. Hard data to support the assessment have been relatively easy to find. \nThe main contributors were Member State authorities in charge of visa policy and those managing the VIS.\n\n The evaluation criteria and questions were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\n 51\n\n Annex 2: Summary of findings on the implementation of the Visa Information System (VIS) Regulation based on \nMember States and eu-LISA reporting\n\n I. RESULTS ACHIEVED AGAINST OBJECTIVES\n\n\n\n 1.1 Facilitation of the visa application procedure\n\n The overwhelming majority of Member States that responded to [a questionnaire on implementation of the Visa \nInformation System (VIS) agree that the introduction of the Visa Information System facilitated the visa application \nprocedure: 60 % consider the VIS to have had a slightly positive impact on the procedure, while 11 % consider this \nimpact strongly positive. 16 % of the responding Member States consider that the VIS had no impact on the visa \napplication procedure, and 10 % consider the impact to be negative (5 % consider it strongly negative and 5 % \nslightly negative).\n\n All responding Member States agree that the procedure was made slower and lengthier by the introduction of the \nVIS, because it requires biometric capture and the maintenance of the biometric equipment, and consequently \nmore cumbersome for applicants as well. All Member States agree that the VIS has also made the procedure more \nsecure in terms of due diligence and that applicants are better protected against identity theft.\n\n However, those who consider the impact of the VIS positive emphasise that it has simplified decision making, by \nstreamlining the exchange of data between Member States on applications and related decisions. Applicants\u2019 visa \nhistory is now easily available.\n\n Statistics from the eu-LISA system show that from 1 August to 15 October 2015 the average time taken to \ncomplete an examination procedure (from the moment of accepting the visa application until a visa was issued) \nwas around 4 days. Most Member States take an average of 5 days to complete the procedure, but the range is \nwide: from less than a day (0 days) for one Member State to 13 days for another.\n\n Some Member States consider that the impact of the VIS cannot, at this point, be fully evaluated, because it does \nnot currently contain enough data about applicants and their visa history to simplify the visa procedure. When the \nVIS contains more information, more analysis will be possible and this will simplify the procedure.\n\n 1.2 Preventing bypassing of the criteria for determining the Member State responsible for examining the application\n\n The prevailing view among the contributing Member States (63 %) was that the introduction of the VIS had no \nimpact on preventing the bypassing of the criteria80 for determining the\n\n 80 Possibly due to the relative recent experience of visa applicants with the VIS, in particular in regions of the \nworld with high migratory risks, the system has not had a large impact on preventing the applicants from\n\n 52\n\n Member State responsible for examining visa applications. Only 31.5 % of the responding Member States \nconsidered that the VIS had a positive impact, either slightly positive (21 %) or strongly positive (10.5 %). However, \nnone of the responding Member States thought the situation had worsened with the introduction of the VIS.\n\n There is considered to be little advantage in checking the VIS for previous applications (especially recently rejected \napplications). The history of applications helps determine the main destination, which is very useful in cases where \n\n\n\nthe applicant uses a new (blank) passport for a new application. The criteria for determining the Member State \nresponsible follow from the information provided in the application form, where the main destination for the visit is \ngiven. Previous rejection does not necessarily mean the current application will be rejected, nor is it grounds for the \ncurrent application not to be handled by a given consulate.\n\n A well-coordinated LSC remains an essential tool to fight visa shopping.\n\n Member States that replied stressed that for the system to work satisfactorily it is extremely important that all \nMember States perform searches and linking of individual files in the VIS correctly and that the biometrics taken are \nof sufficient quality.\n\n 1.3 Facilitating the fight against fraud\n\n The overwhelming majority of responding Member States \u2014 84.2 % \u2014 agreed that the introduction of the VIS \nfacilitated the fight against visa fraud, 42 % found this impact slightly positive, while 42.2 % found it strongly \npositive. 10.5 % consider that the VIS has had no impact on visa fraud. No Member State seems to consider that \nthe VIS might, in any way, have facilitated fraud.\n\n The main feature contributing to the fight against fraud are the fingerprints stored in VIS. The system thus provides \na secure link to the identity of the applicant through biometrics and no \u2018look-alike fraud\u2019 is possible. However, this \nrequires searches made on the basis of fingerprints, systematic linking of files, and biometrics of sufficient quality.\n\n VIS is not intended to prevent fraud with documents/false passports presented as part of an application; to tackle \nthis problem, when examining a visa application, visa authorities should use SIS II and Interpol\u2019s Stolen and Lost \nTravel Documents database. Consulates must be sure of the applicant\u2019s identity before taking fingerprints.\n\n 1.4 Facilitating checks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States\n\n The vast majority of the responding Member States (73.5 %) consider the introduction of the VIS to have facilitated \nchecks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States, 52.3 % considering the VIS \nto have a slight positive effect in this sense and 21.2 % considering the VIS to have a strong positive effect. 15.9 % \nof the responding Member States consider that the VIS had no impact on these checks at external border\n\n continuing to attempt to bypass the criteria for determining the Member State responsible for examining a visa \napplication.\n\n 53\n\n crossing points and within the territory, and 5.3 % consider that the impact was slightly negative.\n\n The main positive impacts relate to the enhancement of the quality of the visa checks, the increase in the amount \nof information accessible to relevant authorities and the VIS\u2019 contribution to the detection of and fight against \nfraudulent documents. The few responding Member States who did not notice any impact or consider the system to \nhave had a slightly negative impact are mainly concerned about the increased time required for border checks. \nPoor-quality fingerprints and missing information in the VIS files were also mentioned as issues faced at external \nborder crossing points. According to one Member State, the evaluation was also negatively impacted by the \n\n\n\ndifficulty of evaluating the system before the roll-out was completed and an increase in positive appreciation may \ntherefore be expected in the future.\n\n 1.5 Assisting in the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay \nor residence on the territory of the Member States\n\n An overwhelming number of responding Member States \u2014 78.9 % \u2014 were of the opinion that the introduction of \nthe VIS helped with the identification of persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay or \nresidence on the territory of the Member States. 63 % consider this impact slightly positive, while 15.9 % consider \nthat the VIS had a strong positive impact. 5.3 % of the responding Member States consider that the VIS had no \nimpact on the identification of these persons and 5.3 % consider the impact of the VIS to have been slightly \nnegative.\n\n Most Member States consider that the VIS gives them the possibility to assess in an unambiguous way and in a \ntimely manner if a person fulfils the conditions for entry to or stay in the territory of the Member States. One Member \nState stressed its positive impact on identifying a person who has no identity or travel document, thanks to access \nto fingerprints. The main concerns of the few Member States who consider that the system has had no impact or a \nslightly negative one on identifying people referred to the lengthy procedures mentioned above, though some \nMember States have already noticed improvement in that aspect. The lack of police equipment for identification \nduring checks within the territory was also raised.\n\n 1.6 Facilitating the application of Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 (as replaced by Regulation 604/2013, the \u2018Dublin III \nRegulation\u2019)\n\n The vast majority of the responding Member States \u2014 63 % \u2014 consider that the introduction of the VIS supported \nthe application of the Dublin Regulation to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum \napplication. Almost 31.5 % consider the impact of the VIS to have been slightly positive, and 31.5 % consider it \nstrongly positive. Almost 26.5 % consider that the introduction of the VIS had no impact on the Dublin procedure \nand 11 % did not answer. None of the respondents found this impact to be negative.\n\n For asylum purposes, the VIS has been used by 12 Schengen Member States in 399 991 cases since October \n2011 to help determine the Member State responsible under the Dublin\n\n 54\n\n Regulation and by 15 Member States in 1 384 988 cases since October 2011 to support the examination of asylum \napplications. The vast majority of these VIS searches were carried out by four Member States. Feedback from \nMember States shows that VIS data yield evidence for determining the Member State responsible and facilitate \n\u2018take charge\u2019 requests. They also help with assessing the identity and credibility of applicants when an asylum \napplication is being examined.\n\n 1.7 Contributing to the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States (on the basis of \nCouncil Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System \n(VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and \ninvestigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences)\n\n For almost half of the responding Member States \u2014 47.3 % \u2014 the introduction of the VIS had a positive impact on \nprevention of threats to the internal security of the Member States. For 42 % this impact was slightly positive and for \n5.3 % it was strongly positive. For 10.5 % of respondents the introduction of the VIS had a limited impact and for \n15.9 % no impact. 26.3 % of respondents did not rate its contribution to the prevention of security threats.\n\n\n\n II. ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTINUING VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE FOR THE SYSTEM\n\n 2.1 Assessment of the continuing validity of the VIS as an instrument for supporting the implementation of the \ncommon EU visa policy\n\n All responding Member States consider the VIS essential for the good functioning of the common visa policy and \nfor supporting the common area of free movement. It has led to more streamlining and harmonisation of the visa \napplication procedure, albeit rendering it lengthier and more cumbersome. It has minimised fraud and visa \nshopping, and enhanced the global security features of visa procedures. It facilitates and encourages \ncommunication between Member States.\n\n By introducing increased transparency in the visa process, especially by linking applications, VIS seems to be an \nincentive for Member States to seek common practice when assessing applications, and so leads to more \nharmonised procedures. Using the VIS has also made cooperation between the Member States in individual cases \nboth easier and quicker. Biometric identifiers are both reliable and immediately available. This gives the consulates \nand the central visa authorities the information they need to determine whether the applicant in question has \npreviously been issued with a visa.\n\n The VIS is useful both for consulates and centrally to analyse how the common rules are applied and to obtain \nearly indications of the level of abuse of issued visas in specific locations. However, there are regional disparities in \nthe way VIS obligations are implemented, for example when applying the exemptions from the rule to enrol \nbiometrics.\n\n The VIS has the potential to make the visa process and its end result more predictable for visa applicants, too, \nregardless of which Member State assessed the application. Allowing Member States to conduct searches in the \nVIS is a tool well suited to offering bona fide travellers a simplified procedure when applying for a visa.\n\n 55\n\n Where the VIS consultation on asylum applicants is properly done, it should lead to more uniform practice in \nassessing visa applications with a potential for asylum.\n\n Member States also underlined the need to expand the use of VIS information and improve data quality (including \nalphanumeric data), which is essential to obtain full and reliable information for queries in the VIS. More detailed \ninformation on the reasons for rejection / withdrawal of an application and on revocation / annulation of a visa would \nbe welcomed.\n\n Some Member States suggested that the mandate given to eu-LISA needs to be extended in order to allow it to \naccess the VIS for data analysis (trends) and for reporting on biometrics quality, in particular compiling statistics. \nSharing statistics on hits in the VIS among Member States and with the EU bodies concerned would also provide \ninformation and the hard evidence needed to identify and support any change to the common visa policy.\n\n\n\n Also, the VIS should be developed and unified with the Schengen entry/exit system. In addition, it could be the \nbackground to the e-visa or EU travel authorisation system.\n\n Member States indicated that a limitation of the assessment was imposed by the very recent and rather limited \nnature of the experience with the VIS, given that the worldwide roll-out had barely finished by the time the \nevaluation was carried out.\n\n 2.2 Assessment of the continuing validity of the VIS for performing biometric matching, primarily of fingerprints, for \nidentification and verification purposes\n\n Member States find the VIS an essential tool in the detection of identity theft and visa shopping and the biometric \ncheck as the key element that renders the VIS efficient. Biometric matching is considered the cornerstone of the \ncommon identification and verification procedure. Its applications in the visa, asylum, migration and return policies \nare very much appreciated by practitioners.\n\n The biometric match provides a strong means of identification and prevents the misuse of applications and \nfraudulent behaviour.\n\n It helps to identify non-EU nationals who are staying irregularly and is a very useful tool for return purposes. As \nregards asylum, the VIS is a fast and reliable source of information to establish whether the asylum applicant has \nbeen granted a visa, the identity of the asylum applicant and the identification document the person in question \nsubmitted for the visa application. In some cases there is no match in the VIS although the asylum applicant has \napplied for a visa. Some authorities signalled that they have, in some cases, found the applicant in the VIS via an \nalphanumeric search, although the fingerprints search had not resulted in identifying the person in the VIS.\n\n At the same time, many Member States emphasised the need to do more on data quality. Though rare, cases of a \nfingerprint-based match between two different persons have been found, resulting from poor-quality fingerprints. In \nsome cases, poor-quality fingerprints discourage Member States from carrying out border checks using the VIS. eu-\nLisa should be given a mandate to assist Member States in improving the quality of biometrics, e.g. with the \ndelivery of fingerprint software kits.\n\n Some Member States suggested adding a function in the VIS allowing an automatic check against other \ndatabases, such as the SIS or Eurodac.\n\n Some Member States proposed that information on D-visas, including biometrics, should also be recorded in the \nVIS.\n\n 56\n\n To make VIS searches more efficient for law enforcement purposes, the possibility of searching with latent \nfingerprints was suggested to be included in the law.\n\n 57\n\n III. THE APPLICATION OF THE VIS REGULATION\n\n\n\n 3.1 Entry and use of data by visa authorities\n\n 3.1.1 Use of the procedures for entering data upon application\n\n With one exception, responding Member States consider the current procedures provided in Article 8 of the VIS \nRegulation for entering data upon application, visa issuance, discontinuation, refusal, revocation, or extension are \nsufficient and effective for the purpose of further processing of the application, provided they are correctly followed \nand that all data are available.\n\n Long waiting times are sometimes reported when entering data and before receiving confirmation from the VIS of \nthe identity of the applicant. It is unclear whether this is due to low system capacity, delays in communication \nbetween national systems and the VIS, or a break in transfer between the consular posts and the Member State\u2019s \nnational system.\n\n On Article 8(5) of the Regulation, which lays down rules on marking data which cannot be provided for legal or \nfactual reasons, a further distinction was suggested in the second category between: (a) fingerprint(s) not in fact \nprovided for technical reasons; (b) fingerprint(s) not provided because of permanent disability; and (c) fingerprint(s) \nnot provided because of a temporary disability.\n\n The Member State that considered the current rules as insufficient mentioned that the applicant cannot fill in all the \ninformation, only fragments. An example is given of a person travelling through three countries, when the \napplication form only allows one hotel to be entered. It could be misleading for the consul examining a future \napplication to compare the information from the passport (i.e. border-check stamps) and in the VIS application file, \nwhich only shows one country, i.e. the first country of entry.\n\n Ten out of the 19 responding Member States reported having experienced various problems when entering data in \nthe VIS. The most common problem arises because not all Member States seem to follow the same pattern for \nentering data. Also, some entries seem to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading. In rare cases, the applications \nsent contained the fingerprints or photograph of another person.\n\n With very rare exceptions, all respondents reported having systematically checked for the existence of previous \napplications when entering data on admission and systematically linking them to earlier applications. Files are \ncreated for each applicant travelling in a group and systematically linked to those of the other applicants in the \nsame group. However, problems were reported in the event of long system response times or of work overload, \nwhen the linking fails.\n\n 58\n\n However, eu-LISA figures for October to December 2015 indicate great discrepancies between Member States in \nterms of the rates of operations linked to previous applications by the same person as a percentage of total \napplications made \u2014 from 0 % for one Member State (i.e. every applicant is a new one to the system) to 55.65 % \nfor another Member State (i.e. over half of the applicants are already recorded in the system). Most often this rate is \naround 20 % to 24 %. It is, however, difficult to draw a conclusion on this basis, as the rate of linked applications \nmay indeed vary significantly in practice. However, a general conclusion could be drawn, as the probability of only \nnew applicants showing up at the consulate seems rather low. Thus, rates close to 0 % may indicate that there is \nno systematic linking; the service might not be technically implemented in the national information system.\n\n As regards the use of \u2018grouping\u2019 operations for persons travelling in the same group, eu-LISA data reflecting entries \nbetween October and December 2015 show the same wide discrepancy between Member States\u2019 performance. \n\n\n\nThus, rates vary from as low as 0 % in two Member States to almost 62 % in one Member State. Five Member \nStates have rates below 1 % (including the two that have 0 %), 1 Member State between 1 % and 2 %, 5 Member \nStates between 2 % and 6 %, 1 Member State 7 %, 8 Member States between 10 % and 20 %, 2 Member States \nbetween 20 % and 30 %, 1 Member State around 32 %, 1 Member State 44 % and 1 Member State 62 %.\n\n These figures seem supported by similar findings during the field visits part of SCHEVAL monitoring. For example, \nthe consulate of one Member State was found not to systematically check against the VIS for previous applications \nlodged by the same person, nor to link them to the new application. This practice is not compliant with Article 8(2) of \nthe VIS Regulation, or with Article 21(2) of the Visa Code.\n\n In five instances, the Member States\u2019 consulates were found not to systematically link the applications of persons \ntravelling together in a group when entering data in the VIS. This practice does not comply with Article 8(4).\n\n In all these cases, recommendations had been addressed to the Member State monitored, to remedy the problems \nidentified.\n\n 3.1.2 Use of the data to be entered\n\n Most responding Member States (10) declared having experienced no problem when entering data into the VIS \naccording to Article 9 to 14 of the VIS Regulation, i.e. on applications, visa issuance, discontinuation of an \napplication, refusal, revocation or visa extension. Two responding Member States provided no reply or no statistics \non this particular issue. Six Member States reported limited problems, including occasional inability to upload \nalphanumeric identification information about the applicant or biometric data or to register the visa sticker. \nSometimes long delays are experienced in communication between the VIS and\n\n 59\n\n the consulate, and it is unclear whether this is due to delays between the national system and the VIS, or to low \ncapacity of the VIS database.81\n\n Where particular data are not required to be provided for legal reasons or cannot in fact be provided, the specific \ndata field in the VIS should be marked with \u2018N/A\u2019, in accordance with the legal basis. None of the responding \nMember States could provide figures on the use of the \u2018N/A\u2019 entry, as they are not collecting statistics on it.\n\n When asked whether they systematically collect and enter in the VIS all information set out in Article 9 of the VIS \nRegulation, 11 Member States said yes, 3 said no, and 5 did not reply. Only one Member State provided some \nexamples of difficulties preventing it from systematically entering the Article 9 data into the VIS. Such difficulties \nrelate to the \u2018address\u2019 field during the registration of the applications, depending on the particularities of each \ncountry. Details of persons and companies issuing an invitation are sometimes not filled in the application form, so \ncannot be entered in the VIS. The lack of such data has to do with the training of the authorised consular staff and \nof the external service providers (ESPs). Another piece of information typically omitted by applicants in the \napplication is the names of the parents.\n\n Comprehensive statistics (see below) on filling-in of the Article 9 and Article 10 fields extracted from the VIS show, \nhowever, that only \u2018date of birth\u2019, \u2018intended date of departure\u2019, \u2018latest visa sticker number\u2019, \u2018latest visa type decision \ndate\u2019, first name and surname, and the travel document number, type and validity are always filled in. By April 2015, \naround 70 % of some fields, such as \u2018visa type requested\u2019, \u2018occupation, employer name\u2019, and \u2018host organisation or \nhost person\u2019, were being filled in, while the figure for \u2018place of residence, country\u2019 was around 80 %. This \ninformation is required to be systematically entered in the VIS, and \u2018n/a\u2019 filled in if it is not applicable, under Article 8 \n\n\n\nof the VIS Regulation. Its use becomes all the more relevant if there is prior consultation under Article 22 of the \nVisa Code, because a search using any fields in which data is missing yields no results and means the person \nbeing checked will not be found. The fields highlighted in red in the graphs below are often used as search criteria \nby Member States in prior consultation.\n\n 81 The reference to the low capacity of the system was made by the Member States; however, we note that \ncapacity has been increased several times and is currently seven times more than what is needed for the VIS to \nfunction with its current parameters.\n\n 60\n\n Figure 1. Fields to be entered in VIS, in line with Article 9\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Figure 2. Fields to be entered in VIS, in line with Article 10\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n In addition to the missing fields relating to Article 9 and 10 of the VIS Regulation, some inconsistencies and a lack \nof common practice were identified particularly in relation to filling\n\n 61\n\n in the \u2018nationality at birth\u2019 field and information concerning applicants with more than one current nationality.\n\n For \u2018nationality at birth\u2019, monitoring (based on eu-LISA data taken from the VIS) showed that this field is currently \nfilled-in in two different ways: some Member States use the historical name of the country (at the time of the \napplicant\u2019s birth) and some the current name (e.g. \u2018Soviet Union\u2019 versus \u2018Turkmenistan\u2019). Either option is legitimate, \nbut in practice this discrepancy leads to difficulties in identifying the visa applicant and even to security problems if \nsearch operations then fail. The matter has been discussed at various levels with the Member States and eu-LISA \nand as a result a recommendation was made that the nationality stated in the travel document should be used in \nsuch cases.\n\n For applicants with more than one current nationality, the issue arose from a request by some Member States to \nhave all current nationalities entered in the VIS, as they consider such information relevant to prior consultation \nunder Article 22 of the Visa Code. So they asked for the VIS interface to be extended to allow this. To keep practice \nin line with the Regulation and prevent any inconsistency in applying the law (i.e. different Member States carrying \nout prior consultations based on different criteria), a recommendation was made that Member States carry out prior \nconsultations only on the basis of the nationality stated in the travel document presented when applying for the \nvisa, into which a visa sticker will be inserted if a visa is granted.\n\n Visa applicants must state whether fingerprints have been previously collected. It is possible they may make an \nerror, either in stating that fingerprints have previously been collected, although they are subsequently not found in \nthe VIS, or by stating that fingerprints have not previously been collected, although they are then found in the VIS. \nMost responding Member States could not provide quantitative data or evidence of such occurrences. A very few \nMember States provided figures showing very little occurrence of the former case (mostly below 1 %), and a rather \n\n\n\nmore frequent occurrence of the latter (over 7 % or \u2018often\u2019). This suggests a rather cautious approach by applicants, \nconsulates and ESPs in practice, i.e. people avoid taking the risk of having to come back to give fingerprints at a \nlater date, and so have a tendency to give fingerprints even if it is likely that biometrics have already been entered \nin the system up to 59 months previously.\n\n Schengen evaluation visits showed that decisions to revoke visas are not systematically entered into the VIS by \ntwo Member States. This practice is not compliant with Article 13 of the VIS Regulation (and Article 34(8) of the \nVisa Code) and therefore relevant recommendations have been addressed to these Member States.\n\n 3.1.3 Use of the VIS to examine applications\n\n All responding Member States except one said they systematically consult the VIS when examining the visa \napplication. One Member State said that in urgent cases checks on the history of applications can be overlooked, \nalthough in such cases a check against the records of the local consular post is required.\n\n 62\n\n One responding Member State does not consult the VIS if a visa application is made in circumstances that do not \nraise doubts to its validity or authenticity. If the application is subject to prior consultation under Article 22 of the \nVisa Code or in cases of domestic consultation, sufficient data is usually provided by their own consular posts \nwithout having to consult the VIS. For this purpose, the VIS was used as confirmation of an applicant\u2019s identity and \nof whether the application was lodged in the proper consulate (representation cases).\n\n Seven out of nineteen responding Member States (almost 40 % of respondents) experienced problems to various \nextents when consulting the VIS with the purpose of examining applications. These problems relate to errors in \nlinking the applications, incomplete (missing data fields) or erroneous data, including poor-quality biometrics, long \nresponse times for consultations, and the existence of open \u2018junk\u2019 cases in VIS, which generate mistaken alerts \nrelating to visa shopping. It was felt the information entered into the VIS about previous rejections could be more \nextensive.\n\n 3.1.4 Use of the data for reporting and statistics\n\n In all responding Member States except one, the competent visa authorities have access to consult all the data \nprovided for in Article 17 of the VIS Regulation for the purpose of reporting and statistics. Three of them declared \nthey had allowed access to consult these data for purposes other than reporting or statistics, for example for \nmonitoring the work of the consular authorities or for the purposes set out in Article 6(1) of the VIS Regulation, i.e. \nentering, amending, deleting or consulting data.\n\n NB: The term \u2018solely\u2019 used in Article 17 seems to create a certain confusion in interpretation, as many respondents \nunderstood it as a limitation of the visa authorities\u2019 access to data. However, the word \u2018solely\u2019 refers to the purpose \nof reporting and statistics and does not affect the core competences of the visa authorities which, under Article 6, \nshould have access to the data recorded in the VIS for the purpose of amending, deleting and consulting it.\n\n This evaluation has shown that, although there is a clear legal provision on collecting statistics on the VIS, most \nMember States do not make full use of it. So the response rate to many of the quantitative questions addressed to \nthe Member States was quite low and most answers referred to eu-LISA as the most appropriate source of \n\n\n\ninformation on VIS statistics, as the entity that manages the central database where all the aggregated data can be \nfound.\n\n For example, when asked to provide information on the number of cases in which applicants were exempted from \nfingerprinting because fingerprinting was physically impossible, pursuant to Article 17(12) to (14) of the VIS \nRegulation, only 7 out of the 19 responding Member States provided any information; the others provided no reply \nor reported that they collect no such data.\n\n As for data on the number of cases in which the applicant was exempted from fingerprinting by virtue of their status \nas heads of state or government, members of a national government, accompanying spouses or members of an \nofficial delegation, pursuant to Article 17(13) of the\n\n 63\n\n VIS Regulation, again only 4 (SE, SK, EL, PT) out of 19 responding Member States provided some.\n\n None of the responding Member States (including the four that provided data on the previous issue), was able to \nprovide data on cases in which the applicant was not exempted from fingerprinting despite their status as heads of \nstate or government, members of national governments, accompanying spouses or members of official delegation, \ndespite this issue being intrinsically related to the previous one.\n\n 3.2 Access to data by other authorities\n\n 3.2.1 Use of the data for verification at external border crossing points\n\n The vast majority of the responding Member States (12 out of 19) limit access to the VIS at external border \ncrossing points to border authorities, while in 5 Member States access is open to other law enforcement bodies \n(such as customs services, immigration services, or federal police82) in accordance with their national \nresponsibilities for border controls. However, all authorities given access to the VIS for checks at the external \nborders were properly notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 6(3) of the VIS Regulation and a \nconsolidated list for the Member States has been published in the Official Journal.83\n\n In terms of the number of checks, although only 5 Member States were in a position to provide data on the \npercentage of visa holders whose visa is recorded in the VIS and who have been checked against the VIS at \nexternal border crossing points, the average percentage is very encouraging, at 96.5 %.\n\n A big majority (73.7 %) of the responding Member States confirmed that the obligation to check the identity of the \nvisa holder and the authenticity of the visa sticker at the border by searching on the number of the visa sticker in \ncombination with fingerprints was introduced from October 2014. Very little information is, however, available on \nwhether this obligation is systematically met (5 out of 19 Member States said yes, one said no, while the remaining \n13 did not give further details).\n\n 82 Some Member States do not have a specific \u2018border guard\u2019: the work is done by the \u2018police\u2019.\n\n 83 An updated list is in course of publication at the time of drafting this report. The last update was in 2014: OJ C \n106, 9.4.2014.\n\n 64\n\n\n\n Figure 3.

Average time for processing visa checks at MS' borders\n\n Source eu-LISA\n\n However, according to the statistics provided by eu-LISA, checks based on fingerprints as a percentage of total \nchecks on visa holders against the VIS at external borders steadily increased, from 0.55 % in October 2011 (first \ndata available) to almost 23 % in November 2015. Interestingly, this number stood at only 3.22 % in September \n2014, the month before most of the Member States started to implement the requirement to check the identity of \nthe visa holder and the authenticity of the visa sticker at the border by searching on the number of the visa sticker \nin combination with fingerprints.\n\n It would be impossible to reach 100 %, because of cases where it is legally or physically impossible to record the \nfingerprints in the VIS, and the limitations of the calculation method (which assumes that all visa holders will cross \nthe border at least once within three months of\n\n Member State1st Linewith FP1st Linewithout FP2nd Linewith FP2nd Linewithout \nFPAustria1.130.158.150.14Belgium1.290.246.200.18Denmark1.520.474.890.33Estonia1.620.409.390.45Finland1.\n230.274.530.33France1.260.3311.490.20Germany1.300.278.030.27Greece1.530.316.600.48Hungary1.160.1126.5\n80.11Iceland1.390.35N/AN/AItaly1.410.1825.250.20Latvia1.930.3910.950.39Liechtenstein0.000.000.000.00Lithuan\nia1.550.8619.210.17Luxembourg1.230.23N/A0.33Malta0.690.485.200.27Netherlands1.430.186.930.17Norway1.59\n0.385.340.27Poland1.290.248.470.17Portugal1.310.346.420.23Slovakia1.430.1510.680.24Slovenia1.230.15N/A0.1\n3Spain1.370.316.610.31Sweden1.740.3714.450.33Switzerland1.260.245.990.34The Czech \nrepublic1.280.147.250.13VIS Border average processing time (seconds)\n\n 66\n\n\n\n the date of application84 and does not take into account the proportion of multiple entry visas). But still, the low \nnumber of checks based on fingerprints, as a percentage of all checks on visa holders against the VIS at external \nborders, has raised concern about whether the VIS Regulation is being properly implemented. The issue has been \nconstantly under the attention of the Commission and considerable work has been done with the Member States to \nraise awareness of the need to properly and fully apply the law.85\n\n The current rise in fingerprint (FP-based) checks shown in the Figure 5 below is, in that respect, encouraging (up \n19.24 % between October and November 2015).\n\n Figure 5. Comparison between total number of checks and checks based on fingerprints\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n The main difficulties linked to using the VIS for checks at external border crossing points are reported to be poor-\nquality fingerprints (see the graph below on fingerprint quality); missing data, especially in regions where it is newly \nrolled-out (see the graph below on missing facial images, for example), the fact that some fingerprints have been \nswitched and are therefore not linked to the right person, and the length of the process.\n\n 84 Article 9 of the Visa Code: \u2018Applications shall be lodged no more than three months before the start of the \nintended visit\u2019.\n\n 85 This has been discussed especially at various meetings of the Frontiers and Visa working parties and the VIS \nAdvisory Group.\n\n 67\n\n Figure 6. % of applications with poor quality fingerprints\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n * 0-FTE feature: as from the end of 2014 fingerprints are accepted by the VIS irrespective of their quality. This \nmeasure requested by some Member States and agreed upon by the VIS Advisory Group, means fingerprints are \nmore often available for border checks. In the vast majority of cases, fingerprints originally rejected by the VIS \nwere of sufficient quality for border checks. A side-effect of this measure is a slight decrease in fingerprint \nidentification accuracy at consular posts, in examining visa applications and in second-line checks at borders. This \nslight decrease is offset by additional checks by the end-user on the facial image available in the VIS. This \nmeasure does not exempt consulates from attempting to collect fingerprints of the highest quality, in particular by \nusing a software kit embedded locally in the fingerprint capture devices and by signalling potentially poor quality in \nreal time.\n\n Figure 7. % of cases in which facial image is not available in VIS\n\n Implementation of the 0-FTE feature as from October 2014*\n\n 68\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n\n\n In 9 out of the 12 responding Member States, if data quality is unsatisfactory the border guards contact the \nMember State which issued the visa (either the consular post or the central visa unit). In the other 3, the border \nguards proceed to a second-line check. When asked to suggest options for solving cases of insufficient data quality \nat borders, Member States suggested a 24/7 centralised call centre or contact point and/or a quality check \nmechanism to be used when data are entered in the VIS.\n\n 3.2.2 Use of the data for verification within the territory\n\n According to the data provided by eu-LISA (see Figure 8), the use of VIS data for checks within the territory varies \ngreatly between Member States. Only half made use of VIS data for that purpose and in more than 61 % of cases \nsearches were not carried out systematically but only for certain non-EU nationals. In addition, in 2015, more than \n60 % of searches were made by the same Member State.\n\n Figure 8: Monthly usage (by Member State) of services supporting verification of personal data within Schengen \nterritory (Article 19 of the VIS Regulation)\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Among the authorities with access to the VIS, most Member States referred to the police and the border guards; \nfour to immigration services, and three to asylum services. One Member State provided direct access not only to \nborder services and the police, but also to the customs service and local government, while indirect access was \nalso given to courts, the prosecutor\u2019s office, the internal security agency, the foreign intelligence agency, the central \nanticorruption\n\n 69\n\n bureau, the tax control authorities, and the government protection bureau, plus military intelligence, counter-\nintelligence services and the police.\n\n The dates as of which verification had been carried out ranged between November 2011 and June 2015. \nApproximately 42 % of the responding Member States conducted verification only for certain non-EU nationals, \nwhile only 26 % did it systematically in combination with the fingerprints. The others provided no reply.\n\n As regards the number of cases in which the VIS was used for the purpose of verification within the territory, only 1 \nMember State provided a number; most respondents gave no reply or replied that no statistics were available. \nAsked for the number of cases in which a person was identified staying irregularly, only 2 Member States provided \nfigures, one of which previously claimed to have used VIS for the purpose of verification in 0 cases. 21 % of \nrespondents stated that their authorities responsible for carrying out checks within the territory have experienced \ndifficulties in meeting their obligation to verify the identity of visa holders.\n\n 16 out of the 19 responding Member States (84 %) affirmed the utility of the VIS for identifying persons who may \nnot or may no longer fulfil the conditions of stay or residence on the territory of the Member State.\n\n 3.2.3 Use of the data for identification\n\n Use of VIS data for identification, either at external border crossing points or within the territory, was recorded in \nalmost all Member States (92 %) between October 2011 and November 2015 but to widely varying degrees (see \nFigure 9 below).\n\n 70\n\n\n\n Figure 9. Monthly usage of VIS (by Member State) for identification purposes, within the territory and at the borders\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Approximately 84 % of responding Member States confirmed that their authorities make use of the VIS to identify \npersons who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for stay or residence on the territory of the Member \nStates.\n\n With regard to questions about the percentage of checks in which the VIS helped to ascertain that the person had \na visa which was no longer valid and the percentage of searches which could not be made using fingerprints, half \nof the respondents indicated 0 cases, while the others gave no reply or replied that no statistics were available. \nOne Member State replied that most of these checks are made with the information written on the sticker and if \nnecessary counter-checked with the VIS.\n\n In cases where a search with fingerprints could not be made, those few Member States who provided an answer \nuse the photo and other alphanumeric data entered in the VIS and compare them with the travel document: e.g. the \nname, passport number, visa sticker number, and date of birth. Otherwise they have to ask partner states\u2019 \nembassies for information.\n\n Only 26 % of the responding Member States have experienced difficulties in carrying out the obligation to verify the \nidentity of visa holders at external border crossing points, such as the lack of response of the central system.\n\n To sum up, Member States are far from using the full potential of the VIS for return purposes. Unfortunately, the \navailable information does not shed light on the reasons for this situation (whether the cause is the lack of internal \ncoordination, practical or legal obstacles, lack of awareness or lack of fingerprint capturing devices on the spot).\n\n 3.2.4 Use of the data for determining responsibility for asylum applications\n\n One of the criteria for determining responsibility for examining an application for international protection is whether \nthe applicant is in possession of a visa issued by a Member State,86 and if so, whether the visa has expired (and \nwhen) and whether the visa was issued on behalf of another Member State. To help determine which Member \nState is responsible, Article 21 of the VIS Regulation allows the competent asylum authorities to search in the VIS.\n\n 86 Article 12 of the \u2018Dublin III\u2019 Regulation (EU) 604/2013/ Article 9 of Regulation (EC) 343/2003.\n\n 71\n\n Figure 10. Monthly usage of VIS (by Member State) for the purpose of determining the Member State responsible \nfor deciding on an asylum application. Source: eu-LISA\n\n 72\n\n The eu-LISA statistics (see Figure 10 above) suggest that in a total of 399 991 cases, VIS searches were carried \nout for this purpose by 12 Member States between November 2011 and November 2015 inclusive. Total monthly \nVIS searches for this purpose increased from 496 in February 2012 to 11 778 in September 2014 and, after a slight \nfall, rose rapidly again from 15 954 in July 2015 to 44 173 in November 2015, with a peak in October 2015 (56 437).\n\n\n\n The vast majority of these searches were made by only two Member States, with 269 387 and 96 638 searches \nrespectively. At the other end of the spectrum, one Member State searched the VIS once in the second half of 2014 \nand once again in November 2015; another Member State searched only in very sporadic cases, and another \nMember State in a single case.\n\n Member States\u2019 replies suggest that the VIS data was used to provide evidence for determining the Member State \nresponsible not only when a search was carried out for this purpose under Article 21 of the Regulation, but also \nwhen a search was carried out under Article 22 in the context of examining the application.\n\n Member States\u2019 replies show some inconsistencies with the eu-LISA statistics. Only seven of the Member States \nthat searched the VIS according to those statistics to determine the Member State responsible (partly) replied to the \nrelevant sections of the questionnaire. On the other hand, seven Member States submitted some observations even \nthough, according to the eu-LISA statistics, they do not yet use the VIS or use it only for examining asylum \napplications. Eight Member States, including four for which the statistics show no searches under Article 21 of the \nVIS Regulation, stated that they had given their competent asylum authorities access to search the VIS using the \napplicant\u2019s fingerprints under Article 21. One Member State had given access to search with alphanumeric data \nonly. In one of those Member States, all officials of the competent asylum authorities have access to the VIS for this \npurpose; in the other Member States access is only given to certain categories of officials.\n\n Member States\u2019 experience shows that the VIS helps in determining the Member State responsible and the \nprocedures for \u2018take charge\u2019 requests based on the evidence of the visa information. Examples of the most relevant \nsituations where the use of the VIS significantly contributed: providing evidence solving or clarifying cases of \nresponsibility for the examination of applications for international protection, where applicants were not in \npossession of the relevant travel or identity documents, in the absence of a Eurodac hit or of a credible statement \nabout their itinerary, or for establishing the age of the applicant or the responsibility of a Member State on whose \nbehalf the visa has been issued. One Member State reported that in 2014 almost 500 out of 1 100 \u2018take charge\u2019 \nrequests on the basis of the visa criteria were based on a VIS hit. Another Member State, which does not use the \nVIS regularly for determining Member State responsibility, noted that the number of incoming \u2018take charge\u2019 requests \nbased on VIS hits has increased considerably. One Member State reported that in 2015 (up to 17 November) 705 \n\u2018take charge\u2019 requests had been accepted by other Member States based on evidence from the VIS and 59 \nrequests had been refused on the basis of evidence from the VIS.\n\n 73\n\n Of those Member States who gave an overall rating as regards the use of the VIS for asylum purposes, eight see a \nstrong positive impact of the use of the VIS on the application of the asylum policy. The use of the VIS significantly \nintensified in the last months of the reporting period, although, according to the eu-LISA statistics, one of those \nMember States did not use the VIS for asylum purposes at all. Four Member States (one of which did not use the \nVIS for asylum purposes) see a slightly positive impact. One other Member State that searches the VIS to \ndetermine the Member responsible and three other Member States that did not use the VIS for asylum purposes \nsee no VIS impact on the application of the Dublin Regulation.\n\n As regards refusals of a \u2018take charge\u2019 request, some requested Member States considered the VIS hit not enough \nproof of entry into the territory, particularly if the visa had expired, or also required submission of a passport with an \nentry stamp. They also considered the VIS hit to be insufficient proof in cases where the visa had expired no more \nthan six months before the application for asylum was made.\n\n 3.2.5 Use of the data for examining the application for asylum\n\n\n\n Article 22 of the VIS Regulation provides that the competent asylum authorities may search in the VIS for the \npurposes of examining an application for international protection.\n\n 74\n\n Figure 11. Monthly usage (by Member State) of VIS for the purposes of examining an asylum application. Source: \neu-LISA\n\n 69\n\n The eu-LISA statistics (see Figure 11 above) indicate that in total approximately 1.4 million VIS searches were \ncarried out for this purpose by 16 Schengen Member States between October 2011 and November 2015. Total \nmonthly VIS searches for this purpose increased from 284 in October 2011 to 121 151 in October 2015 and 109 \n459 in November 2015.\n\n The vast majority of the searches under Article 22 of the VIS Regulation were carried out by only four Member \nStates, which made 551 830, 477 068, 118 408 and 104 136 searches respectively.\n\n Four Member States used VIS data for this purpose only in sporadic cases, i.e. for 138, 39, 9, and 2 cases \nrespectively.\n\n According to the figures submitted by the responding Member States, which do not always match the eu-LISA \nstatistics, seven Member States have given their competent asylum authorities access to search the VIS using an \napplicant\u2019s fingerprints for the purposes of examining the asylum application, and one Member State allows \nsearches with alphanumeric data only. In one Member State all of the authorities\u2019 officials have access to the VIS \nfor this purpose; in one other Member State access is only granted to certain categories of officials.\n\n Member States\u2019 experience confirms the utility of VIS data for examining an application for international protection, \nin particular for assessing applicants\u2019 credibility (taking into account other information), for identifying applicants \nwho have few or no travel or identity documents, and for identifying the applicant\u2019s country of origin. In two Member \nStates, the VIS was checked when examining 99 % and 94 % of all applications.\n\n 3.3 Retention period, amendment and deletion of data\n\n Under Article 23 of the VIS Regulation, each application file should be stored in the VIS for a maximum of five \nyears, without affecting the deletion provisions in Articles 24 and 25 or record keeping as referred to in Article 34. \nThe VIS became operational on 11 October 2011 and thus the end of the retention period will start applying as of \n11 October 2016. It is therefore not possible, at the time of this evaluation, to assess whether the retention period \nhas been properly applied. No statistics are available on this topic.\n\n As regards the amendment of data, as provided for in Article 24 of the VIS Regulation, eu-LISA reporting shows \nthat the \u2018update application\u2019 operation is used to delete individual data (in order to correct the application data) and \nto make other small data corrections. Often Member States use the operation \u2018update application\u2019 to insert data to \ncomplete the uploading of the application. From a technical point of view, it is therefore not possible to distinguish \nwhether the \u2018update application\u2019 operation is used to insert new data (the practice referred to) or merely to correct \ndata already inserted. To cover those cases, the creation of another operation (CorrectApplication) could be \nproposed.\n\n 70\n\n\n\n An overview of data modification after issuing the visa between the VIS\u2019 entry into operations in October 2011 and \nNovember 2015 is presented in Figure 12 below. The general trend shows a net decrease over time of the \u2018update\u2019 \napplication (from almost 40 % at the launch of the system in October 2011 to 3 % in November 2015), and of the \n\u2018biometric\u2019 deletion of data (which fell from 2 % to 0 % in a matter of few months following the launch of the \nsystem).\n\n VIS application modifications performed after issuing the visa\n\n Month\n\n Applications\n\n Application UPDATE\n\n UPDATE %\n\n Application DELETE\n\n Biometric DELETE\n\n Bio.

VIS application modifications performed after issuing the visa\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Most Member States provided no information as regards data deleted or amended. The few that did so (5 out of 19 \nMember States) noted that incorrect data is usually corrected. In such cases, the procedure is that the Member \nState that finds the incorrect data sends a VIS Mail message to the visa authority of the Member State responsible, \nasking it to correct the data in the VIS. If a consulate/embassy receives such a request, it will send it to the national \ncompetent authority to check and if necessary to correct or delete the data. If visa data entered by another Member \nState is incorrect or breaches the VIS Regulation, that Member State is informed through a VIS Mail message.\n\n Very few cases of data deletion under Article 25 of the VIS Regulation (Advance data deletion) have been recorded \nto date (as shown by the eu-LISA statistics above) and they are normally situations where a person obtains \ncitizenship. However, although incorrect, one Member State also reported the practice of deleting a visa application \nand creating a new one if an error is found.\n\n Another practice identified, when the wrong dossier is selected in the VIS, is to cancel the electronic application \nand enter a new one in the system. In such cases, there is no need for any kind of correction or deletion of data in \nthe VIS.\n\n 3.4 VIS operation and responsibilities\n\n 3.4.1 State of play of the VIS roll-out\n\n\n\n The Commission took the decision to launch the VIS in accordance with the legal basis, when the conditions under \nArticle 48(1) (a), (b) and (c) were met, i.e. once:\n\n \u2022 the implementation of the central VIS, national interfaces and the communication infrastructure between them \nwas finalised, according to Article 45(2);\n\n \u2022 comprehensive testing of the VIS had been carried out; and\n\n \u2022 Member States validated the technical arrangements and notified them to the Commission.\n\n 72\n\n Consequently, Commission Implementing Decision 2011/636/EU set the date of 11 October 2011 as the date on \nwhich the VIS would start operations.\n\n The VIS was deployed region by region, until all Schengen countries\u2019 consulates across the world were connected. \nThe Commission decisions on the sequence of the VIS\u2019 geographical roll were adopted based on criteria set out in \nthe VIS Regulation (risk of irregular immigration, threats to the internal security of Schengen countries, technical \nfeasibility of collecting biometrics). There were three decisions that addressed this:\n\n 1) Commission Decision 2010/49/EC of 30 November 2009 determining the first three regions for the start of \noperations of the Visa Information System (North Africa, and most of the Middle East);\n\n 2) Commission implementing Decision 2012/274/EU of 24 April 2012 determining the second set of regions for the \nstart of operations of the VIS (eight regions in Africa, the Americas, Central and South-East Asia, the Caribbean \nand Australasia); and\n\n 3) Commission implementing Decision 2013/493/EU of 30 September 2013 determining the third and last set of \n(12) regions for the start of operations of the VIS (the Eastern Partnership countries, Russia, China/Japan and \nneighbouring countries, India/Pakistan and neighbouring countries, the European \u2018microstates\u2019, the UK/Ireland, the \nother EU Member States).\n\n The Commission then adopted implementing decisions to determine the date from which the VIS was to start \noperations in each of the regions set out in the Decisions listed above. It adopted 15 such decisions between \nSeptember 2011 and February 2016 (these are listed in Annex 6).\n\n The start of operations meant that consulates started collecting fingerprints and digital photos from visa applicants \nand that the applicants\u2019 data were stored in the VIS. Once in the system, the data can be consulted by all visa-\nissuing authorities of the Schengen Member States, and is counter-checked by border authorities when a visa \nholder enters the Schengen area.\n\n The global roll-out was initially scheduled to last three years from the launch of the VIS (by October 2014), but was \ndelayed until the end of November 2015. Schengen Border Crossing Points (SBCPs) were defined in the first roll-\nout Decision as a separate region for the VIS roll-out, to make it possible to use the VIS to issue visas at borders, \nbut it was decided to first roll out to the regions covered by the second and third Decisions and to leave SBCPs for \nlast. The technical preparations that Member States had to carry out as a prerequisite to the VIS roll-out in the \nSBCPs meant that it was only possible to roll out in this region on 29 February 2016.\n\n\n\n Schengen countries have had the possibility to start using the VIS, with or without collecting visa applicants\u2019 \nfingerprints, ahead of the general roll-out, provided they notified the Commission first. Nineteen Member States \nused this possibility in various locations, two used it for all their consulates worldwide since October 2011, and \ntwelve Member States used it for\n\n 73\n\n the SBCPs. The Member States who chose to roll out the VIS ahead of its general deployment did so without \ncollecting fingerprints, in order to maintain the coordinated character of the roll-out and to avoid creating an uneven \nplaying field between consulates present in a certain location.\n\n Member States encountered no major problems since the VIS entered into operations. Most reported issues were \nof limited severity and related to the quality of biometrics, in particular in certain regions at the beginning of the roll-\nout, where climatic conditions lead to poor fingerprint quality. During the roll-out (when visa stickers were marked \nas \u2018VIS 0\u2019 and \u2018VIS\u2019), some visa stickers were issued with a \u2018VIS\u2019 mark even though fingerprints were not collected.\n\n 3.4.2 Operational management of the VIS\n\n From the first stages of planning in 2004, the Commission took responsibility for the development and entire \nimplementation process of the VIS. The operational management of the VIS was delegated to the French \nAdministration (C.SIS) for the first year of operation (between going live on 11 October 2011 and 30 November \n2012), based on a contract of services. On 1 December 2012, eu-LISA (\u2018also the Agency\u2019) started operations and \ntook over the operational management of the VIS, in line with the VIS Regulation.\n\n Supervision activities taken over by the sTESTA87 network include: the review of operational and project reports; \nverifying the reports\u2019 correlation with the eu-LISA\u2019s records and investigating discrepancies; and participation in \nregular operational meetings with the network provider, Orange Business Services (OBS). The Eu-LISA took over \ncoordination from the Commission and restructured communication between sTESTA and Member States so that it \nis always involved in communication between them if any part of the VIS site is affected. On eu-LISA\u2019s side, \nsupervision and coordination activities are carried out by the Network Infrastructure Sector. The security officer in \ncharge of the sTESTA network is involved in: the change management process, where eu-LISA reviews and \napproves all change requests that might affect the security of the sTESTA infrastructure; the review of monthly \nsecurity reports; approval of the generation of smart cards used for the TAPs and related administrative tasks; the \nbiweekly DG HOME SOC88 operations meetings.\n\n The eu-LISA develops and implements comprehensive governance and operational frameworks based on best \npractice and current industry standards. It ensures efficient and cost-effective system management by continuously \nmonitoring and developing operational processes. It is gradually applying IT service management based on ITIL \nbest practice. The\n\n 87 The sTESTA network service \u2014 i.e. the secured Trans-European Services for Telematics between \nAdministrations \u2014 is a European network for exchanging data between various public administrations. The network \nuses internet protocols to ensure universal reach, but is operated separately from the internet. It provides \nguaranteed performance and high levels of security and has connections with all EU institutions and national \nnetworks.\n\n 88 Service Operation Centre.\n\n 74\n\n\n\n following ITSM processes have already been defined and put into practice: the incident management process, \nproblem management process, request fulfilment management process, access management process, change \nmanagement process, configuration management process, release and deployment management process, test \nmanagement process, service-level management process, and service catalogue management process. The VIS is \ncontinuously monitored and a technical team is on-site 24/7.\n\n eu-LISA has increased the capacity and performance of the VIS by implementing infrastructure- and software-\nfocused improvements in the VIS and the BMS89. Projects finalised include new flow control measures at VIS level, \nthe VIS middleware, server and database upgrades, and introduction of a more modern and efficient alphanumeric \nsearch engine. eu-LISA is now developing a new test environment, exploiting the benefits of virtualisation and \nexamining possibilities related to an active-active central unit to backup central unit (CU-BCU) connection.\n\n eu-LISA staff are bound by the obligation of confidentiality under the Staff Regulation, internal security rules and \nindividual responsibilities included in their security clearance briefing. sTESTA staff are bound by the obligation to \nhold valid security clearance (SOC staff and field engineers) and the related obligation of confidentiality. A \nbackground screening is carried out for each staff member, and a confidentiality clause is included as a contractual \nobligation.\n\n The evaluation carried out by the Commission in 201590 concluded that the eu-LISA had overall achieved its \nobjective of effectively ensuring the operational management of the three IT systems entrusted to it.91 The \nevaluation found that eu-LISA successfully fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it in its establishing Regulation and under \nthe service-level agreements (SLAs) in place. It correctly developed the systems, and met the requirements \nstemming from security, data protection and industry best practices. It also put in place the resources and \norganisational framework needed to cope with tasks related to the development of the systems under its \nresponsibility (ITILv3, Prince2, ISO2700x).\n\n Nevertheless, the evaluation also identified areas for improvement, the most important of which are discussed \nbelow:\n\n \u2212 Although eu-LISA made commendable progress on implementing ITILv3 best practices, there is still work to be \ndone. For instance, the evaluation identified the need to strengthen the monitoring of implemented IT process \nperformance and to extend the scope of performance indicators, which are currently limited to business \nperformance.\n\n 89 Biometric Matching System, a component of the VIS specialised in fingerprint-based services such as \nauthentication, identification and quality assessment.\n\n 90 Independent external evaluation of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT \nsystems in the area of freedom, security and justice - eu-LISA Final Evaluation Report, PDF/Volume_01, catalogue \nnumber DR-01-16-464-EN-N, ISBN 978-92-79-58236-3, doi 10.2837/76935.\n\n 91 The VIS, the SIS II and EURODAC.\n\n 75\n\n \u2212 There is a risk to business continuity, linked to the absence of a unique and transversal Disaster Recovery Plan \nand Business Continuity Plan covering all three systems (e.g. for staff, facilities, resources, etc.). This should be \naddressed.\n\n\n\n \u2212 On capacity management, the evaluation identified a need (e.g. VIS Evolution Case Study) for eu-LISA to put in \nplace a review process that would make it possible to regularly review system capacity needs with Member States. \nThis should be based on the statistics generated from the systems and a prospective exercise.\n\n \u2212 On IT security, the evaluation identified a need to hire a cross-functional architecture management person, to be \nin charge of validating infrastructure choices, selecting the application technology and implementation at a \ntransversal level, across systems.\n\n \u2212 On data protection, the evaluation identified a need to ensure that appropriate data protection clauses are \nincluded in agreements with external contractors. Moreover, it identified existing concerns about the production of \ndata quality and data analysis reports. The extent to which eu-LISA can access the databases to produce these \nreports is unclear since the current legal framework does not provide for an explicit mandate, especially regarding \ndata analysis reports (i.e. reports analysing data added to the systems by Member States). There is a need to \nfurther clarify this issue in a future update to or reform of the current legal framework.\n\n In its meeting of 15-16 March 2016, the eu-LISA\u2019s Management Board took due note of these recommendations \nand committed to adopting an action plan to address them by March 2017.\n\n 3.4.3 Use of the VIS for consultation and requests for documents (VISION, VIS Mail 2)\n\n The VIS Mail Communication Mechanism (\u2018VIS Mail Mechanism\u2019) is based on Article 16 of the VIS Regulation, and \naims to provide a standard way of exchanging business and administrative messages via the VIS. Personal data \nsent via this mechanism must be used solely for the consultation of central visa authorities and consular \ncooperation.\n\n Since the VIS started operations, VIS Mail 1 has been available for sending information related to consular \ncooperation, requests for supporting documents, and advance data deletion.\n\n Since 20 January 2016, VIS Mail 2 has replaced the Schengen Consultation Network as per Article 46 of the VIS \nRegulation (and as agreed by the Visa/VISION92 Working Party in May 2015). From this date onwards, all new \nrequests have been sent via the VIS infrastructure using the VIS Mail Mechanism.\n\n VIS Mail 2 is used for consultations and to send information between Member States, based on Articles 8, 22, and \n31 of the Visa Code. A Member State is able to send a message with a VIS application number and indicate the \nMember State to which the message is addressed. The recipient Member State(s) can send its (their) response via \nthe VIS Mail Mechanism\n\n 92 Reference: 9074/15 VISA 194 SIRIS 38 COMIX 236.\n\n 76\n\n quoting the same VIS application number. All data related to the applicant concerned is then available in the VIS.\n\n In October 2015, OBS handed over the VIS Mail infrastructure to eu-LISA, and it has since been responsible for \nthe operational management of VIS Mail exchanges, its network infrastructure, and the provision of VIS Mail \nstatistics.\n\n\n\n eu-LISA identified a need for close coordination, proper communication, alignment and close follow-up of actions \nin order to ensure a successful transition. It set up the Transition Board, an informal group managing all preparatory \nactions, risks, prerequisites and procedures for the transition from VISION to VIS Mail 2. In cooperation with \nMember States, eu-LISA also drafted Transition Guidelines.\n\n In order to facilitate Member States\u2019 preparations, eu-LISA also updated the VIS Mail Operational Guide and the \nVIS Mail global campaign \u2018test design description\u2019 document. The global testing phase lasted from September 2015 \nuntil mid-December 2015. At the end of this phase, all Member States formally declared their readiness to comply \nwith the Council\u2019s conclusions.\n\n eu-LISA reported that usage of VIS Mail 1 has been limited. This could be explained by technical reasons, Member \nState(s) not meeting specifications, or the system\u2019s limited business coverage and thus limited interest for end-\nusers.\n\n As identified by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and indicated in the Commission\u2019s implementing \ndecision adopting VIS Mail specifications, the VIS itself could be used for the direct exchange of well-structured \nmessages, instead of relying on a separate VIS Mail Mechanism based on SMTP. Compared to using SMTP, this \napproach would be more reliable and would be implemented using the same logic as for already existing exchange \nmechanisms used by Member States cooperating through the VIS. If this option is legally endorsed, eu-LISA could \ninclude it in a future VIS release.\n\n 3.4.4 Communication infrastructure\n\n The Commission\u2019s work relating to the communication infrastructure between the central system and national \ninterfaces started with the preparation and publication of tendering specifications for the sTESTA framework \ncontract. After this contract was signed in September 2006, DG HOME signed a specific contract for the VIS on 18 \nDecember 2007. The network components were subsequently implemented in each Member State and in the \ncentral domain, both on the main and the backup sites. Since the VIS started operations in 2011, the contract \nincludes operations and monitoring activities related to the VIS network.\n\n The 2008-2010 budget for developing the communication infrastructure rose to slightly above EUR 20 million, and \nthe annual operational budgetary ranges varied slightly between 2011\n\n 77\n\n and 2015, around EUR 8.5-8.7 million. This is for the 26 Member States connected to the VIS and the 493 \npreparing to connect.\n\n After a new framework contract was signed with T-Systems in 2013, a new contract with OBS was negotiated and \nsigned in August 2014, and is still in force.\n\n The contracts are for the delivery, monitoring and maintenance of one local national interface (referred to as LNI, \nterminal access point or network access point) for each Member State that connects with the secure communication \nnetwork. The local national interface contains the encryption devices dedicated to the VIS.\n\n The contracts also allow for the delivery, monitoring and maintenance of an optional backup local national interface \n(\u2018BLNI\u2019) which has the same contents and function as an LNI. A BLNI connects the backup national system to the \nVIS on other premises of the national authority in charge of the national system, generally located in another area of \nthe city or in another city.\n\n\n\n The specific configuration of the LNI and BLNI, e.g. the bandwidth, precise physical location, etc., are agreed with \neach individual Member State.\n\n The network services are specifically delivered for the VIS, as the VIS network remains separated from any other \nnetwork at central level \u2014 this could change in the future for reasons of cost-effectiveness. Hence, Member States \ncan use the LNI and BLNI exclusively for the purposes laid down in the EU legislation applicable to the VIS.\n\n The contractual agreements applicable to the VIS provide for an encrypted, virtual, private network dedicated to \nVIS data exchange between Member States as well as between Member States and eu-LISA, which is responsible \nfor the operational management of the VIS.\n\n Under EU legislation related to the VIS, the VIS architecture makes use of centralised services, which are \naccessible from the different Member States. For resiliency purposes, these centralised services are duplicated in \ntwo locations namely Strasbourg, France, which hosts the principal central unit and St Johann im Pongau, Austria, \nwhich hosts the backup central unit. Note that, for reliability and cost-efficiency purposes, the distinction between \nthe central- and the backup unit may be lifted in the future.\n\n The principal and backup central units are accessible from the different Member States via the LNI and BLNI, \nwhich connect national systems to the VIS. Each central unit can be accessed by either the LNI or the BLNI.\n\n The connection between the principal and the backup central unit makes it possible to continuously synchronise \nthem, so that if there is a switch-over or failover, Member States\n\n 93 Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus, although not yet full Schengen members (i.e. their VIS sites are not yet \nlive), have already had their sites ready so that they can test their applications in view of future use.\n\n 78\n\n can still work on an up-to-date alternate unit. There is currently nothing to stop this connection being used for new \narchitecture and technology in the future.\n\n As visa-issuing and border-check activities vary from one Member States to another, the bandwidth needed for the \nLNI and the optional BLNI is specific to each of them. The communication infrastructure offers site connection \nbandwidths adapted to the expected traffic load, and has increased the bandwidth in some cases as a result of \ncapacity management observations.\n\n The network guarantees sufficient minimum upload and download speeds for each connection and supports the \ntotal bandwidth size of the network access points. eu-LISA assesses the monthly reports, which include information \non line utilisation (to assess whether there may be issues of capacity bandwidth or peaks), round trip delay \n(maximum and 95 %), and packet loss (average and 95 %). These metrics help assess the needed bandwidth in \ncoordination with the Member States.\n\n IPv4 Layer 3 connectivity is provided without any traffic filtering so anything that uses IPs may pass through the \nnetwork filters (applied by eu-LISA at central level). Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, NTP, SMTP94 are supported. \nOnly the SAN95 replication protocols that are IP-oriented and capable of operating over WAN networks are \nsupported. Proprietary java-to-java connection protocols of BEA WebLogic work if they are used over TCP/IP.\n\n\n\n All IP addresses used on the sTESTA network are dedicated to this network and for VIS purposes only. Each \nMember State\u2019s LNI or BLNI uses unique allocated subnet for production and pre-production and dedicated subnet \nfor VIS Mail traffic (production and pre-production).\n\n Up to now, no Member State has requested IPv6. However, the network access points and backbone are IPv6 \ncompliant. If such a request is made, a study and testing would need to be carried out first.\n\n Some Members States are able to fully utilise the provided bandwidth for brief moments of time only. CU and BCU \nare not the bottlenecks, however. It is the connectivity with Member States that briefly saturates during peak times. \nThis only happened in 2015 and, after the eu-LISA assessed the situation, new bandwidth was ordered for some \nsites.\n\n The communication infrastructure complies with the minimum set of technical specifications set out in the Annex to \nDecision 2008/602/EC of 17 June 2008. The contract is governed by a service-level agreement which determines \navailability, thresholds for round trip delay (both maximum and 95 %, measured both towards CU and BCU), and \npacket loss (both average and 95 %, measured both towards CU and BCU). These measurements result in a \nweighted value. Penalties are applied if the value falls under the threshold.\n\n 94 Hypertext transfer protocol, file transfer protocol, network time protocol, simple mail transfer protocol.\n\n 95 Storage area network.\n\n 79\n\n The maximum transit delay or round trip delay is contractually defined as 200 miliseconds (ms) for production and \nthe same for pre-production. The 95 % network round trip delay is calculated based on real usage; on the \nproduction network, it is below 150 ms for all Members States except Malta, which is slightly above at 153 ms. \nHowever, the actual measured values remain well below this threshold (lately below 100 ms) . The threshold \ncontractually defined for 95 % network packet loss is at the level of 0.01 % (10-4) and average network packet loss \nat the level of 0.005 %. Each access point has its own specific value and each is measured and reported on \nseparately.\n\n There are two paths between the CU and the BCU; one is over EuroDomain and one is over a dedicated point-to-\npoint connection. The contractual 95% network round trip delay threshold for the path over EuroDomain is 48 ms for \nproduction. The 95 % network round trip delay threshold for the path over point-to-point is 14 ms for production. In \n2015, the average maximum round trip delay was around 14 ms and the average 95 % round trip delay was 11.5 \nms, which is far better than the target.\n\n The communication infrastructure offers high availability. The backbone is fully resilient; there are multiple paths \nbetween the points of presence (POPs) and also between countries. There are always two customer edge routers \nin each terminal access point (TAP) connected to two different provider edge (PE) routers. Each of the PE router is \nlocated in different POPs, which are physically in different locations. If possible, dual entrance to the building is \nused, along with different connections to the building and different cable tracing inside it. On the production branch \nof the TAP there is level 1 resiliency and all critical devices (crypto devices, firewalls and switches) are in resilient \nsetup on production. All generic services are operated by eu-LISA and located in the CU/BCU, except for the NTP \nservice, which is located in Brussels on the contractor\u2019s premises. The connection between the LNI and the BLNI \nfalls under the responsibility of the Member States. The contractor provides one of the failover mechanisms to \nswitch between the LNI and BLNI, and this is usually operated manually by Member States.\n\n\n\n sTESTA monitoring relies on a Service Operation Centre located in Bratislava. Specific monitoring tools are \navailable to eu-LISA for the operational management of the Central VIS (CS-VIS). This makes it possible to \nanalyse incidents quickly, and to quickly assess whether or not the issue lies at network level between the CS-VIS \nand the LNIs.\n\n Generic services are also offered through, for example, mail relay and NTP. The mail relay protocol is used by VIS \nMail and the NTP protocol allows Member States to synchronise their time on the central server.\n\n Contracts include an SLA which is based on the 99.99 % availability for production sites. Penalties are applied \nwhenever availability drops, up to the full monthly cost of running each site.\n\n 80\n\n In terms of security services, no VIS-related information circulates on the communication infrastructure without \nencryption. The VIS network is ensured by a virtual private network managed by the network provider. SINA \nencryption boxes are remotely administered and monitored. 3DES 128 bits and AES 192 bits are used on \nencryptors. In order to guarantee that no one, not even the network provider, can have access to the information \nexchanged on the network, a supplementary level of encryption will be added to the currently existing VPN. \nEncryption and decryption will be ensured by crypto boxes located in the terminal access points, and their key will \nbe under the eu-LISA responsibility. This is planned to take place once the migration to TESTA-ng is completed.\n\n All infrastructure under the responsibility of the Commission and eu-LISA is monitored and if there is a threat the \nsecurity level is raised either automatically or manually. It could be escalated to a \u2018security incident\u2019, and these are \nreported on weekly and monthly. If there is a critical incident, a full incident report should be prepared.\n\n A redundant helpdesk and support structure is established by the network provider. It remains in permanent \ncontact with eu-LISA. eu-LISA also has some of the network provider's monitoring tools in its premises.\n\n The EuroDomain network infrastructure is dedicated and is separated from other networks by an air gap. In \ncommon interconnection points like SOCs and on the Brussels premises, the communities are separated by \nfirewalls and encryptors. At the backbone level, each community has its own IP VPN. This prevents data from \nleaking into other systems or networks. However, Members States are responsible for their part of the network and \nCommission and eu-LISA cannot ensure that Members States' networks do not interconnect.\n\n 3.4.5 Relationship between the VIS and national systems\n\n Under Article 28 of the VIS Regulation, how national authorities provide access to the VIS varies based on their \ninternal organisation. Member States can decide on this themselves.\n\n A consolidated list of national authorities was first published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 17 \nMarch 201296, with two subsequent updated consolidated lists published in April 201497 and May 2016,98 \nrespectively.\n\n The management and arrangements for VIS access of duly authorised staff of the competent national authorities \nalso depend on Member States\u2019 internal organisation.\n\n In general, a system of role-based individual access is set up by the national authorities and formal authorisation is \nneeded in order to grant such access. A personal account or individual certificate to log into the VIS is provided, \nwhen necessary and in accordance with the relevant legislation.\n\n 96 OJ 2012/ C 79/04.\n\n\n\n 97 OJ 2014/C 106/04.\n\n 98 OJ 2016/C 187/04.\n\n 81\n\n Duly authorised staff may only consult the VIS when they need to do so in order to carry out their work. Member \nStates report that they usually provide access to specific staff members of consulates, national authorities, asylum \nauthorities and law enforcement authorities (\u2018LEAs\u2019). One Member State reported that its procedure for granting \naccess is controlled by its cybersecurity department.\n\n 3.4.6 Technical incidents caused by the VIS or national systems\n\n Incidents resulting in long response times or downtime have been experienced by 9 Member States (out of the \nresponding 19). These happened both in national and central parts of the VIS.\n\n In these cases, applications could not be registered in the VIS or the VIS did not reply to requests sent by the \nnational system. However, such incidents were only sporadic.\n\n The way in which technical incidents are handled varies between Member States. Two Member States reported \nhaving developed a specific functionality in its national system to register failed applications at a later time (i.e. data \nqueuing). Usually, a single point of contact (SPoC) is set up in each Member State according to eu-LISA's VIS \nOperational Manual. The single point of contact is available to monitor the functioning of the national system and to \nliaise with the Agency\u2019s central helpdesk in case of an incident at national or central level. An escalation procedure \nis activated if necessary.\n\n 10 Member States reported having an emergency plan in place for situations where it is impossible for users to \nsearch in the SIS II due to a problem with a national system or network inaccessibility. 4 Member States reported \nhaving no such plan and 5 Member States did not reply. Although this is not directly related to the VIS, it impacts \nvisa-related activities.\n\n The Agency\u2019s annual survey measured customer99 satisfaction with how incidents were managed and their \nfollow-up.\n\n 99 In this context, the \u2018customer\u2019 is SPoC technical staff in contact with the Agency for supervision and incident \nmanagement.\n\n Numeric values range:\n\n 1 (minimum, very dissatisfied)\n\n 5 (maximum, very satisfied)\n\n 82\n\n Figure 13. Overall level of customer satisfaction based on the answers provided by Member States.\n\n\n\n The responses showed that the Agency is meeting customer expectations and properly addressing the areas of \nimprovement identified in the preceding reports. Please see in Figure 13 and 14 the main results of the report \nissued in 2015 and covering 2014.100\n\n Figure 14. Overall level of customer satisfaction based on the answers provided by 17 Member States\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Some observations about Member States\u2019 satisfaction with VIS services can be made based on the Agency\u2019s \nannual survey, as follows:\n\n 1. 88.25 % of Member States indicated that they are satisfied or very satisfied with the services received.\n\n 2. The score given to the Service Manager Tool (SM7) is the survey\u2019s lowest score and shows that Member States \nare insufficiently satisfied with it.\n\n 3. The VIS areas that need improvement are:\n\n \u2022 the overall SPoC experience;\n\n \u2022 the completeness of the information provided when closing an interaction;\n\n \u2022 the Service Manager Tool and User Guide.\n\n 4. Member States are especially satisfied with the available technical documentation, which they consider \nsufficient and clear.\n\n 5. Other comments received concern various aspects of the VIS, for example:\n\n \u2022 Member States\u2019 requests not being properly understood by the helpdesk, and responses received not being \nrelated to the question asked;\n\n \u2022 occasional misunderstandings when sharing information.\n\n 100 Document 2015-110, Customer Satisfaction Survey \u2014 eu-LISA 2014 services.\n\n 83\n\n The following recommendations can be made for the VIS services:\n\n \u2022 improve the Service Manager Tool to meet customer expectations\n\n \u2022 put in place mechanisms to ensure the quality of answers provided in the interactions, in terms of completeness, \nrelevance and clarity.\n\n 3.4.7 Training activities for authorised staff\n\n\n\n Member States provided information on training activities for staff authorised to process data stored in the VIS and \nfor staff of the national authorities that have access to the VIS.\n\n Some Member States train staff before they start working with the VIS, and some provide annual training. Others \ntrained their staff only with the roll-out of the VIS. All training courses addressed software functionality, security and \nauthorisation issues, as well as data protection and security.\n\n In some Member States, staff members have access to e-learning education, handbooks and routines on the \nintranet; these also address security and authorisation issues and data protection.\n\n One Member State reported that the following subjects were also covered by the training:\n\n \u2022 detection and prevention of trafficking in human beings, and illegal immigration as an integral part of the \ninvestigation procedure for visa applications;\n\n \u2022 specificities related to the \u2018EU nationals and their family members\u2019 category;\n\n \u2022 issues relating to the fundamental rights of the applicants.\n\n The Commission\u2019s evaluation of the Agency, carried out in 2015, concluded that since its establishment the \nAgency has made commendable efforts to develop robust training activities in line with the needs of national \nauthorities, both technical and practical. The training strategy is further developed annually, via the National Contact \nPoints.\n\n The evaluation also found that further alignment with technical needs was necessary, particularly in terms of \nimproving training courses\u2019 technical content. This gap in technical content could have been caused by \nstakeholders\u2019 passive participation in the development of the training strategy, despite the Agency\u2019s efforts to keep \nthem engaged (e.g. the Advisory Group and NCP members).\n\n 3.4.8 Responsibility for using data and keeping it in national files\n\n Most responding Member States never keep data retrieved from the VIS in national files. One responding Member \nState stated that only technical logs, not data, are kept in national files, for an average duration of one year (see \nsection on Keeping of records below). One Member State reported that the data page summarising the applicant\u2019s \nbasic information is kept in the national file (entry/exit date, decision) when the applicant lodges an application with \nthis Member State. However, this falls outside the remit of this topic, which concerns only the\n\n 84\n\n retention at national level of information taken from the VIS and not retention of information collected during the \nvisa application process, which naturally remains under national ownership. 4 Member States did not reply.\n\n Incidents related to non-compliance with provisions related to keeping data in national files under Article 30(1) of \nthe VIS Regulation\n\n No specific information was provided by Member States on any incidents related to non-compliance with provisions \nrelated to keeping data in national files under Article 30(1) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n\n\n No incident of unauthorised access to VIS data was reported.\n\n 3.4.9 Member States\u2019 liability towards the VIS\n\n 17 Member States stated that they have never failed to comply with their obligations and thus caused damage to \nthe VIS. 2 Member States did not reply. The Agency confirmed that it is not aware of any such cases.\n\n Consequently, no Member State reported having claimed for compensation against another Member State\u2019s failure \nto comply with its obligations and thus causing damage to the VIS.\n\n 3.4.10 Keeping of records\n\n Information recorded when a data processing operation is carried out within the VIS (logging) varies depending on \nthe Member State.\n\n 11 Member States reported that they collect and keep records of authorised staff members entering data into the \nVIS. 2 Member States did not specify and 6 did not reply. It is therefore difficult to assess the extent of Member \nStates\u2019 compliance with their obligation to keep records of all data processing operations within the VIS under \nArticle 34 of the VIS Regulation.\n\n All responding Member States confirmed that they keep a record of all transactions and their details, notably the \nvisa application number and visa sticker number (when available), search criteria, etc.\n\n Legal provisions require that the records collected both at central and at national level must show the purpose of \naccess, the date and time, the type of data sent, the type of data used for interrogation, and the name of the staff \nmember entering or retrieving the data.\n\n At central level, it is only possible to access the VIS to consult records for the purpose of data protection, \nmonitoring of the admissibility of data processing (only services fit for purpose are usable by a specific end-user \nprofile), and to ensure data security. These records are protected by access control measures (username, profile \nand password) to prevent unauthorised access and are deleted after one year after the retention period applicable \nto the visa applicant and visa application data.\n\n 85\n\n 3.4.11 Self-monitoring and penalties\n\n The VIS Regulation requires Member States to ensure that each staff member entitled to access VIS data takes \nthe necessary measures to comply with the VIS Regulation and cooperate, where necessary, with the national \nsupervisory authority, i.e. the data protection authority (DPA).\n\n All responding Member States have in place a supervision system for data processing. Access is controlled via \naccess controls (e.g. through individual accounts, accessed with an ID and password, usually accessible only to \nback office national officials based on authorisation principles, i.e. not to local staff) and monitored via logging (i.e. \nevery action is logged so that every file manipulation can be linked to an account).\n\n All responding Member States declared having in place security routines according to which only duly authorised \nstaff members have access to the VIS system/data. Staff access to personal data is restricted, based on access \ncontrol rights. Access to the data is granted only to staff who need it to carry out their tasks. The data are encrypted \n\n\n\nbefore transfer from the consulates to headquarters and back. Security measures are usually set out in the security \ndocumentation which details access, technical and object-oriented security rules.\n\n The answers received show that Member States have put in place routines to make sure that data processing is in \ncompliance with the VIS Regulation and the Visa Code. The law provides for administrative and criminal sanctions \nfor breaches of personal data processing rules. However, there is some uncertainty about the interpretation of the \n\u2018self-monitoring\u2019 provision in the VIS Regulation. The answers provided by some respondents indicate that by self-\nmonitoring they mean the monitoring carried out by DPAs and not by the national authority designated as controller \nunder Article 2(d) of the Data Protection Directive.101\n\n Self-monitoring performed by national authorities since the entry into operation of the VIS shows that obligations \nrelated to authorised access and keeping adequate and accurate information records have been met. No penalties \nhave been reported.\n\n Irregularities most often encountered during monitoring relate to data quality problems, for example when the \ncorrect reasons for exemption from fingerprinting are not consistently specified (either \u2018not legally applicable\u2019 or \u2018not \nfactually applicable\u2019), when several applications of the same applicant are not linked, or when applications are \nlinked erroneously.\n\n Some Member States mentioned that self-monitoring resulted in a series of improvements in national procedures \nand the overall improvement of data quality. Improvements were seen in areas such as: application reviews and \naudits (architecture management board); application monitoring and consistency of workflows; regular network \nsecurity checks; review of\n\n 101 Directive 95/46/EC.\n\n 86\n\n authorities\u2019 and users\u2019 access rights; regular training (Article 28(5) VIS Regulation); and updating of the security \nscreening level.\n\n 3.5 The costs of setting up and operating the VIS\n\n The impact assessment102 for the VIS projected the following costs to set up and run the system:\n\n The following is an overview of the financial costs incurred to set up and run the VIS, including the investment and \noperational costs of the communication infrastructure between the national interface and the national system:\n\n Expenses\n\n VIS setting-up\n\n Expenses 2005-2011 (\u20ac m)\n\n Development contract (without fingerprints)\n\n 39.9\n\n Development contract (fingerprints)\n\n\n\n 37.4\n\n Technical assistance\n\n 9.4\n\n Network infrastructure (including Member State connection)\n\n 46.2\n\n Site preparation\n\n 4.7\n\n Other including security\n\n 13.1\n\n Total\n\n 150.7\n\n The two pie charts below (Figures 15 and 16) indicate the same expenses in both full amounts and as a \npercentage of the total.\n\n 102 Commission Staff Working Document, Annex to the Proposal for a Regulation to the European Parliament and \nto the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on \nshort-stay visas \u2014 COM(2004)835 final.\n\n VIS with biometrics\n\n One-off investment costs (\u20ac m)\n\n Annual operational costs (\u20ac m)\n\n Costs for the Community\n\n 93\n\n 14-16\n\n Costs for the Member States (national systems)\n\n 186\n\n 49\n\n Total costs\n\n\n\n 246-256\n\n 55-57\n\n 87\n\n Figure 15.

VIS expenses in percentages (%)\n\n As to the cost of setting up the national systems, the calculation is more complex because the source of the \nfunding was both national and EU (External Border Fund for the period 2007-2013). The External Border Fund \ncontribution to setting up and run the VIS at national level during the period was about EUR 140 million for the 21 \nMember States that benefited from such funding. However, individual expenditure varies greatly among Member \nStates, from almost EUR 40 million in the case of France (the Member State with the largest consular network) to \naround EUR 10 million for Belgium, Italy or Germany and over EUR 16 million for Switzerland, to less than EUR 1 \nmillion in Slovakia and around EUR 300 000 by Malta and Iceland.\n\n 88\n\n No\n\n Member\n\n State\n\n Total\n\n 2007\n\n 2008\n\n 2009\n\n 2010\n\n 2011\n\n 2012\n\n 2013\n\n 2007-\n\n 2013\n\n 1\n\n AT\n\n\n\n 596\n\n -\n\n 620\n\n 629\n\n 153\n\n 226\n\n -\n\n 2 224\n\n 2\n\n BE\n\n 1 490\n\n 1 088\n\n 1 426\n\n 2 064\n\n 1 609\n\n 1 100\n\n 2 032\n\n 10 809\n\n 3\n\n BG\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 2 907\n\n 464\n\n\n\n 1 127\n\n -\n\n 4 498\n\n 4\n\n CH\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 7 486\n\n 3 707\n\n 5 293\n\n -\n\n 16 486\n\n 5\n\n CZ\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 127\n\n 1 531\n\n 2 434\n\n 363\n\n -\n\n 4 455\n\n 6\n\n CY\n\n\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 219\n\n -\n\n 894\n\n 786\n\n -\n\n 1 899\n\n 7\n\n DE\n\n -\n\n 1 661\n\n 2 806\n\n 1 161\n\n 2 237\n\n 1 592\n\n 1 203\n\n 10 660\n\n 8\n\n DK\n\n 753\n\n 1 134\n\n 1 576\n\n -\n\n 232\n\n\n\n 1 634\n\n -\n\n 5 329\n\n 9\n\n ES\n\n -\n\n 2 568\n\n 741\n\n 1 300\n\n 747\n\n 921\n\n 1 161\n\n 7 438\n\n 10\n\n FI\n\n -\n\n 614\n\n 930\n\n 410\n\n 1 666\n\n 2 215\n\n 1 998\n\n 7 833\n\n 11\n\n FR\n\n\n\n 10 154\n\n 3 758\n\n 2 544\n\n 6 085\n\n 5 380\n\n 2 731\n\n 7 620\n\n 38 272\n\n 12\n\n HU\n\n -\n\n 1 152\n\n 271\n\n 707\n\n 1 854\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 3 984\n\n 13\n\n IT\n\n 1 900\n\n 1 359\n\n 1 399\n\n 1 580\n\n 1 626\n\n\n\n 2 229\n\n -\n\n 10 093\n\n 14\n\n IS\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 89\n\n 134\n\n 65\n\n -\n\n 288\n\n 15\n\n MT\n\n 223\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 128\n\n -\n\n 351\n\n 16\n\n NL\n\n\n\n 96\n\n 502\n\n 2 977\n\n -\n\n 1 758\n\n 840\n\n -\n\n 6 173\n\n 17\n\n NO\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 607\n\n 711\n\n -\n\n 1 146\n\n 2 464\n\n 18\n\n PL\n\n -\n\n 1 681\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 1 681\n\n 19\n\n SE\n\n -\n\n 1 633\n\n -\n\n 455\n\n 205\n\n 222\n\n -\n\n 2 515\n\n 20\n\n SI\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n -\n\n 497\n\n 688\n\n -\n\n 1 185\n\n 21\n\n SK\n\n\n\n 121\n\n 383\n\n -\n\n 117\n\n 178\n\n 128\n\n -\n\n 927\n\n Total\n\n 139 564\n\n Figure 17. Expenses for setting up National VIS (N-VIS)\n\n Source: European Commission, EBF VIS-related expenditure 2007-2013 (in thousands of euros).\n\n The full costs for setting up and running the national visa information system (N-VIS) in each Member State are \nactually higher. Only 8 of the 19 responding Member States could provide any figures (or approximation) regarding \nthese costs. However, they give an idea of the financial requirements.\n\n 1. Sweden estimates that the national VIS-related system had a total cost of EUR 14 m.\n\n 2. For Switzerland, the development costs amounted to EUR 31 m. The operational costs were EUR 12 m, and the \nbiometric enrolment infrastructure and operational costs were EUR 12 m.\n\n 3. For the Netherlands, the investments made by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs were estimated to be around \nEUR 2 m. Operational costs were minimal and shared between the Dutch partners, since all use a centralised point \nof communication with the VIS. No figures are available for other authorities.\n\n 89\n\n 4. For Lithuania, the financial costs incurred by the implementation of the N-VIS development project during the \nperiod 2013-2015 were about EUR 1.2 m.\n\n 5. For Poland, infrastructure costs were EUR 1.7 m. The communication and maintenance costs for the VIS could \nnot be estimated, as the SIS II and the VIS share the same communication infrastructure. The annual cost of the \ncontractor who delivers some extra maintenance services for both SIS II and VIS was EUR 0.4 m.\n\n 6. In Malta, the maintenance costs for the national system were EUR 0.23 m. Other costs related to connectivity. \nHowever, it is difficult to quantify them given that the same connection is used by other services that the embassies \nand consulates provide.\n\n\n\n 7. For Norway, the costs for setting up and running the national system were estimated at approximately EUR 30 \nm.\n\n 8. France estimated direct investment costs to be around EUR 12 m from 2014 to 2018, the year of delivery of the \nfinal release. The peak would be in 2015 and 2016 for major developments for the front and back offices. A \ncontribution of up to EUR 7 m from EU funds has been sought, thus reducing the actual cost for France to EUR 5 \nm.\n\n Figure 18: VIS operating costs (2011-2015)\n\n The VIS was handed over to eu-LISA on 1 December 2012. Applicable as from 2013, the Agency\u2019s budget for Title \n3 (i.e. relating to the system\u2019s operation) is set out in Error! Reference source not found.. For 2011 and 2012, the \nexpenses relate to the operational management entrusted to the French authorities. The increase in appropriations \nover the years relates to necessary investments to adapt the system\u2019s capacity to the gradual roll-out of the VIS. On \nentering into operation, the VIS capacity was 60 000 requests an hour on a database capacity of 40 million \napplications. In the first half of 2016, the system is able to cope with 450 000 requests an hour from a database of \n60 million records. Until further notice, this is sufficient until 2018 for Member State activities related to visa-issuing \nand border checks.\n\n In the same period, the biometric matching system capacity was also significantly increased. This was to cope with \nMember State fingerprint identifications in all consular posts and for\n\n 90\n\n authentications for all border crossing points, in particular following the systematic use of the fingerprint as from \nOctober 2014.\n\n These figures exclude staff, infrastructure and logistics costs applicable for eu-LISA\u2019s seat in Tallinn and the \noperational site in Strasbourg. Although having identified certain possibilities for improvement, the eu-LISA \nevaluation carried out in 2015 concluded that the VIS, as one of the three large-scale IT systems in the Justice and \nHome Affairs area entrusted to eu-LISA, has been operated effectively. The evaluation found that the VIS \ndevelopments have been effectively ensured by the Agency. The evaluation found that 81 % of the VIS Advisory \nGroup members strongly agreed or agreed that continuity and uninterrupted services were available. Although \nsome respondents could not provide their opinion on this matter, there was no perception among the VIS Advisory \nGroup members of any disagreement on continuity and uninterrupted services.\n\n 3.6 Data protection in the visa application procedure related to the VIS\n\n 3.6.1. Right of information\n\n Article 37 of the VIS Regulation requires Member States to inform visa applicants of their rights related to data \nprotection. From the consultation carried out with Member States, it is unclear whether all of them have put in place \nthe necessary measures to ensure that this information is systematically made available to all visa applicants.\n\n Five of the eighteen responding Member States did not provide any input regarding this subject, and one advised \nthat the process is still being implemented.\n\n\n\n Most respondents, however, confirmed that appropriate measures are in place to inform applicants. Various means \nare used to ensure that data subjects are informed of their rights and of the way in which they can request a copy of \ntheir stored personal data. This information is mainly provided in the visa application form, sometimes with an \nadditional cover letter, which needs to be signed before the application is submitted. There are various other \nmeans of providing the information:\n\n \u2022 information fliers, in particular one drafted by the European Commission \u2018Visa Information System (VIS), \nImproving Schengen visa procedures\u2019;\n\n \u2022 information posted on the websites of visa authorities, DPAs, consulate homepages or external service providers; \nand\n\n \u2022 additional information provided by ESPs upon application.\n\n Particular attention seems to be given to informing applicants of their rights concerning their biometric data and the \nrights of access, rectification and erasure related to it.\n\n 91\n\n 3.6.2. Access, rectification and erasure of data\n\n When it comes to requests received from applicants to access their VIS data, most responding Member States \nadvised that they had not received any such request, and one Member State reported that it does not keep account \nof such requests. One Member State received one request (which turned out to be groundless), one received six \nrequests, one received eight requests, and one received 22 requests.\n\n As regards requests to correct VIS data, only one of the responding Member States reported having received two \nsuch requests, while none of the others received any. During the reporting period, only one received a request to \nerase the data.\n\n The procedures in place to request access to data vary, though usually they provide that data subjects can submit \ntheir requests directly to the VIS data controller. National DPAs can also receive such requests and can provide \ninformation on the applicable procedure and contact details of the data controller. Under the responsible authority, \nthe matter is referred to the data protection officer (DPO), who would then directly treat the requests for access, \nrectification or erasure.\n\n As regards the period for answering a request to access or rectify data, all responding Member States declared \nthat they respect the one-month deadline in processing the request (where applicable).\n\n Member State procedures provide that when the right to access data, or to correct or delete such data, is refused \nby the authorities of a Member State, a decision in this respect is to be issued by the competent authority of that \nMember State. Such decisions are subject to an appeal before an administrative court (e.g. Switzerland, Lithuania) \nor else the person has the right to submit a complaint to the data protection authorities (e.g. Poland, Iceland).\n\n\n\n According to the reported information, there has been no situation in Member States during the reporting period in \nwhich a request to correct or delete data was refused and which led to actions or complaints before the national \ncompetent authorities.\n\n As regards information on requests for which another Member State was responsible, most contributing Member \nStates reported that no such requests were received. Only one Member State advised having received one request \nconcerning data for which another Member State was responsible. The request was forwarded to the responsible \nMember State via VIS Mail.\n\n As regards complaints related to personal data recorded in the VIS, two of the responding Member States received \none each and one Member State received 16. None of the others received any such complaints, while one Member \nState advised that it does not keep any record of such complaints.\n\n 92\n\n 3.6.3. Member States cooperation on data protection\n\n As regards cooperation with other Member States to ensure an individual\u2019s right of access, correction and deletion \nof VIS data as provided for under Article 39 of the VIS Regulation, responding Member States reported they do not \nhave any special provisions in law or established practice for this. This is mainly because cases that would require \ncooperation between several Member States do not usually occur in practice.\n\n However, specific international cooperation on these matters is carried out either at the level of local Schengen \ncooperation (i.e. through the consular posts of other Schengen states in a certain location) or of the national data \nprotection supervisors, through the VIS Supervisory Group (SCG VIS) founded on the basis of Article 43 of the VIS \nRegulation \u2014 which meets regularly in Brussels.\n\n 3.6.4. Remedies on data protection\n\n According to Article 40 of the VIS Regulation, data subjects have the right to bring an action or complaint before \nthe competent authorities or courts of a Member State when their right to access VIS data related to them is \nrefused.\n\n As reported under the previous point, there has been no situation in the Member States during the reporting period \nin which a request to correct or delete data was refused. Consequently, to date, no action has been brought before \na competent authority or court on this ground. Therefore, there was no case when Member States should have \nexercised their duties to assist and advise the person concerned in proceedings before a court or competent \nauthority.\n\n 3.6.5. Liability towards individuals\n\n The Commission has received no information and no evidence regarding cases of individuals or Member States \nwho suffered damage as a result of a processing operation incompatible with the VIS Regulation. Nor is it aware of \ncases where a person or Member State has made a complaint claiming damage suffered as a result of a \nprocessing operation incompatible with the VIS Regulation.\n\n 3.6.6. Supervision by the national supervisory authority (DPA) and EDPS\n\n 3.6.6.1 Supervision by the EDPS of the central VIS\n\n\n\n According to Article 41 of the VIS Regulation, the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by Member States \nis monitored by the national data protection authorities (DPAs). The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) \nis responsible for supervising the management authority (eu-LISA), as provided for under Article 42 of the VIS \nRegulation.\n\n The VIS Supervisory Coordination Group (hereafter VIS SCG) was established in order to ensure a coordinated \nsupervision of the VIS and national systems, as provided for under Article 43 of the VIS Regulation. Cooperation \ntakes the form of meetings held on a regular\n\n 93\n\n basis with all DPAs in charge of supervising the VIS at national level and the EDPS, acting together as the VIS \nSCG. The main purpose of these meetings is to discuss common problems related to supervision and to find \ncommon solutions or approaches whenever possible. On average, two meetings are held each year. The \nCommission and eu-LISA are also invited to parts of the meeting to update the group on new developments \nregarding the VIS.\n\n Since the entry into operation of the VIS and until the date of publication of this report, eight supervision \ncoordination meetings have taken place: in November 2012, April and October 2013, May and October 2014, \nMarch and October 2015, and April 2016.\n\n The meeting typically consists of two parts: firstly, the VIS SCG is updated by the European Commission and eu-\nLISA on the status of the VIS roll-out and other developments with a potential data protection impact; and secondly, \nDPAs discuss issues that are in need of checking at national level or new developments of interest for VIS \nsupervisors.\n\n 3.6.6.2 CS-VIS\u2019s compliance with data protection rules\n\n From a data protection perspective, Member States are responsible for personal data in the VIS, while eu-LISA \nacts as a data processor with regard to the central visa information system (CS-VIS). Therefore, there is a sharing \nof tasks: eu-LISA operates the CS-VIS and Member States provide for the NI-VIS. The responsibility of eu-LISA as \nthe management authority for the CS-VIS and data processor is to ensure that the CS-VIS is operated in \naccordance with the requirements, including those related to data protection, of the VIS Regulation. This is in \nparticular as regards the security of the system, the network and the national interfaces, to ensure that only \nauthorised staff have access to data processed in the VIS for the purposes of the performance of tasks specific to \nthis authority. As regards eu-LISA, the protection of personal data related to individuals processed by CS-VIS is \nmonitored by the eu-LISA DPO and supervised by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Member \nStates have the obligation to ensure that personal data are lawfully processed (collected, transmitted to the VIS and \naccessed) and that they are accurate when transmitted to the VIS and kept up to date.\n\n The data protection obligation is central to the system\u2019s risk assessment. VIS data (e.g. the applicant data and \napplication data) and VIS logs (see the section on \u2018Keeping of records\u2019) are rated as the most sensitive assets to be \nprotected, thus covered by all technical and organisational security controls described in the VIS Security Plan. The \nVIS data benefit from the highest level of security controls. The processing of VIS data is limited to what is \nnecessary and proportionate for carrying out the tasks. Personal data of applicants are kept in the VIS for five \nyears. Personal data is never passed to second or third-level support (i.e. never to anyone except eu-LISA staff). \nPersonal data can be provided by Member States as data controllers when and as far as necessary in case of \ntechnical investigations following incidents. To this end, specific protected communication channels and \nprocedures are in place.\n\n\n\n 94\n\n For its part, eu-LISA reported one incident where a Member State did not use the proper channel to communicate \nissues with the VIS. This resulted in emails containing personal data of VIS applicants being delivered to personal \nmailboxes of the operations team and the application team. This incident was reported by security to the eu-LISA \ndata protection officer who contacted the Member State in question and requested the removal of emails with \npersonal data. In mid-2014, a communication was sent to all Member States requesting them to use the proper \nsecure channels to communicate incidents, as per the operator\u2019s manual.\n\n Authorised Agency staff have access to personal data as far as necessary for technical purposes and for the \nfulfilment of an agency\u2019s obligations under Article 50 of the VIS Regulation (i.e. monitoring the functioning of the VIS \nagainst objectives relating to output, cost-effectiveness, security and quality of services).\n\n In its almost three years of operation, eu-LISA has not received any complaint related to data protection.\n\n The EDPS has performed inspections on the spot to monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data. The \nEDPS uses monitoring tools for self-auditing in accordance with Article 34(1) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n As the supervisory authority responsible for ensuring that the personal data processing activities of the visa \ninformation system management authority are carried out in accordance with the VIS Regulation, the EDPS has to \ndate performed two security audits of the VIS central system, as required under Article 42(2) of the VIS Regulation.\n\n The first EDPS audit of the CS-VIS took place in November 2011, when the management authority of the VIS was \nstill the European Commission. In June 2012, the findings were sent to the European Parliament, the Council, the \nEuropean Commission and the national data protection supervisory authorities.\n\n The 2012 audit assessed whether the infrastructure, personnel, organisation and technologies complied with the \nsecurity requirements provided for in the applicable legislation and particularly in Commission Decision 260/2010 on \nthe security plan for the operation of the VIS.\n\n On this occasion, the EDPS found that the absence of a security policy made it impossible to assess the security \nmeasures in place. Instead, the audit\u2019s findings and recommendations were based on the requirements provided for \nin Commission Decision 260/2010 on the security plan for the operation of the VIS and on the assessment of the \nmandatory areas defined in the BSI103 IS methodology (information security quick audit).\n\n In the course of this first audit, the EDPS did not find any critical security weakness that would justify imposing a \ntemporary ban on processing data, under the terms of Article\n\n 103 British Standards Institution.\n\n 95\n\n 47(1)(f) of Regulation 45/2001. However, in order to address the issues identified, the EDPS requested the \nCommission to put in place an implementation plan to address all these recommendations and also to consider the \nadditional actions that could be needed to adapt the current system to the requirements of the security policy (once \nproperly established).\n\n\n\n The EDPS made a series of recommendations, among the most important being the need to put in place a proper \nsecurity policy, to assess and plan the training needs of the operational staff, and to set an adequate business \ncontinuity plan.\n\n The second EDPS audit took place in 2015. It focused on the central VIS database and the biometric matching \nsystem. The fieldwork was carried out on 23-24 September 2015 at the eu-LISA premises in Strasbourg, France, \nand was preceded by a pre-visit documentation review. The report with the EDPS findings and final \nrecommendations was not published by the time of publishing this report and therefore could not be taken into \naccount.\n\n One of the objectives of the September 2015 inspection was to follow up on the 2012 audit. At the time of the \ninspection, 15 of the 24 recommendations made by the EDPS in the 2012 report were considered closed. The \nremaining open recommendations were included in the follow-up to the 2015 inspection.\n\n 3.6.6.3 Supervision by DPAs of the national authorities having access to the VIS\n\n National supervisory authorities (DPAs) monitor by various means the lawfulness of the processing of personal \ndata stored in the VIS at national level. The main and most often used tool is through undertaking an inspection \u2014 \ncovering the VIS and the log-files and activities of the ESPs \u2014 either of the national visa authority or of consulates \nto whom Member States delegate the visa application collection. DPAs also carry out other tasks:\n\n \u2022 giving opinions on new national legal proposals concerning the national visa information system;\n\n \u2022 ruling in cases of dispute concerning the processing of personal data;\n\n \u2022 providing data protection training of the staff responsible in national authorities; and\n\n \u2022 carrying out audits of the national system.\n\n Of the 18 Member States that responded to the Commission consultation on this point, eight reported that an audit \nof the national VIS data processing operations (required every four years on the basis of Article 41(2) of the VIS \nRegulation) had been carried out, four reported that such an audit had not taken place, and six did not provide any \nanswer.\n\n The Joint Activity Report 2012-2014 of the VIS SCG (see above), which summarises the contributions of national \nDPAs, reported that inspections had been carried out in 14 Member\n\n 96\n\n States ,104 and no inspections had been carried out in the reporting period in 11 Member States105 (although \ninvestigations had been carried out on the basis of complaints received). One national DPA (Lithuania) provided no \ninformation on inspections. With four exceptions (several complaints in the Czech Republic and Spain, and one \neach for Poland and Slovenia), no national DPA reported having received complaints from anyone regarding the \ndata processed in the VIS, or the complaints received turned out to be irrelevant from a data protection perspective. \nOne national DPA (Hungary) reported having received an access to data request.\n\n Some inconsistencies are apparent between the information provided by Member States in response to the \nquestionnaire for the VIS evaluation and that provided in the Joint Activity Report. The inconsistencies concern \nwhether an audit took place or not, and as regards the content of that audit. Most national contributions in the Joint \n\n\n\nActivity Report seem to refer to inspections of the consular posts carried out by DPAs, as opposed to audits of the \nnational VIS in the Member State itself. While the latter are relevant for the overall assessment of compliance with \ndata protection rules, they are not equivalent to an audit of the national VIS under the terms of Article 41(2) of the \nVIS Regulation. Only two national DPAs (Netherlands, Portugal) reported that they had carried out such an audit of \nthe national system. The remaining reports referred rather to on-site inspections of consulates in non-EU countries.\n\n To ensure that only authorised users access the VIS and that such access complies with purposes legally provided \nfor, national competent authorities have put in place various measures to grant access, exclusively based on legal \ngrounds. Only authorised personnel have access to the VIS personal data. Various audit and verification measures \nare in place for the individual competent authorities. Risk assessments are in place for personal data processing \noperations. Every account is logged so that every operation can be traced. Technical measures are also in place, \nsuch as encryption of communication lines. Regular audits are carried out and training is provided for the personnel \nresponsible for VIS data processing in the various authorities.\n\n As part of its 2013-2014 work programme, the VIS SCG evaluated the legality of data processing by the national \nauthorities having access to the VIS. In this respect, three questionnaires were circulated within the Group in \nsummer 2014, relating to the following:\n\n 1) authorities having access to the VIS addressed to DPAs;\n\n 2) access to VIS data for the purposes of law enforcement, split into two parts \u2014 one for the central access point(s) \nand one for the DPA; and\n\n 3) how data subjects\u2019 rights are implemented in practice.\n\n 104 Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, \nSlovenia, Sweden, Switzerland.\n\n 105 Austria, Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain.\n\n 97\n\n Although the results of the questionnaires were not public by the time the present staff working document was \nfinalised, the VIS SCG communicated several main conclusions to the Commission. The VIS SCG welcomed the \nprogress achieved so far on issues as important as access to the VIS and data subjects\u2019 rights. It encouraged \nMember States to go further to ensure compliance with the legal framework of the VIS in every detail. In this \nrespect, the report found that there is room for improvement in certain respects.\n\n In particular as regards law enforcement authorities, the group recommended that Member States ensure that \naccess is restricted to the operational units that need to use VIS data under the terms of Article 3(6) of Council \nDecision 2008/633/JHA.\n\n With regard to data subjects\u2019 rights, the VIS SCG monitoring showed that, according to the assessment by Member \nStates, the relevant staff members of the competent authorities dealing with the VIS have a satisfactory level of \nawareness regarding their obligation to safeguard data subjects\u2019 rights. Training covering data subjects\u2019 rights is \nprovided to the relevant staff in some Member States.\n\n The VIS SCG noted the absence or very low number of requests made by data subjects to exercise their rights of \naccess, correction or deletion of their personal data stored in the VIS. The group assumes that the phenomenon is \ndue to data subjects not being aware of their data protection rights, but also to the lack of information about the way \n\n\n\nto exercise them (e.g. to whom data subjects should address their requests). In this sense, the EDPS invited \nnational DPAs to carry out quality controls regarding the information provided to data subjects by diplomatic \nmissions, consular posts and ESPs.\n\n As regards the procedures in place to answer requests by data subjects to access, correct or delete their personal \ndata stored in the system, the group encouraged Member States to better define the expression \u2018without delay\u2019 in \nArticle 38 of the VIS Regulation and to adopt uniform maximum time limits for replying in writing to such requests.\n\n Finally, the VIS SCG found that there was a lack of statistics, in most Member States, on the exercise of data \nsubjects\u2019 rights of access, correction and deletion, and on the cases in which those requests were denied. It invited \nMember States to find a common approach to keep such statistics.\n\n 3.6.7. Data protection supervision of external service providers (ESPs)\n\n The EDPS and national DPAs have taken particular interest in the activities of ESPs. In its Joint Activity Report \n2012-2014, the EDPS refers to a subgroup composed of representatives of the German, Italian, Maltese, Swiss and \nSwedish DPAs. This was set up to explore the data protection implications of the use of ESPs by Member States.\n\n The subgroup presented a first note on the analysis of technical and legal issues related to the use of service \nproviders for the collection of visa applications. The note addresses the relevant legal basis for cooperation with \nESPs, the tasks that can be delegated to an ESP, the minimum\n\n 98\n\n requirements to be included in contracts (see above), supervision by Member States or DPAs of the processing of \npersonal data by ESPs, and the enforcement by Member States of instructions in terms of data protection \ncompliance.\n\n In its conclusions, the note recommends to draw up a model contract to facilitate contractual agreements between \nMember States and ESPs. In the future, the subgroup intends to check these contracts more closely. In parallel, \nnational DPAs plan on looking at how such contracts are being used.\n\n The EDPS looked into how data subjects\u2019 rights are implemented in practice. It analysed extensively the issue of \ndata protection by ESPs. The final results of the EDPS inquiries into data subjects' rights were not available at the \ndate of publication of the present evaluation and could not be taken into account for the present evaluation.\n\n IV. THE APPLICATION OF THE VIS DECISION\n\n 4.1 Access to data by designated law enforcement authorities\n\n Access to the VIS data by law enforcement authorities is recent and very fragmented among the countries using \nthe VIS. Of 26 Member States, eight never accessed the VIS for this purpose and one Member State alone \ngenerated 54 % of all requests. However, the statistics provided by eu-LISA show that the use of VIS for law \nenforcement purposes has recently been increasing. The recent and limited use of the system explains the low \nquantity and quality of replies to the questionnaire and its limited analytical value.\n\n Regarding alphanumeric searches, up to the end of 2015, 26 629 accesses to VIS for law enforcement purposes \nhad been requested. These requests originated from 18 of the 26 countries that use the system. However, only \n\n\n\neight Member States can be considered as regular users, having used the system for more than one year and \nrequested access for a substantial number of cases (more than 400 requests). Of the 10 remaining countries, eight \nrequest access very rarely (1 to 82 requests, some likely submitted for testing purposes) and two started to use the \nsystem only during the second half of 2015 but they have already generated several hundred requests.\n\n Compared with alphanumeric searches, the number of fingerprint-based searches is very low. Only 49 such \nsearches had been requested by the end of 2015, originating from seven Member States, and some of them were \nprobably testing the system. Only two Member States accounted for the majority of requests but still in low numbers \n(16 and 21 requests). The use of fingerprint-based searches was marginal in the five remaining Member States (1 \nto 5 requests).\n\n 99\n\n The number of requests to access the VIS for law enforcement purposes is presented in Figures 19 and 20 below.\n\n Figure 19. Quarterly usage of VIS by Member State for law enforcement purposes (total number of searches)\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n Figure 20. Quarterly usage of VIS by Member State for law enforcement purposes (fingerprint based searches)\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n The numbers provided by eu-LISA do not enable a clear trend in the use of VIS to be detected. Among eight \nregular users of the system, five of them recorded a decline in the number of requests. The number of requests for \nthe three remaining regular users is increasing over time.\n\n Six responding Member States provided statistics on the number of requested searches in VIS. It is noticeable that \nthese statistics do not correspond to the statistics provided by eu-LISA, since the numbers provided by the \nrespondents are always lower then these registered by eu-LISA. For two reporting Member States, the difference \nbetween both sets of data is very high, with the respondents providing information about only 1 % to 5 % of the total \nnumber of searches registered by eu-LISA.\n\n The overall perception of the effectiveness and usefulness of the VIS as an instrument to support the prevention, \ndetection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences is clearly positive. Ten of the 19 \nresponding countries consider that\n\n 100\n\n access to VIS by law enforcement authorities is or could be beneficial in this context. No respondent expressed a \ncontrary opinion.\n\n 4.2 Procedures for access to the VIS by designated authorities\n\n The first step in the implementation of Decision 2008/633/JHA is in principle the designation of the central access \npoint through which access is executed, and the competent law enforcement authorities that are authorised to \naccess VIS data.\n\n Moreover the Decision requires Member States to keep a list of the designated competent law enforcement \nauthorities. This list, and any subsequent amendments, should be notified to the Commission and the General \n\n\n\nSecretariat of the Council. Sixteen of the 19 responding countries designated a central access point to VIS. \nHowever, only 14 of them indicated that they had designated the relevant competent authorities. Ten of them had \ndrafted their list and notified it to the Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council. Two of the responding \ncountries, one of which is a regular user of VIS data for law enforcement purposes, acknowledged that the relevant \nauthorities had not been designated. One respondent reported that even if the designation had been made, the list \nof the competent authorities had not been drafted and notified. Reasons are not provided for not designating the \ncentral access point and the competent authorities or, if they are designated, for not drawing up the list. All 15 \nrespondents that replied to this question acknowledged that the Decision is clear as regards the authorities and \ncentral access points that may be designated to access VIS data.\n\n All the responding Member States consider that the central access point is easily accessible for the designated \nauthorities.\n\n In an exceptional case of urgency, the central access point may process the request immediately and only verify \nafter the fact whether all the conditions for access were fulfilled under Article 4(2) of the Decision. Member States \nreported 52 such urgent requests and all of them were justified by the ex post verification.\n\n The awareness of law enforcement authorities on the possibility of getting access to VIS for law enforcement \npurposes appears to be sufficient in 13 Member States. However, in two Member States, the competent authorities \nare not fully aware of this possibility.\n\n Few recipients provided general remarks on access to VIS for law enforcement purposes. Three Member States \nreported that the access procedure is adequate or sufficient. One Member State considered that the conditions for \naccess are set at a high level, which prohibits the use of VIS to prevent, investigate or detect less serious offences. \nOnly one example of a standard and of an urgent reasoned request to access the VIS was provided. This does not \nenable any conclusions to be drawn on the quality and lawfulness of the requests.\n\n 4.3 Conditions for access by designated authorities\n\n Only two respondents provided a description of the conditions for access to the VIS data by competent authorities. \nIn both cases, the designated authorities must use a specific form to\n\n 101\n\n request access to the VIS. In one case, the designated criminal investigation authority sends to the public \nprosecutor's office a request with reasons for querying VIS. The public prosecutor determines if the conditions are \nmet. If so, it orders the criminal investigation authority to send the written request with the written verification of the \npublic prosecutor to the national access point. In the second case, verification of whether the conditions of access \nare fulfilled is carried out by the central access point.\n\n All 14 States that replied did not report any case of requests to access to VIS that did not meet the conditions for \naccess as referred to in Article 5 of the Decision.\n\n 4.4 Conditions for access by designated authorities of Member States not participating in the VIS\n\n No Member State reported any requests for access to the VIS by designated authorities of Member States in \nrespect of which Regulation (EC) 767/2008 had not yet been put into effect.\n\n 4.5 Access to the VIS by Europol\n\n Europol is not yet connected to the VIS.\n\n\n\n 4.6 Data protection by law enforcement authorities\n\n 4.6.1 Protection of personal data in the process of access by designated authorities under the VIS Decision\n\n The data protection and data security training for the staff of the authorities that have access to VIS is clearly \ninsufficient. While such training is compulsory for all staff having access to VIS, only five Member States replied that \nthey provide such training. Of these, three of them use VIS only exceptionally. A brief description of the training was \nprovided by three respondents and they appear to cover data security and data protection issues. It seems that the \ntraining is not specific to VIS but is part of general training provided to law enforcement staff.\n\n Regarding the supervision of the processing of personal data pursuant to the VIS Decision, seven respondents \nindicated that the competent data protection authority had undertaken an audit. However, only three of these \nprocess VIS data for law enforcement purposes in any significant manner. Under Article 8(6), data protection audits \nmust be carried out at least every four years, which leaves the Member States some time to implement this \nprovision.\n\n Three respondents reported that the audits did not identify any irregularities. Instead, in one country, the data \nprotection authority discovered violations of data protection rules: incomplete documentation on data processing \nactivities and access to VIS by one or more persons without authorisation. The relevant law enforcement \nauthorities were ordered to remedy this situation.\n\n No complaints were reported from anyone concerned by the processing of their VIS data.\n\n 102\n\n 4.6.2 Keeping of VIS data in national files\n\n Nine Member States replied that they do not keep any data originating from VIS in national files. On the contrary, \nthree acknowledged that such data are indeed kept in national files. In two countries, the data are kept in a specific \nfile related to the individual criminal investigation in which VIS data were processed.\n\n 4.6.3 Access, correction and deletion of data related to them by persons concerned\n\n No respondent reported the existence of request for access, correction or deletion of the data obtained from VIS for \nlaw enforcement purposes. Three Member States reported that they would process such requests in line with the \nrelevant national law and provided examples and content of the applicable provisions. In all three cases, the \nlegislation regulating access to police files would apply.\n\n 4.6.4 Keeping of records on the processing operations resulting from accessing VIS data\n\n The keeping of records on processing operations from accessing VIS data is an essential element to enable the \nsupervision and enforcement of the lawfulness of data access. It is also necessary to ensure data integrity and data \nsecurity. Specific and detailed records of access operations are therefore required under Article 16 of the Decision. \nThe replies to the questionnaire suggest that the Member States do not fully comply with their obligations in this \nrespect.\n\n Only four Member States reported that access to VIS is fully recorded in line with Article 16. Moreover, one other \nMember State informed that the recording is done but only partially: only the request for access, and no other \nprocessing operation, is recorded.\n\n\n\n Only one Member State provided information about the number of records kept. These numbers are inconsistent \nand significantly lower compared with the number of access requests registered by eu-LISA.\n\n In this context, the difference in the numbers of search requests to VIS provided, on the one hand, by national \nauthorities and, on the other, by EU-LISA, also indicates weaknesses in recording at national level (see above \n\u2018Access to data by designated law enforcement authorities\u2019).\n\n Regarding the security of the records, five respondents briefly described the security measures in place. They \nemphasised, in particular, the fact that records are accessible to a limited number of people \u2014 subject an \nidentification protocol \u2014 and protected by encryption and/or physical protections.\n\n 4.6.5 Member States\u2019 liability in case of damage to persons\n\n No Member State provided information on liability for unlawful or incompatible processing of data.\n\n 103\n\n eu-LISA is not aware of any damage arising from any illegal processing of data by Member States.\n\n V. THE SECURITY OF THE VIS106\n\n According to eu-LISA, the VIS complies strictly with the VIS Regulation in terms of data protection and information \nsecurity. Since its creation, eu-LISA has had a security sector in place answering directly to the eu-LISA Executive \nDirector, with both a system security officer and a local security officer as provided for under the legal basis. In a \nfirst phase, the existing VIS security policy and controls have been maintained and translated into the new context \nof the Agency.\n\n A new Agency security framework is being developed with the purpose of implementing a Security and Continuity \nManagement System based on the ISO 27001, 27002 and 22301 international standards and taking into account \nthe Commission Decisions in this respect107.\n\n The risk mitigation strategy covers all security layers: physical, personnel, network, operating system, application \nand data. The communication infrastructure is based on a non-routable, logically private closed group network, \nprovides a strong encryption mechanism, and is further protected by firewalls.\n\n The central VIS is an isolated, controlled and secure environment. The operational and administrative access to \nthe system is managed in accordance with the principles of segregation of duties and least-required privileges. All \nactivities and communication in VIS are controlled, monitored and logged. The system\u2019s access configuration \nenforces that only a limited group of eu-LISA staff administrators are able to gain access to the VIS data if it is \nrequired for technical maintenance (Article 50(2)).\n\n VI. THE USE MADE OF THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 31 AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE \nOPERATIONS\n\n Communication of data to non-EU countries or international organisations\n\n Only 3 out of the 19 responding Member States declared they communicated VIS data to non-EU countries or \ninternational organisations for the purpose of return.\n\n\n\n 106 Data security taking into account Commission Decision 2010/260/EU of 4 May 2010 on the Security Plan for \nthe operation of the Visa Information System.\n\n 107 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/443 on Security in the Commission of 13 March 2015, Commission \nDecision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information of 13 March 2015, \nand Commission Decision C( 2006 ) 3602 concerning the security of information systems used by the European \nCommission of 16 August 2006.\n\n 104\n\n Only one Member State identified the authority communicating VIS data to non-EU countries/international \norganisations for the purpose of return, i.e. the national immigration police.\n\n No information was provided on the number of cases in which Member States communicated VIS data to non-EU \ncountries or international organisations for the purpose of return, or in which a person could be successfully \nreturned or at least acquire a travel document by using these data. Only one Member State replied to the question \non the main purpose for which the data were provided: the purpose was identification of the applicant and \nfacilitating return of an applicant with a rejected residence permit.\n\n No transfer of data to a non-EU country or to an international organisation for the purpose of the prevention, \ndetection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences was reported by the \nresponding Member States.\n\n Complementary to the VIS evaluation survey, a European Migration Network ad hoc query was launched on 18 \nMarch 2016 on the subject of Member States\u2019 experiences with the use of the VIS for return purposes. Twenty-four \nMember States provided replies by 29 April 2016, including four that do not have access to VIS as they do not \u2014 or \ndo not fully \u2014 implement the Schengen acquis.\n\n Member State experiences have been limited due to the fact that not all immigration services already have access \nto the system. It is also in part because queries based only on fingerprints, which would enable identification of \nundocumented irregular migrants, are not yet available.\n\n Nevertheless, 14 Member States acknowledge using VIS data to identify people and to facilitate the issuance of \nemergency travel documents by consulates of the countries of origin. However, experience with the use of the data \nobtained from VIS are mixed due to the fact that non-EU countries often do not accept such data as prima facie \nevidence of nationality. Acquiring a copy of the passport (which would be a much stronger evidence base) from the \nMember State consulate that issued the visa is in turn very difficult: some consulates refuse to provide such a copy \nor the files are destroyed as a result of the two-year limitation on the retention of documentation. Two Member \nStates suggested that the availability of a scan of the passport (in particular of the data page) in the VIS would \nsubstantially help speed up the return process and more returns could be carried out on the EU travel document \ntogether with a copy of the passport.\n\n 105\n\n Annex 3: Summary of findings on the implementation of VIS-related provisions of the Visa Code, based on \nMember States\u2019 and eu-LISA reporting, Local Sschengen Cooperation and Schengen evaluations\n\n I COLLECTION AND USE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTIFIERS\n\n\n\n 1.1. Implementation of the obligation to collect biometric identifiers\n\n In order to make it possible to fully examine visa applications, where physically and legally possible Member \nStates should capture and record each visa applicant\u2019s 10 fingerprints in a way that produces results of an \nadequate quality.\n\n When asked whether they have experienced any technical or administrative difficulties in implementing the \nobligation to collect an applicant\u2019s biometric identifiers, 17 % of the responding Member States declared having \nexperienced no such difficulty, 61 % declared having experienced some sort of problems in time, and 22 % \nprovided no answer.\n\n Some of the reasons given for these difficulties were technical, e.g. the slow connection between the fingerprint-\ncapturing device and the computer, the system being slow when copying fingerprints from previous applications, or \ninterference from other electronics. However, most difficulties were linked to the quality of the applicants\u2019 \nfingerprints, due to parameters such as climate, age, and dust. Also, people who perform hard manual labour or \nwork with chemicals have fingerprints that are difficult to capture. Finally, some consulates had to deal with self-\nacclaimed VIP applicants protesting strongly against having their fingerprints taken.\n\n Where the quality of fingerprints was so low that the fingerprints could not be recorded in the system, consulates \ngenerally asked the applicant to come back a second time.\n\n Responding Member States stated that technology used to be more of a problem when the VIS was first \nintroduced and that now problems due to the technology used have become rare.\n\n For the obligation to record all of a person\u2019s 10 fingerprints when they apply for a visa, eu-LISA statistics indicate \nthat the percentage of applications that included fingerprints consistently increased over time, from 62 % in the \nfourth quarter 2011 to 91 % in the fourth quarter of 2015. It should be taken into account that it was during this \nperiod that the VIS was gradually rolled out worldwide and that some Member States chose to introduce it in certain \nregions or locations ahead of the general rollout. Such rollouts took place without registration of applicants\u2019 \nbiometric data, thus artificially increasing the percentage of missing fingerprints in the system, when in reality the \nrecording of biometric data was not yet legally required in these regions.\n\n 106\n\n Figure 1. Applications where fingerprints were not attached\n\n 97.3 % of NIST files108 in the VIS from August 2015 to October 2015 include all 10 fingerprints, which is a clear \nimprovement compared to previous reporting periods. The analysis of the statistics also revealed that Member \nStates often encode incorrectly the reason for not recording fingerprints by not setting the right combination of the \ntwo indicators fingerprints not required for legal reason and fingerprints physically impossible to collect.\n\n Eu-LISA statistics show that the percentage of records of facial image missing from the VIS decreased from almost \n2.4 % in October 2011 when the VIS was first rolled out to 0.02 % in June 2015. This low level was maintained for \nseven months in 2015, after which an increase of approximately 0.12 % was recorded in October 2015. The table \nbelow (Figure 2) shows the monthly evolution of the percentage of missing photographs in the VIS109 since the first \nrollout and until October 2015.\n\n\n\n 108 Standardised files containing fingerprint information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology \n(NIST) is a measurement standards laboratory, also known as a National Metrological Institute (NMI), which is a \nnon-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce.\n\n 109 Source: eu-LISA.\n\n 107\n\n Figure 2. Applications where a facial image was not included- monthly evolution\n\n As regards the distribution of missing facial image per rollout region, the figures are very low as well, usually \naround 0.03 %-0.06 % per region, with the exception of Australasia (0.17 %) and Schengen Member States (1.68 \n%).\n\n 1.2. Implementation of the technical requirements for collecting biometric identifiers, including the use of \nappropriate standards\n\n 8 out of the 19 responding Member States collect the applicant\u2019s facial image directly at the consular post and 11 \nMember States scan applicants\u2019 printed photos from the travel document.\n\n 9 Member States encountered difficulties when electronically collecting a photograph or when adding it to the VIS. \nThese were mainly because the photos provided by the applicants did not comply with rules on quality, colour \nparameters or dimensions. For photos taken at the consular post, the reported difficulties were caused by the \nmorphology of the applicant\u2019s face (regional particularism, very young children).\n\n The Schengen monitoring and evaluation mechanism (\u2018SCHEVAL\u2019) found that for one Member States the photo \nquality standards in practiced at national level were incompatible with those in the CS-VIS .\n\n 7 Member States reported situations in which biometric identifiers could not be collected according to the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation (\u2018ICAO\u2019) technical requirements because of the unusual features of some \ncategories of applicants\u2019 fingerprints (e.g. photographing very young children, fingerprinting manual labourers or \nelderly people, etc.), wrong user handling or software problems (and lack of IT support).\n\n 108\n\n Language barriers have also been reported to be a challenge when communicating information to the applicant on \nwhat they need to do for their fingerprints to be captured correctly.\n\n It should be noted that the system requires 10 good-quality fingerprints, which in some cases may be difficult to \nobtain, may require several attempts and may therefore be time consuming.\n\n One Member State noticed a discrepancy between the definition of \u2018good quality\u2019 in its national system and that in \nthe CS-VIS.\n\n One Member State mentioned the lack of a harmonised procedure for collecting biometrics across Member States \nas an impediment to operational cooperation between Member States in the field. Each Member State has \ndeveloped its own software, and there are often incompatibilities with software used by other Member States.\n\n According to eu-LISA, the current tools and practices used to collect biometrics should be replaced by common \nstandards and best practices so as to increase the overall quality and efficiency of both fingerprints and \nphotographs. Furthermore, the capacity to monitor performance centrally and provide feedback should be \n\n\n\nincreased. The central certification of equipment used should be considered. Introducing anti-spoofing standards \nshould also be considered. Higher resolution (1000dpi) images should be accepted, for example, to allow the use of \nextended feature sets.\n\n 1.3. Quality of data collected\n\n Statistics on the quality of data collected with the application for the reporting period from October 2011 to October \n2015 show a continuous improvement (see Figure 3 below). Although the initial levels of insufficient quality \nfingerprinting (i.e. missing fingerprints or poor quality of one or more of the 10 fingerprints taken) were around 6 -7 \n% in the first months after the VIS entry into operations of the system, with a peak of almost 9 % in December 2011, \nthey decreased to almost 3 % by October 2014.\n\n The introduction of the \u20180-FTE\u2019 measure110 (zero failure-to-enrol, i.e. no fingerprint set is refused by the central \nsystem for insufficient data quality) in October 2014 made sure that all fingerprints were recorded in the subsequent \nperiod. This made it possible for border guards to perform fingerprint-based authentication for all visa holders \nwhose fingerprints are stored in the VIS. One potential negative effect concerns the accuracy of fingerprint-based \nidentification, needed particularly for new visa applicants. However, Member States have not reported any \nproblems of this kind so far. Moreover, the introduction of the \u20180-FTE\u2019 measure did not have a detrimental effect on \nthe overall fingerprint quality: despite the fact that the VIS now accepts all fingerprints irrespective of their quality, \nconsulates still aim to collect the best quality fingerprints possible.\n\n 110 This measure had been requested by Member States already before the VIS was introduced, though its \nimplementation was delayed because priority was given to other technical changes in the VIS.\n\n 109\n\n Figure 3. Percentage of applications with poor quality fingerprints\n\n Source: eu-LISA.\n\n 1.3.1. Statistical data for cases in which fingerprints could factually not be provided\n\n The Commission requested that Member States provide information on cases in which fingerprints could factually \nnot be collected, as well as the percentages that these figures represent in the total number of cases in which \nfingerprints were taken. Only 4 out of the 19 responding Member States provided any data on this and the data \nsubmitted was not reliable enough for the Commission to be able to draw any conclusions.\n\n According to the information provided by eu-LISA, between April 2011 and April 2015 the percentage of cases \nrecorded in the VIS in which fingerprints could not be collected because they were factually not available (i.e. \npersons for whom fingerprinting is physically impossible steadily decreased. Therefore, while the total number of \napplications recorded in the system increased four-fold during this period, the number of fingerprints missing \nbecause they could factually not be collected remained stable, with the exception of some peaks in February 2014 \nand February-March 2015, which are not related to the new regional rollouts. In April 2015 (latest period reported \non by eu-LISA), the number of applications with fingerprints not attached because factually impossible represented \napproximately 8.6 % of the total number of applications.\n\n Implementation of the 0-FTE feature as from October 2014*\n\n\n\n 110\n\n Figure 4. Cases in which fingerprints could factually not be provided\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n 1.3.2. Information/statistical data on cases in which fingerprints were not required for legal reasons\n\n Only 4 out of the 19 responding Member States provided data on cases in which the applicant was exempt from \nfingerprinting due to their age (<12 years), which makes the overall aggregated data unreliable. For these four \nMember States who contributed data, the number of cases evolved as follows: 125 cases in 2011; 2570 cases in \n2012; 17726 cases in 2013; 28791 cases in 2014; and 44338 cases in 2015.\n\n Only 4 of the 19 responding Member States provided data on cases in which the applicant was exempt from \nfingerprinting due to their status as Head of State or Government, member of a national government, accompanying \nspouse, or member of an official delegation. Although these data are inconclusive due to the very low response \nrate, they show a dramatic increase in such cases over time. This could be due to practitioners in the national visa \nauthorities being more aware of the applicable legal provisions or to the sheer increase in the number of VIS \nentries because of the system\u2019s increased geographical coverage over time: 29 cases in 2011; 100 cases in 2012; \n292 cases in 2013; 948 cases in 2014; and 1753 cases in 2015.\n\n None of the responding Member States provided information on cases in which the applicant was not exempt from \nfingerprinting despite their status. Eight Member States reported zero such cases, while the others stated that they \ndo not compile statistics on this.\n\n According to eu-LISA, between April 2011 and April 2015 the proportion of cases recorded in the VIS in which \nfingerprints could not be collected because they were legally not required steadily decreased. The evolution follows \nthe same pattern as for cases in which fingerprints\n\n 0\n\n 500.000\n\n 1.000.000\n\n 1.500.000\n\n 2.000.000\n\n 2.500.000\n\n 3.000.000\n\n Fingerprints not attached, not available\n\n Total Applications\n\n No fingerprints attached\n\n\n\n Fingerprints not available\n\n 111\n\n could factually not be provided, showing the same relative peak in February 2014 and reaching about 8.7 % of total \napplications in April 2015.\n\n Figure 5. Cases in which fingerprints were not required for legal reasons\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n 1.3.3. Comparison between the number of cases in which fingerprints could factually not be provided or were \nlegally not required and the number of cases in which fingerprints were taken\n\n In the fourth quarter 2011, the cases in which fingerprints were not attached represented about one-third of the \ntotal number of applications (due in part to the fact that two Member States started using the VIS worldwide on 11 \nOctober 2011 without recording fingerprints), and in the fourth quarter 2015 they represented about one-tenth of the \ntotal number of applications. At the same time, although at the beginning of the reporting period the number of \ncases in which fingerprints could physically not be collected represented about half of the number of cases in which \nthe fingerprints were not attached, towards the end of the period these two figures were almost equal. This means \nthat there were very few applications in which fingerprints were not attached because they were legally not \nrequired.111\n\n 111 The statistics presented must, however, be considered with caution. If the legal definitions are correctly \napplied, the sum of the number of cases in which fingerprints were not available and the number of cases in which \nfingerprints were not required should equal the total number of cases in which fingerprints were not attached . \nHowever, according to the below table (Figure 6) extracted from the VIS, it appears that the number of fingerprints \nnot available often equals the number of fingerprints not required, and sometimes these have values similar to the \nnumber of fingerprints not included. Such cases are not possible in reality. The fact that they appear in the system \nindicates inconsistencies in the way Member States encode the reason for not including fingerprints and shows that \nthe legal and physical reasons are in practice often confused (probably because in reality a lack of fingerprints for \nphysical reasons is also a legally justified reason for not providing the fingerprints).\n\n 112\n\n Quarter\n\n Total applications\n\n Fingerprints\n\n not included\n\n Fingerprints not available\n\n Fingerprints not required\n\n 2011/4\n\n\n\n 297 347\n\n 112 033\n\n 61 471\n\n 61 883\n\n 2012/1\n\n 342 891\n\n 107 902\n\n 53 257\n\n 52 380\n\n 2012/2\n\n 469 678\n\n 161 541\n\n 84 056\n\n 85 773\n\n 2012/3\n\n 440 869\n\n 135 755\n\n 82 856\n\n 79 893\n\n 2012/4\n\n 537 221\n\n 141 710\n\n 95 380\n\n 98 470\n\n 2013/1\n\n\n\n 577 404\n\n 126 201\n\n 85 327\n\n 83 937\n\n 2013/2\n\n 976 141\n\n 230 519\n\n 177 215\n\n 173 865\n\n 2013/3\n\n 1 052 918\n\n 210 721\n\n 182 805\n\n 176 757\n\n 2013/4\n\n 869 094\n\n 157 045\n\n 142 474\n\n 83 388\n\n 2014/1\n\n 1 075 996\n\n 207 274\n\n 192 918\n\n 128 237\n\n 2014/2\n\n\n\n 1 629 464\n\n 379 134\n\n 358 525\n\n 290 101\n\n 2014/3\n\n 1 535 298\n\n 312 487\n\n 296 383\n\n 243 461\n\n 2014/4\n\n 1 305 966\n\n 203 518\n\n 196 110\n\n 148 642\n\n 2015/1\n\n 1 408 616\n\n 214 190\n\n 205 628\n\n 164 685\n\n 2015/2\n\n 2 405 285\n\n 658 768\n\n 641 176\n\n 393 709\n\n 2015/3\n\n\n\n 2 734 616\n\n 594 626\n\n 567 708\n\n 345 871\n\n 2015/4\n\n 1 882 977\n\n 177 936\n\n 162 316\n\n 164 279\n\n Figure 6.

Cases of visa refusal where a person could not physically provide fingerprints\n\n Source: eu-LISA\n\n The information provided by the responding Member States shows that the few cases in which a visa was refused \nto a person whose fingerprints could physically not be collected were not linked to the physical impossibility of \ncollecting fingerprints, but rather to one of the grounds for refusal set out in the Visa Code. These included an \nabsence of proof of sufficient means of subsistence, situations where the purpose of travel was not clear or justified, \nand no proof of return to the point of origin after the end of travel.\n\n 1.5.

However, most Member States admit that this takes place in practice, and evaluation teams \nconfirmed this on two occasions during SCHEVAL monitoring missions (in two different Member States).\n\n The reported reasons for repeated collection are related to doubts regarding the identity of the person, the poor \nquality of the first collection, difficulties in finding the first file in the system\n\n MS\n\n Applications\n\n % Copy\n\n MS\n\n Applications\n\n % Copy\n\n Austria\n\n 49,397\n\n 0.79%\n\n Lithuania\n\n 96,323\n\n 5.98%\n\n Belgiu\n\n 44,527\n\n 11.77%\n\n Luxembourg\n\n 2,04\n\n 6.46%\n\n Denmark\n\n\n\n 19,510\n\n 10.56%\n\n Malta\n\n 6,45\n\n 0.00%\n\n Estonia\n\n 31,341\n\n 3.48%\n\n Netherlands\n\n 105,63\n\n 5.80%\n\n Finland\n\n 140,99\n\n 1.88%\n\n Norwa\n\n 18,912\n\n 2.47%\n\n France\n\n 607,71\n\n 7.98%\n\n Poland\n\n 257,50\n\n 11.35%\n\n Germany\n\n 389,23\n\n\n\n 11.39%\n\n Portugal\n\n 39,739\n\n 30.80%\n\n Greec\n\n 64,506\n\n 16.95%\n\n Slovakia\n\n 17,995\n\n 2.88%\n\n Hungary\n\n 57,181\n\n 2.25%\n\n Slovenia\n\n 5,20\n\n 8.52%\n\n Icelan\n\n 510\n\n 2.94%\n\n Spain\n\n 265,34\n\n 8.98%\n\n Italy\n\n 321,46\n\n 5.04%\n\n\n\n Sweden\n\n 30,298\n\n 7.32%\n\n Latvia\n\n 36,440\n\n 5.05%\n\n Switzerland\n\n 78,996\n\n 9.07%\n\n Liechtenstein\n\n 0\n\n N/A\n\n The Czech republic\n\n 96,058\n\n 0.00%\n\n Total\n\n 2,783,32\n\n 8.00%\n\n VIS usage of CopyBiometric operation October-December 2015\n\n 115\n\n due to different country codes used by different Member States, or simply the fact that applicants are often \nthemselves uncertain of whether or not they already gave their fingerprints and volunteer to give them (again) when \nthey apply for a visa. This last situation occurs frequently due to the widespread use of external service providers \n(ESP) for collecting applications and biometrics, as these do not have access to the VIS and thus cannot check \nwhether the applicant\u2019s fingerprints have already been taken.\n\n Except for very small Member States with limited consular networks, cases with a 0% occurance of the \n\u2018copyBiometric\u2019 operation would suggest that the service has not been technically implemented or that there is a \nserious lack of awareness among consular staff as regards the rule on copying biometrics.\n\n\n\n 1.6. Suitability of the chosen International Civil Aviation Organisation standard\n\n The technical requirements for the visa photograph must be set in accordance with the standards set out by the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in document 9303 Part 1, 6th edition. All Member States and the \neu-LISA confirmed that the current ICAO standards for photographs are most suitable for visa-related activities. \nOne Member State, however, noted that there are no requirements for the recording procedure.\n\n If automated facial image recognition were to be used in the VIS (1:1 operation), all photographs would at least \nneed to comply with ICAO standards. As the ICAO standards set a number of conditions which would not be \nsufficient in case of a search (1:n operation \u2014 see for example the Entry Exit System currently under discussion, \nwhere a search should combine four fingerprints with a photograph), a minimum photograph quality would need to \nbe set and enforced.\n\n Fingerprints must be taken in accordance with ICAO standards and Commission Decision 2006/648/EC of 22 \nSeptember 2006 laying down the technical specifications on the standards for biometric features related to the \ndevelopment of the Visa Information System. Most of the responding Member States (13) declared that the current \nstandards are most suitable for visa-related activities.\n\n 116\n\n II ORGANISATION OF APPLICATION-RELATED PROCEDURES\n\n 2.1 Operational cooperation between Member States\n\n In order to facilitate the visa application procedure, the Visa Code provides for several forms of cooperation, such \nas limited representation, co-location, common application centres, recourse to honorary consuls, and cooperation \nwith ESPs, taking into account data protection requirements.\n\n The impact assessment accompanying the 2014 Commission proposal to amend the Visa Code113 identified \ninsufficient geographical coverage in visa processing as one of the major problems in the development of a \ncommon visa policy, leading to costly and lengthy application processes for applicants in many third countries.\n\n Since then the situation has slightly improved as the number of representation arrangements between Member \nStates is steadily growing (also indirectly, due to the lifting of the visa requirement for a number of third countries in \n2015), making it the most widespread means of cooperation and of expanding consular coverage. Access to \nconsulates/ESPs can be challenging in countries where all or most of the Member States are present in the capital \nand where many applicants need to travel long distances to reach them. Finally, there are still eight third \ncountries114 whose nationals are subject to a visa requirement obligation and in which no Member State is present \nfor the purpose of collecting/processing visa applications.\n\n Despite improvements in geographical coverage, to date there are still around 500 \u2018blank spots\u2019 in the table of \nconsular presence/representation,115 where Member States are neither present nor represented in the capital. Full \npresence/representation is only ensured in approximately 25 locations worldwide116.\n\n Most responding Member States described the quality of operational cooperation between Member States as good \nor satisfactory. Examples of good cooperation include exchanges of information/lessons learned prior to VIS roll-out \nin a certain region, with Member States that were already outsourcing parts of the visa process. During audit \n\n\n\nmissions, Member States include meetings with other Member States to exchange information and harmonise \nprocedures. If a Member State temporarily cannot process visa applications due to technical\n\n 113 Doc COM(2014) 164 final and SWD(2014) 68 final.\n\n 114 Belize, Gambia, Guyana, Liberia, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, Swaziland.\n\n 115 A full table with Member States\u2019 consular presence is published on the DG HOME website at            \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/index_en.htm.\n\n 116 Annex 28 to the Visa Code Handbook (last revision:15.01.2016): Algeria: Algiers; Azerbaijan: Baku; China: \nBeijing, Shanghai; Egypt: Cairo; Georgia: Tbilisi; Ghana: Accra; India: New Delhi; Indonesia: Jakarta; Israel: Tel \nAviv; Japan: Tokyo; Jordan: Amman; Russian Federation: Moscow, St. Petersburg; Saudi Arabia: Riyadh; Serbia: \nBelgrade; Sri Lanka: Colombo; Thailand: Bangkok; Turkey: Ankara; Ukraine: Kiev; UK: London; USA: Washington; \nVietnam: Hanoi.\n\n 117\n\n problems, other Member States may ensure back up, taking in visa applications on behalf of the Member State in \nneed. However, the number of visas issued manually for technical reasons remains high for some Member States \nand a spot check carried out in 2014 revealed that data on manual applications were not entered in the VIS. \nUnfortunately, the Commission was not in a position to carry out a comprehensive study of this phenomenon \nbecause of lack of access to data in the VIS.\n\n The temporary dysfunction of the N-VIS in one Member State in December 2015 was an example of how Member \nStates cooperate in crisis situations and showed the importance of support provided by other Member States in \nsuch situations. The dysfunction started on 10 December 2015 and the normal situation was fully restored only on 6 \nJanuary 2016. Technical failures in the national system prevented the Member State\u2019s consulates from sending \ndata to the VIS. The Member State concerned immediately stopped issuing visas, while other Member States\u2019 \nrepresentations in the various locations stepped in to handle urgent applications. There was regular communication \nwith eu-LISA and other Member States throughout, and situation reports were submitted. When the normal situation \nwas restored, the concerned Member State\u2019s authorities immediately carried out an assessment of the event\u2019s \nimpact on the VIS, and established its causes and consequences. The results were presented to the relevant \nbodies (such as the Friends of VIS Working Party in the Council and the VIS Advisory Group).\n\n There are currently no co-locations or common application centres (CACs) as defined by the Visa Code, although \nthe Commission has promoted the setting up CACs in the past. The 2014 Commission Report on the Visa Code \nalready identified this as a major issue and the situation has not changed since. The impact assessment for the \n2014 Commission proposal to revise the Visa Code identified several reasons for this situation, one of a legislative \nnature: Article 41 of the Visa Code does not provide the necessary flexibility to set up co-locations and CACs on the \nspot.\n\n To date, not one fully-fledged CAC has been created, though, as for co-location, funding had been made available \nto develop consular cooperation projects under the Community Actions of the External Borders Fund. Only two \nsuch projects have been funded: the \u2018Schengen House\u2019 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and the \u2018Centro \nComum de Vistos\u2019 in Praia, Cape Verde. However, these operate based on classical representation arrangements: \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/index_en.htm\n\n\napplications are lodged and examined at the centre, and decisions are also taken there, by the Belgian and \nPortuguese consulates, respectively.\n\n The Commission continues to abide by its opinion expressed in the 2015 Report on the Visa Code that, from a \npractical and technical point of view, setting up such cooperation is cumbersome and not worthwhile if the purpose \nis only to collect visa applications, when there are fully equipped and staffed consulates to examine the \napplications. The money potentially saved by sharing facilities to receive applicants and equipment to collect \nbiometric data is likely to be spent on costs linked to transferring data, files and staff from the \u2018co-location\u2019 to the \n\u2018back office\u2019.\n\n 118\n\n This shortcoming led the Commission to propose a revision of the provisions of co-location and CACs in the 2014 \nproposal to recast the Visa Code, currently under examination by co-legislators, and to introduce instead:\n\n \u2022 a general notion/concept of \u2018Schengen Visa Centre\u2019 which would provide a more realistic and flexible definition of \ncertain forms of consular cooperation;\n\n \u2022 the concept of \u2018mandatory representation\u2019 according to which, if the Member State responsible for processing the \nvisa application is neither present nor represented (under such an arrangement) in a given third country, any other \nMember State present in that country is obliged to process visa applications on their behalf.\n\n The use of honorary consuls to collect visa applications is extremely limited. By the end of 2015, only three \nMember States used this possibility \u2014 Italy (mainly for applications for national visas), Malta and Poland.\n\n The Visa Code provides that no form of organisation should lead to the applicant being required to appear in \nperson in more than one location to lodge an application. The Commission has taken action against certain \nMember States who violated this principle. One case concerned a Member State present in Lagos/Nigeria which \nused a two-step procedure to collect fingerprints in some locations, until the ESP was given the necessary \nequipment. The applicant had to first submit a paper file and later on had to come to the consulate to give \nfingerprints. The problem was eventually solved and this practice was eliminated.\n\n Some Member States (e.g. Spain, Denmark) practice both representation and use of ESPs in some locations (e.g. \nMinsk). This is an example of good practice.\n\n This issue is closely linked to the possibility of direct access provided in Article 17(5) of the Visa Code, according \nto which Member States using outsourcing must maintain the possibility for applicants to lodge their application \ndirectly at the consulate so that no one is forced to pay an extra service fee.\n\n The Commission had in the past received numerous complaints about Member States\u2019 violation of this provision, \nand has therefore conducted an investigation on their practices. It turned out that, in some cases, there was no \npossibility to lodge applications directly at the Member State\u2019s consulate, the only option was to lodge them at the \npremises of the external service provider.\n\n\n\n The 2014 evaluation of the implementation of the Visa Code already looked into this matter and found that the \nformulation in the legal text (\u2018maintain the possibility \u2026. to lodge their application directly\u2019) made it difficult for \nMember States to enforce this provision. Bearing in mind that the main reason for using outsourcing is a Member \nState\u2019s lack of resources and facilities to receive applicants in high numbers or for security reasons, the requirement \non direct access to the consulate can be seen as an impossible to meet. To ensure that emergency cases are \ntreated promptly, priority access to the external service provider should always be possible.\n\n 119\n\n To address this issue, the 2014 proposal to recast the Visa Code provided that Member States are no longer \nobliged to maintain the possibility of \u2018direct access\u2019 for lodging applications at the consulate in places where an \nexternal service provider has been mandated to collect visa applications (Article 17(5) was deleted). However, \nMember States may always maintain this possibility.\n\n 2.2 Experience with external service providers (ESPs)\n\n 2.2. 1 Member States\u2019 use of ESPs\n\n The 26 Member States have representations in 175 countries worldwide. Outsourcing is steadily growing and \npractically all Member States do it in several locations. The main reason for outsourcing the collection of \napplications is the volume of applications and large territories. This is true for most countries in which outsourcing is \nused: Russia, China, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, Algeria, India, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. ESPs generally have \nvisa application centres (VACs) in the capital and bigger cities, and \u2018satellite VACs\u2019 (\u2018dropboxes\u2019) in other locations.\n\n 2.2. 2 Legal instrument governing cooperation between a Member State and an ESP\n\n Cooperation between a Member State and an ESP must be based on a legal instrument (a \u2018contract\u2019), to be drawn \nup based on Visa Code Article 43 and Annex X which set out a list of minimum requirements to be covered.\n\n Under Article 43(13), Member States are required to provide a copy of their contracts to the Commission. In \nprinciple, this should happen when cooperation with an ESP starts, is renewed, suspended or terminated. Member \nStates have failed to share contracts systematically.\n\n In 2015, the Commission carried out a study of the state of affairs regarding the existence and content of contracts \nconcluded by Member States. By March 2016, eleven Member States sent the Commission all their contracts \nrelating to cooperation with ESPs. Three Member States have still not sent in their contracts, and information from \ntwelve Member States on contracts that were terminated or are being renewed is pending.\n\n An analysis of the submitted contracts makes it possible to draw a set of conclusions, and these are discussed \nbelow.\n\n Generally, Member States\u2019 monitoring of ESPs is sub-optimal; records of announced and unannounced visits and \nreactions to possible malpractices are not kept. This is why the Commission has proposed to strengthen the \nmonitoring and reporting provisions in the 2004 proposal on the recast Visa Code, in Article 41(12).\n\n 120\n\n\n\n The type and extent of the contracts to be used are left to Member States\u2019 discretion and internal organisation. \nBased on the Commission\u2019s analysis and Member States\u2019 responses to the present evaluation, 30 % of Member \nStates use global framework contracts and 70 % use local contracts.\n\n Most local contracts are for the outsourcing of services in a given jurisdiction or third country, but there are also \nseveral examples of contracts covering specific regions (e.g. South Caucasus, Central Asia) or several countries \n(e.g. India and Nepal, South Africa and Swaziland).\n\n The contracts often include the possibility to sub-contract work to a local service provider. In most cases, this is \nsubject to prior approval by the Member State\u2019s Contracting Authority.\n\n As regards the scope of the contracts, Member States generally outsource the collection of both long-stay and \nshort-stay visa applications.\n\n Under Article 43(1) of the Visa Code, Member States must select the ESPs without prejudice to public \nprocurement and competition rules. Responses to the evaluation showed that practically all Member States launch \ncalls for tender to select ESPs.\n\n However, based on an analysis of submitted contracts, it seems that the existence of a tender procedure cannot be \nascertained in all cases. Only an average of 50 % of contracts include a reference to a call for tender.\n\n According to the information provided by Member States (only 20 % of the responding ones), contracts are \nnegotiated and concluded either by embassies/consulates directly with ESPs, under the supervision and control of \nthe central administration, or by Member States\u2019 central authorities (the latter happens in particular for Member \nStates with minor consular representation).\n\n Some Member States reported that the ESP is selected based on the best offer of price and quality.\n\n Member States have concluded contracts with a limited number of companies: 80 % with VF Worldwide Holdings \nLimited/VFS Global, 8 % with TLS Contact, 12 % with local companies.\n\n Finally, as regards the tenure of the contract, the average duration is three years. In most cases, this can be \nrenewed up to a limited number of times. In some cases, however, a limit is not set or renewal is automatic.\n\n Most contracts with ESPs contain a \u2018sauvegarde\u2019 clause to ensure service continuity if the contract is terminated \n(Article 43(12)). This clause states that the contract remains in force for a certain period of time after its expiry date. \nThis period should not be indefinite.\n\n The list of minimum requirements set out by Article 43(2) and Annex X of the Visa Code can be divided into two \nmain areas. It requires that contracts include provisions governing the performance of ESP activities, such as those \nrelated to the conduct of staff (qualifications, training, behaviour) and to data protection and transmission. It also \nrequires\n\n 121\n\n specific provisions for the verification and monitoring of ESPs\u2019 performance, notably by granting consular staff the \nright to access ESP premises and the possibility to monitor them and the ESP\u2019s software system remotely.\n\n\n\n An analysis of contracts provided to the Commission so far has shown that Member States\u2019 contracts by-and-large \ninclude these elements. In some cases, Member States even transpose them exactly as written in Annex X.\n\n In the few cases where this is not the case, in particular with regard to the second set of provisions (monitoring of \nperformance), the Commission will address the issue directly with the Member States concerned within the \napplicable legal framework.\n\n The implementation of contracts is checked in the context of the periodic evaluation of the implementation of the \nSchengen acquis. Following on-site visits to ESP premises and related consular posts, the evaluating group of \nexperts checks the conformity of the ESPs\u2019 practices against the contractual provisions. In cases where a problem \nwas found, a list of recommendations was sent to the Member State concerned.\n\n 2.2. 3 Organisation and implementation of services\n\n Most Member States train ESP staff when a new visa application centre is set up. A two-way process is usually in \nplace: embassy staff visit the ESP to train the staff there and ESP staff visit the Member State\u2019s embassy in the \nhost country or in a neighbouring country; only rarely is ESP staff trained in the Member State concerned. After the \ninception phase, training is provided upon need, and especially when new legislation or technical procedures are \nimplemented (e.g. introduction of biometric data capture when the VIS was rolled out). The \u2018train the trainer\u2019 method \nis often used, where supervisors are invited to take part in training sessions given by instructors from the Member \nState\u2019s representation and they will in turn train ESP staff. However, based on information collected in the \nframework of SCHEVAL evaluations, continuous training and awareness raising on new legislation and practices \nappears to be suboptimal (e.g. changes of practices at the visa section are not systematically communicated to the \nESP).\n\n All responding Member States declared having procedures for monitoring ESPs\u2019 activity. Ways to ensure that \nESPs provide all information required by visa law and meet the data protection requirements related to collecting \nthe visa application and biometric data include:\n\n \u2212 Inclusion of these requirements in agreements concluded with the ESPs, including the obligation for the ESP to \nput in place the necessary framework and procedures for quality assurance/control. The agreements usually \ninclude a description of the complete process of handling the application, from receiving the documentation to \nreturning the travel document to the applicant.\n\n 122\n\n \u2212 Conclusion of data processing agreements with the ESP. ESPs often have their own data protection system in \nplace, and are accredited on personal data protection requirements by the host country in accordance with national \nregulations.\n\n \u2212 Permanent monitoring by the consulates.\n\n \u2212 Regular checks of VACs by national visa authorities, according to a checklist based on the Visa Code.\n\n All Member States declared having the relevant information on visa requirements published on the ESP\u2019s website \nand in the VACs. However, SCHEVAL field monitoring showed that this was not always the case (e.g. there was a \nlack of updated information on visa requirements on the ESP\u2019s premises and on the consulate\u2019s website).\n\n\n\n All Member States declared having technical and organisational security measures in place to ensure that personal \ndata are adequately protected against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised \ndisclosure or access. These measures are usually also part of contracts concluded with ESPs. In addition, guidance \non how the consulate should supervise the ESP\u2019s activities is available.\n\n According to the Visa Code, ESPs do not have access to the VIS for encoding data, nor can they store data on \nown devices. Each ESP collects and stores biometric data on a secure server, from which Member States import \nthem into the VIS. If the ESP does not have a direct secure IT connection to the consulate, the data are registered \non a data carrier, which is electronically signed and encrypted. The data carrier is transported with physical files in a \nlocked and sealed courier bag/suitcase/box, by the ESP\u2019s own courier or an external courier company.\n\n According to replies from Member States on monitoring methods, the favoured way of monitoring ESPs is through \nannounced and unannounced audits carried out by consulates, although inspection teams from headquarters and \nthe national data protection authority are also mentioned. About 20 % of responding Member States mentioned \nmonthly audits, though most had no fixed frequency. Test applicants are rarely used to monitor ESPs (only one \nMember State mentioned this method).\n\n However, SCHEVAL field missions uncovered shortcomings in this, in particular as regards visits of consular staff \nto VACs (non-existant in some cases) and the consular staff\u2019s supervision of the ESP\u2019s process of delivering \napplications and collecting passports (no electronic tracking of document exchange; lack of an internal monitoring \nreport; lack of remote access to the ESP\u2019s appointment system software).\n\n In order to address this issue, the 2014 proposal to recast the Visa Code envisaged an amendment to the rules on \ncooperation with ESPs. It requested that Member States provide to the Commission annual reports on their \ncooperation with and their monitoring of ESPs worldwide, in accordance with Annex VI (former Annex X) to the Visa \nCode.\n\n Two of the responding Member States declared having experienced situations of insolvency, unreliability, conflicts \nof interest or other problems with an ESP. One Member State found that staff at a specific visa application centre \nreceived commissions based on how many\n\n 123\n\n additional services they sold. As additional services are optional, this was not considered to be in line with the \nagreement and this form of compensation was stopped. Another Member State experienced some reliability- and \nefficiency- related problems, mostly in IT, which were solved through contacts between the consulate and the ESP.\n\n All responding Member States assessed the overall satisfaction of visa applicants with the ESPs\u2019 services as very \ngood and mentioned having received very few or no complaints. Reasons for complaints include misunderstanding \nthe VAC\u2019s role, problems with appointments, inadequacy of the premises (limited space, few attending staff, waiting \ntimes), or not receiving a satisfactory explanation for a visa refusal (the latter is the Member State\u2019s responsibility).\n\n Most Member States ensure that complaints are sent directly to their consulate. If the ESP receives a complaint, it \ncan follow the procedure for receiving and responding to complaints included in the contract. Complaints should be \nforwarded to the consulate, which then further decides on the matter. If the ESP proposes an answer itself, it must \nsubmit it to the consulate for approval before it sends it to the applicant.\n\n\n\n None of the responding Member States received complaints regarding data protection or uncovered any data \nprotection irregularities in ESPs\u2019 activities. There has never been any action taken under the host country\u2019s national \nlaw on an ESP\u2019s alleged breach of data protection obligations.\n\n However, 40 % of responding Member States have terminated or suspended cooperation with an ESP. The three \nmain reasons for such termination are:\n\n \u2212 the closure of the consulate;\n\n \u2212 granting the contract for activities to another ESP following a public tender;\n\n \u2212 non-respect of the contract concluded between the Member State and the ESP (this seems to have occurred in a \nsingle case, due to the ESP\u2019s delayed start of services caused by an inadequate IT solution).\n\n 2.2. 4 The service fee\n\n An ESP charges a service fee to cover the service offered (Article 17). The fee must be set in the contract between \nthe Member State and the ESP.\n\n According to Member States\u2019 reporting, the service fees charged by ESPs comply with the limitations imposed by \nthe law (i.e. they are proportionate to the costs incurred by the ESP and do not exceed half of the amount of the \nvisa fee, i.e. 30 euros). The fees charged worldwide vary between approximately 10 euros and 30 euros. Some \nESPs charged lower fees before the VIS was rolled out (i.e. before the collection of biometric identifiers) and \nadapted them to local price levels. A good practice was identified in some Member States who have set a maximum \nfee of 20 euros regardless of location.\n\n 124\n\n However, there were some cases where the fee exceeded the 30 euro ceiling, sometimes due to the addition of a \nmandatory courier fee for sending the application to the competent Member State\u2019s consulate or because of \nexchange rate variations. The two responding Member States whose ESPs exceeded the limit are the same ones \nthat stated during the consultation that the fee limitation under the Visa Code has given rise to problems in practice. \nThe fee limitation was contested by one Member State in particular, who argued that the limit is a hindrance in \ncases where a state intends to introduce a \u2018hub and spoke organisation\u2019 (where the application is handed in to the \nservice provider in one country and transported to a regional or central hub for handling and decision). This is the \ncase for example in Palestine, where the ESP requires a 30 euro service fee (plus 12 euro courier fee).\n\n Responding Member States pointed out that the objective of harmonising the service fee in certain locations cannot \nbe reached, for reasons which can be summarised as follows:\n\n \u2212 Member States negotiate their contracts individually, which leads to differences in the prices ESPs propose to \nthem.\n\n For example, Member States bring different volumes of visa applications when negotiating a contract with a local \nservice provider, so even if several Member States use the same ESP in a given location, the prices quoted by the \nESP will vary.\n\n\n\n \u2212 Member States work with different service providers in the same location (since the contract with an ESP is the \nresult of public procurement, the same ESP does not always win all contracts in a location).\n\n \u2212 Member States do not always outsource the same tasks.\n\n \u2212 Member States may provide the hardware/software solution or not.\n\n In reality, this situation prevents the implementation of Article 17(3), according to which Member States \u2018shall aim \nto harmonise the service fee applied\u2018. Since the Visa Code does not lay down a clear obligation (\u2018shall aim to\u2019), \nlocal harmonisation of the service fee is de facto not attained.\n\n 2.2. 5 Quality of the collection of biometrics by ESPs\n\n All responding Member States declared satisfaction with their cooperation with ESPs regarding the collection of \nbiometric data. Minor difficulties in the beginning (such as problems with the transfer of the biometrics via the \nnational system, or problems with the quality of the biometrics collected by the ESP) were quickly resolved.\n\n Member States often mentioned training as the most efficient way to address problems.\n\n 2.3 Equipment for the collection of biometric identifiers\n\n 125\n\n Only seven of the responding Member States provided information on the level of equipment possessed by \nconsulates and authorities responsible for processing visa applications at borders, with the required material for \ncollecting biometric identifiers.\n\n All responding Member States declared having sufficient infrastructure in consulates and at border control posts to \nhandle the VIS-related requirements and to have all visa issuing authorities properly equipped. One Member State \nhighlighted the need to equip border guards with mobile equipment do deal with specific situations.\n\n 2.4 Encryption and secure transfer of data\n\n For representation arrangements between Member States, Member States\u2019 cooperation agreements with ESPs, or \nin cases of recourse to honorary consuls, the Member State concerned must ensure that all data are fully \nencrypted, whether they are electronically or physically transferred.\n\n In third countries where electronic data transfer of encrypted data is not possible or is not possible without specific \nmeasures (potentially) damaging the data\u2019s confidentiality, most responding Member States (11) declared having \navoided working with an ESP and/or being represented by another Member State.\n\n None of the responding Member States concluded any agreements with third countries with the aim of lifting the \nprohibition against encryption of data to be electronically transferred. One Member State reported that it asked the \nESP to send the encrypted data to the consulate via \u2018crypto-hub\u2019. The encrypted data was then sent to the Member \nState\u2019s capital and was protected under Articles 27 and 33 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Cooperation.\n\n If it is necessary to transfer data from an ESP to the consulate physically, the timing depends on the distance \nbetween the ESP and the consulate. Five responding Member States stated that transfers are normally done during \n\n\n\nthe same working day. However, in some specific circumstances such as problematic or vast countries, the transfer \ncan take between two and (maximum) five days.\n\n III RELIABILITY OF FINGERPRINTS OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 FOR THE PURPOSES OF \nIDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION\n\n 3.1 Evolution of fingerprints with age (based on a study carried out under the Commission\u2019s responsibility)\n\n Article 57(3) of the Visa Code requires that the issue of the sufficient reliability for identification and verification \npurposes of fingerprints of children under the age of 12 and, in particular, the issue of how fingerprints evolve with \nage, be addressed based on the results of a study carried out under the Commission\u2019s responsibility. The study \nwas carried out in 2013 by the Digital Citizen Security Unit of the Joint Research Centre of the Institute for the\n\n 126\n\n Protection and Security of the Citizen (JRC-IPSC). Its results were published in the \u2018Fingerprint Recognition for \nChildren\u2019 report (Report EUR 26193 EN).\n\n The JRC study addressed the question of whether or not automated fingerprint recognition for children is feasible, \nthat is, if the recognition rates obtained with this technology for children are similar to those reached for adults. The \nstudy faced two major challenges in order to draw meaningful conclusions about the changes in children\u2019s \nfingerprints over time:\n\n \u2212 As the data processed belonged to children, the JRC was logically required to implement the most stringent \nsafeguards in order to guarantee the highest level of care in preserving their rights.\n\n \u2212 On the other hand, large amounts of data were required in order for the studies to result in statistically significant \ndata. Any quantity in the range of hundreds or even thousands of properly selected test people could produce some \ninitial findings, but tens of thousands of people were required for a real performance analysis of state-of-the-art \nfingerprint recognition systems.\n\n A solution that respects these requirements was found with the support of the Portuguese government, which \nmade available a large source of children\u2019s fingerprint data from their national repository of passport data.\n\n The study\u2019s main conclusions showed that:\n\n \u2212 Growth has limited influence on fingerprint recognition \u2014 Although the passage of time was expected to be the \nmost important factor influencing children\u2019s fingerprint recognition, all tested algorithms showed the same \nrecognition rate regardless of the time elapsed between fingerprint collections (of up to 4.5 years).\n\n \u2212 Size (in terms of the dimensions of the relevant fingerprint characteristics) does not constitute any theoretical \nbarrier to automated fingerprint recognition. Within the available investigation window of up to 4.5 years between \nfingerprint colelctions, there was no theoretical barrier observed for the correct automated recognition by current \nmatching algorithms, provided the images were of sufficient quality.\n\n \u2212 Image quality (in terms of low contrast and distortion effects) is the ultimate problem for children\u2019s fingerprints, \nand image quality is strongly influenced by size. Though the observed image issues are well-known also in adults, \nthe issues get worse and the probability of problems increases with the smaller structure sizes of children\u2019s \nfingerprints. Therefore, the correct recording of fingerprints is a key factor in successful recognition.\n\n\n\n \u2212 Relevant quality metrics for fingerprints need revision with regard to the case of children. Otherwise, the reported \nquality scores might be misleading. The data and the results processed for this study can contribute to the correct \nrevision of quality metrics.\n\n \u2212 An isotropic growth model may serve as a good approximation to cover changes over time. The data from \nPortugal, with only two fingerprints per child, do not allow for a clear distinction of distortion from other effects. \nHowever, an isotropic model (i.e. linear\n\n 127\n\n growth of the fingerprint in all directions) seems to be sufficient to estimate the real level of impact that the growth \neffect has, if any.\n\n \u2212 Alternative acquisition devices for fingerprints should be seriously considered in the future. Experiments with \nmulti-spectral and touchless fingerprint capture devices, as well as with traditional devices with enhanced user \nguidance, gave promising indications on how the quality issues could be better managed \u2014 on top of already \nexisting best practice guidelines for the improvement of quality in fingerprint acquisition.\n\n These conclusions confirm that, under certain technical conditions, fingerprint recognition of children aged between \n6 and 12 years is achievable with a satisfactory level of accuracy.\n\n In order to achieve this objective, the study also makes a series of recommendations, as follows:\n\n \u2212 Image quality is key. A certain minimum level of training of operators and data subjects is necessary to acquire \nhigh-quality images. Training needs to be designed for the particular setting in which the fingerprint acquisition will \nbe carried out. Analysis of the context should be a strong prerequisite and guidelines for this purpose can be further \ndeveloped and promoted.\n\n \u2212 Matching algorithms can be further improved. Experiments with various versions of matching algorithms suggest \nthat there is still room for improvement, at least with regard to time lapses beyond five years, which could not be \naddressed by this study. An earlier study had already demonstrated the benefits of such measures. Improvements \ncan be made with respect to adaptations that addresss child feature dimensions and/or by applying the isotropic \ngrowth model. These improvements will then need to be tested and evaluated in a rigorous and fully independent \nway.\n\n \u2212 Availability of relevant test data. The significant insights gained from the Portuguese data on realistic automated \nrecognition of children\u2019s fingerprints clearly emphasise the need for long-term availability of such data for research \nand development. The key aspects of such a data repository would be its permanence (as a unique and EU-wide \nreference), full compliance with security and data protection requirements, and efficient usage (in combination with \nsecurity measures) with quality metrics.\n\n \u2212 Selection of acquisition devices. Experiments with multi-spectral, touchless and novel four-finger capture devices \ngave promising indications on how the quality issues could be better managed. These emerging technologies \nshould be further explored.\n\n The study\u2019s limitations are discussed in a chapter underlining the remaining open questions:\n\n \u2212 Calibration with adult data. The impact of the children-specific issues still needs to be more clearly distinguished \nfrom general quality-degrading issues. Therefore, performance in the recognition of adult fingerprints needs to be \n\n\n\ncompared to that of children\u2019s fingerprints where the adult data were acquired under similar conditions to children\u2019s \ndata. This would make it possible to predict the performance loss for children\u2019s data, if there are no other reasons \nfor the difference.\n\n 128\n\n \u2212 Trials on recording children\u2019s data. In order to quantify a practical age limit, given the best available technology, \nlarger field trials on recording children\u2019s data need to be conducted. These trials should further investigate and \nquantify the impact of certain devices and procedures.\n\n \u2212 Refined growth model. The current results do not contradict the assumptions of an almost isotropic growth model \nas suggested by an earlier study. At least, it seems suitable as a first order approximation for improving algorithms \nin cases where the time lapsed between fingerprint collections is not greater than the one considered in the present \nstudy (i.e. 4.5 years). However, it is desirable to draw conclusions for longer time windows (beyond five years) in \norder to give clear instructions to developers of fingerprint recognition systems.\n\n 3.2 Impact of the evolution of fingerprints with age on the reliability of their use for the purposes of the person\u2019s \nidentification and verification\n\n The results of the study seem to indicate that, from a technical point of view, automated fingerprint recognition for \nchildren is feasible, provided some technical obstacles related to image quality and the revision of quality metrics \nare overcome, and alternative acquisition devices for the fingerprints of children are considered.\n\n Apart from the technology upgrade that is needed in order to ensure the reliable use of children\u2019s fingerprints for \nthe purposes of identification and verification, there are other considerations to keep in mind before deciding on the \ncollection of children\u2019s fingerprints. As biometric identifiers are taken with the main purpose of facilitating the fight \nagainst visa fraud, it needs to be assessed whether this policy objective is to be pursued in the case of children \nunder the age of 12 \u2014 have cases of fraud, attempts to bypass the criteria for determination of the Member State \nresponsible for examining the visa application, or any other of the objectives set out in the VIS Regulation been \nidentified in relation to children under the age of 12? If yes, is the scope of such phenomena significant enough to \njustify this measure? The pertinence of and need for identifying and verifying children under the age of 12 must be \nclear for further action to be taken in this area.\n\n 129\n\n Annex 4: Technical progress made regarding the use of fingerprints at external borders on the basis of Article 50(5) \nof Regulation 767/2008 (the VIS Regulation)\n\n Technical readiness of VIS use at the external border crossing points\n\n Summary: The gradual worldwide rollout of the Visa Information System (VIS) that completed on 20 November \n2015 contributed to a progressive introduction of fingerprint-based verifications at borders as from October 2014. \nThe vast majority of Member States started gradually to use the fingerprints from the moment the biometric checks \nbecame mandatory, although some states started checking fingerprints as part of pilot projects. When considering \nthe number of issued visas with fingerprints and the related checks at borders, the evaluation found that Member \nStates have overall made progress on the use of the fingerprints at external borders. The evaluation also identified \nways of increasing the proportion of visa holders whose fingerprints are actually checked at borders.\n\n\n\n The Member States have established the appropriate capacities and organisational framework to cope with tasks \nrelated to the use of fingerprints both at first and second lines. Although some regions were issuing visas without \nfingerprints ahead of the coordinated rollout of visas with fingerprints, the proportion of visas checked with the visa \nsticker number together with fingerprints has not yet reached the optimal figure. The evaluation also identified areas \nwhere improvement was needed: among the most noteworthy was the proportion of visa holders checked (with or \nwithout the fingerprints), which remained below 50 %.\n\n Given Member States\u2019 limited contributions to the survey, the evaluation found that it remains difficult to determine \na realistic figure for the number of border crossing points equipped with fixed or mobile devices for the capture of \nfingerprints.\n\n The evaluation found that outside the first months of running the new system, Member States have experienced \nvery few hardware or software problems and infrequent administrative impediments to checking fingerprints at \nexternal borders. Cases where multiple scans were needed to collect fingerprints of sufficient quality and attempts \nat spoofing have been reported as sporadic.\n\n The evaluation found that the process to check visas at borders is significantly influenced by the visa marking \nthough a slight difference exists between the meaning of the marking and its actual use. The evaluation also found \nthat situations where capturing devices and the VIS are unavailable are managed using appropriate alternative \nprocedures.\n\n Most Member States started performing systematic checks against the VIS at the external borders on the basis of \nfingerprints, at least as concerns visa holders\u2019 data present in the VIS,\n\n 130\n\n in October 2014 i.e. three years after the start of operations as per Regulation 81/2009, which amended Regulation \n(EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the VIS at borders.117\n\n Figure 1: Number of Member States per start date for fingerprint-based checks\n\n Seven Member States declared not having encountered technical problems or administrative impediments in \nchecking fingerprints at external borders. Nine Member States declared having experienced such problems. Two \nMember States did not respond.\n\n The main reasons were:\n\n - limited hardware performance;\n\n - problems with visa sticker scanning due to its variable location on the passport page;\n\n - software not sufficiently prepared for visa applications with no fingerprints;\n\n - possible negative match of the traveller\u2019s fingerprints with those in the VIS;\n\n\n\n - insufficient quality of fingerprints collected in consular posts or damage to the traveller\u2019s fingerprints;\n\n - the absence of fingerprints in the VIS for a region already rolled out;118\n\n - resistance to fingerprint-based checks at borders;\n\n - long waiting times for fingerprint-based identifications performed for second line checks;\n\n - national system unavailability due to maintenance;\n\n - care required in the capturing process because of the devices (cleaning of the surface, maintenance).\n\n 117 REGULATION (EC) No 81/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 January \n2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the \nSchengen Borders Code.\n\n 118 The VIS Regulation allows for not capturing the fingerprints when it is factually not possible or when not legally \nrequired \u2014 e.g. for heads of state, royal families.\n\n 131\n\n Out of the 19 Member States that contributed to the survey, 16 provided figures on the number of border crossing \npoints equipped with fingerprint fixed stations or capturing devices.\n\n For air border crossing points, the number amounts to 269. This figure is to be considered together with the 677 \nairports and aerodromes declared by Member States and documented in Annex 4 to the Schengen Handbook.119\n\n In reality, the number of possible non-equipped air border crossing points might be compensated by organisational \nmeasures implemented by Member States. These measures consist for example in having mobile capturing \ndevices or in conveying the travellers to another border crossing point hosting fingerprint stations. This can be the \ncase for some aerodromes where travellers subject to fingerprint checks have to be conveyed to the nearest \nequipped border crossing points by the competent authorities. Although not specified in the survey, this practice is \noften cited by practitioners in Member States with a high number of small airports or aerodromes.\n\n Due to the absence of information about the flow of passengers processed at equipped borders, one can only \nassume that the border crossing points facing the most substantial flows have been equipped as a priority.\n\n Most of the Member States who provided the date from which the equipment is in use mentioned October 2014 or \nthe subsequent months. Two Member States indicated October 2011, probably because of the existence of national \nprogrammes such as an entry-exit system.\n\n Overall, 192 maritime border crossing points are equipped with a fixed station, with 77 for Norway in particular. The \nnumber of sea border crossing points is 842. Here also, the difference might be compensated by organisational \nmeasures consisting, as previously, in using mobile stations or conveying the travellers to the nearest border \ncrossing point hosting fingerprint stations. Although not specified in the survey, this practice is cited by practitioners \nof Member States with a high number of sea ports.\n\n\n\n The Frontex report on the use of the VIS at borders (\u2018Implementation and Operation of Visa Information System at \nNational Level as of 2015\u2019, section 3.1.1, February/March 2016) found that a majority of pedestrians (81 %) and \ncars (64 %) on ferries are checked with fixed readers.\n\n The top three Member States in terms of maritime border crossing points (i.e. Denmark, Germany and Italy), have \neither not participated or not provided figures.\n\n 119 \u2018Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook)\u2019 containing common guidelines, best practice \nand recommendations on border controls.\n\n 132\n\n Most of the Member States who provided the date from which the equipment is in use mentioned October 2014 or \nthe subsequent couple of months. Member State contributions, however, remain limited.\n\n 74 land border crossing points are equipped with fixed stations, with 18 for Greece, 4 for Slovakia, 7 for Estonia, 1 \nfor Norway and 35 for Lithuania. The Member States presenting the highest number of land border crossing points \n(including on railways) are: Hungary (47), Slovenia (35, excluding crossing points for local border traffic), Poland \n(32), Greece (19), Finland (16), Lithuania (12) and France (10). The overall number of land border crossing points is \n344 (including 85 on railways).\n\n 74 points are equipped with fixed stations. This provides coverage of 22 %, a figure that can be explained by \nfactors such as:\n\n \u2022 the presence of mobile stations;\n\n \u2022 the very limited number of answers in this survey: the top three Member States in terms of number of land border \ncrossing points did not provide figures.\n\n The Frontex report on the use of the VIS at borders found that a majority of cars and lorries are checked with fixed \nreaders installed in the booth.120\n\n The number of air border crossing points declared as having a fingerprint mobile station or capturing devices is 53, \nwhich represents a small proportion (8 %) of all air borders (53 out of 677). The Frontex report found that mobile \ndevices are used for private airplanes or military airports.\n\n The top three Member States in terms of the number of air border crossing points did not participate or did not \nprovide any figures. As five Member States provided positive replies and eight Member States provided a zero \nfigure, the precision of the findings is questionable.\n\n Out of the 27 reported air border crossing points equipped with fingerprint mobile readers for which the number of \nfingers checked was indicated:\n\n \u2022 18 are equipped with a 1-finger mobile reader (67 % of reported cases); and\n\n \u2022 9 (33 %) are equipped with two-finger readers.\n\n\n\n The vast majority of Member States replying to the survey indicated that mobile stations or capturing devices in \nairports were available for the official date of the start of fingerprint-based checks, i.e. October 2014. Two Member \nStates indicated that mobile solutions had been available since 2011. However, the response rate remains low so \nno general trend can be derived from these findings.\n\n 120 Section 3.1.1.\n\n 133\n\n The number of sea border crossing points declared as having a mobile station or capturing devices (irrespective of \nthe number of fingers checked), is 19, which represents a very small proportion (2.3 %) of all sea borders (19 out of \n842 when excluding rivers). Without entering into detailed considerations about the volume of the traffic at declared \ncrossing points, the figures show that mobile stations are used in limited cases. 9 % (1 out of 11) of declared \nmaritime border crossing points are equipped with a 1-finger mobile reader; for the other border crossing points, the \nnumber of fingerprints checked is not specified.\n\n No reply was provided by the top three Member States. To date, 4 Member States out of 20 with a maritime border \nhave replied to the question. Although the contributions are insufficient to represent the overall community of \nMember States with a maritime border, the conclusion coincides with the Frontex report findings, namely that a \nminority of pedestrians (19 %) and cars (36 %) on ferries are checked using mobile readers.\n\n One Member State replying to the survey indicated having mobile stations or capturing devices available in sea \nports in time for the official date of the start of fingerprint-based checks, i.e. October 2014. One Member State \nindicated that a mobile solution had been available since 2011, while another Member State reported a date of \nJune 2015.\n\n Four Member States reported that land border crossing points are equipped with a mobile reader (one of these \nMember States uses 1-finger readers). The number of land border crossing points declared as having a mobile \ndevice is 13, which represents 72 % of those Member States\u2019 land border crossing points. Considering the number \nof Member States that declared having no mobile equipment, mobile stations are limited to 4 % of all land borders \n(13 out of 344 when excluding crossing points for local border traffic). One of the top three Member States in terms \nof the number of border crossing points responded that it has no mobile devices.\n\n One Member State mentioned having mobile stations or capturing devices available at land border crossing points \nin time for the official date of the start of fingerprint-based checks, i.e. October 2014. One Member State indicated \nthat a mobile solution has been available since 2011. The contributions are, however, insufficient to be considered \nas reflecting the overall reality.\n\n For all types of border crossing points, Member States were not in a position to indicate the average number of \nattempts to collect fingerprints of sufficient quality in first line checks.\n\n On the basis of information collected from the Member States participating in the survey, the usual border check \nprocedure at the first line can be summarised as follows (the split is for readability purposes only).\n\n 134\n\n\n\n Part 1:\n\n - for land border checks that involve a car, the vehicle\u2019s registration documents are verified;\n\n - the travel document is verified in order to establish whether it is valid;\n\n - it is established by visual check that the person being checked is the same one as in the document;\n\n - the machine readable zone (MRZ) of the travel document is scanned; otherwise the information is entered \nmanually;\n\n - the relevant European (SIS II), international (Interpol) and national databases are consulted.\n\n Part 2:\n\n - the visa MRZ is scanned;\n\n - if there is a record in the VIS, fingerprints are collected only if the visa marking indicates the visa was issued in a \nregion for which fingerprint-based checks have been rolled out.\n\n Part 3:\n\n - thorough check in accordance with Article 7 of the Schengen Borders Code;\n\n - if entry conditions are met, including the availability of remaining days in the maximum duration of stay, the entry \nstamp is affixed. If not, the traveller goes through a second line check, following which entry can be refused.\n\n It is frequently reported that, as per the procedure in Part 2, fingerprints are collected once there is evidence that \nthe visa exists in the VIS and that fingerprints are attached to the application. This process in two steps is not \nprecisely the one set out in the VIS Regulation, which requires the VIS to be consulted on the basis of the visa \napplication and the fingerprints together.\n\n The time processing ranges from 7 to 10 seconds from the submission of the verification request to the result \ndelivery at border crossing points.\n\n One Member State reported that during the processing of the consultation by national and central systems, border \nguards ask questions such as the purpose and duration of the journey, check the financial means, etc. Some \nMember States reported that a document drafted in the national tongue exists so as to describe the different steps \nto follow.\n\n Overall, 12 Member States replied to the question asking them to provide a brief description of the different steps \nfollowed in the border checking process at the first line, including the collection of fingerprints.\n\n\n\n The visa marking significantly influences the border checking. Generally, the following approach is adopted:\n\n 135\n\n - \u2018VIS\u2019 or \u2018VIS 0\u2019: verification of the visa in the VIS, based on the visa sticker number;\n\n - \u2018VIS\u2019: verification of the visa in the VIS, based on the visa sticker number and the fingerprints;\n\n - No marking: verification without fingerprints.\n\n Unexpectedly, some Member States report that the VIS is only consulted when the visa marking is \u2018VIS\u2019.\n\n A two-step approach was applied by some Member States until October 2014, when mandatory collection of up to \nfour fingerprints commenced. The two-step practice consists in:\n\n 1. consulting the VIS on the basis of the visa sticker number only;\n\n 2. if there are fingerprints in the VIS, possibly collecting fingerprints and proceeding with an electronic \nauthentication.\n\n There is no evidence that this practice has completely disappeared immediately since October 2014. The latest \nfigures on border checks show a gradual replacement of verification based on the visa sticker number by \nverification based on the visa sticker number together with the fingerprints.\n\n One Member State reported more values for the marking than just \u2018VIS\u2019 and \u2018VIS 0\u2019. \u2018VIS 0\u2019 remains the most \nreliable means to decide whether fingerprints have to be collected. However, the survey shows that the visa \nmarking is not entirely used as per the original meaning: \u2018VIS\u2019 does not mean that no fingerprints exist for the \ntraveller, but that the visa was issued in a country where the collection of fingerprints was required. Similarly \u2018VIS 0\u2019 \ndoes not mean that there are no fingerprints but that fingerprints were not required for the country when the visa \nwas issued. In practice, fingerprints are affixed to visas with a \u2018VIS\u2019 marking and Member States rarely collect \nfingerprints ahead of the official rollout date in countries where \u2018VIS 0\u2019 applies. One Member State noted that the \nmarking VIS should unambiguously mean \u2018presence of fingerprints\u2019.\n\n The root causes of problems met during the border checking are documented as follows.\n\n 11 Member States reported no or sporadic technical errors involving the scanning devices at first and second line \nchecks. Some Member States reported that the number of issues decreased over time as end-users gained \nexperience of the devices.\n\n The details provided by four Member States for first line checks are as follows:\n\n - malfunction of the document & fingerprint scanner;\n\n\n\n - long response time (6 seconds);\n\n - device unable to scan correctly or multiple fingerprint scan.\n\n For second line checks, one Member State mentioned long response times (sometimes without any result \nreceived) as a problem.\n\n 136\n\n Judging from three Member State contributions, cases where multiple scans are needed to obtain sufficient \nfingerprint quality tend to occur occasionally at first line and even more rarely at second line.\n\n Member States did not report other issues relating to the scanning device: few replies mentioned occasional \nproblems at first line and rare problems at second line.\n\n One Member State reported that some visa holders may require assistance during enrolment for first line checks.\n\n Member States reported no issue on response times.\n\n Four Member States reported that the absence of a match between the traveller\u2019s fingerprints and those in the VIS \noccurs rarely both at first and second lines. One Member State reported no such cases, while other Member States \neither did not respond or reported not having statistics on this topic.\n\n Two Member States indicated that spoofing attempts occur rarely, while one Member State reported no such \ncases.\n\n Four Member States reported that software or hardware issues occurred rarely.\n\n One Member State reported issues with workstations during the initial launching of the system. However, for first \nand second lines, all computer workstations were replaced and contributed to increasing the overall efficiency.\n\n Alternative solutions are used in the absence of applicable normal conditions i.e. when the fingerprints cannot be \ncollected with a scanning device or when access to the VIS is not possible. Alternative solutions are reported as \nfollows.\n\n When the fingerprints cannot be collected with a scanning device, Member States compare the traveller\u2019s \ndocument alphanumeric data and live face with the alphanumeric data and the facial image stored in the VIS.\n\n When access to the VIS is impossible, the border guard follows the approach applied before the introduction of \nthe VIS. Both the visa sticker and the travel document are checked to ensure they have not been counterfeited or \nfalsified. A check of national, SIS II and Interpol databases is also carried out to verify that the document is not \nstolen, what the purpose of the journey is and whether there are any other prior records. However, this check is not \nreported as being carried out widely and systematically. In the event of suspicion of a false travel document, a \nsecond line check is performed. The border guard proceeds with a risk analysis and may contact the consular post \nthat issued the visa to request the alphanumeric data and photo.\n\n\n\n 137\n\n With the exception of three Member States that did not provide information, all Member States reported that the \ncollection of fingerprints has not been automated in a border crossing system such as an ABC- or e-Gate.\n\n Implications of technical progress in the use of fingerprints at external borders on the duration of searches\n\n Summary\n\n The evaluation found that the overall impact on the time taken to collect and verify fingerprints at air borders is on \naverage 26 seconds, while for sea borders the figure is 44 seconds. For vehicles at land borders, the information \nprovided was sparse. One Member State reported an impact of 15 seconds. For trains, two Member States \nprovided contributions, resulting in an average of 42 seconds. The limited information provided meant that the \nimpact on the queue length could not be determined. The evaluation found that no Member States reported \nsearches entailing excessive waiting times at border crossing points. The average time taken for fingerprint \nauthentication between sending data from the border crossing point and getting the result from the VIS is \napproximately six seconds.\n\n Based on the input from eight Member States, the average time for fingerprint collection (including possible retries \nand other issues) is 23 seconds for air border crossing points. This correlates with the result of the Entry/Exit \nSystem (EES) pilot:121 \u2018The added duration of the border-control process is directly linked to the number of \nfingerprints enrolled and the desired quality: enrolling four FPs (fingerprints) had the least impact on time and is \nconsidered to have a relatively limited impact on the border-crossing process, with the vast majority of cases being \nperformed in under 30 seconds on average. At air borders, average durations ranged from 17 seconds for 4 FPs to \n60 seconds for 10 FPs. [\u2026 122]\u2019.\n\n On the basis of contributions from three Member States, the estimated average time for fingerprint collection was \n30 seconds for sea borders. Four Member States replies supported an average of 26 seconds for land border \ncrossing points (excluding trains). Three replies helped to approximate the average in trains to 30 seconds.\n\n All border crossing points considered, the estimated maximum time to swiftly collect 90 % of visa holders\u2019 \nfingerprints is 12 seconds, as calculated based on seven replies. One Member State mentioned that results were \nimproving over time, citing the following five quarterly figures: 45, 30, 20 and finally 10 seconds by the last two \nquarters of 2015.\n\n The average time for fingerprint authentication between sending data from the border crossing point and getting \nthe result from the VIS is approximately 6 seconds. This figure is based on the contribution of nine Member States \nfor figures on air and three for sea and land border crossing points.\n\n 121 Smart Borders Pilot Project \u2014 Report on the technical conclusions of the Pilot \u2014 Volume 1, doi: 10.2857/08, \npage 8.\n\n 122 \u2018At sea, durations ranged from an average of 20 (4 FPs) to 46 seconds (10 FPs), and at land borders from 21 \n(4 FPs) to 49 seconds (10 FPs)\u2019.\n\n 138\n\n\n\n Based on the input from nine Member States, the maximum time taken to most swiftly authenticate 90 % of visa \nholders is 27 seconds. This average figure includes an outlier reply of 180 seconds.\n\n All things considered, the overall impact on the time taken to collect and verify fingerprints at air borders is on \naverage 26 seconds. This figure is based on seven contributions. One Member State indicated that it is quite \ndifficult to provide a precise time, as it depends on whether the person knows the process of fingerprint checking or \nnot. If the person already knows how the process works, it usually takes about 15 seconds to collect fingerprints \ncorrectly and the whole process takes no more than 30 seconds, system response time included. Another Member \nState reported by three-month periods figures of 60, 45, 32, and 30 seconds for the two last quarters of 2015.\n\n The overall impact on the time taken to collect and verify fingerprints at sea borders is on average 44 seconds. \nThis figure is based on two to three contributions depending on the type of border crossing point, which detracts \nfrom the level of confidence we can have in the figures.\n\n The overall impact of the collection and verification of fingerprints on queues at airports cannot be reliably \nassessed on the basis of a single contribution. One Member State remarked that queue length does not depend \nonly on the use of fingerprints, as there are other factors to consider and therefore no precise number can be \nprovided. Only one contribution reported increasing lines at border crossing points for travel groups from China and \nRussia since the implementation of the VIS. No data were made available for sea borders.\n\n For vehicles at land borders, one Member State reported an impact of 15 seconds. For trains, two Member States \nmade contributions, resulting in an average of 42 seconds.\n\n The average waiting time for a traveller\u2019s border crossing check is:\n\n \u2022 one minute for air (five contributions);\n\n \u2022 55 seconds for sea (one contribution);\n\n \u2022 70 seconds for cars and trucks (one contribution);\n\n \u2022 35 seconds for trains (two contributions).\n\n No relevant data were collected for buses.\n\n 140\n\n Annex 5 \u2013 VIS evaluation questionnaire\n\n Questionnaire I \u2013 Evaluation on the basis of Article 50(4) of Regulation 767/2008 (the VIS Regulation)\n\n Relevant law provision\n\n Topics to be covered\n\n Authority in charge with providing the data\n\n\n\n Type of information requested\n\n Specific questions\n\n I.
