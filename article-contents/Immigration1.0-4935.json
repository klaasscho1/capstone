{"title": "INS to End Private Testing for Citizenship", "body": "\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service announced yesterday it will end the private testing of citizenship \napplicants and take over the work itself as part of a plan to reform the naturalization process.\n\nFive private testing organizations have been told they may administer the required English and civics tests until \nAug. 30, the INS said.\nTest certificates awarded through that date will be accepted by the agency for up to one year.\n\nINS Commissioner Doris M. Meissner said the change is intended \"to reduce fraud and to improve customer \nservice and efficiency.\" The private groups and about 1,000 subcontractors account for about 15 percent of \ncitizenship testing. The program has been subject to fraud, allowing thousands of immigrants to pass the tests by \npaying hundreds of dollars each to private administrators.\n\nCompiled from reports by staff writers Eric Pianin, Terry M. Neal and William Branigin.\n"}
