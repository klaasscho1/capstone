{"title": "Automatic Deportation Law Isn't Retroactive, Judge Says", "body": "\nThe Government cannot use the 1996 antiterrorism law to automatically deport legal immigrants who were \nconvicted of some crimes before it was enacted, a Federal judge ruled yesterday.\n\nThe judge, Jack B. Weinstein of United States District Court in Brooklyn, ruled that the Justice Department cannot \nretroactively deny those immigrants the chance to ask an immigration judge to allow them to stay in the country on \nhumanitarian grounds, or the chance to ask a Federal district court to review the deportation order for a legal error.\n\nHis ruling rejected an order Attorney General Janet Reno issued last year that the law be applied even if the crime \nwas committed decades ago and, in some cases, even after an immigration judge had already blocked the \ndeportation.\n\nIn a stinging rebuke to Ms. Reno, Judge Weinstein characterized her legal reasoning as irrational and her order as \n\"an arbitrary abuse of power.\" He said the Reno policy would be cruel to immigrants who may have come to this \ncountry as children, committed a crime, rehabilitated themselves and have families here who depend on them.\n\nLawyers for the Government said an appeal was likely. \"We believe the Government's position is consistent with \nSupreme Court precedent and Congress's reasonable efforts to streamline the often abused deportation process \nso that aliens convicted of serious crimes can be expeditiously deported,\" said Scott Dunn, an assistant United \nStates attorney.\n\nJudge Weinstein's ruling comes at a time when the law on deportation of immigrants with criminal records is in a \nhighly unsettled state, immigration law experts say. Dozens of legal challenges to laws adopted last year are \npending around the country. But the experts said they knew of no other ruling that had addressed the issue of \nretroactivity.\n\nCongress twice changed the law last year on the deportation of criminal aliens, first in April in the antiterrorism law \nand again in September. Both times, it significantly broadened the offenses that lead to mandatory deportation, but \nthe two laws defined those crimes differently. Immigration lawyers and Federal officials disagree about which law \nshould apply in which cases.\n\nThe resolution of these legal quandaries will affect the lives of thousands of immigrants. As the Government has \nmoved more aggressively to deport immigrants with criminal records, the number asking immigration judges to \nwaive their deportation on humanitarian grounds has risen sharply, to 6,517 last year. In the 1990's, immigration \n\n\njudges have typically allowed more than 40 percent of immigrants who sought waivers to remain in the country. But \nsince October, the approval rate has fallen to 18 percent.\n\nJudge Weinstein set aside the deportation orders for the two plaintiffs in the case before him: Saul Navas, a 22-\nyear-old Panamanian convicted of driving a stolen car and snatching a purse, and Guillermo Mojica, a 56-year-old \nColombian convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine in 1988.  Both were longtime legal residents of the United \nStates whose immediate families live in this country.\n\nThe judge also ruled that Federal district courts have broad authority to review immigration judges' deportation \norders against immigrants with criminal records -- an authority that other Federal judges have interpreted more \nnarrowly.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants and civil libertarians who have sued the government around the country said yesterday \nthat they hoped the force of Judge Weinstein's legal reasoning in his 103-page ruling would influence courts \nbeyond his jurisdiction.\n\n\"The Justice Department is asking for the unprecedented power to act as law enforcement and then as judge if \nanyone challenges the legality of its actions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties \nUnion's Immigrants' Rights Project, which helped represent the men. \"We are fighting to insure that no one is \nerroneously deported based solely on the word of the Justice Department.\"\n\nUntil Congress adopted the antiterrorism law in April 1996, legal permanent residents who had committed crimes \ndefined by Congress as \"aggravated felonies\" and who had served five years or more in prison were generally the \nonly ones subject to mandatory deportation. Immigrants who had committed other crimes or who had served less \nthan five years could ask an immigration judge to waive their deportation on humanitarian grounds.\n\nBut the antiterrorism law barred those waivers for a greatly expanded range of crimes, including ones that Judge \nWeinstein called relatively minor offenses -- for example, one minor drug possession charge or two misdemeanor \npetty theft charges.\n\nLawyers for the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service contended that the antiterrorism law should apply \nto all pending applications for waivers of deportation, even if the crimes had been committed long ago. The Board \nof Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative tribunal in the immigration system, disagreed.\n\nMs. Reno then overruled the board, deciding that the law should be retroactive, though she noted that nothing in \nthe law \"specifies either that it is to be applied in pending proceedings or that it is not.\"\n\nJudge Weinstein found that Congress had included explicit language making other sections of the law retroactive, \nbut had not done so on the issue of eligibility for waivers of deportation. Without a clear expression of Congress's \nintent, the law cannot be applied retroactively, he said.\n\n\"Retroactive application would create a situation in which people who have lived in the community, have \nestablished themselves as valuable members of society, and who are needed to support their families, are \nsummarily deported without regard to the present and future interests of their families or the community at large,\" \nthe judge wrote.\n\n      \n"}
