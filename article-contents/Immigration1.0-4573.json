{"title": "Noriko Calderon's Case - Is Japanese Immigration Law Too Cruel?", "body": "\n   Apr. 14, 2009 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \n\nArlan Cruz Calderon and his wife Sarah Calderon illegally migrated to Japan in the early 1990s from their home in \nthe Philippines.  Their daughter Noriko was born in Japan. Arlan got himself a job with a construction company and \nNoriko went to school like any other Japanese girl, until the Calderons were detected in 2006 had deportation \nproceedings initiated against them.  \n\nThe Calderons fought the immigration department?s deportation ruling till the last minute. Finally, the inevitable \ncould no longer be avoided. The Calderon?s were asked to leave Japan and under Japanese law they cannot \nreturn for five years. \n\nDaughter Noriko, however, was given a choice. She could leave Japan for the Philippines with her parents or she \ncould stay back though she is not a Japanese national. Being born in Japan does not confer automatic citizenship, \nunless at least one parent is a Japanese national. Thirteen year old Noriko opted to stay back in Japan.  The \nCalderon?s lawyers collected around 2,000 signatures in support of the Calderons right to stay back. It was argued \nthat Arlan has a stable job and that Noriko can speak only Japanese. The immigration department refused to \nbudge. \n\nThe Japanese immigration department?s decision has been attacked by many as cruel and harsh on the \nCalderons. But is it? Consider this:   \n\n* Noriko is not being forced to stay back. She has the option of going back to Philippines with her parents. \n\n* Should an illegal immigrant(s) get favourable treatment solely because s/he has a child? \n\n* Is going back to Philippines the end of the world? Philippines may not be a developed country, but surely people \ndo get by over there.\n\nThere is no doubt that Japanese immigration law is very harsh compared to that of other developed countries. In \nthe US, any child born in the US is entitled to US citizenship, irrespective of the status of the child?s parents. This \n\n\nused to be the case in the UK till 1983. Currently, any child born in the UK (even to illegal immigrants) can become \na British citizen if the child lives in the UK until the age of 10. \n\nBy contrast, Japan does not have any form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. \n\nBeing born in Japan does not confer citizenship, unless at least one parent is a Japanese national. Therefore, one \nfinds many Japanese residents of foreign descent and nationality, especially Koreans, who have lived in Japan for \nmany generations.  Of course, Japan is not the only developed country with such harsh laws. \n\nSwiss immigration laws are almost as harsh. Being born in Switzerland does not entitled one to Swiss nationality \nat any point. There are many foreign nationals who have lived in Switzerland for their entire lifetimes, who are \nunable to get Swiss citizenship. Theoretically, anyone who has lived in Switzerland for a dozen years and can \nspeak one of the four Swiss languages can apply for Swiss nationality. A decision is made by the local Canton on \nthe basis of how well the applicant has integrated into Swiss life. Many applicants are rejected. As a result, there \nare third generation Swiss residents who do not have Swiss nationality. In 2004, a bill was introduced which sought \nto give automatic Swiss nationality to individuals who have lived in Switzerland for three generations and an easier \nnaturalistion process for the second generation. The bill was rejected, mainly as a result of opposition from the \nGerman speaking parts of Switzerland.  \n\nOf course, there are very rich countries whose immigration laws are much harsher than Switzerland or Japan. I \nam referring to the Sheikdoms in the middle-east, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but I wouldn't call them developed \ncountries.  There is no doubt in my mind that Japan?s immigration laws are harsh. However, I don?t think the \nJapanese immigration department is being unduly harsh on the Calderons or on Noriko. \n\n Newstex ID: CRIT-0009-34134112 \n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs on Demand\u00ae\") are solely the \nauthor's and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.
