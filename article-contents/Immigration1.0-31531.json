It was mere speculation.\"\n\nPeters' Lawyer, John Legge, said she \"respectfully disagrees\" with the decision and is weighing whether or not to \nchallenge the ruling.\n\n\"As an appeal is being considered, and may be brought, neither my client nor I can say more at this time,\" Legge \nwrote in an email.\n\nThe teen's troubles began in the spring of 2005 when she joined the school track and field team as a sprinter and \nlong-jumper, according to an agreed statement of facts presented in the ruling.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 19, Peters alleged she was practising long jumps at the school's pit when she injured her \nleft knee. X-rays taken the next day showed some \"joint effusion,\" and she was sent home after having her knee \niced and wrapped in a tensor bandage.\n\n\nContinuing discomfort sent her to her doctor three months later, and a subsequent MRI revealed a tear in the knee.\n\nThe decision stated that she underwent a partial lateral meniscus meniscectomy in January 2006.\n\nVarious medical experts were called as part of the suit and confirmed that Peters' knee had deteriorated over the \nyears. Most of them, however, cited her weight as a key factor in the decline and concluded her current struggles \nwere not related to her previous track and field injury.\n\nPeters' legal action was focused on employees at her former high school, whom she accused of being negligent \nbefore, during and after the injury.\n\nShe alleged that coach Lana Del Maestro did not instruct her on safe jumping techniques, did not inspect the \ncondition of the long jump pit prior to the injury, and did not check on her while she waited for transport home.\n\nEdwards dismissed Peters claims in this and nearly every other facet of her testimony, noting that her evidence \nchanged noticeably at various phases of the trial process.\n\n\"I have concluded that Ms. Peters' evidence is not reliable,\" he wrote of her overall testimony. \"Her evidence was \nreplete with inconsistencies, some insignificant; some very significant.\"\n\nEdwards also pointed to times at which Peters' evidence was contradicted by third-party documents, such as school \nand hospital records that indicate her recollection of key dates was faulty.\n\nFor instance, Peters claimed missing weeks of class after sustaining her injury, while documents from the school \nsuggest she missed only a handful of courses the day afterwards.\n\nThose documents, in turn, tally with provincial health records showing she sought treatment at the hospital on that \nday, a fact Peters had denied.\n\nEdwards was equally candid in Peters' assessment of the impact her injury had on her artistic goals.\n\nShe said she abandoned her acting dreams in university after securing a role that required her to throw herself to \nthe ground while on stage. She contended her physical limitation prevented her from executing that move and said \nshe nearly lost the part as a result.\n\nA guest speaker at the American university she attended later advised her to abandon acting due both to her \nweight and her previous knee injury.\n\nEdwards said Peters undertook minimal training to achieve her career goals even before her injury, citing enrolment \nin a single hip hop dance class, a few years of private vocal coaching and one year of high school drama.\n\nIn dismissing Peters' lawsuit and declining to award damages, Edwards was blunt in his assessment: \"I find that \nthere is no reason to calculate the differential between the earnings of an actor, dancer and singer to what \noccupations Ms. Peters can now likely attain.\"\n\nFollow @mich_mcq on Twitter\n"}
