STEPHEN HORN (R-CA): The quorum being present, the hearing of the Subcommittee on Government \nEfficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations will come to order.\n\nOnly two months after the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11th, this nation is just beginning to \nunderstand the dimensions of a dramatically changing world. Preserving the American way of life requires \nadaptation and sacrifice. It means using this nation's unique strengths to address the vulnerabilities that terrorists \nexploited at an enormous human toll. Technology is one of America's greatest strengths. In recent weeks some \nhave called for using that technology to combat terrorism by developing a national identification system. Proponents \nof such a system argue that a hi- tech national identifier system linking federal and state databases would allow \nauthorities to spot terrorists before they attack.\n\nSome of the September 11th terrorists were in the United States illegally. Supporters say that had such a system \nbeen in place, airline personnel would have been able to crosscheck passenger lists against various watch lists. \nThe airlines would have known that the men should not have been in the country, let alone on an airplane. Those \nwho oppose such a system are concerned about the impact a national identifier system would have been on the \nvery precepts of America's freedoms.\n\nGiven the vast amount of personal information that could be placed in a national identification system, there is \nlegitimate cause for concern over its potential abuse or mismanagement. In the event that such a system were \nadopted, it must incorporate sufficient safeguards to prevent the abuse of power by those who would have access \nto the information and those with the authority to demand an individual's identification.\n\nThe technical issues involved in a database project of this magnitude must also be considered. Is it possible to \ndevelop a system that is both fraud resistant and secure? Freedom is the most precious gift to Americans. The \nterrorists knew it and took good advantage of it. Freedom itself was the target of the September 11th attacks. If that \nfreedom is lost in the pursuit of justice, the terrorists will have won, even if they themselves are punished. Although \nholding firm to America's freedoms, we must also be open to new ideas. The survival of this great nation may \ndepend on it.\n\nI welcome our witnesses today and I look forward to their testimony. But before giving you the oath I will yield time \nfor the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, and -- for an opening statement.\n\nREP. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank this panel of witnesses for \ncoming here today.\n\nIn the wake up September 11th we're faced with an enormous challenge of balancing the need for enhanced \nnational security with the need for protecting civil rights of the public. In the past, some efforts in the name of \n\n\nnational security, in my view, have gone too far and have endangered those liberties. We've learned that once that \nkind of harm is done, it's difficult to repair.\n\nDuring World War 2 we uprooted thousands of Japanese Americans and placed them in internment camps. It is \ngenerally recognized today, over 50 years later, that the internment was a mistake. In fact, it was clear at the time \nthat there was no danger of sabotage from those individuals. As historian Margo Anderson points out, in November \n1941, in response to a request by President Roosevelt, John Franklin Carter wrote to the president, \"There is no \nJapanese problem on the coast. There will be no armed uprising of Japanese.\" Nonetheless thousands of \nJapanese Americans, many of whom were citizens, were rounded up and placed into camps.\n\nToday we have a monument to those that were mistreated just north of the Senate office buildings, and our \ngovernment has officially apologized. However, getting to that apology and the monument was extremely difficult \nand did not repair the harm done. Liberty and sense of security lost by those interns cannot be given back. We must \nbe careful not to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nLast week on Thursday, before Veteran's Day, I went to the floor of the House to pay tribute to those who have \nserved our country in the defense of freedom. We have fought hard throughout our history to maintain a free and \nopen society. We must not sacrifice those freedoms in the name of war. If we sacrifice our freedom, we lose the war \nno matter what the military outcome.\n\nThe security measures we proposed in response to terrorism must pass three tests. Are they effective? Can they be \napplied without discrimination? Can they be implemented without sacrificing our fundamental freedom of due \nprocess, privacy and equality? The proposal for a national identification system is not new. It has failed in the past \nbecause it cannot pass these fundamental tests. The Congress passed an Immigration Reform Act in 1996, which \ncontained a number of provisions that would have led to a national identification system. Since that law was \npassed, those provisions have steadily been tiered back. One provision was repealed and another modified to the \npoint where it could not be administered at the land border between the United States and its neighbors.\n\nIn the Patriot Act, the House has reaffirmed those provisions knowing that they had no teeth. The events of \nSeptember 11th show us that systems like national identification cards will not deter crazed terrorists from their \nmission. Those terrorists all have driver's licenses, credit cards and Internet accounts. I urge all of us and each of \nyou to pay close attention to the effects your proposal will have on the fundamental freedoms on which this country \nwas founded: freedom of speech and religion, freedom to assembly, freedom of the press, freedom from \nunreasonable search and seizure, and freedom from imprisonment without due process. Those freedoms cannot be \nignored in the name of homeland security. As members of Congress we must evaluate any proposal offered in the \nname of enhanced security. Does it do what it claims to do? What is the burden on the public in terms of time \nconsumed and freedom lost? Do the benefits outweigh the cost? Is there an incremental gain in security and does it \njustify the loss of freedom?\n\nI look forward to hearing the testimony today and hope our witnesses will help us answer these important questions. \nAnd I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. HORN: I thank you and before I call on Ms. Maloney, we have two members of the committee which will be \nbefore us, and without objection we'll have Mr. Castle and Mr. Miller.\n\nMr. Castle.\n\nREP. MICHAEL N. CASTLE (R-DE): Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I know I'm an interloper here today \nand I appreciate you and the ranking member allowing me to appear. And I wanted to share some thoughts I have \non this and some legislation I've been working on with Congressman Jeff Flake of Arizona with respect to this issue. \nBut I must comment first that this is a very distinguished but even more so very interesting panel. I look forward to \nwhat they have to say.\n\n\n\nMany of the issues that are involved in the subject matter of today of national identification cards in my judgment \nshould first be addressed in managing foreign visa holders in the United States of America. While I understand that \nthe issue of national ID cards is extremely important in the times we are living in, and I would imagine somewhat \ncontroversial if I had to place a wager on it, I believe that we must first begin with the tracking of foreign guests in \nour country and I don't think this should be controversial.\n\nI would like to just share a few statistics with you. In 1998 the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, reported \nthat 30.1 million foreign people came to the United States on a temporary basis. Of this 30.1 million, there are an \nestimated five to eight million illegal immigrants living in the United States; 40 percent of which were listed as \noverstays by the INS. That means they stayed beyond the time of their visa. I believe very strongly, and Mr. Flake \ndoes as well, that we need to be able to monitor all foreign visitors and track in real time -- that is, the actual \nknowledge on a computer screen in real time -- who they are, what their background is and what they are doing in \nour country.\n\nCongress has actually -- probably in the time of the gentlemen who are on this panel -- has actually taken steps on \nthis, but none of this has really been implemented. Six years ago Congress instructed the INS to gather the arrival \nand departure date of most foreign visitors, to make sure they do not remain in the United States after the expiration \nof their authorized stay. However, to this day the INS Passenger Accelerated Service System, INSPASS is its \nacronym, remains only a pilot project used at only four airports, but not at any land or sea port points of entry.\n\nAnother example of an innovative idea which has been put in place but not fully used, is the border crossing card \nwhich is used by Mexican and Canadian nationals who seek admission as border crossers. But, again, this \nprogram has been plagued by difficulties and delays. I think such examples illustrate the lost opportunities inherent \nin the poor management of tracking systems.\n\nTo address immigration challenges, Representative Flake and Representative Deal of Georgia and I did introduce \nan act called the Visa Integrity and Security Act to strengthen the immigration system and to improve the ability of \nthe INS to track all these temporary visa holders. A number of the key provisions in this legislation were actually \nincluded in the Patriot Act, which you might know as the Anti-Terrorism Act, which passed very recently in the \nCongress of the United States.\n\nBut there is still a lot of work to be done. We do need to be able to track and locate temporary foreign visitors to the \nU.S. to ensure they are here for their stated purpose, which could be anything from being a student, to working, to a \nvisitor, and to know when they have come and when they have left.\n\nA student tracking system that's been under development since 1997 needs to be improved and fully implemented. \nThe Patriot Act does call for the implementation of the Student Tracking System and has authorized $36 million, \nwhich is a good start towards its deployment. However, we must advocate that the INS incorporate key provisions \nin any future student tracking system. We need to know if foreign students actually enroll in classes and whether \nthey drop out. There are over 500,000 foreign students in the United States now. We also need to know their family \nhistory, course of study and date of enrolment.\n\nSecond, we need to know if a temporary worker holding an H1B visa, which has been the subject matter of many \nan hour here in the Congress, is still working at the company that hired that person. A crucial aspect of any effective \nsystem that tracks foreign visitors is the use of technology to foil would be counterfeiters, of which there are many, I \nmight add.\n\nA Smartcard visa for foreign visitors would be much more difficult to forge than traditional visas. It would hold a copy \nof the fingerprint biometric and typical visa information; or pupil of the eye or whatever biometric one would want to \nuse. This is not a new idea either, by the way. It just has not been implemented particularly well. U.S. citizens \nacross the border frequently are able to participate in a voluntary program that registers the fingerprint biometric. \nWe just think in certain instances it should be automatic that it be done, as opposed to being a voluntary program.\n\n\n\nHolders of frequent traveler passports pass more quickly through Customs by showing their fingers for identification \nat a Customs station. The use of biometric technology is encouraged in the Patriot Act. These tamper-resistant \nvisas could eventually be linked to an integrated computerized entry access system and the INS, Customs, \nconsulates, universities and other law enforcement agencies would all work off the same information to monitor and \ntrack students, tourists and other visa holders. And I'm sure I'm not telling anybody here the difficulty of some of the \ninformation exchange, even among governmental agencies today, much less on a computer in real time in terms of \nthe various places, the embassies, the points of entry where that information would be usable.\n\nAll this technology is available, by the way, although at a cost. And programs could be more effectively utilized to \ntrack our foreign guests. The lessons learned from tracking foreign visitors can lend important insight to the pros \nand cons of enacting a national identification card for United States citizens, which we may or may not be ready for \nnow. But I think we are ready for a visa system at this point, if we put our minds to it and go about it.\n\nLet me just say in conclusion, in no way am I advocating limiting in this particular program what we are doing with \nrespect to visas or visitors to our country. We just want to make sure we know who's coming into this country and, if \nthey should not be coming into this country, are preventing them from being here and while they are here, they are \ndoing what they are supposed to be doing. And I appreciate the time, Mr. Chairman. Again, I realize I'm an \ninterloper and you've been very generous and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you very much and now I yield to the ranking member over the years and the gentle lady of \nNew York, Ms. Maloney.\n\nREP. CAROLYN B. MALONEY (D-NY): Thank you and I would first like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the \nranking member for holding this hearing and commend you for tackling yet another complicated and controversial \nissue. Also, I'd like to extend my appreciation to the very interesting panelists we've assembled here today for \ntaking the time to be here.\n\nWe have taken a hard look at the way our great nation operates since September 11th. The hard, cold truth is that \nwe have been very lax in many areas of safety and security.\n\nI believe the most difficult fact for us as a nation to face is that there is a group of individuals who hate us and want \nto do harm to the citizens of America. As an elected official, I must do everything that I can to protect my \nconstituents and the constituents of our country. In this new world, I am not exactly how sure we can accomplish \nthis. However, I'm eager to learn and understand more, as we will learn today.\n\nIn the month of October alone we had 17 million people travel across the borders of the United States. We welcome \nall travelers. Our nation's economy depends in part on these visitors. However, we have to face this cold, hard truth \nthat not everyone entering our borders enters with good intentions. Access to the United States must be looked \nupon as a privilege, not a right. Our country's founders provided many safeguards to protect our freedom while \nensuring our safety.\n\nOne of the duties of our democracy is that it is not static, but a robust living thing that can change, and times have \ndramatically changed. Daniel Webster, one of our nation's former great leaders, once stated, \"God grants liberty \nonly to those who love it and are always ready to guard and to defend.\" Today, we must guard and defend it. We \nmust not be afraid of new ideas. We need to protect not only the rights of individuals, but their life.\n\nWe pride ourselves of the many freedoms we have in the United States. However, in order to protect these \nfreedoms we need to protect our safety and our nation's security. I commend President Bush for taking the bold \nstep yesterday to begin to acquire stricter regulation regarding the granting of visas. Fear has struck the core of the \ncommunity I represent in New York -- I lost well over 600 constituents -- and it has struck the core of the American \npeople.\n\n\n\nThe freedom to travel freely about our nation has taken a devastating blow. We now have armed guards on several \nflights, with the implementation of complete coverage for all flights ongoing. We look to our law enforcement to \nprotect and to serve. However, we need to arm them with the tools to accomplish this mission. A more thorough \nand smarter Green Card for non-U.S. persons, I believe, is a beginning. I also believe that we need to tie one's \nstate driver's license to their visa expiration date.\n\nDuring a hearing held in New York on terrorism, Governor Jeb Bush provided testimony that in his state of Florida \none's driver's license expires on the same date as their visa. Does this not provide yet another way of tracking non-\nU.S. persons? I believe we need to take other steps and one could be that an individual's bank account could be \nfrozen at the time of the visa expiration date. All non-reclaimed funds could revert to the state's escrow account to \nfight terrorism. We have seen how our banking industry has been contaminated by the terrorist community again, \nand we need to reclaim it. As I stated earlier, I do not have all the answers so I'm very much looking forward to our \npanelists to help me and other members of this committee uncover all the pros and cons of this important issue.\n\nThank you very much and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you, and we now yield to Mr. Miller from Florida, the chairman of the Census Subcommittee of \nGovernment Reform.\n\nMr. Miller.\n\nREP. DAN MILLER (R-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling this hearing. I'm delighted with the two \npanels and I'll be very brief because I heard the speaker talk about this issue briefly at a breakfast about two weeks \nago. And ever since September 11th it's raised a lot of issues of which direction to go -- civil liberties issues and I \nknow this will be addressed by the panel, the privacy issue which I know Mr. McCollum has worked on a lot. \nTechnology, which is something the speaker talks about all the time. And just to make sure our country can function \nafter -- post September 11th, our economy can function.\n\nSo there's a lot of challenges and interesting comments, and I'm really here to listen and learn, so I yield back.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you very much, and any other statements that come in will be filed for the record.\n\nWe now start with our first panel, and I think you know the routine that this is an investigating committee, and so if \nyou raise your right hand and if you have any assistants backing you up, get them and the clerk will get their names \ntoo.\n\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this subcommittee will be truth, the whole truth and \nnothing but the truth?\n\nWITNESSES: I do.\n\nREP. HORN: The clerk will note that all the witnesses have affirmed, and we start with the Honorable Newt \nGingrich, former speaker of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nMr. Speaker.\n\nMR. NEWT GINGRICH: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you and the ranking member for \nholding this hearing. I also wanted to take this opportunity to commend you for your consistent leadership on the \nissue of cyber security and fact that this subcommittee has been very far ahead of events in looking at the need for \neffective technology in the security area.\n\nI also want to begin with Mrs. Schakowsky's I think absolutely correct point, which is that we have to design -- the \nchallenge to the Congress and the president is to design a system which both provides civil liberties protection for \nthe innocent and protection of the innocent. In the past with things like fingerprinting, wire tapping and other \n\n\n\ntechnologies, we worked very hard to make sure that while we were strengthening law enforcement, we were never \ninfringing on the innocent, and I think this has to be thought through in a very careful way.\n\nThe fact is we already have a primitive, inefficient, easily cheated system of identification. I flew out of Reagan \nNational yesterday and three times I produced an ID card. Now, I just want to point out every audience I talk to \naround the country, I ask them how many of them know someone who in high school had access to an ID card that \nmight not have been their own, for reasons we won't go into. And, while no one personally had ever used an ID \ncard for an inappropriate purpose, it has always amazed me the number of people who seemed to find at 16 or 17 \naccess to an ID card.\n\nSo I want to be very clear. I think we've already indicated at airports, we've indicated at government buildings, \nwe've indicated in a variety of places that asking for identification is legitimate. The question now is can we design a \nsystem which has effective ID, while still protecting the innocent? I think that it has to be an American model of \nsecurity which means a high technology, capital intensive system that provides security, speed, efficiency and \nconvenience. That's the model we've always set for ourselves and I think, frankly, the current lines at airports are a \nsign we don't have a system that meets that test.\n\nIt's also necessary for the world economy to have a parallel system for freight, whether it's in trucks or container \ncargo, that is secure, fast and efficient or we will literally break down the world economy and add a substantial \namount of cost to everybody's life.\n\nI would suggest to this subcommittee that as you look at these, that you look very seriously at outsourcing as much \nproduction as possible, because most of the great breakthroughs that are high technology and capital intensive \noccur in the private sector, and occur in entrepreneurial businesses. And I particularly would recommend to you \nClayton Christensen's \"The Innovators Dilemma\" as a study of new technologies at work and Nathan Mirbald's (ph) \nrecent writing, particularly in USA Today, on the concept of exponential industries and the ability to develop really \ndramatically new technologies in the next five to ten years.\n\nI personally think we're going to want to end up with a biometric solution that involves either a retinal or iris scan, \nwhich I think is harder to cheat than a thumbprint and, frankly, is as easy to measure in real time; it's simply a \npicture. And any of us who are being filmed for television or by still photographers are having exactly the same \nexperience you'd have for a retinal scan.\n\nI want to distinguish also civil liberties for American citizens from foreign visitors. I believe that all foreign visitors \nshould be scanned as they enter the country.\n\nWe ought to have a databank either of their iris or retina; I think that's a technical decision which one you're using. \nBut we ought to be able to know who you are. We ought to be able to match you up against a system that would \nindicate whether you were a known drug dealer, a known terrorist, et cetera. And it would basically indicate and \nattach to an identity that had a biometric on the identity card, so we knew that the person we're talking to didn't just \nbuy this for $11 in Los Angeles on a street corner, as can currently be done.\n\nFor Americans, I think it's fairly simple to have the 50 states go to a biometric measure on the driver's license and \nsimply ensure that all of the states -- 50 states plus D.C. that the databases are linked. That means an investment \nin wireless, high speed connectivity with very high speed computing. But, literally, it's no harder for a policeman \nstanding and talking to you by the side of your car within seconds to have verified who you really are, if we design a \nsystem that does it. And I think you can do that with civil liberties protected.\n\nI would not insist on a national ID card, because I think you do get into civil libertarian issues. But I would suggest to \nyou that the simple act of having two lines at airports, one biometric where anybody who's a frequent flyer who \nwanted to be able to literally walk through the line, verify who they are and pick up their ticket at security as they're \ngoing through. While we'd have a long line that may take an hour and a half for people who prefer to avoid that \n\n\n\nkind of convenience. I think you'd find a natural migration of over 90 percent of the American travelers, within a year \nor less, to the higher speed line.\n\nLet me also suggest that the committee look at the emerging technology at MIT and elsewhere, that for somewhere \nbetween one and 30 cents per suitcase you could literally have an embedded wireless system that would enable \nyou to track literally every suitcase. And if you introduced it as a manufacturing process now, you would within five \nor six years have an overwhelming tagged and identified, highly secure system.\n\nAs I said earlier, this kind of thinking I think has to also apply to trucks and the container cargoes. And if you look at \nwhat UPS and FedEx already do, you can see the beginnings of a model that, given the high -- the new \nbreakthroughs and the technologies, could be even more sophisticated and even more accurate.\n\nLet me just close by going back to the exactly correct warning that Mrs. Schakowsky made. There is no question in \nmy mind that we can design, just as with medical records, an ability to have personal privacy and access to \ninformation that may save our lives. But that requires a federal law that makes it a felony to use that medical record \ninappropriately.\n\nSimilarly, I think you can design a system which allows you to track a person who is genuinely out to do something \nbad, without in that process either dramatically inconveniencing or harming those who are innocent. And, in fact, I \nwould argue that if the American people knew that every employee who walked on an airport had some means of \nchecking to make they were really the person they claimed to be, if we knew that our FBI, CIA, FAA computers \nworked, the notion -- I just want to close on this notion, because what you're doing on this subcommittee is so vital.\n\nSix weeks before September 11, the Central Intelligence Agency told the Federal Bureau of Investigation two \nterrorists had entered the United States. Six weeks later they had still not been able to get that information into the \nairline computers, and two of the terrorists on September 11 in Boston boarded the airplane under their own names, \n42 days after the United States government officially knew they were in the U.S. and they were very dangerous.\n\nNow, I simply suggest going to a mandatory, regular ID card won't help much, because with desktop printing they \nwill learn how to buy cards that are false. But if we had a high speed computing system and we had an ability to \nhave very high speed access, I think we could design a system where we would have found those two people, they \nwould have been stopped at Logan and we would have had a very significant understanding of what was going on.\n\nI think this committee is moving in the right direction. If it does it right, the system will be very secure, it will be very \nsafe, and it will protect our civil liberties while also protecting us.\n\nREP. HORN: We thank you very much for those pertinent views, which I'm used to, and it's very useful. We now \nturn to the very distinguished ex-senator and one of the great public servants of this country, namely Alan Simpson, \nwho has spent more time on immigration I think than probably all the rest of us put together. So I'm going to turn it \nover to you.\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: Mr. Chairman, if I could just inquire. Apparently you're going to proceed through the vote?\n\nREP. HORN: No, we're going to go now and when Mr. Miller returns, he will be presiding, and then I'll come back. \nWe're in this less than seamless operation --\n\nMR. : We know that.\n\nREP. HORN: -- known as the vote. And we'll be back, so --\n\nMR. ALAN SIMPSON: I'll just proceed then. Thank you.\n\nREP. HORN: Proceed and I will try to be back in six or seven minutes.\n\n\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Thank you, Chairman Horn.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: I come in here with a very eerie feeling as Jack Brooks is staring at me there. He would look at me \nwith that smoldering cigar and say, \"Simpson, I got a deal for you.\"\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nI'd lose my shirt and my underwear and everything else in here. Well, that was Jack Brooks. What an amazing man.\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here to discuss this serious issue of how we might strengthen domestic security. I was \nparticularly moved by Congresswoman Schakowsky's remarks, for I met Norm Mineta at the Heart Mountain \nRelocation Center when we were 12-year-old-boys. He was behind wire and I were living in Cody, and our scout \nmaster took us to the Jap camp -- that's what it was called. Eleven thousand people there, and Norm and I struck \nup a friendship of curiosity and juvenile devilment that has lasted now 70 years. He's a very dear and special friend.\n\nBut we want to remember at that time that Attorney General Warren, Earl Warren of California, signed the order to \nevacuate them and the unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court by William O. Douglas said that it \nwas proper. So I think let's try to keep that in perspective and not think of how it is 50 years from then as to the fact \nthat the Japanese submarine lobbed a couple of shells into an oilfield off of California in the spring of '42, and it kind \nof startled people. Just thought I'd pitch that in. Just thought I'd throw it in there.\n\nAnyway, you're on track. I was impressed by what Newt is saying because you're all being led astray by a single \nterm, and the term is national ID. I never used it. I put it in the bill that we were not talking about a national ID and \nyou'd do a disservice to the country when you use the phrase national ID. We're talking about a more secure \nidentifier system. It could be many things. And if anyone believes that there is intrusiveness in what we're \nsuggesting, all of us -- Newt, myself, what Bill will say, what Democrats and Republic -- what Rodino and I said, \nwhat Mazzoli and I said. And in the bill it said we're not talking about a national ID. That's a diversion for people who \nlike to talk about tattoos and Nazi Germany, and don't let them get away with it.\n\nWe're not talking about that. Every time we try to do something in this area it was filled with emotion, fear, guilt, and \nracism. The Select Commission on Immigration Refugee Policy said we ought to do something in this area. We \ntried to do that, got shot out of the saddle by arguments about tattoos and Nazi Germany. Then we tried it again \nand we had a biometric activity in one of them, and in a conference committee in the middle of the night when on \nthe floor of the House, passed the Senate, there was a highly emotional argument about, again, Nazi Germany and \ntattoos. It was pulled out and dear old Joe Moakley took it out and we passed it in the middle of the night without \nanything in it.\n\nThe House always had an aversion to that kind of thing.\n\nThe Senate would pass it and I can only share with you that everything we did in this area was bipartisan. Mazzoli, \nour Democrat from Kentucky; Rodino, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee from New Jersey -- still living and a \nmagnificent man -- we did these things. Hamm Fisch (ph) -- and Newt knows him well and so does Bill. You have to \ndo something and the something is not intrusive any more than what you get when you go to the airport now, or \nwhat you get when you go into a store and have to give your slide card, or when you file for credit or whatever it \nmay be.\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: Senator Simpson.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Yes, indeed?\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: I'm afraid I have to go vote, which would leave no members here and so I'm going to grab \nthis gavel while I can --\n\n\n\nMR. SIMPSON: (Inaudible.)\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: -- and recess this committee at least until someone returns. All right.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Well, that's very kind, thank you. I'll just keep going though. No.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n(Recess)\n\nREP. MILLER: The subcommittee will come back to order. Mr. Horn will be back shortly and he asked me to \nproceed with the presentation.\n\nSenator Simpson, would you continue?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Thank you very much, Congressman Miller, and I see you have new devices here which are very \nclever. It's not on yet, so I'll -- it is?\n\nWell, I was just kind of reviewing things and speaking to Congresswoman Schakowsky's comments. Let me just \ngive you a very brief summary of past efforts. The select commission came into being '79 to '81. I was a member of \nthat bipartisan commission, Father Ted Hesburgh was chairman, and we did a lot of things. We recognized that no \nsystem attempting to control anything would be effective without a more secure method of confirming a person's \nidentity and immigration status.\n\nSo we recommended -- the commission recommended it. It was a narrow vote, a substantial improvement. Then we \nhad Immigration Reform and Control Act of '86. When that first passed, it had a provision in it that the executive \nbranch would implement a system that would reliably determine identity, again, and authorization of all persons. \nThat was weakened by the Senate, stripped by the House. I think it was a conference committee, and that's often \nthe history of conference committees as I recall them here in this chamber, especially with Brooks with the gavel. \nBut anyway, that's an aside.\n\nThe enacted version of IRCA had a pilot program in it and then we had telephone verification. We couldn't get much \ndone because, again, the background noise was always national ID. The initial conference committee version of the \nImmigration Act of '90, where we broadened legal immigration a great deal, contained a pilot program using \nbiometric data to make state drivers' licenses more secure. And it was then, to the amazement of Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that that issue was demagogued in the most grotesque way one evening in this body, and the \nHouse rule was defeated. And Joe Moakley brought it back from the dead and we got it out, but it was stripped \nagain.\n\nThen Barbara Jordan came to the floor, a most amazing woman, and she did the Jordan Immigration Commission \non Immigration Reform. She recognized it was too susceptible -- the present system was too susceptible to \ndiscrimination against foreign-looking and foreign-born or foreign-sounding workers. So she commended a \ncomputerized registry using data provided by Social Security and the INS, and suggested pilot programs for \nemployers to use these databases to be conducted in states with the highest immigration rates.\n\nThen along came the '96 bill. I had little to do with that because we did nothing to do anything to curb illegal \nimmigration -- or legal immigration, rather, as Barbara Jordan recommended. But we did get a pilot program in there \nto -- where you could access via computer modem. In '97 it was used by approximately 2,000 employers, who were \nvoluntarily using it. While it's a helpful deterrent to certain instances of fraud, it is not a good one. An unauthorized \nalien submits a card with an invalid number or submits a card where the name does not match the number. It does \nnot prevent aliens who falsely assume the identity of another person from using the other person's valid Social \nSecurity number, and this is often referred to as identity theft or true identity fraud, and it is endemic in America. \nTalk to your credit card people.\n\n\n\nSo I doubt that there is any full support for a national ID card. I never suggested it and I just have to pack that in one \nmore time. And if that's going to be the word, you're going to all fail. You will do nothing. Get away from it. It's a \nphoney baloney. What we're talking about is -- and when we were talking about it then, was some type of new \ndocument to establish work authorization or identity. We were talking about perhaps a card that would not be \ncarried on your person, not be used for law enforcement, have the maiden name of your mother on the back of it \nand the birth date. And then, you know, always would come the George Orwellian aspects of that.\n\nHere's what I suggest, respectfully. A few positive benefits, I think. I therefore would respectfully suggest that you \nimprove the state drivers' licenses. That's the principal identity document in our country. We must eliminate the \nability of people to falsely assume the identity of another. Some of the September 11 terrorists facilitated their \nactions through easy access to Virginia drivers' licenses. Now, the only way to prevent identity fraud is to include \nbiometric data on the card, I agree with Newt completely, such as a fingerprint. It is also -- in California it is done \nwith a retina scan in California for commercial drivers' licenses, and you ought to take a look at that. Minimum \nnationwide issuance standards could be imposed by Congress or agreed upon by the states. I think it would be \nminimally intrusive.\n\nExpanded access, would be another one, to INS and Social Security databases. Extend the basic pilot program not \njust California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois. Include other states, have access to that base. But, of course, that \nwould require more funding for the Social Security Administration and directing to improve the accuracy of the \ndatabase, and here's the one that everybody misses. There are about 2,000 agencies in the United States that \nissue a birth certificate. They love it. They're little old ladies, they do things -- little old men too, and they issue them \nand they love it and they don't want anybody to mess with it. Don't mess with me giving -- because I know the \nmother and the father and when little twinkletoes was born, I signed that.\n\nThe vulnerability of the birth certificate system allows aliens to bypass all immigration systems altogether and \nimpersonate U.S. citizens. The Jordan Commission said if we reduce the fraudulent access to the breeder \ndocuments, start looking at the breeder documents, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress; particularly birth \ncertificates that can be used to establish an identity in this country.\n\nAnd the specific steps recommended by her commission were, and I conclude, regulation of requests for birth \ncertificates through standardized application forms. A system of interstate and intrastate matching of birth and \ndeath. We don't do that in America; we don't match birth and death. How can you ever get a handle on it? Requiring \na federal agency only accept certified copies of birth certificates and a standard design and paper stock for all \ncertified copies, and encourage states to computerize birth records repositories. I think these recommendations are \nsensible, practical and should be enacted and it is time. Thank you very much.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you, Senator. As usual, you have the common people's touch and you also know how to get \nthrough the bureaucracy and everything else. I am glad to say to you the commissioner yesterday told a number of \nus that he will split up the agency, so that you've got an enforcement operation and you've got a service operation. \nAnd a lot of us have wanted that over the years, so a little progress is being made there.\n\nWe now go to Mr. McCollum, who, during my years in the House, no one was a better legislator than he was. And \nwe're glad to have you back here, Mr. McCollum.\n\nMR. BILL MCCOLLUM: Well, that's a high compliment, Mr. Chairman, and I'm very glad to be back here too today \nwith you and especially pleased to be with this distinguished panel of my friends, Speaker Gingrich and Senator \nSimpson, with whom I've served a good number of years, and on a topic that really is very timely and very \nimportant.\n\nI know, like everybody here, that we all were affected terribly by this tragedy on September 11th, the attacks on us \nthat I think most envisioned was unimaginable. Even though many of us who served in the arenas that I did in \nCongress knew that sooner or later we were going to have a terrorist attack of some magnitude, we could not have \nexpected nor anticipated the horror that came with this particular one. And now we're having a reaction to that.\n\n\n\nHaving been chairman of the Crime Subcommittee, having chaired the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, \nfounded the Terrorism Task Force, spent 18 of the 20 years served on Immigration Subcommittee, many of those \nyears with Senator Simpson's work and mine together, with the fellow up there you mentioned, Brooks, and others, \nI come to this with a perspective of absolute conviction about a couple of things.\n\nOne of those is that there is no need for a national identification card, and I am very much opposed to one. But I \nthink it's important to identify what a national identification card is. What do we mean by that? Mr. Chairman, I mean \nby that a uniform system -- a uniform card that every American would be required to carry to produce to law \nenforcement, employers, various government agencies for identification purposes. Such a card would contemplate \na national database, access by computer for verification purposes. It might contain a strip on the back like your Visa \nCard does. It has data and information already built in it, or accessible through computer, a photograph of \nfingerprint, possibly even a national database that every American had a fingerprint in. I don't favor that, I don't think \nthat's right, I think that's an insult to our system of government, the privacies and those great freedoms that our \nfounding fathers envisioned. The Big Brother type system.\n\nBut we do need to make some of the identifiers we already have work, and that's what all of us are testifying about \ntoday. I have not heard a word that either of my colleagues said that I took umbrage with, but I do have a \nperspective on a couple of these, a little bit differently.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that the Social Security card desperately needs to be made more secure. There's been great \nresistance to doing much with that card over the years, but back in 1996 -- excuse me, 1986 when the Simpson-\nMazzoli bill passed, and then more in the amendments of 1996 in the immigration world for employer sanctions and \nwhen you go to get a job, the two principal identifiers became narrowed down to your driver's license and your \nSocial Security card. So if you produce them, fraudulent or otherwise, today, they essentially get you a job.\n\nAnd the Social Security card as well as the driver's license is commonly used for a whole host of other identification \npurposes today. Yet, it is probably the most fraudulently produced document in America. It is a document that has \nbeen flimsy and paper for years. In recent years the Social Security Administration has put a few fibers in it, but by \nno means made it tamper-resistant or counterfeit- proof. And I encourage this committee and other members of \nCongress to really take a look at a proposal that I have in as a legislative matter for a good number of Congresses, \none that is attached and submitted to this testimony today, H.R. 191, and a bill in the last Congress, Mr. Chairman, \nthat you were an original co-sponsor of.\n\nThat is a bill -- that is a proposal that would require the Social Security Administration to make the Social Security \ncard as secure against counterfeiting as the $100 reserve note, with a rate of counterfeit detection comparable to \nthe $100 reserve note, and as secure against fraudulent use as the United States passport. Now, we're not talking \nabout putting pictures on the card, we're not talking about any of that, but it's all those interweaving, interwoven \nthings that you can use to -- use ultraviolet lights and so forth to determine.\n\nI also would encourage the same type of activity that has been discussed here today with regard to the driver's \nlicense. I think that drivers' licenses, at least the general standards for what they are, should be uniform throughout \nthe country, and I don't think we have to mandate that. I don't think Congress should pre-empt the states, but I think \nthat there should be an effort to encourage that from Congress, and I think that it should be done in a way that does \nhave either a uniform standard proposed, or you get the states together to do that, or whatever.\n\nAll drivers' licenses should certainly have photographs on them, they should have the signature on them, they \nshould have a fingerprint or another biometric identifier on them. And they should have holograms and other types \nof devices built into those drivers' licenses, just like I suggested for the Social Security cards so they cannot be \neasily reproduced, and so that when you take it somewhere, to an employer or to a person who's in law \nenforcement, they can quickly be checked.\n\nYou know we have a little machine that's been around for a number of years on fingerprints. You put it on this desk \n-- I've had it when I was chairman come before my committee; you probably have too, Mr. Chairman. And it's doing \n\n\n\nnothing more than saying if you put your finger on that machine and you put the card that you have with your pre-\nexisting fingerprint on it, it matches it or it denies it. And it doesn't have to go to some central database to do that. \nAt least that'll tell me biometrically whether the person I'm looking at is the same as is on that card.\n\nI also concur with the view that we need to do something about birth certificates. One of the great, great problems in \nthis country are the (breeder ?) documents Senator Simpson's talked about, and that's important.\n\nLast, I want to comment on one aspect of the Immigration Service, because I do believe that the focus rightfully \nshould be there, as Congressman Castle stated in his opening. There is a great, great opening right now in this \ncountry for people to come here and not be identified. We need a tracking system. We need to be -- we need to find \npeople so we don't have visa overstays, and we need to shore up so many things.\n\nA number of things have been mentioned, but one has not been. Today when somebody goes before a formal \nproceeding of an immigration tribunal, or to the Immigration Service or whatever, they're usually released on their \nown recognizance or maybe on a cash bond. The Immigration Service has the authority to have a security bond, \nmuch like a bail bond, but they don't do that.\n\nAnd I believe that it would be extremely helpful to get people to show up when they're supposed to before \nimmigration proceedings. If there was a general policy that a security bond be used and then have the private \nsector, bail bondsman if you will, like they do on criminal law, be responsible for bringing them in; making sure they \ndo show up, because people can come not only into this country and get here too easily because the visa system \nand visa fraud and we don't track them, but then when they do show up to a proceeding and they're supposed to \ncome back in 90 days or six months or whatever, we have no system to bring them back in, we have no way of \nknowing where they are, and we don't have nearly enough police or immigration officers that will ever be able to do \nthat. So why aren't we using the private sector, in the same way that we do in criminal law? And it's not being done \ntoday.\n\nSo I would encourage that this committee and your members look at -- very strenuously at not only making these \nidentifiers more secure and finding ways to track visa overstays and people who come in here, but making sure that \nwhen they're here, that is those who are aliens, show up when they're supposed to at the end of whatever period of \ntime that there is.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you for your testimony, and we'll now go to questioning. It's going to be five minutes per \nperson because of the travel schedules, and we will alternate between the majority and the minority. And I'll start it \noff and it will be -- Mr. Chief Counsel, we'll get the technology here, we're in business.\n\nIn my opening statement I cited a few research center studies that showed overwhelming support, 70 percent of \nthose polled, for a national identity system and are all of these people just misguided? How do you feel? Do you \nthink, from what you've seen, does the average citizen when you get into a debate like this -- and I would take it \nwith this particular three of you, would you have, say, a hardened, if you will, Social Security? Or would you take the \nlicense, which in my case with California they have a photo and they have a thumbprint. And not all of them do it, \nbut that's pretty good identification.\n\nSo any type of -- other type you're talking about than simply hardening up the Social Security card, and then putting \na picture on a it or a thumbprint? I remember when the supervisors at Los Angeles County, which is a county of 10 \nmillion people, and they started with the photo on the welfare situation and a few thousand people got off the rolls \nbecause they were going two, three, four places to get money, and that was one way to do it.\n\nMR. WILLIAM MCCOLLUM: Well, Mr. Chairman, if I might respond?\n\nREP. HORN: Yeah.\n\n\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: I don't believe that, for example, the Social Security card, you want to go to put a picture on it. I \ndon't think you need to -- I think it can stay paper. Its purpose is to make sure that the number that's on that card \nand the name on that card are the bearers, and that when you take that card and produce it for whatever purpose \nthat, that very simple fact can be verified.\n\nI also think, by the way, that it would present problems in reissue, and so that the Social Security card -- one of the \ngreat reasons why that's been a problem in getting it corrected is the Social Security Administration won't go to the \ncost of reissuing a lot of these cards. They don't have to reissue all of them, but I do think they do need to reissue \nthose with -- those with younger age group and they -- that would be an added expense that I don't think you would \nwant to encounter.\n\nAnd, again, I don't think we need a national ID card as such, a separate card, if you have the driver's license and \nyou have the Social Security card, one with a picture, one without it, that are more secure, more tamper-resistant \nand counterfeit-proof.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: It's interesting, Mr. Chairman, that polls throughout the select commission back in the '80s, '85, '90, \nif you'd asked the American people, Roper, Gallup, whatever, if they favor restrictions on immigration, 70 percent \ndo. It just stays that way. Not illegal or -- I mean, I'm talking about legal and illegal immigration. Interesting.\n\nBut when it comes to the Congress it doesn't get done that way because the Statue of Liberty suddenly enters the \nphrase, and all of us are children of immigrants, mine from Holland; orphans. If my granddad hadn't killed a guy in \nthe middle of the main street, we would have had a better reputation there in our state. But that's another story and \nI won't go into it.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nNevertheless, you can't continue to talk about the Statue of Liberty again. You must talk about reality, and all three \nof us I think are; all of you are. But I think the one that surprised me was when they put the examination into \nCalifornia for the written exam on truckers. Guys just stood outside the building because they didn't want any part of \nthat, because they'd been using fake IDs and all the rest of it, and it was a very serious problem. And I think you \nought to look into that California commercial driver's license issue, written exam.\n\nMR. GINGRICH: I think that what you have to recognize is that the people most opposed to a national ID card are \ndramatically more passionate than the people who have some vague, general support for a national ID card. And \nthat's why I think Senator Simpson was right early on in saying that if we go down that road, it's a dead end. It won't \nhappen. On the other hand, most Americans I think can be led to agree that having an efficient transfer of \ninformation so you know that your driver's license is real, that it's valid, so you can check it across state boundaries \nand for specific purposes. Foreign visitors, I think most Americans would agree, you could have a nationwide \nsystem of identifiers, because that's not part of what we think of as our civil liberties.\n\nPeople who have very important security jobs, whether it's on airports or elsewhere, people would agree you ought \nto have a pretty high standard of security, because they understand that that's a function of your job; it's not an \ninfringement of civil liberty. But I would encourage you to be minimalist in this. You want to get to a highly secure \nsystem that is across the whole country, that is ideally mostly decentralized in terms of states implementing it but \nwith information able to flow across state boundaries. And you want to do everything you can to minimize the threat \nto those whose primary concern is civil liberties.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you. My time is up.\n\nFive minutes to Ms. Schakowsky, the ranking member.\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nFollowing up on that minimalist approach and using your examples, Speaker Gingrich, of what happened before \nSeptember 11th, that the CIA actually transmitted information to the FBI and it never got through. What I'm \nwondering is are there not systems in place, were we to have the proper technology for sharing that information, \nthat could provide the kind of security we need?\n\nLet me just -- that's the question, but let me just say that in many, many hearings that we've had since September \n11th, we have found that information was all over the place and had it only been shared and gotten to the right \nplace, that we could have done this or that to prevent what happened. And so I'm just wondering if it isn't a matter of \nlooking at our systems, adding new technologies where we need to, but not new authorities to gather that \ninformation. If it's just a matter of making more efficient what we already have.\n\nMR. GINGRICH: I think you're 90 percent right, but the 10 percent that's missing I think could kill us. Let me \ndescribe what I mean. First of all, whatever system we build, we ought to have a competitive team try to break, \nbecause -- to find out how rapidly can you buy a counterfeit? How rapidly can you figure out a way to work around \nit, because we have active opponents who study what we do and who can spend two or three years trying to \npenetrate our systems. And if we're really serious about security, then we ought to be serious about learning what \nits weaknesses are.\n\nSecond, as Senator Simpson said a minute ago, we discover that whether it is illegal aliens or it is people who are \nfor one reason or another using a false identity, that there are, even in the current system -- even if you had 100 \npercent accuracy of sharing the information, some of the information going into the system is false. And we don't \nnecessarily today have the kind of identifiers and the kind of structure that makes sure that the information you put \nin is accurate information. I think that would be the other zone where I think there has to be really serious work \ndone. But I yield to my colleagues who know more about this than I do.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Well, Congresswoman Schakowsky, you are right on track. One of the most frustrating things for \nme, and I know for Peter Rodino (ph) and Ron Mazzoli (ph), Fish (ph), all the rest of us, was the absolute \nstubbornness of the agencies to share information. The one that appalled me was Customs and INS. Oh, there's a \nreal internal -- it was bizarre; it was childish. Customs wouldn't -- you know, Customs can pick up a lot of stuff. They \nknow what's going on and stuff coming in. And they'd share out and they'd say, we handle that.\n\nThe Border Patrol and the INS and the Justice Department and the CIA and the FBI and often times their \narrogance, and the CIA's secret arrogance. I mean, this is where you have to smash the big bug, right here. And I \nthink that's what I hear the president saying, that he's going to give Ridge all the authority to do that and he's going \nto make them do it. Well, we've all been here a long while. Merry Christmas, we'll see what happens.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: I know that that's a big problem.\n\nWhat Senator Simpson just said and we joked about it is so true. If Tom Ridge can do it -- I see the other day where \nhe's talking about merging maybe the Border Patrol and Customs and maybe the Coastguard. I think that is going \nto be an awfully big hill to climb and that we'd be better off -- you'd be better off using the energies you've got to do \nthings like forcing the Social Security Administration to really go out and make the card tamper resistant. Make it \nlike the $100 bill. Take the driver's license, make it more secure. Take the ideas that Newt Gingrich just said about \nputting a database together nationally to talk to each other on these things, technically. Then cajole, continue to \ncajole the agencies to do this.\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. Let me ask one quick other question. One of the problems created by driver's \nlicenses becoming de facto national identification systems, is the privacy protection of those records is very poor. \nWe know that states often sell that information along with the person's address and it becomes out there in the \npublic. How can we make sure that any particular system we use doesn't mean that that information is sent out? \nAnd should Congress stop the validation of Social Security numbers until the states institute -- a state institutes \n\n\n\nprivacy protections for driver's license records, because they often check those drivers' licenses against the Social \nSecurity cards?\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: Well, Ms. Schakowsky, I don't think that we should stop the validation system as it exists \nbecause, you know, we've got a security problem right now. We need to let these things happen as best we can. \nBut I do believe that Congress should be concerned and should encourage states to make the right decisions to \nprotect the privacy of the data that's in the database. That's the real point I made about not wanting a national ID \nand trying to define it for you.\n\nThe thing the American public may say when they say, we're all for a national identification card, is one thing. But \nwhen they really get down to it, nobody that I know of favors a Big Brother database somewhere, whether it's in the \nstate or in the nation, where other people can go and get access to your personal information. And there's a huge \ndifference between providing a chance, for example, for somebody who's an employer or law enforcement to call up \nor do whatever we can on the computer, to a database and say if you walk in and this is my name and this is my \nSocial Security card and verify that they both match electronically. There is a big difference between that and \nsomebody walking in and saying, \"Okay, I've got a name, now let me go find out -- what is the Social Security \nnumber, tell me?\" Or the other way around: \"I've got a Social Security number. You tell me the name that goes with \nit.\"\n\nWe don't want that information shared publicly, and that's the kind of thing that you need to discriminate, in my \njudgement, against. But you're not going to mandate that in one big piece of legislation. It's going to take a lot of \nwork to get understanding on the part of each person or group in the states that are making those decisions, to \nmake them be aware of what they're doing and to be more secure at educating them.\n\nREP. HORN: I think the gentleman --\n\nMR. SIMPSON: May I add one thing, Chairman Horn?\n\nREP. HORN: Yes, go ahead.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Newt Gingrich is a wizard of the keyboard and I am non-adept in technical prowess of the \nelectronic age. But I do share with you, I believe totally, there really is no such thing as privacy any more because \nof the information technology. They've got you in every database in this country: Social Security, driver's license, \norgan donor, blood type, you name it, FBI reports; I used to read them. And with what's happened with information \ntechnology in this country, I think privacy is gone.\n\nREP. HORN: I now yield five minutes to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Miller, then Ms. Maloney.\n\nREP. MILLER: Let me follow up on what Senator Simpson brought up, and that's the issue of privacy. I know \nSpeaker Gingrich and Mr. McCollum worked this issue when they served here in financial privacy and medical \nprivacy, and I know that Hugh Russell (ph) was trying to get legislation through. Would you comment on that \nexperience and what the experience has been that you're aware of, controlling that kind of privacy? Because we \nare all public figures, and you all were certainly public figures when you served here in this institution. But that's \nreally one of the core concerns: privacy. And when we passed legislation on financial medical in particular, is it \nworking? And what can be done to make sure that we can ensure privacy if we move to some type of ID?\n\nMR. GINGRICH: Well, let me say first of all I think this is an extraordinarily important issue. But in a way, big \ncomputers are a much greater danger than Big Brother. And it's partly true because it is so seductively convenient. \nYou use a credit card. It doesn't occur to you how much information you're building on that credit card every week \nwhen you charge things, what it tells somebody who's clever about your habits, your interests, your tastes, et \ncetera.\n\nThen you go and you use telephones, which have records. And then you go and you pump gasoline. And then you \ngo and you get a driver's license. I mean, by the time you're done with all this, if you were to actually assimilate -- or \n\n\n\naccumulate all the information that currently exists about you, you'd be stunned at how much you are a public \nperson in ways you did not intend.\n\nAnd I think there are two very different layers of this. We badly need to think through an integrated privacy policy in \nterms of law. As I said earlier, I'm a passionate believer in electronic medical records, but I'm also passionate \nbeliever in a federal law that will make the inappropriate misuse of that information a felony, and have very stiff \npenalties. Because I think we have to have the information, but we want to protect people from having it exploited to \nhurt them.\n\nSimilarly, I think that it's important to recognize -- and I want to -- as I started my testimony earlier, I want to \ncommend this subcommittee again. You know from your report issued last week that the federal government \nagencies have security levels that in many cases are so laughable that any really competent sixth grader could \nbreak into them. And even the ones that are relatively secure, except for the top two or three, a relatively competent \njunior in high school could break into them.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to understand that you've got -- and I met recently with the National Association of \nState Chief Information Officers, and we talked about the fact that we need to set a whole new standard against \nhacking, against organized crime, against terrorists, against foreign governments that want to try to break in, and \nrecognize that that's going to take a sharing of technical knowledge.\n\nIt's not just writing laws, but it's understanding how to write the security systems. And we have to recognize how \nmuch of our code is now written outside the United States. And I think we have to have a project that the defensive \nand research project agency, and the national science foundation, and the national security agency, to really figure \nout a way to literally scan all the code we now rely on, because we don't know how many various back doors have \nbeen built in. Because you're talking about millions of lines of codes that routinely, now, enter the U.S. system from \noverseas.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: May I say, too, sir and to the panel, who knows more about the loss of privacy than all of us? You, \nme; all of us who are in public life have none. And maybe that's all right. It's all right with me. I laid it all out there, all \nthe peccadilloes and the goofy things I ever did. But there is no privacy for a public figure. And so I think it's very \nimportant to realize that as we do these things, the media loses a lot of sleep about us, because when we get active \nthey go into everything we've ever done: first grade, high school, college, the whole works. And we get the whole \nload.\n\nWhen you come back to them and say, \"And aren't you intruding in our privacy?\" and they say, \"Well, you're public \nfigures, we're not.\" I say, \"More guys know you on that tube than know us, all of us in Congress, so don't give me \nthat. I think we ought to know a little bit about your private life.\" It's a sick idea, I know. It's about the First \nAmendment. It belongs to me too.\n\nBut this is really -- we're the ones that have suffered the slings and arrows. And I haven't the slightest -- I'm ready to \ndo that at any time. In fact, anything, anything -- and the woman I've been living with for 47 years is sitting back \nhere -- in anything they couldn't dig up on Al Simpson, but let me tell you, they've sure as hell tried.\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: If I might, I'd like to make a distinction. Mr. Miller, you've asked about privacy. And I think it is \nwhat is a person's reasonable expectation, what are the constitutional protections for that, and there are some. And \nwe live in a different age when it comes to the computer, but we need to divide up what people should reasonably \nexpect in the way of privacy with respect to their government intrusion, and intruding into that, and what they can \nreasonably expect when they go out and take certain steps on their own in the private world, in the world of \nbusiness and what data that they freely yield to someone for a purpose. Two different things.\n\nThe privacy that's protected in the Constitution clearly is there when it comes to the government coming into your \nhouse, not just from a criminal law standpoint, but a reasonable search or seizure, or eavesdropping, or whatever, \nand we have all kinds of checks on that and they should always exist.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the computer, when you use the computer, you need to just simply be aware you are opening up \nwhatever you put in there to other people to look at it. And we can talk about trying to restrict that all we want, and \nit's very difficult to do. On the other hand, when you give up data, say, to a bank, which was where we first met the \nprivacy issue in the last congress and it created a hullabaloo, I don't think people were even thinking about the \nprivacy question so much there.\n\nBut the reality is that prior to the enactment of the big bank bill last Congress, banks could share data that they had \nwith anybody. There were no restrictions. And we put the first restrictions. Congress did, and the law. And those \nrestrictions said that since we allowed the merger of the operations of banks and security companies and insurance \ncompanies, that if you were in the same holding company, you know, the same group owned all three of you, within \nthat group financial information that you, as a citizen, gave to that bank could be shared. But if they want to go out \nand give that information out to somebody that wasn't a party to their company, to their big, you know, their holding \ncompany, they had to seek your permission.\n\nAnd those are the kinds of things we need to think about at each stage. You give up your rights when you go and \ndo a certain business transaction, but you should be informed what you're giving up. And before information that's \ngiven by you to a business or third party is given away to somebody else, you should have the right to say yes or \nno. But, absolutely, you should have a reasonable expectation the government won't intrude in your privacy. That's \nsort of the broad guidelines. It's a huge subject. But that's the guideline. Thank you.\n\nREP. NEWT GINGRICH: I thank the gentleman.\n\nAnd now five minutes for the gentle lady from New York, Ms Maloney.\n\nREP. MALONEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nSpeaker Gingrich, you mentioned that you were not supportive of a national ID card, but you supported a more \nefficient transfer of information. Since all of the known terrorists were visitors with visas here, either legally or \nillegally, it appears that a good place to start would be with a sort of smarter, a more thorough tamper proof Green \nCard. Would you agree?\n\nMR. GINGRICH: Yes, I did say earlier that I drew a very sharp distinction between the need for a national system \nfor non-citizens, which I think should be administered by the federal government, run across the whole system, \nshould have a clear identifier that's biometric and should have a database that can be accessed by a variety of \nagencies. And that just I think should be a condition of being here.\n\nI also said, and I think you'll get real controversy about this, that I think we are much better to go to some kind of \nguest worker program, and accept the legality of people who are here for the purpose of working and get them \nidentified. I think when you have a pool of -- I think the numbers are three to five to seven million people, who are \nillegally here but are here actually to do legal things -- they're not here to be drug dealers, they're not here to be \nterrorists, that pool of people who are outside the system causes I think a real challenge for security purposes.\n\nSo I think it would be much healthier to have an identifiable guest worker program, and simply have a requirement \nthat everybody who's a non-citizen have, as you said, some kind of identifier and a sophisticated Green Card with a \ncentral database. That should be national. And my guess is overwhelmingly the American people would support \nsomething like that.\n\nI'm also suggesting if you come here as a visitor, as part of the transit point that we ought to have some biometric, I \nthink probably an iris or retina scan, so we could determine whether or not you, in fact, are a person that is a threat \nto the United States. That is at a point of entry, even for visitors who are here on business or here for tourist \npurposes. And my guess is most people who are on the planet -- people who come for business or for vacations \nwant to be safe, and they want a safe system. And as long as it's not too intrusive I think they'd be very accepting of \nthat kind of safety.\n\n\n\nREP. MALONEY: Building on that base of a non-citizen database that is national, who should maintain this \ndatabase? Where would you put it in government? Would you put it in the INS? Would you put it in the FBI? Would \nyou put it in the new Homeland Security? Where would you put it?\n\nMR. GINGRICH: I'm going to yield to my two colleagues on this. I have actually not thought about where in the \nfederal government you would house it. I would probably outsource a great deal of management of it, just because I \nthink they -- it's very, very hard for the federal government to get first class --\n\nREP. MALONEY: But it has to be maintained federally?\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: Well, it's the Immigration Service you're talking about. I don't know what -- (inaudible) --\n\nREP. MALONEY: You would put it in INS.\n\nWhere would you put it, Mr. Simpson?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: It was my experience, Congresswoman Maloney, that the -- I met some of the finest people in both \nparties who were commissioner of the INS. It is an absolutely unwieldy agency. Doris Meisner did her best. There's \nnothing you can do with them. The regional people are tough, district people. They're all -- it's got to be done there. \nI think that's -- if you go ahead with the legislation that's being proposed, then it would be the INS which would be \nlogical, not Social Security. Something about Social Security remains rather sacred with --\n\nREP. MALONEY: This is only for non-citizens?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Yes, indeed. Well, many non-citizens hold Social Security cards.\n\nREP. MALONEY: I would also like to ask the panelists, who do you believe should have access to that database, \nassuming it's in INS with a recite by --\n\nMR. GINGRICH: I think for verification purposes it's reasonable to ask people to prove that they're who they are \nwhen they apply for a job if they're a non-citizen. And I think I would allow law enforcement people to have access \nto the proof that they are who they are. Beyond that basis, I would say it would have to be on a carefully screened \nfederal law enforcement basis. But I think if a highway patrolman pulls you over and this is part of your proof of who \nyou are, it ought to be reasonable for them to have at least the negative access that says, yes, this is a valid -- this \nis a real person.\n\nREP. MALONEY: Of the other panelists, who do you think should have access? Do you agree?\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: Well, I think that what Newt Gingrich is trying to say is very clear. I think he did say it, but I want \nto amplify it and that is that the key to all of this, in identification right now, and certainly in the area of these aliens \nthat are here or coming here, is the proof that they are who they are, that verification.\n\nThat is that's the whole idea if you have a biometric where you can pick your fingerprint and put it here, maybe that \ngoes back to some database where you corroborate, hey, that is Joe, you know.\n\nBut I don't think the general public should have access to it, and I don't think that anybody but law enforcement for \nvery specific purposes, probably only Immigration Service and key law enforcement people, should have access to \nthe full information; presumably the data on that alien about, you know, where they were born, how many times \nthey've been married, that sort of thing.\n\nREP. MALONEY: Okay, and my time is up.\n\nREP. HORN: I thank the woman from New York, and now the only librarian in the history of Congress, Major \nOwens, and the gentleman from New York. Five minutes for questioning.\n\n\n\nREP. MAJOR R. OWENS (D-NY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With this distinguished panel seeming to agree that \nthe national identification card would not be a silver bullet, maybe we can put the argument to -- the debate to rest \nonce and for all and focus instead on another problem that I think most of them would agree we have, and that's the \nproblem of monumental mismanagement in our agencies. You know, the kind of mismanagement which allows us \nto have a worldwide electronic surveillance system that can pick up all kinds of information, but they didn't have \nenough Arab translators in the FBI and CIA to deal with the translation of vital information. I could not believe that \nwhen I heard it, you know.\n\nRight now we have a recent airplane crash in New York and it appears that turbulence from a jet that took off just \nbefore is probably the cause of the accident that took place. After all these years of flying and jets we don't know \nabout turbulence and what it might do to an airplane? Or, you know, the mismanagement is such that decision \nmaking within these vital agencies like CIA and the FBI is off to the point where Aldrich Ames could sit there for 10 \nyears on the payroll of the Soviet Union, and Robert Hanssen to be on the payroll of the Soviet Union for 14 years.\n\nMaybe your prestige and your influence can be put to work on a crusade to improve the management of all these. \nOur technology is excellent, you know, and way ahead of our capacity to use it. Including INS. The computers are \nalways breaking down and there's always a problem, you know. If INS maybe had some of the budget of the CIA, a \ncomparable budget -- $30 billion plus goes to CIA. INS is always struggling to just maintain enough staff to --\n\nMR. : If I might --\n\nREP. OWENS: Maybe I'll just conclude and you can comment. Maybe such a crusade by people of your caliber \nwould get to the heart of the matter and all these other things would fall in place, you know. The credit card \ncompanies -- the companies that issue credit cards are very familiar with ways you can develop a foolproof card. \nThey know there's no foolproof card, but a certain degree of fraud they put up with and -- but they're pretty much on \ntop of it. Various ways to do it and some identification card consolidation would be very convenient for most of us -- \nyou know, I think a lot of people.\n\nBut the real problem I think is a monumental mismanagement. I think the history of the fall of the American cyber \ncivilization might be written one day and the cause will be human error. That's what we ought to --\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: Congressman Owens, one of the greatest frustrations I had in the last couple of years in \nCongress was the fact that over the years I had been one of those people who was beating up on the CIA and \nothers to get more language speakers of Farsi and Pushti and all those languages that we're now seeing, we don't \nhave. And we kept pouring money at it and they kept reporting to us and they kept not getting the numbers, and \ntelling us they just weren't available. The reality of it is --\n\nREP. OWENS: -- they had a lot of people spoke Russian and languages -- a lot of good librarians have worked for \nthe CIA.\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: Well, it is a --\n\nREP. OWENS: (Off mic) -- Soviet Union, but --\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: The problem is --\n\nREP. OWENS: (Off mic.)\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: But my point to you, and you know this because you served with me in a number of these \ncapacities, is that you sit there and you have -- you're only as good as the product or the effort of the person who's \nright in charge at the moment and the vision they have. And the vision in the case of some of these things, including \nthe language issue you're talking about, had to be to go out and be creative and find that and get that language \nmore quickly in place. It didn't happen.\n\n\n\nThe same thing is true about the immigration stuff we're talking about here today. That's why we all hope, and you \ndo too, that some of the ideas being batted here today will really be enacted; that SIGMA (ph) and others will go \nout and do it, and we won't just be talking about it as we have for all those years since 1996.\n\nREP. OWENS: We've had a problem with Arab terrorism since the Beirut bombing when President Reagan was \npresident. Arabs, the World Trade -- you know, why after all those years don't they have translators who can \ntranslate documents from Arab?\n\nMR. GINGRICH: Let me just say I -- in your five minutes you put your finger on the heart of the American challenge. \nIn a sense, it's what Senator Simpson said earlier when he wished Tom Ridge luck as part of his Christmas \npresent. And it goes to the core of whether we are a comfortable system or we're a serious system. The difference \nis a comfortable system accepts any innovation that doesn't require it to change. So it gets to go on doing \nwhatever it wants to do. A serious system says this is what has to happen.\n\nIf you watch Jack Welch at General Electric, for example. He's probably the best modern CEO. I mean, he said GE \nto be successful has to go and become X and that means we're going to change in the following ways, and he \ndrove the changes. Now, there are three problems: rivalry, bureaucratism, and acquiring new capabilities. Rivalry, \nas I think Senator Simpson was saying earlier, the CIA doesn't want to share with the FBI and the FBI doesn't want \nto share with anybody.\n\nI mean, it's an absurdity and it should be a national scandal that the watch list didn't get through at Logan Airport \nafter 42 days, as an example. The one that Senator Simpson mentioned. The Border Patrol and the Customs \nagents, standing next to each other, have different computers. Now, that's just a level of deliberate bureaucratic turf \nguarding that shouldn't be tolerable and that should be shameful.\n\nSecond, bureaucratism. I had staff at the American Enterprise Institute pull this up the other day. There are 51,000 \nPashtuns in the United States. Now, if the Central Intelligence Agency can't find Pashtun speakers, they should \nassign someone to go to National Airport and wait for the taxis to come out.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMR. : Right. That's exactly right.\n\nMR. GINGRICH: I mean, the idea you couldn't hire a translator who -- you don't have to go through the process of \nvetting somebody to be a FBI agent, or vetting them to be a CIA agent with secrets in order to have them as a \ntranslator. The notion you couldn't find an Arab translator in the FBI is -- it tells you how bureaucratic they were, \nhow lacking in drive and seriousness, and how unwilling to confront reality.\n\nThird, I mentioned earlier before you got here, as a librarian you'll appreciate that I'm pushing books. I mentioned \nClayton Christensen's book on the innovator's dilemma, because he really makes the key point. Really big \nbreakthroughs tend to come in really small companies. Just the nature of how breakthroughs occur. Government is \npeculiarly slow at finding those. Government procurement makes it almost guaranteed not to acquire the newest \ntechnologies.\n\nAnd so I think you put your finger on a profound challenge for the American government. I wish President Bush well \nand Director Ridge well in trying to -- to try to get this thing solved. But I think you've absolutely described the core \nproblem of us becoming an effective country in the next decade.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: May I just say a word to my friend Major Owen, who I've enjoyed very much through the years. \nWe've had some nice sessions together and traveled together. You're absolutely correct when you're talking about \nmismanagement. And then you're talking about the thing that all of us never do well, when we're here and it's called \noversight hearings. We have an oversight hearing, we bring in an agency, they prepare for it. Oh, man, do they get \nready for it, and then you beat 'em up. Everybody just beats their brains out from up on the panel. And they all say, \n\n\n\n\"Don't worry, we recognize that. We're going to correct it. We're so thrilled that you see too that this is a problem for \nus.\"\n\nAfter pounding their brains in all day and after them slip, sliding along, like that old play, \"The Best Little \nWhorehouse in Texas\" where the guy just slid all over the place, we don't do anything. I couldn't do anything. I had \noversight hearings with the INS and they told me the most magnificent things for 18 years and nothing was ever \ndone. It was with violin music in the background and timpani and bells, you know. But it's oversight and that's the \ntough one.\n\nREP. HORN: I'd better give you one more question. And in his testimony for the panel two, Professor Turley will \npropose that a commission be established to study the feasibility of a national identification system. What do you \nthink of that proposal? You've been on these commissions. Should they do, whoever they are? Presidential and \nleadership in both chambers or have legislators go up to the trough and see what they can do?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: I think a national commission -- I speak from experience -- this select commission did two reports \non legal and illegal immigration by the Chairman Ted Hesburgh and both of the commission reports were enacted in \nthe law. The essence of the legislation. So I think it's good. I do think that it has to be not called a national identifier. \nIt should be called \"how to make more secure the systems of identification and work recognition in America,\" or \nsomething like that. If you use national ID, it's over.\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: I believe, as Senator Simpson does, that commissions do form the nucleus and sometimes the \ninitial impetus to get legislation enacted, when you need to get a consensus together, and I share his concern. The \nwhole idea of a national ID, as I described it in my opening statement to you, Mr. Chairman, is a non- starter and we \ndon't want to talk about it. Not that we don't want to recognize people could call something that, but I don't want a \nnational ID with a national database with Big Brother. What I do want is the improvement that that commission \ncould recommend and make things more secure in identification that really works in this country.\n\nMR. GINGRICH: Let me be a doubter just for a second. I'm not opposed to a commission, but I think we know an \nawful lot of what needs to happen and Congress, I think, could move expeditiously early next year on an awful lot of \nstuff. Particularly, as it relates to non-citizens we really know how much we have to improve that system. And I'm \nnot sure that we need to have more people tell us -- I suspect, if you had your staff from the Library of Congress pull \nup all the commissions on this topic in the last 20 years and simply put out a summary of recommendations, you'll \nbe astonished how much already exists and how many smart people have already worked the issue. I think it's \nimportant to move while the public is paying attention and cares about this topic and that would be in the next \nsession of Congress, not three years from now.\n\nMR. MCCOLLUM: And by the way, I'd echo that. I think he's absolutely right about that point.\n\nREP. HORN: Well, I thank you all for coming. I know when the three of you are together, it's going to be a lively \nsession. We wish you well.\n\nMR. GINGRICH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. HORN: We'll go to the second panel now.\n\n(Pause in proceedings.)\n\nREP. HORN: Let's get them to take the oath also. So raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the \ntestimony you will give before the subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\n\nWITNESSES: I do.\n\nREP. HORN: The clerk will note all the individuals, the witnesses -- and I didn't see too many other assistants.\n\n\n\nSo let us start then with Mr. Turley, Shapiro professor of Public Interest Law at the George Washington University \nLaw School. Mr. Turley.\n\nMR. JONATHAN TURLEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me express my thanks for \nappearing again before this subcommittee and also to appear before you, perhaps for my last time, as chairman of \nthis subcommittee. We all owe you a great debt and your retirement is a real loss to this institution and I want to be \none that thanks you for it.\n\nREP. HORN: Remember, you're under oath now.\n\nMR. TURLEY: (Laughs.) Obviously, this is a subject where generally more heat than light is generated and in a rare \ndisplay of academic modesty, I will say that I will not resolve the questions surrounding this debate. I would, \nhowever, like to offer a constitutional historical foundation perhaps to move the debate from what is often kinetic \nrhetoric to a more stable basis for discussion.\n\nIt's certainly not enough to dismiss national identification systems, as opposed to a card, as unprecedented. The \nframers gave us a system that was certainly at the time unique, because it is the most nimble and versatile system \nin the world. As in nature, nations that fail to evolve are least likely to survive. The world is not static and so our \nresponses have to be as dynamic as the world around us. So this is a hearing that is looking at a question that's \nvery much a question for our times. Whether you consider the national identification system to be a necessary \nsecurity measure or Big Brother's little helper, we need to reach some type of consensus. And so tonight, I'd offer \nmy views on those lines.\n\nToday's debate is part of the long, unbroken debate that has raged between the government and the governed. We, \nas Americans, have a virtual hereditary suspicion of government. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, \"The life of the \nlaw has not been logic, it's been experience.\" And our experience with the government, in systems of this kind, has \nnot been good. It's been long and painful. We have learned that government authority operates along the same \nprinciples as a gas in a closed space. As you expand that space, government authority will expand as well to the full \nextent of the expansion. And from Biblical times, and I've laid this out in my written testimony, through the Ottoman \nEmpire and Henry VIII to the present time, nations have tried to create national registries. Not for oppressive \nreasons but for necessary reasons. But those systems have, as we know, been used for great harm.\n\nNow, we also need to get away from a habit of talking a good game about national identification systems. We are \nvery proud, as Americans, that we don't have human license plates. But the fact is we have a national identification \nsystem; it just doesn't happen to be a very good one. We have allowed the Social Security number to mutate into a \nnational identifier. That is ironic since, as I mention in my testimony, the Congress was quite clear that the Social \nSecurity number was not to be used as a source of identification. This Congress has repeatedly said that it should \nnot be used as opposed to a national identification card. And so the question is: why in my wallet do I have a drivers \nlicense, a smart university card, an athletic card and credit cards that are all based on my SSN?\n\nWhy do I have two kids, one who's three and one who's one and a half, who have their own cards? They are \nalready being tracked. Human serialization that we fear is here in some respects. But the reason it's here and the \nreason we failed in our efforts to control the SSN is because the market had a need; it created a vacuum that in the \nabsence on Congressional involvement, it filled that vacuum. The SSN was inevitable because the market needed \nit.\n\nI happen to have a great deal of problems with national identification systems. I tend to fear government, quite \nfrankly.\n\nI tend to like at least of it as I possibly can have. But we also have to be concerned that if we do not act, that the \nmarket will act for us. We have to be concerned that if we remain passive, there will be efforts to fill that vacuum, \nand they're happening right now. At this moment, the heads of Department of Motor Vehicles have already moved \n\n\n\ntowards a -- what's called a de facto national identification card. The airlines are working on a fast track card of their \nown, that will effectively have a national footprint.\n\nNow, I don't know the heads of Departments of Motor Vehicles, quite frankly; maybe I should. But I don't they're the \nones that should make this decision. I think that you're the ones that should make this decision and it's important for \nyou, I believe, not to be repelled by the idea to the extent of being absent.\n\nI happen to believe, and this may disagree with our earlier panel, that we may want to discourage the development \nof those cards. We may want to try to exercise some degree of control as to what is happening in the country in \nterms of identifications. If nothing else, to avoid the creation of redundant systems where we suddenly have a whole \nbunch of cards that become barriers to travel.\n\nNow, in the review of identification cards around the world, you have over 100 nations with different cards. But to \nuse the term national identification system, let alone national identification card, is virtually meaningless. These \nsystems are unbelievably diverse. Some of them are really little better than our SSN system. Others are incredibly \ndetailed and are attached to databank that probably would make most Americans feel uneasy.\n\nBut using the reference to Nazi Germany and to the abuses I think is a little bit overblown, but it is relevant. It is \noverblown in the sense that we have a nation that has its own safeguards, constitutional safeguards, cultural \nsafeguards, that make those types of abuses of historical but not contemporary relevance. Many of our friends \naround the world, like Belgium and France and Germany, are great democracies and yet they have these cards. So \nI think we need to look at this with the appropriate amount of passion, but also with an open mind.\n\nNow, the cards differ of course dramatically. Britain of course had a national identification system that was \ndiscontinued in the 1950s, when they had a negative ruling by the Lord Chief Justice. They're now considering a \nnew card. And they range -- we can look at, for example, the Belgium identification card, which is one of the most \ndeveloped of systems. And in Belgium you are required to have a card at age 12 and then you're required to carry it \nby age 15. You are required to have it on you. It is not an internal passport system in the most negative sense, but it \nis a potential barrier in the sense that when you go to an airport, apparently, in Belgium, you do have to show the \ncard. Obviously, Belgium has not used that card for oppressive means; far from it. They have a large database that \nthe police have access to.\n\nGermany also requires the carrying of a card and it has a great deal of information, it's incorporated into a database \nwhich is accessed from multiple sources. Like Belgium, it's a stand alone system. Other countries like -- for \nexample, for the Dutch they have the SOFI number, which is a more developed system than our Social Security \nsystem. It's sort of a hybrid between these various options. And you can go through, as my testimony indicates, \nfrom country to country to look at all of these options.\n\nNow, as we move towards to a national identification system, if we are going to move towards that, then we need \nto look at the constitutional and legal parameters for that system, because we're all talking about so far a system \nmore of authentication. And it seems that we're mainly talking here, and the members have already indicated, \nthey're interested in authenticating people, to make sure they are the people that they say they are.\n\nSo we have to distinguish between what we're trying to achieve. Are we trying to get a ready identification that's \nreliable for the cop on the beat, so that he can take a look, and a card is biometrics and other elements that make it \nhard to tamper with? If that's the case, the card could be largely contentless. It simply requires those biometric \nelements to be reliable as authentication. If we're talking about, as has been discussed in the past, a smart card \nattached to a database, we're talking about a far more significant issues in terms of constitutional and legal \nquestions.\n\nOne of the most important constitution questions that have to dealt with is the right of travel. The Supreme Court \nhas said that the right of travel is virtually unconditional in the United States. And when we develop national \n\n\n\nidentification systems, we have to be concerned not just in drift, but that those systems can create barriers to travel \nthat will impinge upon that right. And I go into that in my testimony.\n\nWe also have to be concerned about creating a national identification system that will fall into the trap of the Brady \nLaw. To some extent, any national identification system will require the integration of state and federal systems. To \nthe extent that we commandeer the state agencies, we're moving into a separate area in which constitutional \nconcerns would be heightened. Then, finally, there are privacy protections that I talk about in my testimony.\n\nWhat I would like to propose is that Congress consider one thing that I think is clear, and clarity in this matter is truly \nvaluable. It should not necessarily be clear how we should proceed, but it should be clear how we should not \nproceed. We need to look at the SSN experience and not repeat it. That's not how we do national policy. We \nallowed the SSN to be propelled into a national identifier, without any vote of this body. There were a couple of laws \nin which this -- in which Congress embraced the SSN. Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted to use the SSN, but for \nthe most part this has been done with little foresight and control. And as we see these, quote \"de facto identification \ncards\" in the making, it seems that history is repeating itself.\n\nSo that's the reason I've recommended the creation of a federal commission and, God knows, this town does not \nrequire another commission. I've been on a federal advisory group. I was on it for three years and at the end I \nwanted to take a ballpoint hammer to my head. They are frustrating, there's too many of them, but unfortunately I \nthink this is an area that deserves a commission; unlike the ones that we have seen in the past.\n\nNewt Gingrich is right, we have had commissions in this area, but none have been given the specific task of looking \nat whether we are going to have a national identification system. Whether or not we act or not, that's important. We \nneed to have a commission that looks at the question of whether there is inevitability, whether in this information \nage we're going to have this Cosian (ph) problem where the market is going to dictate those conditions unless you \ndo something. So we have to deal with reality and if that reality is that businesses and agencies need national \nidentifiers, I would rather have you involved in it than the hidden hand of a market which may take us away from \nprivacy.\n\nThat commission can look at some questions I've laid out in my testimony. The first one is what the function utility of \na national identifier card is. I've already mentioned that, but there are vast differences and when you look at what \npeople have said about national identification systems, they are as different as you can possibly be. Some of them \nare talking about massive databases; some of them are talking about immediate authentication. I don't know which \none we need, but we need to look at that before we do anything.\n\nSecond, we have to look at the utility of the system. Part of the problem with a national identification card is that you \ncan have a sleeper agent from Al-Qaeda or an espionage agent in the United States. One of the most effective \nways to penetrate a nation is to have a sleeper and he or she comes into the country, she has a wonderful life, is a \nwonderful neighbor, goes to PTL meetings and then about nine years down the road Al-Qaeda activates her. She's \ngot a wallet full of every possible card, from the PTA to a fast track card, to a national identification card.\n\nFinally, we need to also -- I'm sorry, second we need to look at what technology would be used for the system. We \nhave everything from iris recognition to DNA fingerprinting to facial recognition systems. We need to look at those \ntechnologies. We need to, if we're going to embrace the technology, embrace one that is going to be good 10 \nyears from now, that is going to be accurate and reliable. We need to look at the system to prevent hacking, \nbecause if this is going to be a system like Belgium's where you need it to get on a plane, then frankly it's \ndangerous to have the usual government error rate with databanks and databases.\n\nFinally, we need to look at what type of protections we need to put in place. As you know, the Census Bureau \ninformation is supposed to be private but it was used to round up Japanese Americans. We also know that \ninformation from states has been sold on to private companies. And then, finally, I've suggested that we consider \nthe need for a constitutional amendment. I have never supported a constitutional amendment until this year. But \nthere is a trend that needs to be arrested and that trend is the diminishment of privacy. It's chilling to hear a person \n\n\n\nlike Simpson, who I have a huge amount of respect for, say that privacy is dead -- because if privacy is dead, we \nhave allowed something that is uniquely American to die with it.\n\nSo in conclusion, the test of the moment, I think, is to try to protect our society without changing it in the way that \nwe lose the object of our defense. The framers never said this would be an easy road, they simply said it was the \nonly road for a free people. And so I suppose the charge of the framers is this: how to keep us safe from harm but \nto pass along our system to the next generation with the condition it was passed to us? I think that's a subject that \ndeserves some thought and circumspection. I thank you very much for your time today.\n\nREP. HORN: We thank you very much for your presentation. I have had the opportunity last night to read all of \nthem and we will first get all the presentations, then the members will have a question and answer with you and \ndialogue.\n\nNow, my next witness here we deeply are for, Roy M. Goodman, state senator New York. You joined us on such \nshort notice. We thank you very much. You flew down here from New York this morning after our invitation \nyesterday afternoon, so you get things done very fast. And I look at this background. Any legislator that has 1,200 \nof his bills become law, that's impressive. So we're lucky around here if we get five to be presented. And we thank \nyou because you are also in the same business we are as chairman of the Senate Committee on Investigations, \nTaxation and Government Operations, and looks like you've had a lot of fun. So thanks for coming.\n\nMR. ROY M. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much indeed for that warm welcome. I'm grateful to you \nand the members of the committee for an opportunity to appear before you today, albeit on relatively short notice.\n\nI would like to make at the outset a comment of warm salute to my former colleague in the state Senate in New \nYork, Major Owens, one of our more esteemed members who has risen to the heights of the U.S. Congress.\n\nMajor, I can see just from the height of the ceiling in this room that we have pygmy proportions compared to the \nstature which all of you possess and I'm very proud to know you.\n\nAnd also Ms. Maloney, who happens to be my own congresswoman. I very much hope she'll be around in a few \nmoments so I can salute her personally, a much esteemed and good friend; although on the other side of the aisle, I \nmust confess.\n\nMay I say, Mr. Chairman, that once upon a time on the matter of personal identity there was a gentleman who \nentered his men's club -- an elderly chap with mutton-chop whiskers, a typical old Peter Arneau (ph) personality -- \nand he sunk into a deep chair and rang the little bell next to it on the table, by which he hoped to summon the club's \nsteward so he could order his usual martini. Nothing happened and he rang the bell again. Finally, after ringing it \nfour times, he was outraged and someone came by and he said, \"Great God, man, do you know who I am?\" and he \nwas speaking to one of the employees of the club. And the chap looked at him and said, \"No, sir, I don't. But if you'll \ngo down I'm sure the gentleman at the front desk will be able to tell you.\" So this was an indication of an identity \ncrisis that occurred under slightly different circumstances.\n\nMay I say, sir, that on a much more serious note, unfortunately I appear before you at a moment when the nation is \nplunged into a war which it did not seek and which was visited upon us in a most astonishing fashion on September \n11. The trauma of that is simply indescribable. I might just tell you that on my second trip -- my first trip down to \nGround Zero I had a chat with the fire commissioner, who was describing some of his experiences on that particular \nday. And without being too lugubrious, let me say that he said a chap came up to one of his firemen and said, \"I \nhave a helmet here, sir.\" And he said, \"Why are you bothering me with that? We're trying to save lives.\" He said, \n\"The reason I'm bothering you with it is that there is a human head in the helmet.\"\n\nAlas, the gentleman had been decapitated and this was one of the horrific, horrendous things that occurred on that \ndate. And, needless to say, this is something which has embedded itself in all of our minds most profoundly, and \n\n\n\nwith a sense of deep grief and outrage we appear before you to discuss the problems relating to the identity card \nmatter. And I have to tell you that my whole view of it is heavily tinctured by the fact that we are at war.\n\nI spent three years in the Navy during the Korean War and wore about my neck at that time an ID tag with a \nthumbprint engraved upon it, so that the idea of having a fingerprint identification is certainly nothing new. My \nofficers' identification card had a full set of prints on it. It is something which anyone who's been in the military \nservices is fully familiar with.\n\nI thought it would be useful just to take a moment to review with you the contents of my own wallet in regard to \ncards. I confess I hadn't thought to do this until I sat down here this afternoon, but I notice that I have a few of them. \nAnd just to give you some idea of the extent to which privacy is invaded, let me give you a quick inventory of my \ncards. I'll make it very brief.\n\nOn top is a picture card identifying me as a New York state senator. Beneath that is my drivers' license, which also \nhas a picture of me upon it. My Citibank Visa Card which also has a picture on it. My MTA, that is to say \nMetropolitan Transit Authority subway card, which has my picture on it. A Sam's Club card, Sam's Club being a \nretail establishment where I have credit, which has my picture on it. And then we go through a series of others: \nAmerican Express, New York Society of Security Analysts, my Medicare card, my New York Public Library card, my \nWyoming Public Library card, where I go in the summer time, my Barnes and Noble credit card, my New York \ngovernment employee benefit card, my Automobile Club of America card, my Metropolitan Museum identification \ncard, my Whitney Museum card, my Museum of Modern Art card.\n\nThat is just a few of the things that I carry with me to be sure that I am at all times able to identify myself as I go \nabout my daily routine. I think this gives you a little idea of the lack of privacy which we have, even with the best of \nintentions. We are certainly photographed widely and our data is on file in many different places. I'm sure anyone in \nthe room could produce a wallet with somewhat similar credentials and make the point that we are today certainly in \nan identification card society at a very broad level.\n\nAnd may I say to you, sir, that it had been my opportunity as chairman of the Investigations Committee in 1993, \nwhen the World Trade Center was bombed -- you may recall we had a dreadful incident in which there was a \ngigantic explosion. I went into that hole and found a tremendous crater five stories deep and three stories high, and \nat that time felt it important to examine the matter of how we have achieved security in regard to the terrorist \npossibilities of future attack. And we prepared a report at that date stating that there were many vulnerabilities and \nwe thought it advisable to create a commission, which commission would have as its principal objective eternal \nvigilance to try to prevent the recurrence of this type of terrorist attack.\n\nIn so doing, I'm sorry to say that people's eyes quickly glazed over and, as is our want as human beings, we fairly \nsoon forgot that episode. And not until September 11 when we had this far graver problem arise with such \nunpredicted suddenness, did we find ourselves in the position of having to once again reconsider this. And I did pull \ntogether a group of five former police commissioners, groups from the FBI, from the Ports Authority, police and a \nnumber of others to participate in an examination of potential terrorist targets and possible means of defending \nagainst them.\n\nThat committee happens to have issued a report yesterday which I have and have, I think, sent in advance to you. I \nwon't attempt to touch on all aspects of it, because it goes far beyond the subject of today's meeting. But let me say \nthat we believe that there are at least 50 different ways in which we should be tightening up the security in the state \nof New York to prevent future occurrences.\n\nThey cover such things as commercial airline safety, private airline safety, which is a thing that has loopholes the \nsize of the Lincoln Tunnel. Anyone can go to a private airport, get on a plane of almost any size, load it with any \ncargo without any inspection whatsoever, proceed to fly over the United Nations building, fly into it and destroy it in \na matter of seconds, in much the same fashion that the World Trade Center was destroyed. And the same would \napply to the Empire State and others of our magnificent buildings in New York.\n\n\n\nSo that this just indicates the extent to which in this war time environment we have not really risen to the concept \nthat we must gird our loins and prepare ourselves with emphatic dedication. I think it was Herbert Spencer said it \nwas only by iteration and reiteration that we impress an alien conception upon an unreceptive mind. And it's only by \niteration and reiteration that we must remind ourselves that we are at war, and war is a very grim business in which \nwe have to suspend values which we normally might wish to feel are repugnant to us in other contexts. I see my \nsign has just signaled stop.\n\nREP. HORN: Don't worry. Just keep going a little.\n\nMR. GOODMAN: Thank you, sir. I'll try to keep it as succinct as I can. Let me simply say to you that with regard to \nthe matters of other emergency issues, we've looked at hospitals, we've looked at the transit system and at various \nmatters relating to nuclear electric gas supplies to the city of New York. There's a possibility that our power could be \nshut off very simply by going to a point of convergence of electric lines. We want to emphasize the problems of \nbiological and chemical warfare, about which much has been unfortunately discussed here in Washington in the \nwake of the anthrax scare, and on and on.\n\nAnd let me say that I speak at the moment on behalf of my colleagues who are former police commissioners, as I've \nsaid, including the new police commissioner designated to the city of New York, designated by our new mayor. His \nname is Raymond Kelly (sp) and he is an expert in the law and, indeed, I think is a man of balanced judgment. It \nwas the unanimous judgment of this group that there should be instituted a national identification card system, and \nopened questions whether it should be voluntary or involuntary, and I'm not prepared to give you any conclusion. \nMy colleagues are thinking on that.\n\nMy own concerns at the moment are very great. As a civil libertarian of long standing, I'm very much concerned \nabout the possibility that such a system could be misused. But let me just say that we now have the -- as Mr. Ellison \nhas pointed out to us, the means by which to create cards which can carry a tremendous amount of information and \ncertainly establish beyond any reasonable doubt the identity of the individual holding the card.\n\nAs you may be aware, in Israel people going seeking entrance to an airplane do not have to stand on long lines. \nThey go to a kiosk and insert their card, insert the palm of their hand and stand in front of a camera, which does \nthree things, I'm told. One is to check whether the palm print coincides with the print on the electronic chip \nembedded in the card, to determine whether the facial characteristics are such as to be individual involved. And, \nfinally, to determine whether the retina of the eye, which apparently is unique in every human being, is such as to \npositively identify the individual. This tripartite identification concept is one which is now technologically feasible and \nis in effect in various countries around the world, and has been used quite successfully.\n\nSo the question is not whether it can be done, nor is it necessarily the cost of doing it, because one could envisage \na system in which there are payments made as a service, as we pay for EZ-Pass cards in our cars going through \nthe toll facilities in New York. So that I'm simply here to say to you that the problem becomes one of the extent to \nwhich this could impinge upon privacy. And I'd remind us all that the Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that \nthere is clear protection in the law for privacy, but not for anonymity. And there's nothing about any Supreme Court \ndicta of which I'm aware, and this point is fully emphasized by the distinguished civil libertarian lawyer Alan \nDershowitz, who in a paper made it clear that, in his judgment, the time had come for the use of these cards.\n\nAnd I say to you, sir, that it's my belief that in order to accomplish several objectives the cards may serve a useful \npurpose and I'd like to quickly outline the objectives, and that would conclude my testimony. The principal purpose \nof the card would be to positively identify an individual, to be certain that his identity has not been stolen. As you \nmay know, identity theft is a matter that is now quite pervasive in our society. People's identities have been stolen. \nTheir bankcards have been lifted. They've been charged with purchases which they never made, telephone calls \nwhich they never placed, and the like. So that there is a serious problem of finding a stable means of positive \nidentification which, as I've indicated, now exists.\n\n\n\nSo that the question then becomes one of whether we are in a position to use the cards constructively. I would say \nto you that for the privilege of not having to wait two to three hours on an airline counter line, that that might be \nworth a $25 payment for a lifetime or a two or three year subscription to a card. Similarly, I think it's quite clear that \nthis would eliminate the need for profiling, an obnoxious thing based upon ethnicity, or the various other \ncharacteristics which have been used by police to properly identify presumed suspects.\n\nBy having a positive ID card, a man could walk in wearing all sorts of outlandish clothing with a beard of three feet \nlong and side burns, and all of the things which might normally be associated with someone who is an undesirable, \nby virtue of easy thinking. And by simply presenting the card, he would exempt himself from the need for any \nspecial profiling type examination. It strikes me that at this moment, because of the unique facial hirsuteness of the \npeople with whom we are at war, that there is a problem. As you recall, a Hindu was mistakenly taken for a Muslim \nand slaughtered early on, right after September 11, which is the kind of tragedy we certainly wish to avert. And an \nID card would preclude that type of problem altogether, it's my judgment.\n\nFurthermore, there are various conveniences if one wished and wished to volunteer to have certain health aspects \nof one's existence on the card. If you dropped to the ground with a cardiac arrest and the card were in your \npossession, it could be put into a reader and quickly determine your condition of health and whether certain drugs \ncould or could not be administered to you, whether a defibrillator would be an appropriate thing to use in view of \nyour heart rhythm pattern and the like, and this could be a very beneficial health aspect to the card system.\n\nSo the point that I'm making is that it's not simply an intrusion of privacy that's involved. There are various collateral \nbenefits which should be weighed into total consideration of whether these cards make sense. Mr. Chairman, let me \njust sum up by saying that it's a complex question and because of my civil libertarian concerns I've thought long and \nhard about this. I do believe at this time we have the sufficient sophistication and awareness of the types of \nproblems that exist to form a decent judgment in the matter, and I would respectfully suggest to this committee that \nit take a very close look at least the volunteer use of such cards.\n\nI think at this time, in view of our war emergency, they've become very relevant to attempting to determine who is \nimproperly in the United States at any given moment, tracking people who may be undesirable or have patterns of \nsabotage or other behavior which needs to be properly overseen and tracked, and that without such cards it \nbecomes exponentially more difficult to accomplish this purpose. So with those thoughts in mind, I shall now \nsubside with all due respect and thank you very much for a chance to be heard.\n\nREP. HORN: I think you mentioned earlier that you had some recommendations out of your committee, and once \nyou're done with it if you could -- we'll have a spot in this to get the whole document.\n\nMR. GOODMAN: I'd be glad to do that.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you very much.\n\nMS. MALONEY: Personal privilege. I would thank you.\n\nREP. HORN: He says he likes you.\n\nMS. MALONEY: Well, I would like it if you'd welcome my senator, actually.\n\nMR. GOODMAN: (Inaudible) -- and I took the liberty of saluting you most warmly.\n\nMS. MALONEY: (Inaudible) -- for many, many years. And we welcome your testimony. You've always tackled the \nhard problems and come up with good answers, and we appreciate your distinguished input into this committee. \nThank you for coming. It's good to see.\n\nMR. GOODMAN: Thank you very much. It's good to see you too.\n\n\n\nREP. HORN: We now go to Katie Corrigan, who is the legislative counsel on the privacy issues for the Washington \nNational Office of the American Civil Liberties Union. And she has quite a background in terms of health, education, \nlabor, pensions matters. And we're glad to have you here.\n\nMS. KATIE CORRIGAN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the members of the \nsubcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you on national ID proposals on behalf of the American \nCivil Liberties Union. The ACLU is a nationwide non- partisan organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated \nto protecting the individual liberties and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\n\nLike all Americans, the ACLU supports efforts to ensure our security from terrorist threat. But we remain convinced \nthat we need not sacrifice our liberties to protect our safety. We believe a national ID system in any form should be \nrejected. First ACLU believes that the threshold question is whether or not a security measure would be effective at \nprotecting us from terrorist threats. Since the terrible events of September 11, there have been numerous proposals \nto create a national ID system. The rationale is that we need to create a clear line between us, the innocent people, \nand them, the dangerous terrorists.\n\nEvery one of us would like an ID card that would put us squarely on the right side of the line and exempt us from \nsuspicion and heighten security when we board a plane or go to work. Unfortunately, none of the proposed ID \nsystems would effectively sort out the good from the bad. An identity card is only as good as the information that \nestablishes an individual's identity in the first place. It makes no sense to build a national ID system on a faulty \nfoundation, particularly when possession of the ID card would give you a free pass to board a plane or avoid \nsecurity checks at federal buildings or other public places.\n\nNo form of documentation is completely foolproof . The same people who are forging IDs today will forge them \ntomorrow. There are always ways to beat the system. Presumably, an individual would obtain an identity card using \na document such as birth certificate or a driver's license. Anyone, including terrorists, could alter or obtain such \ndocuments. The inspector general of Social Security testified last week that six of the hijackers obtained Social \nSecurity numbers through fraudulent means. And, as U.S. citizens, domestic terrorists like Timothy McVeigh would \ncertainly qualify for an ID.\n\nSecond, not only would a national ID create a false sense of security but it would be very, very expensive and divert \nresources from perhaps more effective counter-terrorism measures. In 1998 the GAO reported that the Social \nSecurity Administration estimates no matter what material a card is made from, or what type of technology, \nincluding biometric, is used for security, issuing an enhanced card to all number holders using current procedures \nwould cost a minimum of about $4 billion or more. And even with the offer from Oracle and Larry Ellison for free \nsoftware, the processing costs alone of issuing new IDs to Americans are estimated to be 90 percent of that billion \ndollar expense.\n\nThird, in addition to huge costs, a national ID would require a massive identification bureaucracy to support it. \nThousands of government employees would be required to develop, implement, maintain the supporting computer \ninfrastructure and technology standards for the ID card. The SSA's $4 billion estimate didn't even consider the cost \nof updating the picture or other identifiers on the card over a person's lifetime, or periodically replacing the magnetic \nstrip on the back, or the simple cost of having to replace lost or stolen IDs.\n\nWhen setting up any new bureaucracy simple questions need answers. What would happen if an ID card is stolen? \nWhat proof of identity would be used to decide who gets a card? What would happen if you lose your ID? Anyone \nwho has had to correct an inaccurate credit history will understand how hard it could be to correct an error that has \nfound its way into a government database. Error rates in government databases already tend to be especially high, \nand we heard that from members of our first panel.\n\nAnd what happens if you are misidentified, or one of the thousands of victims of identity theft? Even with a biometric \nidentifier on each and every ID, experts say that there's no guarantee that individuals will be identified or \nmisidentified in error. A technology expert at the University of Pennsylvania recently said biometrics are fallible. \n\n\n\nFourth, an ID system violates basic American values, including our privacy, equality and our right simply to be left \nalone.\n\nDay-to-day individuals could be asked for ID when they are walking down the street, applying for a job or health \ninsurance, or entering a building. This type of intrusiveness would be joined with the full power of modern computer \nand database technology. How long before office buildings, doctor's office, gas station, highway tolls, subways and \nbuses incorporate the ID card into their security or payment systems? The result could be a nation where our \ncitizens' movements inside our own country are monitored through what would equivalently be internal passports.\n\nThe database supporting such an ID system would be massive and contain all sorts of highly personal information. \nThousands and thousands of government employees and even private industry could have access to it. The scope \nof information accessible through a centralized database, as opposed to the many different databases that are \nattached to the cards that Senator Goodman pointed to, would magnify the risk of privacy violation.\n\nOne mistake by a government employee could result in disclosure of personal information that could follow you \naround the rest of your life. This past month a state university accidentally posted the psychological records of 62 \nchildren on the Internet: names, addresses and along with intimate details, such as a boy prone to anger outbursts, \ngender identity issues and bedwetting. Disclosures could come back to haunt children later in life when they are \ntrying to find a job or get a security clearance. With an ID system, one accidental keyboard stroke could put a \nperson's most sensitive information into public distribution.\n\nAnd finally, Mr. Chairman, some people have argued that ID would end racial profiling and other discriminatory \npractices. Unfortunately, we believe that cards would provide new opportunities for discrimination and harassment \nof people who are perceived or looking or sounding foreign. The 1986 requirement that employers verify the identity \nof potential employees and their eligibility to work in the U.S. has resulted in widespread discrimination against \nforeign-looking American workers, especially Asians and Hispanics. A national ID card would have the same effect \non a broader scale. Latinos, Asians, African Americans and other minorities would become subject to more and \nmore status and identity checks. This would have a stigmatizing and humiliating effect and undermine our right to \nequal treatment.\n\nA national ID system in any form would be expensive, require a cumbersome bureaucracy and violate some of our \nfundamental American values. And it simply wouldn't work to stop terrorism. The ACLU urges the Congress to \nreject proposes for a national ID system and I'd be happy to answer any questions at the appropriate time. Thank \nyou.\n\nREP. HORN: Delighted to have your presentation and we now move to Rudi Veestraeten, the counselor and \nconsul at the Embassy of Belgium, and he's been in their Foreign Affairs Ministry in their home city and he's had a \n-- he's had quite a career for his own country and we're thanking you for telling us how that works.\n\nMR. RUDI VEESTRAETEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of the subcommittee. It's an honor to \nbe invited here today. I'll try to give some comments. I had a document, which was distributed, contains the basics \nabout the system in Belgium.\n\nFirst of all, Belgium is -- for those who would doubt -- is a democracy. It's a democratic country. We have a \nlongstanding record of democracy and -- and that is the specific -- we have a very longstanding record of registering \npeople and issuing ID cards. We actually started issuing ID cards in 1919. We started registering people locally in \ntowns and in cities in 1800. That is an existing system in Belgium.\n\nI think when we talk about ID cards, when we talk about registration, there are -- and talk about the events of \nSeptember 11 and other threats in the society today, there are in fact three elements which are often mixed. First \nthere is the ID card as such. ID card is just a document which allows somebody to authentify (sic) who he is. A \nhundred years ago, 50 years ago people might still just know you and know who you are. Even today people in my \nvillage in Belgium, they know who I am. My neighbors here in McLean, they know who I am.\n\n\n\nBut when I drive around in a car, people do not know any more. The card is just a means to prove who you are, that \nyou are who you say you are. That is the card. Then there is the second element in this discussion: the database \nissue. We also have a quite sophisticated system in Belgium with a centralized database which contains a limited \nnumber of informations. You can find that in the documentation.\n\nThe database is a very powerful tool to quickly find more. If somebody shows up and has an identity card, you can \nthen as a police officer, as a public servant, depending on what your duties are, you can then find out about that \nperson what is his background. These are data not contained in the cards, not written on the cards, but there is a \nwhole database behind the card; a system where more information is available if needed and to those who need it.\n\nAnd then there is the whole issue of security. I'm not going to talk about that, but that's a whole other issue. Of \ncourse, the fact of having a card, having a passport, having a travel document, having a driver's license does not \nallow any police officers to determine whether a person is a terrorist or is a genuine person. That's not a purpose of \nthe card. Let's not mistake this. The purpose of the card is just -- is only to authentify that this person is indeed -- \ndoes have this first name and that last name and is properly registered at a particular address.\n\nThis is very important distinction to make, I think. If we discuss about the abuse of cards -- I mean, the threats of \nhaving cards in a country like Belgium, the threat of having this system where everybody needs to carry cards. Well, \nin fact, you can say the same -- this dates back from the German occupation. We were occupied by the Germans \ntwice: in '14/18 and in '40/45. We have been fighting the German system, the German the Nazism, the fascists, in \n'40/45. We are proud to have done that. I think we have a longstanding record of fighting authoritarian mechanisms, \nauthoritarian regimes and we are very proud of that.\n\nNow, the Germans, when they occupied Belgium they used police -- they used military police, they used an army to \noccupy our country and to take away all our civil liberties. Now, this does not mean that we have decided, after we \nwere freed from the German occupation, to abolish police, to do away with an army, to do away with military police. \nThat's not to the point. What we should try to do is to keep steady democratic control over what police does in our \ncountry. Keep steady democratic control about what the army is doing, what the army can do, what the powers are \nthe army can be given. And that is the sense of the -- it's not about having police which can, of course, abuse its \nforce; it's about control of the police.\n\nThe same goes, in our view, in Belgium for the cards. It's not about the cards. It's about how you use the cards, \nwhat you allow people to do with the cards, the way you control, and so on. That is the essence of the debate in our \ncountry where it was taken.\n\nNow, if we want to see what the card means in our system today, what do we use it for? I think the best way to -- \nand for the two ministers that have left, to explain that is to see -- to imagine -- from my viewpoint, for me to imagine \nmy country without the identity card. What would be different if we would take away the identity cards in Belgium? I \nthink first of all we would do what is the case in many other countries. We would probably see other documents \nbeing used instead of an identity card. This might be drivers' licenses, this might be Social Security cards. We have \nthose cards in Belgium as well.\n\nThe problem there -- and that is why we have introduced the card in the first place, the problem is that those other \ncards contain data which are not meant to be communicated to some persons. I mean, on a driver's license there \ncan be data which are not meant to be communicated to a bank employee. It can be medical data, like vision. It can \nappear not to be very important, but the vision is mentioned on the driver's license. Same goes for handicap in \nsome cases. I mean, driver's license are meant for other purposes than identification, and therefore contain other \ninformation which are not meant for public distribution, and not meant for the bank employee.\n\nSame goes for the security -- the other cards, Social Security card here and in Belgium. Those cards are not meant \nfor identification purposes and so do not contain the proper security features which would be required for an identity \ncard, which is a different issue. A passport is an identity travel document, so it's more similar to an identity card. \n\n\n\nAnd then there is also the fact that some people might not have a particular type of card. They may not have a \ndriver's license. I have colleague diplomats who do not drive their own cars. They do not have a driver's license.\n\nSo what do you do with those people in Belgium, if you would generalize the driver's license to be used instead of \nan identity card? You would then have to find a system where you would issue driver's license with no right to drive \na car for identification purposes, which is not really what it's about. So that is one thing. We have a feeling in \nBelgium that the inappropriate use of other identifiers is in fact a highly sensitive civil liberties issue, because you \nwould then abuse other cards. And information contained in other cards in other systems abuse this information for \njust mere authentication and identification.\n\nWhat would also disappear if you would take away this card, and this is probably typical for Belgium and not for a \ncountry like the U.S., is that it's very convenient for people. We can travel in Europe with the ID. We do not need \npassports to travel in Europe to countries like Turkey, neighboring countries. We have agreements there. So if we \nwould abolish the card in Belgium, much more people would need passports and this would increase the cost as \nwell for those people as for the administration to issue all these extra passports.\n\nIn case of police checks, if some things happen and people are stopped in the street in a car, the fact that we have \nthe identity cards and a very efficient database does save a lot of time. People can be released after only two \nminutes, just checking if this person is really who he is. So it's also a matter there in our view of civil liberty that we \ncan release people immediately, if there is no need to keep them. We don't need to take them to the office, to the \npolice office. Another very convenient use of the card is in case of unfortunate accidents. When there is an accident \nwith a person on a bicycle, and he carries his cards, it's very easy to identify him to warn his family members.\n\nSo it's also in the advantage of the citizens of Belgium that the card exists. And then an alternative from this, we \nalso quite generally use the identity cards to fight credit card fraud in Belgium. In many shops when you want to pay \nwith a credit card, you would need to show your identity card, and the way you would show --\n\nREP. HORN: Your time is running.\n\nMR. VEESTRAETEN: Thank you.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you very much. We're going to recess now, because we have to get through the testimony \nand I want to give them full reason, Mr. Hoechst and Mr. Shneiderman. So we're in recess until 12:45, and in other \nwords a quarter of one. We have a motion on the floor to recommit with instructions and a passage situation. So \nwe're in recess until 12:45.\n\n(Recess.)\n\nREP. HORN: The subcommittee will be in order, and the recess is adjourned. And we will start with Mr. \nVeestraeten, who might not have been completely finished.\n\nSo you're certainly welcome if you want to give a few sentences on it.\n\nMR. VEESTRAETEN: Yes, sir, I was finished. Thank you so much.\n\nREP. HORN: Okay. We will then move to Mr. Hoechst, senior vice president of technology, the Oracle Corporation.\n\nThank you for coming.\n\nMR. TIM HOECHST: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Representatives Schakowsky and members of the subcommittee, \non behalf of Oracle I would like to thank you for inviting me to participate in this discussion. I would also ask that my \ncomments and written testimony be submitted to the record, along with an article written by our CEO Larry Ellison --\n\nREP. HORN: Without objection.\n\n\n\nMR. HOECHST: (Off mic) -- Thank you. The reason that I ask to do that in particular, is the article in its original form \nmakes arguments about this issue that unfortunately were culled out during the endless number of editing \nprocesses that go on as articles reach sound bites. And so I think many of the issues that are relevant to this \ndiscussion, which I'll address in my comments, were part of that original proposal as well.\n\nAs we know, information is an incredibly powerful tool and whether we're using it to make decisions in a boardroom \nor on a battlefield, whoever knows the most about their situation is the most well prepared to make competent \ndecisions. And in the country today, whether we're in the government system or in the private sector, we have \ncountless databases with all sorts of information being gathered as part of the everyday processes of modern life.\n\nAnd the challenges associated with providing broader access to this information is exactly what we've working on \nfor the last several years. But the reality is that knowledge that's culled from these databases, is not about the data \nitself; it's about the relationships that exist between data. And, as was fairly thoroughly discussed I think in the prior \npanel, in our opinion the real challenge is not creating new databases based on these various systems. It is coming \nup with a standard and secure and consistent means of establishing relationships between these databases when \nit's relevant, sharing information across these organizations, whether they reside within a single agency or across \nagencies, or even into the private sector.\n\nSo when we talk about a national ID card, I really think what's important to remember is it's not about the card. The \ncard may -- we'll see in my comments in a few minutes, may have some interesting capability to make the process \nof securing our systems more convenient and more straight forward. But what we really want to focus on is the \nrelationships between critical information systems. And in the example that was brought up earlier regarding sort of \nwhat was known about the people before September, the terrorists involved with the events of September 11 before \nthe fact versus after the fact, point readily to this point.\n\nAfter September 11 the FBI was able to discover a great deal about the people that were part of this act. The \nchallenge was not that that data did not exist. We know the data existed because we know they gathered it after the \nfact. But the point was that we were unable to establish relationships between those pieces of information to make \ncompetent decisions. Now, we can make decisions after the fact, but this is the difference between investigation \nand prevention. And so if we are able to address the idea that through a common way of identifying people, inside \ninformation systems and standards for sharing that information between system is adopted, then we have a much \ngreater opportunity of taking advantage of all the information that we're already collecting, when it can still be used \nto make a difference.\n\nNow, if we think about the technical approaches with consolidating databases in this fashion, there's lots of different \nthings we can do. First, is the idea of consolidation. We could start to bring together information systems from \nvarious organizations, even inside agencies or, more importantly, across agencies into huge monolithic government \nmanaged databases of everything we know about people.\n\nThis is not only a poor idea, it's not possible. Even if -- whether it's technically possible aside, it's socially not \npossible. The inertia that exists in information systems and inside organizations and overcoming the challenges of \ngetting those organizations to roll up their information into systems that they don't control, is really a task that would \nbe very difficult to accomplish; not to mention the fact that the government ought not be in the business of building \nhuge consolidated databases of information about people.\n\nInstead, we could decide that it's more important to keep these information systems separate, and let them do what \nit is they do today -- and they are already, like we said, gathering all sorts of information -- but create some standard \nways for them to share that information with one another. And this could very reasonably be aided by a common \nidentifier of people. So if we said between system A and between system B, whether that immigration and FBI, or \nan airline company and FBI, to validate that these two -- that we're both talking about the same person. Having \nstandards for doing that could be very helpful in making that sort of communication more facile.\n\n\n\nThere are also other approaches which are not for consolidation or full distribution and connectivity, and this comes \nin the flavor of what I call sort of consolidated indexes of information. So for example, when a police officer pulls \nover a speeding motorist and wants to check for outstanding arrest warrants, does it make sense for that officer's \nsystem to check every local and state law enforcement in the country in real time, to discover whether there are \noutstanding arrest warrants? Of course not. Maybe it would be prudent for us to have a national system that points \nto outstanding arrest warrants. Again, the government not managing them, but the government providing a more \nconvenient way of checking across systems that really do the same thing. And in fact the Department of Justice has \nimplemented just such a system for that problem.\n\nSo the reality is all sorts of these approaches, when we talk about the consolidation and sharing of information, will \nbe part of the ultimate solutions. We will have opportunity to consolidate systems that currently are duplicating \neffort. We'll have opportunity to teach systems that don't communicate with one another to do just that, and we'll \nhave opportunity to create hybrids, assuming of course, that we come up with some standard methods for doing \nthat.\n\nThe challenges in this are -- fall into two buckets. First, the technical challenges. The use -- the real challenge with \nan identification system like this is not just relating two people and two information systems; it is associating a \nhuman being with a given identity. How do I determine that this person standing in front of me is the same person \nI'm talking about inside this information system, or collection of information systems, and that identity comes \nthrough many of the ideas discussed today, maybe in the form of a card, maybe in the form of biometrics. Creating \na secure and consistent biometrically enabled identification card that anyone could use to establish -- to \nauthenticate identity would be difficult: not only difficult socially but difficult technically. The state-of-the-art here is \nadvancing but it needs to advance further before we could turn such a system on in the short-term.\n\nHowever, there is great opportunity for us to take incremental steps in attacking the technical challenges. First, in \nestablishing standards for national identity, an identifier that uniquely identifies people and government guidance \nthat should be used when building information systems related to these issues could be done incrementally and \nsystems could come online as they choose to start to exploit such an identifier. We also talked about making the \nexisting identification cards stronger rather than trying to establish a new one and there I think that the drivers' \nlicense is a good candidate for that because we've seen a lot of work already done there.\n\nAnd then finally, in introducing specific populations to this technology rather than saying everyone has to \nparticipate, maybe we first focus just on critical jobs, people, for example, whose job requires that they are on the \ntarmac at an airport or specific populations of people, non-citizens visiting the country, for example. So from a \ntechnical perspective as a technology company and representative of that I would like to suggest that with the \ncompetent use of existing technology we can improve the security, not only of identifying individuals, but of \nestablishing relationships between information systems that already exist today.\n\nOn the social side it's not so clear. And as the debates have gone on today, the issues related with privacy and the \nwhole idea that the government is getting into the gathering and establishing a large, centralized databases, is an \nimportant debate but, honestly I believe that it comes down to the difference between can we do something and \nshould we do something. The ability to do this and strengthen security is there.\n\nThe decisions as to when this should be done falls in the hands of policy-makers like yourselves. So it's important \nto remember that at discussion of whether we should do that has to be built on top of the ability to say that we can \ndo that and for that \"should\" part of the debate, I think it's most appropriate to leave it to policy-makers to draw \nthose lines of when such a system should be exploited.\n\nSo, given that, I appreciate your time and your opportunity to let us comment into this debate. Thank you.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd our last presenter is Doctor Ben Shneiderman, Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of \nMaryland at College Park and he also here is a Fellow on behalf of the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\nThanks for coming.\n\nDR. BEN SHNEIDERMAN: Thank you, Chairman Horn, for the opportunity to testify at this timely and important \nhearing. I want to commend you, Ranking Member Schakowsky, the subcommittee members and your staff for \nturning Congress's attention to proposals for a national identity card system. You've given some of my introduction \nalready and I'll just say for further purposes that my statement represents the Association of Computing \nMachineries Committee on U.S. Public Policy. The ACM is a nonprofit educational and scientific society of 75,000 \ncomputer scientists, educators and other computing professionals from around the world, committed to the open \ninterchange of information.\n\nIn the two months since the deplorable acts of terror were perpetrated against America, a number of legislative \nmeasures and regulatory actions intended to ensure the safety and security of our citizens have been proposed. \nWhile most proposals have been well intentioned, some have been misguided in that they overlook the potential for \nunintended consequences or underestimate the technical challenges and risks inherent in their implementation.\n\nRecently information technology vendors have suggested that a comprehensive national identity card system could \nbe created and implemented in as little as 90 days. Implementing such a complex system is a challenging systems \nengineering matter. Such a rapid construction of an effective and novel socio-technical system would be \nunprecedented. A constructive alternative may be focussed efforts that build on existing systems such as state \nmotor vehicle, passports and visas, and as the last speaker I have the luxury of being able to resonate with the \nmany thoughtful comments that have been made already. The first panel made very clear the strong political \nconcerns about a national system and this panel has gone through in good detail about some of the challenges and \ntechnical development.\n\nA national ID system requires a complex integration of social and technical systems, that's what I'm going to stress \nhere is that combination, including humans to enter and verify data, plus hardware, software and networks to store \nand transmit. Such socio-technical systems are always vulnerable to error, breakdown, sabotage and destruction by \nnatural events or people with malicious intentions. For this reason the creation of a single system of identification \ncould unintentionally result in degrading the overall safety and security of our nation because of unrealistic trust in \nthe efficacy of the technology. The national ID card itself is only the most visible component of a system that would \nrequire supporting bureaucracies and elaborate databases that would have to operate in everyday situations, again \nas said by several members of this panel.\n\nIn particular, a national ID system requires an extensive database of personal information on every citizen. Who \nwould enter the data, who would update it, who would verify it, who would determine when the data is no longer \ntrustworthy, who would review audit trails and improve access? If new and centralized approach is technically \nproblematic, as again, has been stated by many, and politically unpalatable, which seems quite well accepted here, \nthen how might we work to increase security? Constructive first steps would be to define goals and develop metrics \nof success. Let me repeat that: constructive first steps would be to define our goals in a narrowly, focussed way, \nand develop the metrics of success.\n\nIf improved air travel safety is at our goal and it has wide public support then we need to develop the techniques to \nachieve that goal with modest impact on personal rights and privacy. A realistic goal would be to make verifications \nof passenger identity more reliable while limiting delay, intrusion and inconvenience to citizens. Improving state \nmotor vehicle identification cards might be accomplished by coordination among the states to determine best \npractices for issuing, replacing, verifying and monitoring usage. Such efforts might be coordinated by the National \nAssociation of State Chief Information Officers as mentioned by Newt Gingrich, or by the National Governors' \nAssociation.\n\n\n\nCommon practices or even national standards might be arrived at through public discussion. Adequate public \ndiscussion of proposals is essential to gain acceptance and to improve their quality. A socio- technical systems \napproach would include quantification of weaknesses and vulnerabilities of database security and network access \nbased on existing systems, then realistic solutions to dealing with problems such as lost cards, mistaken \nidentifications, would have to be developed and tested. Special cases such as tourists, professional visitors, foreign \nstudents, would have to be addressed.\n\nAny complex social technical system such as identity verification requires well-trained personnel whose \nperformance is monitored regularly. Effective hiring and screening practices, chances to upgrade their skills and \nespecially participation in the redesign of the system are important contributors to success. Improvements for \ncitizens could also lead to higher data reliability and system efficacy. Citizen confidence and data accuracy could be \nimproved by system designs that provide greater transparency, greater openness, by allowing citizens themselves \nto inspect their contents and view a log of who uses their data. More constructive ideas could emerge by \nencouraging research by computer and information scientists in collaboration with social scientists. They would also \nbe encouraged to build bridges with legal and policy groups so that their solutions are realistic and implementable.\n\nIt's important that Congress proceeds cautiously on the issue of national identity card systems. They involve risks in \na variety of practical organizational and technical challenges. Any effort to improve homeland security should begin \nwith clear statements of goals and quantifiable metrics of success. Computer technology can do much but it cannot \nsee into the minds and hearts of people, nor can it replace the capability of vigilant citizens. Face to face security \nchecks must be a vital component of airport and other security systems. At this point I also differ from Mr. \nGoodman's report about Ben Gurion University where -- Ben Gurion airport where it is not a biometric system but it \nis repeated face to face encounters with security checkers who ask questions and are vigilant to the responses and \nthe behavior of each person passing through that airport as I did late in August of this year.\n\nDespite growing public and political pressures for perceived security enhancements, the risks and challenges \nassociated with a national ID card system need to be identified and understood before attempting deployment. But \nconstructive alternatives, such as improving existing state motor vehicle registration and passports, are promising \npossibilities that could bring benefits sooner than establishing an entirely new system.\n\nThe emphasis must be on people first, then the technology. The Association for Computing Machinery, and other \nleaders in the computing community are ready and willing to assist lawmakers in their efforts to enhance the safety \nand security of our nation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.\n\nREP. HORN: We have been very enlightened by your presentations. I had a chance to go through them all last \nnight. Except for the senator who is flying down here, I thank you, again. Would you object, I'll just ask all of you, \nwould you object to a form of identification that contained only the person's name and confirmation that he or she is \na U.S. citizen? How do you feel about that? That's getting down to essences.\n\nMR. HOECHST: I think the issue is not just the card. Again the card is only the most visible form, but who issues \nthe card, who certifies its correctness, and how it's handled. And my belief and my testimony suggest that \nstrengthening existing systems such as state motor vehicle systems would be the most effective. We currently have \naccepted practice of walking up for airline boarding to show a state motor vehicle card. I think that is the place of \nintervention where we could do most good to improve its efficacy.\n\nSimply creating a new card with whatever is on it, will lead us down the wrong path.\n\nMR.?: I would add on this, Mr. Hoechst. Yeah, I would add that a card that just has a small amount of information, \nand really even perhaps less than you described, which can only establish identity is the only thing that is feasibly \npossible to deploy practically. Any attempts to create cards that contain lots of information just opens the \ntroublesome box of discussions about how that information is used. What's important to remember is that the \ninformation that will be used once identity is established is already managed by processes inside organizations, \nwhether they're law enforcement organizations or commercial organizations. What the card can only do is help \n\n\n\nestablish identity, authenticate that this person is this -- represents this sort of well understood and standard \nidentity.\n\nREP. HORN: Mr. Veestraeten, how do you feel about that, get it down to the name, and are you a U.S. citizen or \naren't you?\n\nMR. VEESTRAETEN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. That is exactly how it is organized in Belgium today. The cards only -- I \nadded a copy of the only card which I had at hand, which was my own, with documentation, which has disappeared. \nWe only mention limited number of data. This number is limited by law. So nobody can add any additional \ninformation. You will see on the back of the card there are two informations mentioned, and this is on my explicit \nauthorization. I had to sign the documents to approve those mentions.\n\nOne is the name of my spouse, which I'm happy and proud to have her, and the other one is the number of the \nnational register which is a single database. And I also approved in writing to have this mention added to my card. If \nnot, it would not have been there. So the only information we have is -- we standard put on the card: name, first \nname, date and place of birth, and the address and the nationality, and there's nothing else there.\n\nREP. HORN: Ms. Corrigan.\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: I think that in order to answer that question, the Privacy Act, which was enacted in the 70s, was \nrooted in a golden rule essentially, which is that information collected for one purpose should not be used for \nanother purpose. And it's difficult to answer your question because information is rarely collected just to collect it. \nThere's usually a reason that you want to have such a list. So for example, a list of American citizens. And I think \nyou yourself proposed something similar a few years ago around the voter registry. You know, the difficulty there is \nthe same debate that came up around number one, as Professor Shneiderman pointed out, you know, do we have \nin fact an accurate list that would reflect that?\n\nWe do have the passport document only in the country, which establishes citizenship obviously. So there are \ndocuments that are shown to do that. Going back to one of my original points is that to build any one of these \ndatabases on a faulty selection of documents is very problematic, particularly when we're denying either a service \nor a right that you've got, either under a law or the Constitution.\n\nREP. HORN: Senator Goodman.\n\nSEN. GOODMAN: I'd like to reiterate once again the notion that in a wartime situation you have criteria which I think \ndiffer materially from those of the halcyon days day that we knew before September the 11th. And in this instance \nthe purpose of the card would be to determine the -- to establish clearly and unequivocally the identity of the \nindividual. But let me point out that at that stage of the game you have linkages with various databases, which might \nascertain the possible undesirability of that individual's behavior pattern, which will require close tracking.\n\nFor example, if someone enters the country in a situation where they're here to do mischief, as it all too often in the \nrecent past to be the case, it's imperative that we have some means of tracking that individual, to have a society in \nwhich everyone can rattle around in a state of happy anonymity and the assumption that the cool air of freedom \nmust the thing which we permit them to breathe continuously while we're at war, I think, denies the exigencies of \nthe war situation.\n\nREP. HORN: Professor Turley.\n\nMR. TURLEY: Well, I suppose I should be delighted about the opportunity to lie about my weight, but I don't think \nthat this is an issue that will be solved by more cards. God knows, Senator Goodman's wallet couldn't hold another \none. But I think my problem with it is simply that in simply having a card issue on an expedited basis I think puts us \non a track of where we've been. That is, there is a natural desire to rush in this room and put this fire out. But I think \nit needs more study than that.\n\n\n\nI think, not just because of our traditions, but because we have decided on the technology, its use, its functions, its \nappropriate functions, any dangers of what's called authorized misuse. All those things we have to think about \nbefore we plunge into this. I do think that there is a basis, as I say in my written testimony, to issue a card relatively \nquickly for certain insular groups. Those may be foreign nationals. They may be foreign students. But they would \nalso be for example, international truckers. That we do need a very fast system at our borders that's reliable, \nbecause we have a build-up at our borders that's going to get worse, particularly during times of crisis.\n\nWe need to solve that right away. And we could create a biometric card to try to do that. We may also want to use \nthe card for example, groups that handle material like anthrax. So you can have an immediate card issued. But \nwhat I think we should be careful not to do is to restrict it from drifting. Not make it a national card. Focus on those \nareas we need one right away, then study the issue of whether we need a national identifier.\n\nMR. SHNEIDERMAN: Focus systems will be most effective and most prompt, I believe, in producing the benefits \nthat we all seek. For, whether it's airport personnel or truckers, we can go and more groups can be approached and \nhandled in a respectful way.\n\nREP. HORN: I tried out on our first panel the idea of a commission which was usually a presidential commission of \npicking the chair and then the speaker of the House, and then the majority leader of the Senate. And I'm inclined to \nput that into law and have my colleagues with it. But what that does is delay things. On the other hand, what it does \nis try to build a consensus. So we had the Hesburgh one on immigration, we had Barbara Jordan as the chair, and \nso forth.\n\nNow, we've been through this in terms of census material, where we wanted to put through a five-year or so, and \nthey blew it right out because they didn't want any part of it. And it became a jurisdictional argument. So I'd be \ninterested in what your feeling is. Is it worth getting a commission that has those suggestions, the speaker of the \nHouse and the majority leader of the Senate, and the minority leaders of both Houses and the president of the \nUnited States? What do you think?\n\nSEN. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, let me suggest, it does not seem to me that that approach does take into account \nthe concerns which we feel are increasingly evident, and I am afraid that if we are once again hit with another act of \nterrorism, which in my judgement is in all probability likely to occur sometime between now and Christmas, it's \ngoing to create the same reaction, only on an exacerbated basis that we had after the World Trade Center and \nPentagon episodes. And I must say to you, I think that it's extremely important that we move on with this fairly \nquickly, and try to arrive at a conclusion. I would hope that some form of identification could be established \npromptly, so that we are protected to the extent possible against the recurrence of this type of an act.\n\nOn a lighter side, I am reminded of a couple on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, the gentleman got on the scale, put a \nquarter in and one of those little tickets came out with his fortune on it, and his wife said, \"What does it say?\" And \nhe said, \"It said that I'm a handsome, a debonair fellow with extreme brilliance, with the highest IQ in Atlantic City.\" \nAnd she said, \"Well, let me look at it.\" And when she looked at it, she said, \"Got your weight wrong too.\" So with the \n-- we do have occasional confusions in these mechanical devices, but I think we're at the point where that type of \nthing is not likely to occur with any frequency.\n\nREP. HORN: Ms. Corrigan.\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: Well, it sounds like the legislation does not have the ACLU chairing the commission, so it would \nbe much easier for us to come out --\n\nREP. HORN: Well, we don't know. I mean to say, you're here, and --\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: Hey, I'm available --\n\nREP. HORN: Yeah, and there are minorities in both chambers.\n\n\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: I mean, I think the key is not whether there's a commission or whether it is staff on the committee \ndeveloping a legislative proposal, I mean the question is what's in it. And, as you know, the ACLU would oppose an \nidentification system, either through the front door of calling it a national ID, or through the back door of some other \ntype of registry or integrated database.\n\nREP. HORN: Mr. Veestraeten. Anything that Belgium ever had, say a Kings Commission, or the parliament, \nwhatever, to get this moving?\n\nMR. VEESTRAETEN: No, this dates from long back in our country, so I don't know how it was discussed back in \nthe beginning of last century, but\n\nREP. HORN: In the First World War and the Second World War.\n\nMR. VEESTRAETEN: The card was introduced after the First World War.\n\nREP. HORN: Yeah.\n\nDR. SHNEIDERMAN: I think they have 80 years of history of evolution to develop their approach, which fits with \ntheir national values, and I think we've got a history of evolution here, and I support the idea of a continued \nevolution to refine the existing mechanisms.\n\nREP. HORN: Mr. Hoechst.\n\nMR. HOECHST: Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that your concern about a commission delaying things implies, \nespecially with the ID card, that there is an opportunity missed that could be done in the short term, and so what I \nwould suggest is that for the issue of identification cards, then something that studies that in the form of a \ncommission would be valuable, as long as it were giving guidance that along some of the ideas that were proposed \ntoday, that it not just study it, but that it practice it, maybe in prototypical form, giving identification cards to different \npopulations to see how it works, rather than just study it.\n\nBut I would also suggest that there is short term activity that can happen that I would hate to see a commission \ncause us not to focus on, and that is, on these goals of information sharing, especially between critical information \nsystems in the area of law enforcement, and immigration and the like, where we do not -- the technologies exist, we \nknow they work, we need to choose to use them, and we need to set clear guidelines about when it is appropriate \nto use them and legal to use them.\n\nREP. HORN: Thank you.\n\nDr. Shneiderman.\n\nDR. SHNEIDERMAN: I repeat my desire for the evolutionary, but I think also focussed action, as I say, as we hear it \nhere, may be specific interventions between -- for information sharing between FBI, CIA, if our concern is aircraft \nand boarding aircraft, then that kind of sharing of information is a possibility in a very short term basis, and then I \nthink focus populations, such as international truck drivers or airport personnel who have access to secure areas, \nimmediate improvements could be made. But again, I want to restate it's not just building some technology, it's \nproviding the human infrastructure that builds trucks and support for this, rather than antipathy. It must be \ndemonstrated that any intervention has broad support, and especially of those who are most directly effected, but \nit's implemented in a way in which people feel that this does contribute positively and therefore they are most \ncooperative with it. And they will point out -- they will be vigilant in pointing out those who are potentially you know, \nin violation.\n\nREP. HORN: I thank you, and yield at least 10 minutes to the ranking member, the lady --\n\n\n\nREP. SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this has been a really important and a very useful hearing. \nI think all the panel members, these are questions that we are going to have to seriously consider.\n\nI want to first play a kind of devils advocate and -- because my proclivity is to be -- those of you who heard my \nopening statement, is to be very, very skeptical of the notion of a national identification card, but I -- the point that \nMr. Veestraeten said, which is that we use identity cards, and all of you -- we do that when you go on an airplane, \nwhen you cash a check, all kinds of places where we do -- we are asked and required to produce some sort of \nidentification.\n\nIt seems to me, if the technology is available to make -- to improve on those systems, maybe not perfectly, but to \nimprove on those systems, then he asked the question, or at least made the statement that since we do that \nanyway, why not have a universal card, a national card. So, Dr. Shneiderman.\n\nDR. SHNEIDERMAN: Again, I think that the warm support of participation from citizens is necessary. If they see \nthat there's a universal card collected by a federal agency, I think the resentment may, and the doubt and the \nquestion, the interference of privacy would be very much on their mind. So you'd have a poor participation and I \nthink disruption, people would be concerned. Whereas, if they applied for their state motor vehicle license, where \nthey recognize that the benefit is they're receiving a card which enables them to drive, that it possibly takes care of \nhealth problems should they have an accident. And that there may be other specified focus clear benefits to it, they \nwill cooperate, and that those who take the information will also have a clear sense of purpose and work as best as \nthey can to ensure that the quality of the data is high, and that customer satisfaction is high, and that participation is \nbroad. And again, when someone is attempting to forge or bypass the system, there's likely to be stronger civilian \ncitizen participation in stopping such intervention.\n\nI think we have the interesting examples of computer viruses. Why is it that the Linux communities or the Mac \ncommunities have less of this. There's a warm sense of participation, there's an active sense of pride, it's close to \nthem. And so I think, if we follow those models and we want to bring, as in this country, we have a long history of \nbringing things closer to people by having the states be the closest point of connection for such activity, will be \nbuilding the right kind of system. And thinking about the social dynamics of why someone offers their information \nand why they might try to deceive, and how they might help to prevent others from deceiving, that's where we will \ngo to build the strongest possible system. So, again a diversified system and again a focussed one that deals with \nspecial communities.\n\nMS. SCHAKOWSKY: Ms. Corrigan.\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: Yes, I think here, whether it's a state level document like the drivers license, whether it's a Social \nSecurity number, or a newly issued type of identifier, like a biometric, I think again we have to go back to the \npurpose for which we're gathering this information. And the way that this debate has been framed since the terrible \nevents of September 11th, has been a national identification card, or some sort of national ID system that would \nprotect us from acts of terrorism. And, based on the arguments I already made in my testimony, we can't build such \na system on a set of faulty documents. Many of those terrorists on September 11th had fake Social Security \nnumbers. Actually all 19, according to the inspector general last week, had those security, some of them legally, \nand some of them not. And number two, going back to a comment someone made earlier, you can't establish \nmotives or intent, simply on the base of knowing who someone is. And it makes me quite nervous to think that by \nhaving a traveler's ID, or by having some other national ID card, I could just pass through security unchecked, \nwithout much more.\n\nAnd that to me doesn't create more security, and in fact creates a false sense of security: too much dependence on \ntechnology.\n\nSo I think, and whether we're talking again about state or federal level efforts, we have to go back to the basic \nquestion: is this even an effective security measure to begin with?\n\n\n\nMS. SCHAKOWSKY: Is anyone else burning to respond, because I do have another question. Okay. Let me ask \nyou this: is there a place for these incredible new technologies, biometrics, palm, all of those things. I mean, should \nwe be looking for ways to utilize them more effectively, or do those lead into problem areas for us as well? Anyone? \nYes, Mr. Hoechst.\n\nMR. HOECHST: I would suggest that there is a great many places for using them, but not necessarily should we \nhave an expectation that tomorrow we could use them to uniquely identify anyone who is on our soil, American or \nvisiting. And that partly comes in limitations of the technology in its current state. But it partly comes just in the \nbroad ability to adopt any sort of technology like that.\n\nHowever, there are opportunities to use them where they are very effective. And this comes in, for example, \nauthenticating yourself to secure areas. Perhaps, we'd say, you need to identify that you have certified -- we need \nto identify biometrically that you're allowed to enter secure areas at an airport or whatever. And for that sort of \nsmaller focussed identification we know there's a subset of people who are allowed to do this, and we're going to \nconfirm that you are one of that subset. They work quite well. For the general case of just saying, \"Hey, I've got a \nperson here. Let me look through all people to determine whether this person is this person,\" they are still maturing \nin that space, I think.\n\nMR. SHNEIDERMAN: I want to confirm that on the technology side. These are promising technologies, but do not \noffer short-term hope for wide-scale decimation. We've heard in the past, voice recognition patterns and other \ntechnologies that might have been used. And these techniques are potentially interesting. They should be \nexpanded. They should be researched, but they are in the longer term, and should not offer -- should not be seen \nas a techno-fix in the short-term.\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: And, coming from the ACLU perspective, although they we're not the technology experts that \nyou've got to at the end of the table, you know, I think our monitor is -- not all biometrics are created equal, and not \nall uses of biometrics are created equal. We apply the same tests to those measures that we would to a national \nidentification card. And in the air security context the ACLU came out in support of the use of strength and \nidentification cards for air employees that need access to secure areas, including the use of biometric on some of \nthose cards.\n\nThe reason is that in those instances it's a limited and targeted use of the biometrics, and also you're able to take \nthe thumbprint, or you're able to take the iris scan under very controlled conditions, which makes a difference in the \neffectiveness and error rates of biometric technology.\n\nSEN. GOODMAN: Can I venture a comment if --\n\nREP. HORN: Sure.\n\nSEN. GOODMAN: I'm not sure at the moment whether we realize the extent to which certain technologies are \nalready in plane, in attempting to achieve security. I'd like to give you a couple of quick examples in this regard. As \nyou may know, there's something called CAPS, which is an acronym for computer-assisted passenger screening. \nThis is a system under which information is obtained in the reservation process to screen out passengers who may \nrequire additional security checks. The airlines are fairly widespread in their use of such a system.\n\nAlso manifests are at this time provided by airlines. A manifest is a list of the passengers on a flight which would be \nlanding in due course at a given airport. And in that airport, they receive an advance copy of the manifest or the list \nof the passengers on board, to try to determine whether there's a possibility of either customs violations or \nimmigration violations and the like. So already Big Brother, if you please, is watching very closely, in certain \ninstances, to try to determine what's going on.\n\nIn my judgment these are both fully justified under present circumstances attention and I would again repeat that in \nthe context of a war situation, anything we can do to utilize current technology would assist us in making \n\n\n\nidentification of high-risk individuals as helpful. Normally you would not wish to do that, and you'd say, in a civil \nlibertarian sense, case, they are surreal. Let it be, and don't mess with this sort of thing. But I think it would be a \ngreat mistake when we know that we probably will be, once again, subject to a potential attack, to allow ourselves \nto be in a somnolent in regard to matters of this sort.\n\nMR. TURLEY: Could I add something? Obviously, I suggested a commission because I think this deserves more \nstudy. And I think that it's not just a technology issue that needs more study. But we need to look at the efficiency \nand viability of the system so that we can have a single unified card. It has to be integrated very often with at least \nsome level of database that creates its own issues. But putting that aside, I just want to disagree a bit with Senator \nGoodman on one sentence.\n\nAnd it's -- I happen to think that we do need more security. But we have a long history of the government in times of \ncrisis, doing things that can only be described as moronic. And some of them are more than moronic, such as the \ninternment of American citizens of Japanese origin. To simply say that we're living in danger is not a justification for \ngoing boldly into these areas in the search for even a modicum increase in security. I think we've learnt too much in \nterms of our history.\n\nSo I agree with Senator Goodman. I know that he intends this in the best sense, but I don't agree that should be the \nreason or the time schedule for us to add. I don't even believe as much they're going to add security. I mean these \nhijackers on September 11th have wallets that were bursting with false IDs. Adding another one is not going to \nreassure me. I would rather be reassured from my sons that when they inherit this country and this system that it's \ngoing to be given to them in the same condition that it was given to me. And that's my greatest concern because, \nfrankly, the Taliban is today's flavor of threat. And tomorrow there's going to be another group of fanatics. But I'm \nmore concerned in how we respond to a threat than the threat itself, at the moment.\n\nMR. GOODMAN: May I remind us that had we taken the view that people's activities in the country are their own \nbusiness unless they do something overtly wrong, that this possibly was what underlay the fact that we failed to \nrealize that people were taking flying lessons learning how to fly planes in mid-air but neither to land them nor to \ntake them off -- to permit them to take off. And had we simply accumulated a little degree of intelligence data that \nhad indicated there were certain foreign nationals indulging in that type of flying lesson, it might have created a \npattern of concern that would have possibly detected the advance notion of people plowing airplanes into tall \nbuildings in our society.\n\nI use that as an example, because it does seem to me there is an earlier reference to an intelligence breakdown. \nThe use of vigilant intelligence and the need for both the horizontal and vertical communication of intelligence \nagencies in the United States is an absolute imperative at this time. And it's rather regrettable, I think, that we've \nbeen informed that the FBI and the CIA have not adequately communicated with one another, and certainly not \nadequately communicated with local law enforcement to promote vigilance at a time when it could be prudent.\n\nWe want to practice preventive medicine, essentially. I don't want to wait 'til the next thing happens and say, \"It's a \npity it happened. Let's do something about it now.\" I'd like to prevent it from occurring ever again. Because anyone \nwho lives in New York will be forever scarred by what's just happened. And that's perhaps why I'm taking a fairly \nintense view of these discussions at this moment.\n\nMS. SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you to all of you. I want to comment on this important discussion that we've been \nhaving. I think the example of flying lessons conducted by a company that gave them to what turned out to be a \nterrorist is an example of ways in which our current infrastructure failed us, and the ability to communicate \ninformation broke down. And we certainly are all interested in making sure that we fill in the cracks and make a \nseamless flow of information to the extent that we can.\n\nBut I have to say, Senator Goodman, that I too, feel that particularly at this time, when we're on a state of reflection \nabout what is most precious about the United States, what are the things that are -- that make us meek and are so \nworth protecting, that we must proceed very cautiously, perhaps even more cautiously than when things are just \n\n\n\nclicking along so smoothly. So that we don't make the kinds of overreaching mistakes that we did when we interned \nthe Japanese.\n\nAnd I know that you're certainly not talking about that kind of activity but I think that it is somewhat of a slippery \nslope and that we have to be very careful that we don't install permanent -- a reason, for example, that I voted \"no\" \non a bill that I thought had many good provisions, the bill which I felt shouldn't have been called the Patriot Act, \nbecause I believe myself to be a patriot but voted \"no\" on that. So I think we have to be very, very careful as we \nproceed forward and I think that this conversation today and all of the witnesses, both panels, contributed to the \nkind of thoughtful debate that we need to have and I appreciate it very, very much.\n\nREP. HORN: Well, I wanted particularly to appreciate what the ranking member did about the terrible breech of the \nconstitution with the Japanese Americans going into internments. I'm proud to say my mother who was director of \nwelfare in her county, she opened up and said that is just wrong and the person who -- the only person I know of \nwho elected was against that, since Roosevelt and General De Witt just went ahead of everything with putting \npeople in internment camps even going with the Army to Peru so forth. But the only elected person was a very \ninteresting gentleman named Harry Cain, the Mayor of Tacoma, where many Japanese Americans were and he \nlater was a United States senator and then President Eisenhower made him head of the subversive whatever board \nwas in those days, and he had the guts to stand it. And I had lunch with the chief justice, Earl Warren, just before he \ndied, about three months before, and that was, he felt, the biggest mistake he ever went and he was a wonderful \nman and very strong on civil liberties but one gets swept up in that and they do it, but it's wrong and we don't want \nto see that happen again.\n\nSo let me just ask one or two questions and we'll close it out. Mr. Ellison (sp) has offered to provide the databases \nfor free for Oracle, does this include maintenance, technical support and upgrades? As long as you're in a Santa \nClaus mood, I just thought I'd --\n\nMR. HOECHST: I would not venture to be able to speak for him on what's intended there. I would like to describe \nthe nature of the intent of that offer which was to take advantage of the resources and the enthusiasm that \ncommercial organizations like Oracle and others have to facilitate action and so Larry's comments, I believe, were \nto try and remove any roadblocks required to facilitate action toward building systems that can share information \nand if what we can do is provide free software or free maintenance on software or free services, can help a way to \nstimulate action rather than be roadblocks that cause processes to languish, then we'll do that.\n\nREP. HORN: I have one question for Mrs. Corrigan. How would a consolidated identity system invade the privacy of \nindividuals any more than the current systems: Social Security, drivers' license, passport, and we have that now.\n\nMS. CORRIGAN: Well, actually we also have something called the Privacy Act which as I mentioned before is \nrooted in one basic principal and that is that information collected for one purpose, so whether it's either Museum of \nModern Art in New York, or whether it's by the Social Security Administration, information collected for that purpose \nshouldn't be used for another purpose unless subject to one of the exceptions outlined in the law. And we at the \nSLU (?) are also very concerned about the misuse of such security numbers and privacy violations that go on every \nday.\n\nBut one of the biggest protections of privacy is actually the decentralized nature of the data, that it's one thing for \nmy doctor to know my -- have access to my personal health information, it's another thing for law enforcement to \nhave my arrest record, but it's a completely different thing for people to then combine those different pieces of \ninformation and come up and marry them and then come up with a whole profile of my life. And as I mentioned \nbefore, you know, one accident in the federal government, unfortunately, has been subject to either accidents, in \nterms of security on the Web or, unfortunately, employees who are corrupt and sell or misuse that information. That, \nagain, there's a difference when you have separate databases versus the marrying of the information, the privacy \nrisk is just magnified.\n\n\n\nREP. HORN: Well, I'll tell you, every hearing we've ever had on privacy in that is we wanted to make sure, and the \nspeaker mentioned it this morning, you make a felony out of it. We had one of our colleagues when I came into the \nCongress, her medical file had been put in the papers, and why? A disgruntled employee or whatever, and that's \nwhy people have to be very careful of any files, in a doctor's office in particular.\n\nDR. SHNEIDERMAN: I'd like to speak to that issue. There's a long history of the tension between centralized and \ndecentralized systems and there are two issues. One is as Ms. Corrigan described, the centralized facility allows a \nsingle point of attack a single point of destruction, a single point of violation and, therefore, the magnitude of the \nviolation is greater. The capacity of the computer to amplify our power to do good also amplifies the power to do \nevil, and therefore, someone can search across a much larger dataset in that way. But the other interesting point \nabout the multiple, the diversified, decentralized approach actually it stimulates creative designs by having \nindependent explorations and involves much more effective best practices if they then are shared and copied by the \nothers, which is again why I encourage the collaboration by way of the National Association of State CIOs. So that \nthe best practices of each of the 50 states could then be repeated and disseminated widely and that's truly one of \nthe strengths of the decentralized approach.\n\nREP. HORN: I'm going to thank the staff now and then have a closing bit of what I think this is going and the \nperson on my left is the staff director and chief counsel for the subcommittee and Bonny Heald (sp) in back as the \ndeputy staff director, Darren Chidsey (sp) is a professional staff member, Mark Johnson, our chief clerk, Earl \nPearce, professional staff member, Jim Holmes (sp), intern, and then for the ranking member here, David \nMacmillan, professional staff member, and Jean Goesser (sp), minority clerk. Our court reporters, Laurie Shadakian \n(sp) and Nancy O'Rourke, and we thank you.\n\nThe hearing was not intended to resolve the national identification issue, but merely to advance the debate in light \nof September 11th attacks and the changed world in which we now live. Our witnesses provided a variety of \nperspectives and brought a great deal of expertise to the discussion. We're only beginning to explore this \ncomplicated issue, but one thing is certain, the September 11th attacks as horrifying as they were have brought out \nthe best in America. One small but important example of the nation's strength is the ability to conduct this calm, civil \nbut vigorous discussion of whether America needs a national identification system and if so, how to go about \ncreating it. Ultimately we can trust the American people and their representatives to make the right decision.\n\nAnd with that we are adjourned.\n\nEND\n"}
