{"title": "Doctor Cleared in Killing Returns to Mexico", "body": "\nA doctor kidnapped from Mexico for the United States Government and cleared on Monday of helping to kill a \nFederal drug agent returned to Mexico today.\n\nGovernment lawyers had tried to keep Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, 45, in the country after his acquittal by \narguing that he was an illegal immigrant.\n\nBut immigration agents placed Dr. Alvarez on a flight early today, said Allan Parachini, spokesman for the American \nCivil Liberties Union.\n\nProsecutors contended that Dr. Alvarez used his medical skills to keep a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, \nEnrique Camarena Salazar, alive as Mexican drug traffickers tortured him in 1985.\n\nProsecutors stalled his departure by filing an emergency request to have the ruling by Judge Edward Rafeedie of \nFederal District Court blocked, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service placed a hold on him as an illegal \nimmigrant.\n\nDr. Alvarez sat in a van on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport until he was allowed to board the \nMexicana Airlines flight, said Allan Parachini, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n"}
