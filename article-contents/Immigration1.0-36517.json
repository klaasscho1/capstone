{"title": "Reagan Signs Measure Easing Entry to U.S.", "body": "\nPresident Reagan has signed legislation that will prevent immigration officials from barring foreigners because of \ntheir political beliefs for at least the next 14 months.\n\nThe provision, which revises the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, was part of a bill granting the State Department and \nrelated agencies more than $8 billion in spending authority over the next two years.\nThe bill was signed by Mr. Reagan late Tuesday, after House and Senate conferees had approved a final version.\n\nThe McCarran-Walter Act has been used repeatedly to bar entry to certain foreigners because of their \nassociations, political beliefs or statements they might make while in the United States. Among those who have \nbeen kept out are Hortensia Allende, the widow of President Salvador Allende Gossens of Chile; Bernadette Devlin \nMcAlisky, the Irish political activist; Dario Fo, an Italian playwright, and the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes.\n\nThe new provision extends to foreigners the same constitutional protections granted American citizens in such \nmatters. The changes will expire in March 1989, by which time the House and Senate Judiciary Committees plan to \nlook at the issue again.\n"}
