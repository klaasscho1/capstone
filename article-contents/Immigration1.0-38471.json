{"title": "High Cost of Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\nLawrence E. Harrison's Jan. 12 op-ed column was one of the best presentations I have seen on the problems \ncaused by unchecked immigration. These problems are especially severe in Southern California, where illegal \nimmigration has been a major cause of the current fiscal crisis.\n\nFor example, nearly two-thirds of the births in L.A. County-operated hospitals today are to parents who are illegal \naliens. Because most of these births are covered by Medicaid, they are costing taxpayers nearly $ 100 million a \nyear. And because these children are automatically U.S. citizens and eligible for welfare benefits, their illegal \nparents are collecting nearly $ 250 million a year in welfare, up from a little more than $ 100 million in 1989.\n\nGiven that the Border Patrol estimates that more than 2 million illegal immigrants entered the United States last \nyear, it is safe to say these costs will continue to climb unless we as a nation, as Mr. Harrison said, redouble our \nefforts to control illegal immigration. I have introduced a package of bills to do that, by devoting more resources to \nenforcement and the elimination of document fraud and by stopping the payment of federal welfare and \nunemployment benefits to illegals.\n\nAs the extent of the problem becomes better known outside California, public pressure to take action will intensify. \nClearly, Congress has an obligation to address this problem.\n\nELTON GALLEGLY U.S. Representative (R-Calif.)
