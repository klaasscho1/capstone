{"title": "AROUND THE NATION;Los Angeles City Council Softens Sanctuary Law", "body": "\nThe City Council today rescinded a measure declaring Los Angeles a sanctuary for political refugees after \nopponents argued that it was an invitation to illegal aliens to break the law.\n\nBut the Council unaimously approved a compromise measure that reaffirms the city's policy of not reporting to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service the legal status of crime victims, witnesses or those receiving certain social \nservices.\n\n''There's no justification for us to unilaterally violate Federal law,'' said City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who led \nthe move to repeal the measure.\n\nCouncilman Mike Woo, who wrote the original resolution, said he was willing to compromise to avoid a backlash of \nanti-immigrant sentiment.\n"}
