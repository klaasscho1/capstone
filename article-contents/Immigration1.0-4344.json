{"title": "NEW REGULATIONS LINK IMMIGRATION TO FAMILY INCOME", "body": "\nBeginning today, U.S. residents seeking to bring a foreign relative here permanently will have to prove that their \nfamily income is at least 25 percent above the federal poverty level.\nThe new regulations implementing a 1996 immigration law also make sponsors of new immigrants liable for \nrepaying any public benefits the immigrants receive, including food stamps, Medicaid and cash payments. Backers \nof the new provisions say it is only fair that immigrants not become public burdens on their arrival. But critics \ncomplain the changes will disqualify thousands of lower-income Americans from reuniting with their families.\n\nNotes\n\nNational News in Brief\n"}
