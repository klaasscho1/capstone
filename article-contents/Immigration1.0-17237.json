{"title": "Senior citizens launch program to help teach immigrant employees English", "body": "\nPLEASANTON - When residents in a retirement community would leave notes for Claudia Martinez, the \nhousekeeper often was not sure what they wanted her to do.\n\nMartinez, who immigrated from Mexico, could only understand a little English. But now, thanks to an innovative \nprogram at the community, she can even decipher her 401(k) statements.\n\n\"I feel more comfortable, more secure, because I don't need help,\" she said.\n\nGonzalez, 51, works at the Stoneridge Creek senior living community, which has begun offering its employees a \nresident-driven program: free English tutoring once a week, and employees are even paid for their time. The tutors \nare volunteers - residents of the retirement community who are former teachers, engineers, pilots or have \nexperience teaching English as a Second Language.\n\nGonzalez has been in the States for 25 years, and has worked at Stoneridge for about three years. But she's never \nhad a formal English class until April, when she received a private tutor - Jule Saracco, 83, a retired teacher and \nresident. After months of tutoring, she already has gained confidence in her reading and writing.\n\nThe program may be the first of its kind in the area - where senior citizens in a retirement community are \nvolunteering to teach employees of the very community they live in.\n\n\"In a world where we're seeing a lot of hostility toward immigrants, Stoneridge Creek residents and staff are \nbanding together to create unique relations that are changing lives forever,\" said Executive Director Zeke Griffin in a \nstatement.\n\nResidents sometimes leave specific housekeeping instructions when they're not home. Before, Gonzalez would try \nto enlist the help of another person in her department to help her decipher the notes. But after six months of \nlessons, Gonzalez can now understand these lists on her own.\n\n\"It's a win-win situation, because we're helping them, but they're also helping us now, too,\" Saracco said.\n\nGonzalez and Saracco are currently reading \"Charlotte's Web\" together, and Gonzalez has even written essays \nabout her experience in the ESL program, and a recent trip to Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nSaracco, who taught elementary school in Hawaii and college-level English at a military base, forms her own \nlesson plans, based on what Gonzalez wants to learn. She said volunteering for this program was \"right up her \nalley.\"\n\n\nGonzalez has read Michelle Obama's book \"Becoming\" in Spanish and has a goal of eventually being able to read \nit in English as well. She also wants to take classes in American Sign Language at a community college.\n\nThe tutoring program started as an idea by someone who understood the difficulty of learning English, resident Wai \nMoy, a Chinese immigrant herself. She came to America at the age of 13, and was first placed in a kindergarten \nclass, because she couldn't understand any English.\n\nIn her career, she went on to become an engineer and earned two master's degrees. She became an ESL tutor \nherself some 30 years ago in New York. But back then, tutors had to create their own books -  cut out their own \npictures from a magazine and have students identify them.\n\nMoy also tutored at the Pleasanton Public Library through their literacy program. When she heard that some \nStoneridge Creek residents were having difficulty understanding some staff members who didn't speak English \nwell, she had an idea: Offer English as a Second Language classes at the retirement community itself, with \nresidents as the volunteers.\n\nShe gathered other residents who became the core of her committee: Maryanne Silber, who taught ESL in London \nand also did private ESL tutoring for people in Silicon Valley companies, and Julia Casamajor, a retired librarian \nwith the Livermore Public Library who also has taught ESL lessons. They also have a pilot in their midst, Al Baer, \nwho helps with gathering statistics for their programming.\n\nThe Pleasanton Library agreed to not only provide some teaching materials, but also training sessions for their \ntutors as well, said Lori Carducci, a library assistant.\n\n\"What's really been impressive to me is the way this program has taken off on the shoulders of those volunteers,\" \nCarducci said. \"It's been delightful for us to see, because we can expand our program and expand our reach.\"\n\nStoneridge Creek itself got on board, agreeing to let employees not only take the one hour off once a week for the \nlessons, but also paying them for that time.\n\nThe 21 students currently enrolled in the classes work in various departments at the senior community - \nhousekeeping, kitchen, plant operations and custodial. Students speak a variety of languages as their native \ntongue: Spanish, Cantonese, Farsi, Mong, Tagalog are represented, with 20 volunteers so far tutoring them.\n\n\"I think the most important thing is having a chance to speak in English for a sustained period of time. All \nemployees have someone on their staff, who works with them that speaks their same language. So they can get by \nleaning on each other,\" Casamajor said.\n\nThe goal, much like Gonzalez's situation, is to be able to get them to become self-sufficient.\n\nOn the other hand for residents, it gives them a chance to contribute in a concrete way, especially for those who \naren't able to go to the Pleasanton Library, Silber said.\n\n\"It makes for a better community,\" Silber said.\n\nSaracco said she sees that her student is gaining confidence, too.\n\n\"I am not only learning English, but residents are teaching me life; they're teaching me how to live better. And this \nfor me, is beautiful,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nPleasanton Library's literacy program, which currently has 201 active students, and 75 on the waiting list, is looking \nfor tutors.
