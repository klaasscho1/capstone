{"title": "U.S., Cuba to hold migration talks next week", "body": "\nHAVANA (AP)   The United States and Cuba have agreed to hold immigration talks in Washington within days, a \nU.S. official said Saturday, the first since a similar meeting in Havana in February.\n\nThe talks scheduled for Friday are intended to monitor adherence to a 16-year-old agreement under which the \nUnited States issues 20,000 visas to Cubans a year, though in the past the sides have used the meeting to delve \ninto more contentious issues.\n\nIn the last round of talks, U.S. diplomats pressed Cuba to release Alan Gross, a jailed American contractor that \nCuba has accused of spying. Gross has been jailed for more than six months without charge.\n\nThe American delegation also met with dissidents in Havana, raising the ire of Cuban officials.\n\nThe latest round of talks will take place at an as-yet undetermined location in Washington, Gloria Berbena, a \nspokeswoman for the U.S Interests Section in Havana, told The Associated Press. The U.S. maintains the Interests \nSection instead of an embassy.\n\nAfter a brief period of hope that U.S. President Barack Obama would usher in a new era of rapprochement with \nAmerica's longtime Caribbean foe, relations between the United States and Cuba have been on a downward \ntrajectory for some months.\n\nFidel Castro, once a grudging admirer of the president, has been harshly critical lately of everything from Obama's \nwork at global climate change talks, to America's backing of Israel, to the use of American soldiers as part of relief \nefforts in quake-ravaged Haiti.\n"}
