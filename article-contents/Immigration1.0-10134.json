{"title": "No Amnesty For Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\n E. Patrick McGuire, in criticizing President Bush's amnesty proposal for illegal immigrants from Mexico [letters, \nJuly 21], might have also mentioned the work of hundreds of dedicated American Foreign Service professionals.  \nThese workers are assigned to consular sections at posts across the globe and they work hard to uphold U.S. \nimmigration laws. \n\n They screen hordes of applicants for nonimmigrant visas. Under U.S. law, these people must prove that they are \nnot intending immigrants, otherwise they would be ineligible for nonimmigrant status.  \n\nThis process can be stressful, tiresome, even morale-deadening -- but it gets done thoroughly and in full \ncompliance with U.S. law. Consequently, refusal rates for nonimmigrant visas at many posts run high. \n\n Seen in this light, the granting of amnesty to several million illegal immigrants could constitute a grievous slap in \nthe face for Foreign Service personnel. \n\n THOMAS J. CAROLAN JR.  \n\nSilver Spring \n"}
