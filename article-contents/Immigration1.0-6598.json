{"title": "MAN CHARGED WITH POSING AS LAWYER;WEST ST. PAUL MAN SWINDLED $60,000, SAY AUTHORITIES", "body": "\nHennepin County authorities charged a West St. Paul man Friday with posing as an immigration lawyer who \ncould help people with their immigration status.\n\nJuan Flores, also known as Juan Roman Flores-Olivetti, Michael Leroy Hughes and Leroy M. Hughes, was \ncharged with three counts of felony theft by swindle using artifice, trick, device or other means.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Flores told Margarita Martinez-Tavira he could help her get a deportation order \nsuspended for $3,000. Ricardo Duarte Bautisto hired him to help obtain a work permit and permanent residency at \na cost of $1,300, the complaint said, and for $1,200 he said he could help R. Nicolas Sanchez with insurance \nmatters after a car accident.\n\nFlores, who most recently lived on East Sidney Street in West St. Paul, did little or nothing to help the clients he \ntook on, the complaint says.\n\nIn all, the complaint cited 39 victims and said he had swindled people out of $59,666.\n\n\"Juan Flores took criminal advantage of vulnerable people,\" said Amy Klobuchar, Hennepin County Attorney. \"His \nvictims trusted him not only with their money but with their very lives.\"\n\nFor each count he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.\n\nHe used papers from another attorney's office, claiming to work with him, the complaint said, but never sent \nanything to the Immigration Naturalization Service. Some of his victims were threatened with deportation orders and \nalthough he told them he could get the orders suspended, he filed no papers with the INS.\n\nRachel E.
