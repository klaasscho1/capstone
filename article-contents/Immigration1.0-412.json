{"title": "U.S. Meets Quota For 20,000 Visas In Cuban Accord", "body": "\nThe U.S. government said today it had fulfilled its part of a bilateral immigration agreement with Cuba by granting \nmore than 20,000 entry visas to Cuban migrants in the first year of the accord.\n\n\"I am very pleased to announce that as of Aug. 15 we have fulfilled our first-year commitment agreed to in the \nMigration Accord signed in New York on Sept. 9, 1994,\" said Joseph Sullivan, head of the U.S. Interests Section in \nHavana.\n\nAt a brief ceremony in which he presented U.S. travel documents to three Cuban families, Sullivan said the United \nStates had complied \"24 days early\" with the terms of the accord, which required it to issue a minimum of 20,000 \nvisas each year.\n\nBesides the 20,000, Washington had issued 6,244 visas since Sept. 9 to Cubans who were immediate relatives of \nU.S. citizens or who had been on a worldwide waiting list to migrate.\n\nThe immigration agreement, under which both sides pledged to guarantee safe, orderly and legal migration, ended \nlast summer's \"Cuban rafters' crisis\" in which more than 30,000 Cubans fled Cuba in flimsy rafts and boats.\n\nU.S. officials say that of the 20,000 Cubans to be granted entry in the year beginning next month, 5,000 will be \nCuban refugees who had been held at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba.\n"}
