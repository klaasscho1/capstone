ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The \nDepartment of Labor is issuing regulations to govern its certification of the employment of nonimmigrant workers in \ntemporary or seasonal agricultural employment under the H-2A program. Specifically, these regulations establish \nstandards and procedures for employers seeking to hire foreign temporary agricultural workers for job opportunities \nin herding and production of livestock on the range. These regulations are consistent with the Secretary of Labor's \nstatutory responsibility to certify that there are not sufficient able, willing, qualified and available U.S. workers to \nperform these jobs, and that the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working \nconditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. Among the issues addressed in these regulations \nare the qualifying criteria for employing foreign workers in the applicable job opportunities, preparing job orders, \nprogram obligations of employers, filing of H-2A applications requesting temporary labor certification for range \noccupations, recruiting U.S. workers, determining the minimum offered wage rate, and the minimum standards for \nhousing used on the range. The regulations establish a single set of standards and procedures applicable to \nemployers seeking to hire foreign temporary agricultural workers for sheep and goat herding and range production \nof livestock, given the unique characteristics of these job opportunities in their industry. DATES: Effective Date: \nThis rule will be effective on November 16, 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further \ninformation, contact William W. Thompson, II, Acting Administrator, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, \nEmployment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room C-4312, \nWashington, DC 20210; Telephone (202) 693-3010 (this is not a toll-free number).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On April 15, 2015, the \nEmployment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking (NPRM) requesting comments on proposed standards and procedures to govern the \ncertification of nonimmigrant workers in temporary or seasonal agricultural employment under the H-2A program. \nTemporary Agricultural Employment of H-2A Foreign Workers in the Herding or Production of Livestock on the \nOpen Range in the United States, 80 FR 20300 (2015). Specifically, the NPRM addressed employment in sheep, \ngoat and cattle herding occupations performed on the open range.\\1\\ ETA invited written comments on all aspects \nof the proposed regulations from interested parties. ETA also invited public comment on a variety of specific issues. \nOriginally, the written comment period closed on May 15, 2015. However, in response to many requests for \nadditional time in which to comment, ETA extended the comment period through June 1, 2015. ETA has reviewed \nand considered all timely comments received in response to the proposed regulations. --------------------------------------\n------------------------------------- \\1\\ As discussed in greater detail below in Sec. IV.A.3.c., we have modified the \ndefinition of ``open range'' based on a significant number of comments addressing the issue, and the Final Rule \nnow refers to these herding occupations as work on the ``range.'' However, when discussing this requirement as it \nappeared in the former rules or in the proposed provisions in the NPRM, we rely on the prior references to the \n``open range.'' In addition, ETA has traditionally referred to the production of cattle separately as the ``open range \nproduction of livestock.'' For ease of reference, and because this Final Rule concludes that the work involved in \nsheep, goat and cattle production, including herding, can be treated similarly for the purposes of this regulation, we \nmay also refer to the ``range production of livestock'' as ``cattle production,'' which includes ``cattle herding.'' ---------\n------------------------------------------------------------------ The Department received 506 timely comments from a wide \nvariety of sources. Commenters included: Members of Congress; State political officials, including State governors \nand legislative representatives; State executive agencies; individual ranchers that employ H-2A herders in their \noperations; national and state-level industry advocacy organizations; worker advocacy organizations; national and \nstate-level agriculture advocacy organizations; wool growers associations; sheep shearing businesses; members of \nthe media; and the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy (SBA Office of Advocacy), among others. \nThe vast majority of comments specifically addressed issues contained in ETA's proposed rule. The Department \nrecognizes and appreciates the value of comments, ideas, and suggestions from all those who commented on the \nproposal, and this Final Rule was developed only after consideration of all the material submitted. II. Statutory and \nRegulatory Authority The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or the Act) establishes the H-2A visa classification \nfor employers to employ foreign workers on a temporary basis to perform agricultural labor or services. INA Section \n101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a); see also INA Secs. 214(c)(1) and 218, 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1) and \n1188. The INA authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to permit the admission of \nforeign workers to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature if the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Labor (Secretary) certifies that: (A) There are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and \nqualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed to perform the labor or services involved in the \npetition; and (B) The employment of the foreign worker(s) in such labor or services will not adversely affect the \nwages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. 8 U.S.C. 1188(a)(1). The \nSecretary has delegated these responsibilities, through the Assistant Secretary, Employment and Training \nAdministration (ETA), to ETA's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). Sec. Order 06-2010, 75 FR 66268 \n(Oct. 27, 2010). The Secretary has delegated responsibility for enforcement of the worker protections to the \nAdministrator of the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). Sec. Order 01-2014, 79 FR 77527 (Dec. 24, 2014). Since \n1987, OFLC and its predecessor agencies have operated the H- 2A program under regulations promulgated under \nthe authority of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which amended the INA and established \nthe H-2A program.\\2\\ OFLC's [[Page 62959]] current regulations governing the H-2A program were published in \n2010 following notice and comment. 75 FR 6884 (Feb. 12, 2010) (2010 Final Rule). Historically, and as provided in \n20 CFR 655.102 of the 2010 Final Rule, the H-2A regulations permitted OFLC to set ``special procedures'' to \ngovern the employment of foreign workers in certain occupations, such as sheep and goat herding and the range \nproduction of livestock, to which the standard H-2A regulations did not readily apply, so long as the special \nprocedures adhered to the statutory mandates to determine U.S. worker availability and to certify that bringing in \nforeign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly \nemployed. 8 U.S.C. 1188(a)(1). The Department's history of setting standards and procedures applicable to range \n\n\n\nherding or production of livestock occupations through Training and Employment Guidance Letters (TEGLs) and \npredecessor sub-regulatory guidance documents is set out in extensive detail in the NPRM, 80 FR at 20301-20302, \nand we do not repeat it here.\\3\\ However, as a result of a recent court decision, Mendoza et al. v. Perez, 754 F.3d \n1002 (D.C. Cir. 2014), ETA is now establishing the standards that govern H-2A herder occupations in this Final \nRule through notice and comment rulemaking. The new regulations will be incorporated at 20 CFR part 655, \nsubpart B. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 \ncreated the H-2 temporary worker program. Public Law 82-414, 66 Stat. 163. In 1986, IRCA divided the H-2 \nprogram into separate agricultural and non- agricultural temporary worker programs. See Public Law 99-603, sec. \n301, 100 Stat. 3359 (1986). The H-2A agricultural worker program designation corresponds to the statute's \nagricultural worker classification in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a). \\3\\ This Final Rule supersedes the two TEGLs \nthat currently govern the temporary employment of foreign herders, TEGL No. 32-10 (Jun. 14, 2011) and TEGL No. \n15-06, Change 1 (Jun. 14, 2011). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- III. Discussion of \nGeneral Comments This preamble sets out DOL's interpretation of the new regulations added to Subpart B, section \nby section. Before setting out the section- by-section analysis below, however, we will first acknowledge and \nrespond to comments that did not fit readily into this organizational scheme. A. General Comments Most of the \nhundreds of comments we received addressed one or more specific issues in the NPRM, such as the proposed \nwage methodology, all of which are discussed in greater detail in Sec. IV below. However, within many of those \ntargeted comments were more general remarks on the nature and the scope of the proposed rule, as discussed \nhere. We received several general comments in support of the NPRM and the proposed standards and procedures. \nSeveral commenters indicated that new rules were necessary to improve wages and other conditions for workers \nand to monitor compliance with the regulations. Some commenters noted that the new regulations were long \noverdue, in particular because foreign workers in herder occupations are grossly underpaid. One commenter noted \nthat although herders' wages should be increased, the upward adjustment should be implemented over a period of \ntime so that employers can adapt to the wage increase. The vast majority of comments we received were from \nindividuals or organizations that opposed specific aspects of the NPRM's provisions, particularly the wage \nmethodology. Many of the comments were from individual ranchers who stated that their families had been \noperating their businesses for five or more generations. From a review of these comments, several overarching \ngeneral themes emerged. Several commenters observed that the current rules ``are not broken,'' so no fix is \nrequired. Dozens of commenters remarked that the proposed wage methodology would result in the loss of \nlivelihood of many individual ranchers, and dozens of others went further to conclude that the proposed wage \nmethodology would put an end to the production of sheep, goat and cattle industries in the United States as a \nwhole. Many commenters noted that satellite industries that provide goods and services to or derive goods and \nservices from sheep, goat and cattle production, including textiles businesses and wool mills; the production of \nmilitary, sports, and first responder uniforms from sheep wool; meat processing; feed lots; animal transport; \nveterinarians and vet supplies; and seed stock producers, among others, would be adversely effected by the new \nregulation. Others noted that in addition to the impact on satellite industries, the communities in which the regulated \nranches are located would suffer, because the ranches stimulate the local economy through the purchase of goods, \nsupplies and services locally to sustain their businesses, including banking services, grocers and gas stations, \namong others. The adverse impact to both the satellite industries and the local communities would include, the \ncomments noted, the loss of jobs to U.S. and foreign workers alike. One comment noted that with increased costs \nto ranchers, which would result in loss of livestock-based jobs, land grant colleges with agriculture programs would \nsuffer. We received many comments that addressed the international aspects of the herder occupations and the \nindustries that employ them. One commenter noted that the foreign labor certification program creates goodwill \nbetween the United States and the foreign workers' countries of origin, and the new rules would diminish that \ngoodwill. Several comments noted the impact of foreign imports, particularly sheep imports, on the ability of U.S. \nranchers to compete in the global marketplace. These comments suggested that if herder wages are increased, the \ngovernment must also protect the U.S. market from price competition resulting from less expensive foreign imports. \nMany ranchers remarked that foreign importers would further profit because foreign producers would undercut U.S. \nmeat and wool prices. Commenters also asserted that foreign meat imports are not held to the same food safety \nstandards as U.S. meat producers, which increases the cost of the domestic products. We also received several \ndozen comments about the environmental impact that would result if the sheep, goat and cattle industries \nexperience increased costs to employ herders. One commenter noted that grazing livestock producers manage 250 \n\n\n\nmillion acres of Western land, including public land under the stewardship of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS or \nForest Service) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior. Many of these comments noted that the migratory pattern of animal herding is itself a \nnatural resource management activity. Among the natural resource management benefits of controlled animal \nmigration are the improvement of wildlife habitats that promotes animal breeding and sustains migratory fowl; the \ncontrol of the spread of noxious and invasive weeds; the reduction of the use of herbicides and pesticides; the \nincreased use of sheep ``fertilizer'' to improve the quality of the land; and the decreased use of machinery for \ntending the land, thus reducing fuel use and our carbon footprint. Several dozen comments indicated that animal \ngrazing aids in the reduction of undergrowth that feeds wildfires in the West. Thus, these commenters asserted that \nif sheep, goat and cattle producers' costs are raised, this would result in the reduction of animal grazing overall, \nwhich would, in turn, increase wildfires in the Western United States because of the abundance of ``fuel'' that would \notherwise be reduced by grazing. Such fires would, among other things, result in the devastation of sage brush, \nwhich is the [[Page 62960]] habitat of sage grouses that nest in grasslands across the American West. Other \ncommenters noted that without regular grazing, invasive weeds would overtake Western grasslands. One comment \nindicated that if ranchers' costs are increased, ranch land would be sold, and developers would build tract housing. \nThe land management issues offered by these comments raise important questions about the role of animal grazing \nand care of our natural resources. This Final Rule is limited to the regulation of particular issues dealing with the \nemployment of herders, but we have consulted with our sister agencies, USFS and BLM, about particular issues \naddressed in this Final Rule, including the proposed definition of ``open range,'' discussed further below in Sec. \nIV.A.3. of the section-by-section analysis. Many ranchers noted that, in their view, foreign herders are satisfied with \ntheir current wages and working conditions. In support of this conclusion, they indicated that the wages earned are \nfar superior to those wages they might earn for the same work in their countries of origin. Ranchers noted that their \nforeign workers routinely send funds home, suggesting that the herders have expendable income. They also noted \nthat the same herders return to their U.S. jobs year after year, suggesting that the wages and working conditions \nare satisfactory to support the retention of foreign herders. Several ranchers noted that herders become ``one of the \nfamily'' and are welcome in the ranch house to take meals with the family, and that employers take good care of \nherders' health and welfare. To this end, we received several comments inviting us to visit the ranches and the \nherders so that we could better understand the industry and the way of life. Several ranchers indicated that if there \nwere, in fact, exploitive ranch operations that did not ``play by the rules,'' DOL should take action against those \nranchers but not change the current rules. We received several comments requesting that we ``work closely'' with \nthe industry to develop ``workable new rules.'' Prior to this notice and comment proceeding, we received and \nconsidered written input from the industry, as well as employee advocates, in developing the provisions proposed in \nthe NPRM. 80 FR at 20309. We have also reviewed and considered carefully all 506 comments received from the \nstakeholders affected by this Final Rule, including both industry and employee representatives. We address in more \ndetail below, particularly in the section on the wage methodology adopted in the Final Rule, the concerns raised \nabout the adverse impact of the regulation on ranchers, their local communities, and other industries that serve the \nranching industries. As we discuss more fully below, we recognize that after decades of the status quo, in which \nthere was no change to the rules governing these industries, the current modernization effort can have a broad \nimpact, and we have made adjustments to the proposed provisions, as discussed more fully below, with these \ninterests in mind, as well as those of the employees. We thank all commenters for their input, including those that \noffered their general support for and their opposition to the new regulations, and we have considered all these \nremarks as we developed the provisions included in this Final Rule.\\4\\ ------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------- \\4\\ We note that we received several general comments about issues outside the scope of the present \nrulemaking. One comment asserted that this rulemaking ``sets a dangerous precedent'' for regulating the \nbeekeeping and custom combine harvesting industries that also employ H-2A workers. Another comment indicated \nthat the United States needs ``immigration reform,'' but did not specify the nature of that reform. One comment \nasserted that the government should not be involved at all in agriculture, that the ``open market'' should control, and \nthat ``government supports'' for sheep and cattle ranchers should be removed. One commenter submitted that \nemployers should be required to provide herders with two weeks of paid vacations. Finally, three comments \nsuggested that DOL should expand the H-2A program to include other year-round animal agriculture, including \ndairy production. As noted, these comments all address issues that are not within the scope of this rulemaking. ------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Mendoza v. Perez and the Need for Rulemaking The NPRM \n\n\n\nindicated that among the reasons for the current rulemaking was the decision in the Mendoza case, cited above. \nThat case required the Department to engage in notice and comment rulemaking to set standards governing the \nemployment of foreign herders because those standards were legislative rules governed by the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1024-1025. We received several comments to the effect that \nalthough the Mendoza case required the Department to engage in notice and comment rulemaking, that case did \nnot require the Department to alter the substantive standards that currently govern the employment of foreign \nherders as set out in the applicable TEGLs. These comments note that we could have simply proposed the current \nTEGL standards without change, and asked for comment on those provisions. We agree that the Mendoza case \nonly required us to engage in notice and comment rulemaking, but did not require us to alter the standards as they \nwere set in the applicable TEGLs. However, the NPRM provided reasons other than the Mendoza case to support \nnotice and comment rulemaking initiated by a proposal that substantively altered the standards long governing \nherding occupations. As noted in the NPRM, ETA's traditional method of determining the prevailing wage for these \noccupations--the use of surveys by the state workforce agencies (SWAs)--has become increasingly difficult. In \nthese occupations the prevailing wage has served as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR). Few survey results \nare produced, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of those surveys. 80 FR at 20302, 20307. New wage \nmethodology standards were needed to establish ``a more effective and workable methodology for determining and \nadjusting a monthly [wage] for these unique occupations[.]'' 80 FR at 20302. In addition, because of the difficulty in \nsetting the wage under the prior methodology based on the SWA surveys, herder occupations have experienced \n``wage stagnation in various degrees across these occupations[.]'' 80 FR at 20307. In many cases, herders whose \nwages are set under the current standards are making only slightly more in nominal wages than they were 20 years \nago, and therefore are making significantly less in real terms today. Id. Therefore, we needed to engage in notice \nand comment rulemaking not only as a result of Mendoza; we also needed to address the inadequate wage \nmethodology that over years contributed to herder wage stagnation. It is a reasonable exercise of DOL's discretion \nto propose a new wage methodology in the NPRM on which commenters could and did provide input. We received \ntwo joint comments from worker advocate groups that supported the need for rulemaking, particularly to address \nthe inadequate wage methodology and herder wage stagnation. A relatively brief worker advocate joint submission \napplauded the proposed rules, asserting that the revisions will ``greatly benefit both temporary foreign workers and \nU.S. workers alike, including long-overdue wage increases and other proposed provisions that seek to address the \npoor working conditions.'' \\5\\ A more [[Page 62961]] comprehensive worker advocate joint comment submitted the \nsame day, which included many of the same signatories as the other worker advocate joint comment, supported \nthe rulemaking as necessary to revise the current wage methodology that has produced wage stagnation over a \nperiod of years.\\6\\ This comment stated that DOL has relied on old data and outdated surveys, with sample sizes \nthat are too small to be statistically valid. This comment identified problems with the wage- setting method under the \nTEGLs, including permitting reliance on prior years' surveys and basing the wage on neighboring states where no \nsurvey results were available. This comment also identified the failure to filter out the wages of H-2A nonimmigrants \nin the survey results, and errors and inconsistencies in the SWA surveys (which, the comment indicates, may be a \nmisclassification of workers) as contributing to wage stagnation. The comment suggested that the methodology is \nflawed and has cost herders ``millions of dollars.'' Although much of the specific substance of this comment will be \ndiscussed below in the section-by-section analysis, DOL concurs with the general theme of both employee \nadvocate joint comments that, apart from the Mendoza case, this rulemaking is warranted to address problems with \nthe wage methodology and herder wage stagnation, as we stated in the NPRM.\\7\\ --------------------------------------------\n------------------------------- \\5\\ Fifty-four groups and three individuals were signatories to this 4 page joint employee \nadvocate comment providing input on wages, housing, food, employer-provided items, experience requirements, \nand a few other issues. The signatories to this joint comment were American Federation of Labor and Congress of \nIndustrial Organizations (AFL-CIO); California Church IMPACT; California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation; \nCATA--EL Comit[eacute] de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agr[iacute]colas/The Farmworker Support Committee; \nCatholic Migrant Farmworker Network; Central-West Justice Center, Migrant Farmworker Program; Centro de los \nDerechos del Migrantes, Inc.; Church of the Brethren, Office of Public Witness; Coalition of Immokalee Workers; \nCoalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking; Cumberland Presbyterian Church Missions Ministry Team; Disciples of \nChrist Refugee and Immigration Ministries; Dominican Sisters and Associates of Peace; Eastern Regional Alliance \nof Farmworker Advocates; Equal Justice Center; Farmworker Association of Florida; Farmworker Justice; Food \nChain Workers Alliance; Franciscan Sisters of Little Falls Justice & Peace Commission; Friends of Farmworkers, \n\n\n\nInc.; Global Workers Justice Alliance; Greater Rochester Coalition for Immigration Justice; Immigrant Worker \nProject--Ohio; Jobs With Justice; La Union Del Pueblo Entero; Labor Council for Latin American Advancement; \nLegal Aid Services of Oregon; L[iacute]deres Campesinas; National Guestworkers Alliance; National Consumers \nLeague; National Council of La Raza (NCLR); National Employment Law Project; National Farm Worker Ministry; \nNorth Carolina Farmworkers Project; New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty; New Mexico Legal Aid; National \nFarm Worker Ministry; Northwest Workers' Justice Project; Office of Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation at \nthe Stuart Center; Orange County Interfaith Committee to Aid Farm Workers; PathStone Corporation; Pi[ntilde]eros \ny Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste (PCUN); Polaris Project; Public Citizen; Public Justice Center; Puerto Rico \nLegal Service Migrant Worker Project; Ramsay Merriam Fund; Rural Neighborhoods; Sisters of Charity of the \nBlessed Virgin Mary, Dubuque Iowa; Telamon Corporation; Towards Justice; The Episcopal Church; United Farm \nWorkers; United Migrant Opportunity Services; Sergio Velasquez Catalan (one of the named plaintiffs in Mendoza \nv.

Arcury, Ph.D., Professor; Susan Gzesh, Senior \nLecturer & Executive Director, Pozen Family Center for Human Rights, University of Chicago. \\6\\ Fourteen groups \nand three individuals were signatories to a 35 page employee advocate joint comment with attachments, and \nincluded California Rural Legal Assistance; California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation; Central California Legal \nServices; Colorado Legal Services, Community Legal Services of Arizona; Farmworker Justice; Florida Legal \nServices; Global Workers' Alliance; Jennifer J.

Perez, No. 11-cv-01790 (D.D.C. May 7, 2015)). \\7\\ We have \nreviewed and considered both employee advocate joint comments. Because the comprehensive joint comment \nessentially addressed all the subjects that the shorter one did and in greater detail, and because there is a good \ndeal of overlap in the signatories, when referencing the joint comments of the employee advocates, we will refer to \nthem as the ``Worker Advocates' Joint Comment.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. \nHistorical Background of Foreign Herder Employment We received several comments, including from industry \nassociations Mountain Plains Agricultural Services (Mountain Plains) and Western Range Association (Western \nRange) that address the early history of foreign sheep herders coming into the United States to perform herding \nwork, as early as the 1950s. The NPRM discussed this history in some length. 80 FR at 20301-20302. Based on \nthe history, one commenter noted that early herders from the Basque region in Spain were given special treatment \nin order to permit their entry into the United States to work when no U.S. workers were available, which gave rise \nto the establishment of special procedures. Three commenters underscored that Congress recognized the special \nneeds of sheep ranchers in their early enactments in the 1950s. Two commenters indicated, without specific \ncitation, that IRCA intended that DOL grant special procedures to ranchers seeking foreign herders. One \ncommenter asserted that foreign herders should be permitted to stay in the United States longer than typically \nallowed because of the unique skills of foreign herders. One commenter submitted that the history of special \nprocedures, as reflected in early Congressional action, DOL sub-regulatory action, and subsequent regulations \npermitting the establishment of special procedures, provides a sound foundation for the continuation of special \nprocedures. Several commenters noted that the process and standards set out in early Departmental guidance and \nlater incorporated into the TEGLs have worked well for decades and that change is unnecessary. These \ncommenters noted that special procedures--separate from the regular H-2A standards--are necessary because of \nthe recognized unique nature of the herding occupation, including that herders tend to the herd all day, every day, \nand that their remote location makes their work hours difficult to record. Finally, the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment pointed out that even though separate regulatory standards may be required because of the nature of \nherding work, those variances from the standard H-2A requirements must apply only to herders working on the \nrange and not to livestock workers on the ranch. They further note that the variances must be consistent with the \nstatutory command to protect against adverse effect on U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. As with the \nproposal in the NPRM, we have taken into account the unique nature of herder work and its long history with \nrespect to the employment of foreign workers as we developed this Final Rule. D. Requests for Extensions of Time \nto Submit Comments We published the NPRM on April 15, 2015 and originally requested that comments be \nsubmitted within 30 days, by May 15, 2015. We received 100 comments requesting an extension of the public \ncomment period. A plurality of requests to extend the comment period (48) did not identify the specific time period \nsought for an extension. However, 38 requests sought an extension of the comment period for 90 days. The \n\n\n\nremainder of the requests sought additional time variously in a range between 30 and 180 days. On May 5, 2015, \nwe extended the comment period an additional 15 days, to June 1, 2015. 80 FR 25663. We received a few \nadditional comments (counted in the 100-request total mentioned above) seeking time beyond the new June 1, \n2015 deadline. However, because of the Mendoza court scheduling order, we were not able to extend the public \ncomment period beyond June 1, 2015 to submit comments.\\8\\ However, as noted, we [[Page 62962]] received 506 \nunique comments during the allotted comment period, addressing all aspects of the NPRM, which is a robust \nresponse given the 45-day comment period. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ The \noriginal scheduling order, dated October 31, 2014, required DOL to issue an NPRM by March 1, 2014, and a final \nrule by November 1, 2015, with an effective date no later than December 1, 2015. The revised scheduling order, \ndated February 25, 2015, required DOL to issue an NPRM by April 15, 2015, but maintained the requirement that \nwe issue a final rule by November 1, 2015, with an effective date no later than December 1, 2015. -----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------- IV. Section-by-Section Summary of the Final Rule, 20 CFR Part 655, \nSubpart B This preamble sets out ETA's interpretation of the new regulations in Subpart B, section by section, and \ngenerally follows the outline of the regulations. Within each section of the preamble, the Department has noted and \nresponded to those comments that are addressed to that particular section of the rule. The Department notes that, \nin the NPRM, we had proposed to place these new rules in a new Subpart C. In order to ensure that there is no \nconfusion regarding the Department's continued authority to enforce requirements relating to herding and range \nlivestock workers pursuant to 29 CFR part 501, we have decided to place the new rules at the end of existing \nSubpart B, the standard H-2A requirements, rather than in a new Subpart. Therefore, ministerial conforming \nmodifications have been made throughout the regulation to accommodate this non-substantive change. Such minor \nmodifications are not addressed individually below. A. Introductory Sections 1. Section 655.200--Scope and \nPurpose of Herding and Range Livestock Regulations As stated in the NPRM, the standard H-2A regulations in \nexisting 20 CFR part 655, subpart B (Sec. Sec. 655.100--655.185) govern the certification of employers' temporary \nemployment of nonimmigrant workers in temporary or seasonal agricultural employment. Because of the unique \nnature of the herder occupations, employers who seek to hire temporary agricultural foreign workers to perform \nherding or production of livestock on the range, as described in Sec. 655.200(b), are subject to certain standards \nthat are different from the regular H-2A standards and procedures. These new regulations, found at Sec. Sec. \n655.200-655.235 (hereinafter generally referred to as the herding and range livestock regulations), are intended as \na comprehensive set of regulations governing the certification of the temporary employment of foreign workers in \nherder or production of livestock occupations on the range.\\9\\ However, to the extent that a specific variance from \nthe standard H-2A requirements is not set out specifically in the new herding and range livestock provisions, the \nstandards and procedures set forth in the standard H-2A regulations apply. -----------------------------------------------------\n---------------------- \\9\\ Some States have set employment standards governing agriculture employment generally, or \nherder employment more specifically, and those standards may differ from the standards set in this Final Rule. The \nterms and conditions of herder employment established in this Final Rule are intended as a floor and not a ceiling. \nSee, e.g., 29 U.S.C. 218(a). Accordingly, where a State sets employment standards applicable to herders that are \nhigher (more protective) than those set in this Final Rule, DOL intends that the State standards should apply. --------\n------------------------------------------------------------------- Prior to this Final Rule, the standards and procedures governing \nsheep, goat and cattle herders were set separately in two different TEGLs, as noted above. Although there were \nsome differences in the TEGL standards as they applied to the different industries (sheep and goat herding were \ncovered by one TEGL and cattle herding by the second TEGL), the standards and procedures were largely the \nsame. We proposed in the NPRM to set the same certification standards and procedures for employers employing \nforeign sheep and goat herders as employers employing foreign cattle herders. We received two comments on this \nissue. The first was included in the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment, which concurred that a single set of rules is \nneeded to protect goat herders, sheep herders, and range production of livestock workers efficiently and \neffectively. The second comment, submitted by Maltsberger Ranch, opposed applying the same standards to sheep \nand goat herding, and open range production of livestock. Maltsberger Ranch indicated that the rules should be \ndifferent because the animals' ``husbandry, needs and handling standards are different, [and an] area's geographic \nlocation may dictate the need of different ranching practices. . . . The rule should not be rewritten in a manner that \nchanges the scope of, or redefines the application of special procedures historically granted [to] Range Producers \nof Livestock.'' We are adopting the position taken in the NPRM, which sets common procedures and other \nstandards for sheep and goat herding, and open range production of livestock. The common standards and \n\n\n\nprocedures will improve the requirements' clarity and readability, streamline application processing, and improve \ncompliance, all without hindering variations in employer practices or impairing employee rights or employer \nobligations. Accordingly, as proposed in the NPRM, the herding and range livestock regulations apply to employers \nseeking certification of applications to employ foreign herders to tend sheep, goats and cattle on the range. 2. \nSection 655.200(b)--Jobs Subject to Herding and Range Livestock Regulations a. Background In order to use the \nherding and range livestock regulations, an employer's job opportunity must possess all of the characteristics \ndescribed in this provision. The TEGL for sheep and goat herding occupations and the TEGL for open range \nproduction of livestock repeatedly refer to the unique characteristics of these occupations as the bases for the \nspecial procedures. The TEGL for sheep and goat herding occupations describes the unique characteristics of \nherding as ``spending extended periods of time with grazing herds of sheep in isolated mountainous terrain; being \non call to protect flocks from predators 24 hours a day, 7 days a week . . .'' TEGL 32-10, 3. The TEGL for open \nrange livestock production also states that these occupations ``generally require workers to live in remote housing \nof a mobile nature, rather than `a fixed-site farm, ranch or similar establishment.' '' TEGL 15-06, Change 1, \nAppendix B, I. Both TEGLs require that the Form ETA-790 submitted to the SWA include that the anticipated hours \nof work are ``on call for up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.'' TEGL 32-10, Attachment A, I(C)(1); TEGL 15-06, \nChange 1, Attachment A, I(C)(1). Both TEGLs also require that employers provide effective means of \ncommunication with workers ``due to the remote and unique nature of the work to be performed.'' TEGL 32-10, \nAttachment A, I(C)(4); TEGL 15-06, Change 1, Attachment A, I(C)(4). As discussed more fully in Sec. IV.A.3. of the \npreamble related to Sec. 655.201, both TEGLs also provide descriptions of job duties that employers may use when \nsubmitting their Form ETA-790 to the SWA. Section 655.200(b) of the NPRM proposed to limit the scope of jobs \nsubject to these rules by requiring that: (1) the work activities involve the herding or production of livestock and any \nadditional duties must be ``minor, sporadic, and incidental to the herding or production of livestock''; (2) the ``work is \nperformed on the open range requiring the use of mobile housing'' for ``at least 50 percent of the workdays in the \nwork contract period'' and ``[a]ny additional work performed at a place other than the range . . . that does not \nconstitute the production of livestock must be minor, sporadic and incidental [[Page 62963]] to the herding or \nproduction of livestock;'' and (3) the ``work activities generally require the workers to be on call 24 hours per day, 7 \ndays per week.'' 80 FR at 20339. The NPRM also proposed to require that job orders include ``a statement that the \nworkers are on call for up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and that the workers are primarily engaged \n(spend at least 50 percent of the workdays during the contract period) in the herding or production of livestock on \nthe open range.'' Id. Proposed Sec. 655.210(b) also provided that duties ``may include activities performed at the \nranch or farm only if such duties constitute the production of livestock or are closely and directly related to herding \nand the production of livestock. Work that is closely and directly related to herding or the production of livestock \nmust be performed on no more than 20 percent of the workdays spent at the ranch in a work contract period. All \nsuch duties must be specifically disclosed on the job order.'' Id.\\10\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------\n----------- \\10\\ The Department is addressing here the NPRM provisions in Sec. 655.200(b) as well as the \ncorresponding proposed job order disclosures found in Sec. 655.210(b), as these issues and comments overlap. \nThe remainder of the provisions of proposed Sec. 655.210, ``Contents of job orders,'' are addressed below in a \nseparate discussion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the Final Rule, the Department \neliminates the 50 percent mobile housing requirement, and requires that herders spend more than 50 percent of \ntheir workdays on the range, which is more consistent with the exemption in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) \nfor range production of livestock, as discussed below. We have also retained the requirement that the work \nactivities generally require the workers to be on call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. As discussed in more detail \nbelow in Sec. IV.A.3., in which we address Sec. 655.201, ``Definition of terms,'' we have deleted the definition of \n``minor, sporadic and incidental'' duties and removed the 20 percent cap on such closely and directly related duties. \nb. Comments A number of commenters addressed the requirement that the work be performed on the open range \nrequiring mobile housing for at least 50 percent of the work days in the contract period. Some commenters \naddressed the 50 percent requirement directly and others provided information regarding the times of year workers \ntypically spend on and off the range or in mobile housing. Commenters directly addressing the 50 percent range \nrequirement primarily raised concerns with the combined effect of the 50 percent range requirement and the \nproposed definition of ``open range'' (which generally included the absence of fencing as a required element of \nopen range, which is discussed further below); they stated that many operations currently using the TEGLs would \nno longer qualify for the program because of the prevalence of fencing on the range. That is, commenters explained \n\n\n\nthat it is almost impossible to spend at least 50 percent of the contract period away from fences. For example, the \nGarfield County Farm Bureau (GCFB) commented that the 50 percent range requirement ``simply does not work for \nmany of our members.'' The GCFB explained that many producers run their operations on private fenced and \nunfenced parcels, and are only using ``large acre non-fenced permits'' for late spring and summer, thus not meeting \nthe 50 percent range requirement. Silver Creek Ranch explained that fences are prevalent throughout their herding \noperations, so to regulate the time herders are in contact with fences or enclosed areas would be impractical and \ncould impair the quality of the care provided to the livestock. The Wyoming Livestock Board explained that many \nproducers graze on crop residue, private leases, vineyards and other parcels near populated areas, and that if \n``herding can only take place where no fences exist, for at least 50 [percent] of the work time[,] a majority of range \nsheep operations would not be eligible for H-2A herders.'' \\11\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \\11\\ We received a substantial number of comments addressing the proposed definition of ``open range'' and \ndescribing the prevalence of fencing in modern herding. Those comments are discussed in further detail below, in \nSec. IV.A.3. of the preamble related to Sec. 655.201, ``Definition of terms.'' -----------------------------------------------------\n---------------------- Several commenters, including the Idaho Wool Growers Association, stated that the NPRM's dual \nrequirements of no fencing and that the herders must spend half of the year away from headquarters and livestock \nfacilities would disqualify many herders from using these regulations. These commenters primarily discussed the \nfencing issue and did not elaborate on whether herders typically spend more than 50 percent of the work contract at \na fixed site on a ranch or farm. For example, the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers' Association (TSGRA) stated that \n``the proposal suggests that no fences would be allowed in connection with sheepherders and, further, half of the \nherders' year must be away from the ranch headquarters and livestock facilities.'' TSGRA further explained that \n``private grass, supplemental hay and crop aftermath are the available options to maintain year-round feed for the \nanimals and that does not fit the Department's apparent view of grazing out of sight of fencing or facilities.'' Some \ncommenters stated that the 50 percent rule is ``unworkable'' or an ``administrative nightmare'' and does not allow \nfor flexibility in cases of bad weather, emergencies, or other circumstances. For example, Henry Etcheverry, a \nsheep rancher, described the recordkeeping associated with the 50 percent rule as ``impossible'' and explained that \neach operation varies and thus requires different times spent in mobile housing or at the ranch. Brian Clark, an \nemployee of the Wyoming State Workforce Agency representing his own views, stated that using percentages to \ndetermine how much time is spent on the range could create an ``administrative and enforcement nightmare,'' does \nnot reflect reality, and does not reflect the FLSA criteria. Peter and Beth Swanson, commercial sheep producers, \ncommented that many of their grazing locations are neither a ``ranch site'' nor ``open range'' (as defined in the \nNPRM) and that time spent on the ``open range'' depends on range forage availability, which varies due to a \nnumber of circumstances, such as rainfall, weather conditions, and land owner decisions. Mountain Valley \nLivestock stated that time spent in mobile housing versus at headquarters can be completely dependent on the \nweather. Mountain Plains and Western Range, in a comment adopted by several other commenters, specifically \naddressed the 50 percent mobile housing requirement, calling the rule ``arbitrary and unworkable.'' In their view, a \nsheepherder spending 182 days of the year in mobile housing but the rest in a bunk house during other livestock \nproduction work would not be eligible under either the special procedures or the standard H- 2A program. Mountain \nPlains and Western Range further commented that, as mobile housing was defined in the NPRM, a limited number \nof range cattle operations in Montana and Texas currently using the special procedures may not be eligible for the \nnew herding and range livestock regulations, as they use non-mobile range housing on the range for livestock \nworkers. However, they acknowledged that virtually all employers use mobile housing except for this small subset. \nMountain Plains and Western Range recommended that instead of the 50 percent range/mobile housing and 20 \npercent minor, sporadic, and incidental limitations, the Department adopt the FLSA range production exemption \nfrom minimum wage and overtime ``principally engaged'' rule. See 29 [[Page 62964]] U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(F), 29 CFR \n780.325. Under the FLSA, a worker spending more than 50 percent of his or her time on the range is exempt, even \nif the employee performs some duties on the ranch not closely or directly related to herding or the production of \nlivestock. 29 CFR 780.325. Mountain Plains and Western Range commented that the FLSA exemption is ``less \nconfusing and more workable'' than the ``arbitrary'' percentage limitations in the NPRM, as well as more ``holistic \nand flexible,'' and, in their view, focuses on the duties of the worker rather than the location of the work. They \ncommented that the FLSA test would be better understood and more likely complied with by employers. The \nDepartment received a small number of additional comments specifically addressing the requirement to spend 50 \npercent of the work contract period in mobile housing; however, none of these comments supported the proposed \n\n\n\nrequirement. As Mountain Plains and Western Range explained, a small number of their members use non-mobile \nrange housing rather than mobile housing and thus would be ineligible to apply under these regulations. The \nWorker Advocates' Joint Comment commented that the 50 percent mobile housing requirement is unnecessary, \nand that this requirement could have the unintended effect of inducing employers to house workers in mobile \nhousing when fixed site housing is otherwise available. Several commenters provided detailed information \nregarding time typically spent on the ranch versus the range. These comments, considered together, demonstrate \nthat herding and production cycles vary greatly among operations, and a certain amount of flexibility is warranted to \nallow for differing amounts of time spent at the ranch. However, despite many the commenters expressing concern \nwith a 50 percent range requirement (largely due to the issue of fencing), these comments demonstrate that most \noperations appear to be spending more than 50 percent of the work contract period on land considered ``range,'' if \nfencing is permissible. For example, W.F. Goring & Son commented that they run their sheep on the open range \nabout 80 percent of the time and the remaining 20 percent of the time is ``spent on private lambing grounds where \nour animals are divided into large fenced pastures.'' The Siddoway Sheep Company spends approximately two to \nthree months at the ranch for lambing, then spring and fall grazing are conducted on BLM-permitted lands, state \nlands and private lands, and summer grazing is in the high mountain meadows. Larson Livestock stated that it \ngrazes sheep on the open range for twelve months of the year. In contrast to the above comments, the Worker \nAdvocates' Joint Comment agreed that the ``Department's attempt to specifically delineate the kinds of jobs that fall \nunder [the proposed rule] is long overdue and sorely needed.'' However, they expressed concern with the 50 \npercent threshold, asserting that this provision will adversely impact the wages and working conditions of U.S. \nworkers because it allows too much time off the range and creates a loophole allowing employers to pay the \nherding and range livestock wage for up to six months of work on the ranch. The advocates explained that ``H-2A \nand comparable U.S. workers, who do not work on the range (ranch hands), would otherwise be classified as \n`Farmworker, Livestock . . . They would not fall under [these rules] and would be entitled to be paid at the hourly \nAEWR rate . . . That work, if offered apart from the on the range herding work is more likely to attract U.S. \nworkers.'' They recommended that the Department revise the rule to require that 70 percent of the work contract \nperiod be spent on the range. A number of commenters also addressed the requirement that the work activities \ngenerally require workers to be on call up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. These comments overwhelmingly \nsupport the conclusion that these occupations require herders and range livestock production workers to be on call \nat all times while on the range to protect and manage the herd, one of the unique characteristics of these \noccupations. The Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers' Association emphasized the on call nature of the job as central to \nherding, stating, ``[s]heep ranching on rangeland throughout the United States has always been an industry that \nhas at its roots sheepherders, which are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to protect livestock from predation \nand natural disasters.'' The Washington Farm Bureau similarly stated that ``the open range sheep and livestock \nherding industry is unique and requires special treatment'' and that herders are constantly on call to protect the \nherd. However, some commenters stressed that although workers are on call ``24/7,'' they are not required to work \nevery hour of the day. As Helle Livestock stated, ``while herding doesn't require constant attention to the sheep it \ndoes require a constant presence.'' Southern Cross Ranches commented that ``it is imperative for herders to be \navailable on a 24/7 `on call' basis for maintaining herd integrity and predator control'' but herders are ``not expected \nto and don't work 24/ 7.'' Mountain Plains and Western Range commented that the term ``on call'' may be \nmisleading and suggested that instead the Department use the term ``available.'' Although not specifically \ncommenting on the 24/ 7 provision, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment stated that ``[w]orkers must also be \ngiven time off at least every six months and as required for other H-2A workers, who cannot be required to work \nmore than 6 days per week, while at the ranch.'' c. Discussion As in the TEGLs, these NPRM provisions recognized \nthat herding and range livestock production occupations are unique and distinguishable from other H-2A \noccupations because they are conducted primarily in remote areas away from headquarters, require workers to be \non call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, and require certain unique job duties. Specifically, the Department \nincluded in the NPRM a requirement that at least 50 percent of the work contract period be spent on the range and \nin mobile housing. The purpose of this provision was to provide a sufficient threshold to confirm the unique, remote \ncharacteristics of these occupations, because herding and range livestock regulations are intended only to apply to \nworkers who attend the herd as it grazes on the range, while also allowing for a realistic and workable amount of \ntime at the ranch. The Department concluded that some delineation with respect to ranch versus range time was \nnecessary because it has found in its investigations that some workers are spending extended amounts of time at \n\n\n\nthe ranch while being paid the wage rate intended for range workers under these rules. The Department viewed \nthe 50 percent threshold as a reasonable requirement, as it requires workers to be primarily on the range, is \nconsistent with the FLSA range production of livestock exemption, and allows for flexibility in the cases of \nemergencies and changing circumstances. The NPRM further proposed that if an employer violated the 50 percent \nrange requirement, the employer would be in violation of its obligations under this part. 80 FR at 20303. Depending \non all the facts and circumstances, the employer would have been responsible for compliance with all of the regular \nH-2A requirements, including the payment of the highest applicable wage rate for all hours worked, and the \nDepartment could have sought other remedies for the violation. Id. [[Page 62965]] Upon consideration of the all \ncomments received on these issues, the Final Rule removes the requirement that workers be in mobile housing for \nat least 50 percent of the work contract period. The Department received no comments in support of this provision. \nWe agree with the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment that this requirement is not essential to the 50 percent range \nrequirement to confirm that workers being paid the herding and range livestock worker wage are engaged in work \nperformed on the range, and could have an unintended consequence of employers housing their workers in mobile \nhousing when fixed site housing is otherwise available. Further, the Department did not intend to exclude \noperations currently using the TEGLs who use non-mobile range housing on the range from using these rules \n(assuming they are in compliance with the remainder of the requirements under this Subpart), as pointed out by \nMountain Plains and Western Range. The issue of non- mobile range housing is addressed in greater detail below, \nin Sec. IV.E. of this preamble related to the discussion of Sec. 655.230, ``Range Housing.'' However, we conclude \nthat the need for range housing is relevant to whether a particular area is considered range and have addressed \nthis issue in the definition of ``range,'' as discussed in greater detail below. The Final Rule requires that workers \nspend a majority, meaning ``more than 50 percent,'' rather than ``at least 50 percent'' as provided in the NPRM, of \nthe workdays in the work contract period on the range, as range has been defined in the Final Rule. This change is \nintended to be more consistent with the range production of livestock exemption from minimum wage and overtime \nunder the FLSA. However, the Department concludes that fully adopting the FLSA range production of livestock \nexemption ``principally engaged'' rule is inappropriate here, because it would allow these workers to perform duties \nat the ranch or farm beyond those duties constituting the production of livestock. The Department's consideration of \nthe FLSA exemption, permissible duties and the 20 percent cap are further addressed below in Sec. IV.A.3. of the \npreamble related to the discussion of Sec. 655.201. The record demonstrates that a rule requiring a majority of the \nworkdays under the contract to be spent on the range is appropriate and necessary to confirm that occupations \nunder the herding and range livestock regulations, earning the required wage rate, are indeed uniquely remote and \nthus distinguishable from other H-2A occupations. As discussed above, the use of these special procedures is \ncontingent on these occupations posing unique challenges and circumstances, one of which is the remote nature of \nthe job. We conclude that allowing employers to pay the herding and range livestock wage to workers who are \nspending more time on the ranch than on the range would be inappropriate and would have an adverse effect on \nU.S. workers, as this work would otherwise be offered at the standard hourly AEWR for all hours worked and thus \nbe more likely to attract U.S. workers. The Department concludes that a majority range requirement is sufficient to \nconfirm the unique, remote nature of these occupations and distinguish herders from other H-2A occupations, such \nas ranch hands, while also allowing for necessary flexibility in modern herding to allow for changing circumstances \non the range. Thus, the Department declines to increase the threshold of time required on the range to 70 percent, \nas suggested by worker advocates. The Department also concludes that a majority range requirement is \nreasonable and practical. It is consistent with the FLSA range production exemption, as proposed by Mountain \nPlains and Western Range (a suggestion adopted by several other commenters) and, as discussed above, many \ncomments received on this issue provided evidence that operations currently using the TEGLs are spending more \nthan 50 percent of the contract period on grazing areas considered range, as now defined in the Final Rule. As \ndiscussed in detail below, the Department has revised the definition of ``open range'' to ``range'' and removed the \npresence of fencing as an indicator of whether land is ``range.'' The Department concludes that the revised \ndefinition of ``range'' will address the majority of the comments received regarding the 50 percent range \nrequirement, as they focused largely on the issue of fencing. Although some commenters expressed concern with \nsetting a certain required percentage of time on the range, we consider the majority range requirement to provide \nadequate flexibility to address changing circumstances due to weather, forage availability, and other factors. \nAllowing more than half of the work contract to be spent at locations other than the range while still being paid the \nherding and range livestock wage would be contrary to the Department's statutory mandate to determine whether \n\n\n\nU.S. workers are available for the job opportunity, and to provide that there is no adverse effect on similarly \nemployed U.S. workers. Of course, if there are employers who cannot meet the majority range requirement, they \nmay still use the standard H-2A program to obtain workers. Moreover, such employers might be able to use these \nprocedures for some portion of the year that meets the majority range requirement, and use the standard H-2A \nprogram for the remainder of the year; this would require filing at least two certification applications. Additionally, the \nFinal Rule retains the requirement that the work activities generally require the workers to be on call 24 hours per \nday, 7 days a week. The record fully supports that herding and range livestock production occupations continue to \nrequire constant attendance to the herd so that workers are on call 24/7. This is one of the unique characteristics of \nthese occupations that distinguish these jobs from other H-2A occupations, and we conclude that it is appropriate to \nrequire that this be a characteristic of such jobs. With respect to the commenters who underscored that ``on call'' \ndoes not mean actively working, the Department agrees that ``on call'' does not mean working for 24 hours per day, \nseven days per week, and the current terminology, which has been used consistently in the TEGLs for many years \nand is used in this final rule, reflects this distinction. We decline to adopt the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment \nrecommendation to require that workers must be given time off at least every six months and while at the ranch. \nThe NPRM did not include any provisions requiring time off at certain intervals or while on the ranch, and the \nDepartment did not seek comment on any issues relating to mandatory time off. Therefore, the public has not had \nsufficient notice that such a provision was contemplated for the Final Rule and has not had the opportunity to \ncomment on such provisions. Additionally, as discussed above, an essential characteristic of these job opportunities \nis that they require workers to be on call up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. However, the Department \nunderstands from its enforcement experience that workers often do receive days off while at the ranch and some \ncomments indicate that some workers receive paid vacation time. We encourage employers to adopt or continue \nthese practices. As provided in the NPRM and noted above, where the job opportunity does not fall within the scope \nof herding and range livestock production, the employer must comply with all of the standard H-2A procedures. If an \n[[Page 62966]] employer submits an application containing information and attestations indicating that its job \nopportunity is eligible for processing under the herding and range livestock procedures, but it is later determined, as \na result of an investigation or other compliance review, that the worker did not spend more than 50 percent of the \nworkdays on the range, or that the worker's duties at the ranch do not constitute the production of livestock (as \ndiscussed more fully below), the employer will be in violation of its obligations under this part and, depending upon \nthe precise nature of the violation, may owe back wages or be required to provide other relief. Depending upon all \nthe facts and circumstances, including but not limited to factors such as the percentage of days the workers spent \nat the ranch, whether the work was closely and directly related to herding and the production of livestock, and \nwhether the employer had violated these or other H-2A requirements in the past, the employer will be responsible \nfor compliance with all of the standard H-2A procedures and requirements, including payment of the highest \napplicable wage rate, determined in accordance with Sec. 655.122(l) for all hours worked. In addition, the \nDepartment may seek other remedies for the violations, such as civil monetary penalties and potentially debarment \nfrom use of the H-2A program. 3. Section 655.201--Definition of Herding and Range Livestock Terms a. Definitions \nof ``Herding,'' ``Production of Livestock,'' and ``Minor, Sporadic, and Incidental Work'' i. Background The TEGL for \nsheep and goat herding occupations provides a standard description of job duties that employers may use when \nsubmitting their Form ETA-790 to the SWA. TEGL 32-10, Attachment A, I(C)(1). That job description includes duties \nsuch as: Attending the animals on the range or pasture; using dogs to herd the flock and round up strays; guarding \nthe flock from predatory animals and from eating poisonous plants; examining the animals for signs of illness; \nadministering vaccines, medications and insecticides; and assisting with lambing, docking, and shearing. It also \nprovides that the workers ``may perform other farm or ranch chores related to the production or husbandry of \nsheep and/or goats on an incidental basis.'' The TEGL does not define ``incidental.'' The TEGL also states that any \nadditional duties must be normal and accepted for the occupation. The TEGL for the open range production of \nlivestock also contains a standard job description listing similar duties related to the animals. TEGL 15-06, Change \n1, Attachment A, I(C)(1). It also states that the worker may assist with irrigating, planting, cultivating, and \nharvesting hay, and that workers must be able to ride and handle horses and maintain their bearings in grazing \nareas. Finally, it provides that any additional job duties must be normal and accepted for the occupation. The TEGL \ndoes not place any limitation on the amount of time workers may perform these duties. Section 655.201 of the \nNPRM proposed to define ``herding'' as the ``[a]ctivities associated with the caring, controlling, feeding, gathering, \nmoving, tending, and sorting of livestock on the open range.'' 80 FR at 20339. The NPRM proposed to define the \n\n\n\n``production of livestock'' as the ``care or husbandry of livestock throughout one or more seasons during the year, \nincluding guarding and protecting livestock from predatory animals and poisonous plants; feeding, fattening, and \nwatering livestock, examining livestock to detect diseases, illnesses, or other injuries, administering medical care to \nsick or injured livestock, applying vaccinations and spraying insecticides on the open range, and assisting with the \nbreeding, birthing, raising, weaning, castration, branding, and general care of livestock.'' Id. The NPRM further \nproposed that any duties performed at the ranch or farm must either constitute the production of livestock or be \nclosely and directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock, and that any such closely and directly \nrelated work must be minor, sporadic, and incidental. Id. Section 655.201 of the NPRM proposed to define ``minor, \nsporadic, and incidental work'' as ``[w]ork duties and activities that are closely and directly related to herding and \nthe production of livestock and are performed on no more than 20 percent of the workdays spent at the ranch in a \nwork contract period.'' Id. Because the proposed definitions of herding, the production of livestock, and minor, \nsporadic, and incidental work operated together to define the scope of permissible job duties for a worker \nemployed under these regulations, the commenters generally discussed them together; similarly, we are addressing \nthem together. The Final Rule retains the definition of herding as proposed; modifies the definition of the production \nof livestock to include duties that are closely and directly related to herding or the production of livestock; and \neliminates the 20 percent cap on such closely and directly related duties. To provide further guidance, the Final \nRule also includes examples of duties that qualify as closely and directly related and duties that do not qualify under \nthese rules. ii. Comments A substantial number of commenters addressed the proposed intertwined definitions of \npermissible herder duties. Almost all of the commenters that addressed the proposed 20 percent cap were opposed \nto it. Some commenters expressed their opposition directly in commenting on the 20 percent cap, while others \nprovided a more generalized opposition to the proposed definitions' limitations on permissible duties. Mountain \nPlains and Western Range stated (in a comment adopted by numerous other commenters) that the proposed \ndefinitions ``are inappropriately restrictive and are not a realistic reflection of the industry's labor needs.'' They \nspecifically stated that the 20 percent limit on days spent performing incidental work was ``arbitrary'' and \n``unworkable.'' They suggested that the Department use ``a more holistic and flexible approach'' as in the \nregulations implementing the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime exemption for agricultural employees \n``principally engaged in the range production of livestock.'' 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(E). Those FLSA regulations look to \nwhether the employee's ``primary duty'' is range work. 29 CFR 780.325(a). Under the FLSA, a worker ``who \nspends more than 50 percent of his time'' on the range performing range production duties is exempt from minimum \nwage and overtime. 29 CFR 780.325(b). Thus, under the FLSA, such an exempt ``employee may perform some \nactivities not directly related to the range production of livestock, such as putting up hay or constructing dams or \ndigging irrigation ditches.'' Id. The Mountain Plains and Western Range comment stated that we should similarly \nrecognize that ``other work has historically been connected to that work and must be included in the definition of the \njob.'' They asserted that the NPRM did not explain how the 20 percent rule would help U.S. workers or how H-2A \nworkers were harmed by its absence. They also asserted that the wording of the 20 percent cap on the number of \ndays that could be spent on such incidental work was confusing, and they thought it might mean that only one day \nout of five at the ranch could be spent working and the other four spent had to be spent resting. [[Page 62967]] \nCunningham Sheep Company and Dufurrena Sheep Company both commented that ``[l]imits on incidental work \nrelated to herding would unnecessarily burden our operation'' because ``herders need to remain flexible and be \nable to perform husbandry-type jobs without unrealistically mandated rules.'' Another sheep rancher stated that the \ndefinition of incidental work ``needs to be more clearly defined and broadened. Fences need to be repaired to hold \nthe sheep in, supplemental feed fed, and a host of associated jobs that do not necessitate the need for additional \njob descriptions and employees.'' Another rancher asserted that, while ``H-2A workers should not be diverted to \nwork such as construction,'' they should be permitted to perform ``related livestock tending duties, such as the \nbuilding of lambing jugs.'' Etchart Livestock similarly stated that incidental work related to sheep production should \nbe allowed, such as ``[f]ence repair, corral repair, or other limited tasks,'' but did not want a percentage cap; this \ncommenter also stated that if the work does not involve sheep production, it should not be permitted. The Wyoming \nFarm Bureau Federation stated that the 20 percent ``is too low a cap given the nature of the industry.'' Some \ncomments revealed that the ranchers essentially want the workers to be able to perform any chore required \n(although a number of the examples they gave are animal husbandry duties that fall within the definitions of herding \nor the production of livestock). One sheep and cattle rancher, Kelly Sewell, noted that workers perform a variety of \nduties at the ranch base and thus wanted a general agricultural classification because these ``valuable employees \n\n\n\nirrigate crops, fix fences, and many other jobs necessary to run a ranch.'' Similarly, Indart Ranch stated that, in \n``addition to caring for the sheep and husbandry duties, our herders are constantly building and taking down fence, \ndriving pickups and water trucks, fixing and maintaining equipment, amongst many other ranch type duties.'' \nAnother sheep rancher commented that, ``[a]s long as the workers are working on the ranch . . . there should not \nbe such a thing as a 50-20 rule.'' The Rocky Mountain Sheep Marketing Association acknowledged that ranchers \nsometimes employ extra workers as insurance against an H-2A worker falling ill or going home due to a family \nneed, and stated that under the current regulations ``this extra help can be put to productive work on non-herding, \nnecessary work on other aspects of the ranching operation.'' The Colorado Wool Growers Association commented \nthat there are many chores associated with maintaining the herd, including ``fixing a sheep pasture fence or \nirrigating a field that is grazed by sheep.'' The Association suggested that such activities should not necessitate a \nseparate job or pay rate, but rather that the permissible job duties should include all such chores. CLUB 20 also \nrecommended expanding the job description ``to include all chores that are in direct support of maintaining livestock \nmanaged in a grazing livestock production system.'' Similarly, Mountain Plains and Western Range suggested \nreplacing all of the definitions with a comprehensive ``grazing livestock production system'' definition. A number of \nother comments contained the same theme--that the H-2A workers should be permitted to perform any duty at the \nranch, including some activities that would constitute herding or the production of livestock and some that would \nnot. For example, the John Espil Sheep Company comment noted that the livestock workers spend time at the \nranch when weaning the calves before they are sold, and that feeding the calves may only take a couple of hours a \nday. Therefore, they also may perform other duties such as: repairing corrals or the feedlot fence; cleaning the \nshop, the bunkhouse and the tack room; and harvesting hay for winter feed. The company stated that this is all part \nof livestock production, and that keeping track of their time hourly or daily would be extremely difficult or impossible, \nboth on the range and at the ranch, because every day is different. Similarly, another sheep rancher, Katie Day, \ncommented that the workers irrigate pastures, harvest livestock feeds, maintain fences, clean corrals, doctor sheep \nand feed them, and it would be ``absurd'' to limit how long a job can be performed or to require recordkeeping for \nthe incidental work. Finally, the Garfield County Farm Bureau similarly stated that ``[w]hat is defined as incidental \nwork is vital to the day- to-day operations of their ranches. Without the upkeep of fences, pasture irrigation, \nmitigation of noxious weeds and production of livestock feed, their operations cannot exist. As ranchers, they must \nbe able to perform whatever job needs done at any given time and would expect their employees to do the same. . \n. In short, there is no such thing as incidental work on a livestock ranch.'' Many employer commenters seemed to \nobject to the 20 percent cap on directly and closely related duties while at the ranch based, at least in part, upon \ntheir concerns regarding the associated recordkeeping requirements and, in some cases, a misunderstanding of \nthose requirements. Those specific concerns are addressed in Sec. IV.B.2. of the preamble related to the \nrecordkeeping provision in Sec. 655.210(f). Numerous employer commenters and their representatives, including \nAmerican Sheep Industry Association (ASI), Mountain Plains and Western Range, California Wool Growers \nAssociation, Colorado Wool Growers Association, Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association, Vermillion Ranch and \nMidland Livestock Company, and John Espil Sheep Company, suggested that the Department adopt a much \nbroader definition of permissible sheepherder duties. They generally labeled their preferred definition as the \n``Grazing Livestock Management System.'' That definition permits ``the utilization of herbage or forage on a piece \nof land via grazing or supplementation'' and turns inputs into goods (protein, wool, etc.) through practices that: \ninclude but are not limited to: animal husbandry, temporary fencing, permanent fencing, management of urban \ninterface, transport of water for animal use, use of structures and corrals to facilitate production practices, \nassistance with production of feed sources for animals being cared for, assistance with repair and maintenance of \nequipment and facilities used in production practices, trailing livestock and/or assistance in loading and unloading \nanimals into livestock trucks for movement. Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that this definition would \nmake clear that feedlots and similar operations are not covered, while focusing on the critical component of the job--\nthe grazing of livestock. In a joint comment, Vermillion Ranch and Midland Livestock Company (Vermillion and \nMidland) stated that it would be ``general enough to encompass multiple open range occupations without creating \narbitrary line-drawing that is impossible to follow.'' They opined that this definition and the FLSA regulatory \ndefinitions would be ``sufficient to protect the integrity of the special procedure regulations'' while not replacing \nestablished occupational practices. The Wyoming Wool Growers Association stated that this definition would reflect \nthat herding goes beyond just controlling animal movement and includes animal care and husbandry and natural \nresource management. The Association commented that the suggested definition of sheepherder duties recognizes \n\n\n\nthe totality of the process. Finally, the California Wool Growers Association stated that this definition would ``more \naccurately [[Page 62968]] reflect current industry practices and requirements.'' In contrast to most employer \ncommenters, Billie Siddoway, on behalf of the Siddoway Sheep Company, submitted a detailed description of the \nspecific activities performed during various months of the year and did not object to the proposed 20 percent cap. \nBillie Siddoway stated that if an employee undertakes minor, sporadic or incidental work outside the definition of \nherding, such as by performing tasks as erecting temporary pens and corrals in anticipation of the lambing season, \nthe employer could track those hours and job duties in order to allow the Department to evaluate compliance with \nthe 20 percent rule. Billie Siddoway requested clarification that the 20 percent limitation applies only to work \nperformed on the ranch (so that, for example, if a pair of workers divide up their chores on the range with one \nprimarily responsible for tending the sheep and the other primarily responsible for caring for the camp and the dogs \nand horses, there is no need to evaluate that range time). In further contrast to the vast majority of the employer \ncomments, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment agreed that the definitions of the terms ``herding'' and \n``livestock'' are accurate, but stated with respect to the proposed definition of ``minor, sporadic, and incidental work'' \nthat the 20 percent rule ``is a critically important element of the proposed rule.'' They emphasized that sheep \nherders have alleged in litigation that they often are assigned work outside the permissible duties and spend \nsignificant time performing duties such as irrigating fields, harvesting crops, and maintaining ranch buildings, \nvehicles, and equipment. Nonetheless, the workers have been paid the monthly wage required under the TEGL \nrather than the higher hourly AEWR, which could lead to displacement of domestic workers employed as ranch \nhands. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment requested that the Department give more examples of work that \nwould be minor, sporadic and incidental (repairing a fence or corral) as well as examples of work that falls outside \nthe permissible job duties (e.g., constructing fences or corrals, reseeding, haying, operating and repairing heavy \nequipment, and constructing dams, wells, and irrigation ditches). They further suggested that the Department \nexpressly prohibit such other work. As noted, the suggestions related to recordkeeping are discussed in Sec. \nIV.B.2. of the preamble with regard to Sec. 655.210(f). iii. Discussion The NPRM recognized that employers using \nthese procedures to hire workers for the range production of livestock may, at times, require the workers to bring \nthe herd to the ranch or farm for certain periods to perform work that constitutes the production of livestock, such as \nlambing or calving, shearing, branding, culling livestock for sale, or tending to a sick animal. The NPRM further \nrecognized that, during such periods at the ranch, the workers could also perform other work that is closely and \ndirectly related to herding or the production of livestock. The NPRM proposed to limit to 20 percent the number of \nranch days that could be spent performing such directly and closely related work, and it required that the other \ndirectly and closely related ranch duties be included in the job order. See 80 FR at 20303. The purpose of including \nthe proposed 20 percent cap was to require that workers being paid the herding and range livestock wage not be \nused as general ranch hands, who are entitled to the standard H-2A hourly AEWR for all hours worked, because \nthese provisions are only intended for workers who attend the herd as it grazes on the range. 80 FR at 20301. The \nDepartment determined that some limit on the scope of duties such workers could perform was essential because, \nin the course of its investigations, it found that some workers are stationed at the ranch for extended portions, if not \nall, of the job order and are performing general ranch hand work rather than work closely and directly related to the \nrange production of livestock. Therefore, the NPRM identified tilling the soil for hay and constructing an irrigation \nditch as examples of work not closely and directly related to herding or the production of livestock. The inspection \nand repair of the corral was given as an example of work that is closely and directly related. 80 FR at 20303, \n20306. After considering all the comments received, we have decided to remove the 20 percent limitation on the \nnumber of ranch days that can be spent on work that is closely and directly related to herding or the production of \nlivestock, because such work is inextricably linked with those primary tasks. Where such work is, indeed, closely \nand directly related, it comprises an essential part of the work that employees who are engaged in herding and the \nproduction of livestock perform. Further, allowing workers to perform work that is closely and directly related to \nherding and the production of livestock on only one out of every five days at the ranch unnecessarily limits the \nranchers' flexibility in dividing tasks among their H-2A workers. For example, herders may be at the ranch for two \nmonths during birthing season. During that time, the workers may remain responsible for caring for the dogs they \nuse on the range to help herd and guard the sheep or goats; they also may remain responsible for the care of the \nhorses they use on the range to pull their camps or to assist with herding. The proposed 20 percent cap on the \nnumber of ranch days that a worker could perform such closely and directly related work would have required the \nemployer to divide the animal care sequentially among five herders, so no one worker performed it more than 20 \n\n\n\npercent of the days. The employer would have violated the cap if it instead had required that one herder do the \nanimal care every day, even if the task only took one or two hours to perform. Smaller ranchers with fewer than five \nH-2A workers would have found it very difficult to comply with the proposed limitation on the percentage of days \nsuch work can be performed at the ranch. When the work is closely and directly related to herding or the production \nof livestock, there is no need to limit its performance in this way. Therefore, we are including closely and directly \nrelated work within the definition of the production of livestock, which provides employers with sufficient flexibility to \nassign appropriate tasks to workers when they are not on the range. The Final Rule makes conforming changes to \ndelete references to the 20 percent cap in Sec. Sec. 655.200(b)(1) and (2), 655.210(b), and 655.230(d). However, \nwe continue to conclude that it is inappropriate to provide employers with the unlimited latitude that some requested \nby allowing them to require workers employed pursuant to these rules to perform any ranch duties that are \nnecessary to meet the day-to-day needs that arise in ranch operations. Accordingly, the Final Rule does not adopt \nthe revised Grazing Livestock Management System definition of permissible duties, as recommended by a number \nof employers and their representatives. That definition is overly broad and vague, with undefined terms, such as \n``management of urban interface,'' which make it unsuitable for the Final Rule. That definition would allow ranchers \nvirtually unfettered discretion to assign workers any duties, unrelated to herding and the production of livestock, \nparticularly because it states that the permissible duties ``include, but are not limited to'' the listed tasks. More \nspecifically, under [[Page 62969]] that definition, workers could perform additional tasks such as assisting with the \nproduction of feed sources for animals being cared for, which could include planting crops like hay or alfalfa, \nirrigating the crops, applying pesticides to the crops, harvesting the crops, and drying and storing the crops. That \ndefinition also would allow workers to assist with the repair and maintenance of any equipment and facilities used \nin production practices, which could include work repairing a harvesting machine or maintaining a grain silo. The \nDepartment concludes that allowing such general ranch hand work to be performed by herding and range livestock \nworkers, rather than by corresponding U.S. ranch hand workers who would earn the standard hourly AEWR, \nwould have an adverse effect on U.S. workers similarly employed. For similar reasons, the Department also is not \nadopting the FLSA's regulatory definition, as some commenters suggested. The FLSA regulation, 29 CFR 780.325, \nis tied to the FLSA's statutory language, which exempts an employee ``principally engaged'' in the range production \nof livestock. Therefore, that regulation allows a tolerance for non-herding work so long as it is less than 50 percent \nof the work hours. However, such a tolerance would be overbroad in the context of these H-2A rules, which create a \nspecial exception from the standard H- 2A wage requirements. Therefore, in order to fulfill our original purpose of \nproviding that workers employed pursuant to the herding and range livestock regulations are not working as \ngeneral ranch hands when they are not on the range, and to provide the requested guidance and clarity to both \nworkers and the regulated community, the Final Rule includes several additional examples both of duties that \nqualify as directly and closely related to the production of livestock and duties that do not qualify. The Final Rule \nidentifies the following as examples of work on the ranch that is closely and directly related: repairing fences used \nto contain the herd; assembling lambing jugs; cleaning out lambing jugs; feeding and caring for the dogs that the \nworkers use on the range to assist with herding or guarding the flock; feeding and caring for the horses that the \nworkers use on the range to help with herding or to move the sheep camps and supplies; and loading animals into \nlivestock trucks for movement to the range or to market. Furthermore, we note that many of the duties that the \ncommenters stated should be permissible (caring for sick animals at the ranch, providing supplemental feed, and \nassisting with lambing) already are included within the definition of the production of livestock. The Final Rule \nidentifies the following as work that is not closely and directly related: Working at feedlots; planting, irrigating and \nharvesting crops; operating or repairing heavy equipment; constructing wells or dams; digging irrigation ditches; \napplying weed control; cutting trees or chopping wood; constructing or repairing the bunkhouse or other ranch \nbuildings; and delivering supplies from the ranch to the herders on the range. Several of these examples are taken \nfrom the FLSA regulations implementing the exemption for the range production of livestock, which a number of \ncommenters identified as a model for this rule. See 29 CFR 780.325(b), 780.327, 780.329(c). Further, the Final \nRule provides employers adequate flexibility in the use of H-2A workers, while still requiring that the work be \nagricultural and herd-related in nature. Thus, although workers employed pursuant to the herding and range \nlivestock provisions may not engage in work that falls outside the scope of these rules, the Department does not \nintend to debar an employer who in good faith has H-2A workers perform an insubstantial amount of herding work \nnot listed in the Application. In exercising our enforcement discretion when an employer has had an H-2A worker \nperform work outside the scope of the activities listed on the job order due to unplanned and uncontrollable events, \n\n\n\nthe Department will consider the employer's explanation, so long as the activities are within the scope of H-2A \nagriculture, have been occasional or sporadic, and the time spent in total is not substantial. Moreover, the \ndebarment regulations require that the violation be substantial, and that a number of factors must be considered in \nmaking that determination, including: An employer's previous history of violations; the number of workers affected; \nthe gravity of the violation; the employer's explanation, if any; its good faith; and its commitment to future \ncompliance. Under these criteria, the good faith assignment of a worker to work not listed in the Application for a \nsmall amount of time would not result in debarment. The Department concludes that this improved clarity of the \nscope of the rules for herding and range livestock workers will lead to improved compliance and more effective \nenforcement by the Wage and Hour Division. As we explained in the NPRM, 80 FR at 20303, where employers \nviolate this limitation on duties, they may owe back wages and DOL may seek other relief depending upon the \nprecise nature of the violation. b. Definitions of Livestock and Range Housing i. Livestock Livestock is not defined in \nthe TEGLs. The NPRM defined livestock as ``[a]n animal species or species group such as sheep, cattle, goats, \nhorses, or other domestic hooved animals. In the context of this subpart, livestock refers to those species raised on \nthe open range.'' 80 FR at 20339. As explained in the NPRM, the proposed definition of livestock described the type \nof animals, when managed on the range, covered by these rules. 80 FR at 20303-04. As mentioned above, \nMountain Plains and Western Range suggested replacing all of the definitions with a ``grazing livestock production \nsystem'' definition, but this would not address the type of animals covered by these rules. The Worker Advocates' \nJoint Comment agreed that the definition of the term livestock is accurate. Because the Department received no \ncomments opposing the proposed definition of livestock or otherwise suggesting modification, the Final Rule retains \nthe proposed text without any modification. ii. Range Housing\\12\\ ------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------- \\12\\ As noted in Sec. IV.E. of the preamble, and for the reasons discussed there, we have discontinued the \nuse of the phrase, ``mobile housing,'' and instead refer to housing on the range as ``range housing.'' --------------------\n------------------------------------------------------- The TEGLs set standards for, but do not define, range housing. The \nNPRM defined ``mobile housing'' as ``[h]ousing meeting the standards articulated under Sec. 655.235 that can be \nmoved from one area to another area on the open range'' and explained that this definition ``focuses on the \nmovable nature of the housing used on the open range and specifies the provision in the regulation that sets forth \nthe standards such housing must meet.'' 80 FR at 20304. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment agreed with the \nNPRM definition of range housing. While the Department received comments regarding the standards for such \nhousing and SWA inspection requirements, those comments are discussed in Sec. IV.E. of the preamble related to \nSec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235. Because we received no comments opposing the definition of range housing or \notherwise suggesting modification, the Final Rule reflects the definition proposed in the NPRM, with two \nmodifications. First, we now refer to housing on the range as ``range [[Page 62970]] housing'' rather than ``mobile \nhousing,'' as discussed further below in Sec. IV.E. Second, for the same reasons, we have deleted the requirement \nthat the housing must be capable of moving from one area to another. c. Definition of Range i. Background The \nTEGL for sheep and goat herding provides that the special procedures were established in recognition of the \nunique characteristics of sheepherding, which requires ``spending extended periods of time grazing herds of sheep \nin isolated mountainous terrain; being on call to protect flocks from predators 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.'' \nTEGL 32-10, ]3. The TEGL provides that the SWA may rely on a standard job description of the duties to be \nperformed and this description refers to ``sheep and/or goat flock grazing on range or pasture,'' but the terms \n``range'' and ``pasture'' are not further defined. Id. at Attachment A, I(C)(1). The TEGL for the open range \nproduction of livestock procedures similarly were established in recognition of the ``unique characteristics of the \nopen range production of livestock.'' TEGL 15- 06, Change 1, ]3. The SWA may rely on a standard description of \nthe job duties for a job opportunity in the open range livestock production industry, which refers to tasks performed \n``on the open range'' and states that the workers also must ``occasionally live and work independently or in small \ngroups of workers in isolated areas for extended periods of time.'' Id. at Attachment A, I(C)(1). No definition of \n``open range'' is included in the TEGL. The NPRM defined open range as ``[u]nenclosed public or private land \noutside of cities and towns in which sheep, cattle, goats, horses, or other domestic hooved animals, by ownership, \ncustom, license, lease, or permit, are allowed to graze and roam. Animals are not meaningfully enclosed where \nthere are no fences or other barriers protecting them from predators or restricting their freedom of movement; rather \na worker must actively herd the animals and direct their movement. Open range may include intermittent fencing or \nbarriers to prevent or discourage animals from entering a particularly dangerous area. These types of barriers \nprevent access to dangers rather than containing the animals, and therefore supplement rather than replace the \n\n\n\nworker's efforts.'' 80 FR at 20339. The Department specifically sought comment on whether the definition of open \nrange should include a minimum acreage of the land on which the animals roam; under what circumstances (e.g., \nstate requirements related to the ``open range'') the regulation may take into account barriers, fences, or other \nenclosures on this same land; and other factors that should be considered in the definition of open range. 80 FR at \n20304. The Final Rule removes the qualifier ``open'' and revises the proposed definition, using a multi-factor test \nbased on a modified version of the definition of ``range'' used in the FLSA range production of livestock exemption. \nIt sets forth the following factors that indicate the range: The land is uncultivated; it involves wide expanses of land, \nsuch as thousands of acres; it is located in remote, isolated areas; and range housing is typically required so that \nthe herder can be close to the herd to fulfill the requirement to be constantly ready to attend to the herd. No one \nfactor is controlling and the totality of the circumstances is determinative. The definition also specifies what is not \nconsidered range--specifically, that the range does not include feedlots, corrals, or any area where the stock would \nbe near headquarters. The term also does not include any other areas where a herder is not required to constantly \nbe available to attend to the livestock to perform tasks such as ensuring they do not stray off, protecting them from \npredators, and monitoring their health. ii. Comments The Department received a substantial number of comments \naddressing the proposed definition of open range. The comments addressed a number of issues, including: Fencing \non the range; the changing nature of the landscape of the West and the feed used for sheep, including crop \nstubble; the necessity of herders regardless of fences and barriers; ``open range'' state laws; and the definition of \n``range'' used in the FLSA range production exemption. The comments are addressed below according to the \nquestions presented in the NPRM: (a) Whether the definition of open range should include a minimum acreage of \nthe land on which the animals roam; (b) under what circumstances (i.e., state requirements related to the ``open \nrange'') the regulation may take into account barriers, fences, or other enclosures on this same land; and (c) other \nfactors that should be considered in the definition of open range. 80 FR at 20304. (1) Comments on Minimum \nAcreage The NPRM requested comments on whether the definition of open range should include a minimum \nacreage of land. Mountain Plains and Western Range, along with a handful of other commenters, opposed a \nminimum acreage test. Mountain Plains and Western Range reasoned that an employer may not be aware of the \nacreage. Commenter Billie Siddoway supported modifying the definition to include ``remote areas more than fifty \nmiles from the base ranch that require delivery of water by truck.'' (2) Comments on Barriers, Fences, or Enclosures \nMany commenters explained that livestock grazing varies substantially among operations, depending on the \nparticular ranch owner and/or the geographic location. As indicated by the SBA Office of Advocacy, the practice of \nherding has changed since the 1950s and herders must graze on lands that are less ``open.'' Diamond Sheep \nCompany explained that urban sprawl has changed herding patterns, as well as the availability and type of food \nconsumed by sheep. Because the West is no longer an open area, sheepherding in its modern form has changed; \naccording to the Idaho Wool Growers Association and other commenters, it increasingly includes ``a mix of native \ngrass on federal, state and/or private leases, hay and alfalfa grazing, crop aftermath grazing, feeding under power \nlines and in vineyards and even small parcels in residential areas for fuel load management.'' The comments almost \nunanimously opposed using fencing as a defining factor for ``open range.'' Commenters indicated that the \nprohibition on fencing was one of the two most problematic aspects of the NPRM. The comments explained that \nfencing is common on the range; Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that there is ``no such place'' that \ncontains such unenclosed land as the Department had described in the NPRM. Stephany Wilkes stated that the \nidea that grazing only takes place away from fences is ``unrealistic, magical thinking.'' Mountain Plains conducted a \nsurvey of its members and of the 140 employer-members who responded, 45 percent of respondents indicated that \ntheir operation would not qualify as ``open range'' according to the definition in the NPRM. The opposition can \ngenerally be described as deriving from the realities of the modern landscape in the West where fences appear for \nmany reasons, including on federal land managed by the Forest Service and the BLM, as well as the proposition \nthat sheepherding requires a herder to be present regardless of whether the area has [[Page 62971]] fencing. \nNumerous ranchers explained that fences are necessary for a variety of reasons, including to mark boundaries, \nseparate plant or animal species, protect crops or property, keep sheep from eating poisonous plants, manage \ngrazing, protect animals from predators and keep them safe from traffic on public roads. They also stated fences \nare used for rangeland improvement, riparian or riverbank zones protection, and sustainability of rangelands. The \nemployer comments indicated that fencing may be used on both small and large acreages; the size of fenced land \nvaries, and sheep may be within fences but within thousands of acres of private land. For example, Etchart \nLivestock, Inc. stated that its private pasture is fenced and varies in size from 4 acres to 4,000 acres. The \n\n\n\nWashington State Sheep Producers described large bands of sheep that are herded on unfenced open range from \nearly spring to fall and are also herded across 500+ acre rangelands that are fenced for cattle containment, not \nsheep containment. Rangeland described by D.A. Harral was fenced around the exterior and broken up into 2,000 \nto 10,000 acre tracts of semi- arid land. A common theme throughout the comments submitted by ranchers and \ntheir associations was that fencing does not replace the need for herders. Julie Hansmire expressed the view that \nregardless of whether a fence is a quarter of a mile from the sheep or 20 miles, a herder is still required. As \nexplained in the comments, if a fenced area is very large, a herder may keep the sheep in a manageable area, and \na herder also keeps the animals moving to graze on different areas for controlled grazing. For example, Hansen \nRanch pointed out that its sheep are grazed on Forest Service land to control the noxious weed ``Leafy Spurge,'' \nand the sheep herders are needed to keep the sheep grazing on this weed within a fenced area. Many \ncommenters, such as John Parker and the Washington State Sheep Producers, pointed out that sheep cannot be \nleft alone on the range because they may stray from the band of sheep and become lost, or be attacked by \npredators. Commenters also noted they used temporary fencing as well. The employer commenters expressed \nparticular concern about predators, explaining that sheep herders are critical to protecting sheep from attack \nregardless of whether the sheep are in a fenced area. As Pauline Inchauspe described, ``[c]oyotes and mountain \nlions are a constant threat and though the herders are equipped with livestock guardian dogs, there is no substitute \nfor the watchful eye of a sheepherder. Their 24 hour presence is a necessity . . . throughout the entire year.'' For \nexample, Detton Fawcett put a herd on private ground with fences and lost 40 percent of his herd over the summer; \non another piece of land he lost multiple lambs (stating that losing 50 or more lambs in three weeks is common). \nYet, with a herder present, Mr. Fawcett stated that he only loses approximately five percent of the herd. \nCommenters also pointed out that the term ``open range'' refers to state laws that require property owners to build \nand maintain fences sufficient to keep livestock off their property. For example, William Ashby Maltsberger, a Texas \nrancher, submitted information on the Texas livestock laws explaining this concept. He pointed out that the NPRM \ndefinition of open range would prevent range producers of livestock, who are required by Texas open range law to \nfence their properties, from using the special procedures. Similarly, Tom Thompson explained that ``[o]ur \nunderstanding of open range is that if you want to keep other people's livestock off your property you have to put up \nfences, making fences required in areas where there are other ranchers.'' (3) Comments on Other Factors That \nShould Be Considered in the Definition of Range (a) The FLSA Range Production Exemption Both industry and \nworker advocates suggested using the FLSA range production of livestock exemption definitions in some form for \nthe purposes of the H-2A rule, some suggesting adopting them in full and some emphasizing different portions. \nMountain Plains and Western Range and the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment generally encouraged the \nDepartment to align the definition of ``range'' with the FLSA regulations, as discussed further below. The FLSA \nrange production of livestock exemption regulation defines the term ``range'' at 29 CFR 780.326(a) and (b). That \nregulation describes the range generally as land that is not cultivated and typically is not suitable for cultivation \nbecause it is rocky, thin, semiarid, or otherwise poor. It is land that produces native forage for animal consumption, \nand it includes land that is revegetated naturally or artificially to provide a forage cover that is managed like range \nvegetation. The range need not be open. The regulation provides that many acres of range land are required to \ngraze one animal unit (five sheep or one cow) for 1 month; therefore, by its nature, the range production of livestock \nis most typically conducted over wide expanses of land, such as thousands of acres. The FLSA regulation at 29 \nCFR 780.329 provides that an employee is exempt if his primary duty is the range production of livestock and that \nthis duty necessitates his constant attendance on the range, on a standby basis, for such periods of time so as to \nmake the computation of hours worked extremely difficult. The fact that an employee generally returns to his place \nof residence at the end of each day does not affect the application of the exemption. However, exempt work must \nbe performed away from the headquarters, which is the place for the transaction of the business of the ranch; the \nheadquarters does not include large acreage, but only the ranchhouse, barns, sheds, pen, bunkhouse, cookhouse, \nand other buildings in the vicinity. The FLSA exemption does not apply to feed lots or to any area where the stock \ninvolved would be near headquarters. Rather, it applies only to those employees principally engaged in activities \nrequiring constant attendance on a standby basis, away from headquarters, such as herding, where the \ncomputation of hours worked would be extremely difficult. Although Mountain Plains and Western Range indicated \na preference for eliminating an independent definition of range altogether and instead using the alternative ``grazing \nlivestock production system,'' (discussed more fully above with regard to the ``production of livestock'' definition) \nthey alternatively recommended replacing the definition of open range in the NPRM with the FLSA definition of \n\n\n\nrange. Specifically, Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that the use of the phrase ``range'' as defined in the \nFLSA is a better fit than ``open range,'' as nothing is truly ``open'' land anymore. The Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment emphasized that the rule should specify that the land must be uncultivated so that the H-2A procedures \nfor sheep herders are not more encompassing than the FLSA definition. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment \nalso supported using a worker's proximity to the ranch as an indication of whether the work is on the open range. \nTheir comment stated that ``ranch or farm signifies a place where crops are cultivated or where livestock are \nenclosed. Proximity to a location where livestock must be enclosed or where land is cultivated is an indication that \nsuch a place is not the open range.'' They suggested a slight modification to the FLSA definition, stating that work \n[[Page 62972]] activity performed ``near a ranch or farm used by the employer'' is not done on the range. Other \ncomments echoed similar elements about the topography of range or rangeland, which are factors found in the \nFLSA definition. For example, Lyle McNeal stated that range has native forages of grasses, forbs, and shrubs and \nthat ``range is also defined as uncultivated land, including forest land, which produces forage suitable for livestock \ngrazing.'' However, this rancher also noted that herders are needed on other types of land. McNeal further \nexplained that the term ``improved range'' involves ``reseeding and replacing the native range plants with a specific \nimproved forage plant, i.e., crested wheat grass, forage kochia, etc. Improved range might also refer to water \ndevelopments, springs, or wells, including reservoirs or guzzlers.'' Similarly, according to the sources attached to \nthe comment submitted by Vermillion and Midland, ``rangeland'' is defined as ```land on which the native vegetation \n(climax of natural potential) is predominantly grasses, grass-like plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing or \nbrowsing and present in sufficient quantity to justify sufficient grazing or browsing use,' [including] non-native \nvegetation which was either planted for reclamation purposes or has since invaded the rangeland.'' ``Range'' is \ndefined by these sources as ``an open region over which animals (as livestock) may roam and feed.'' (b) Crop \nResidue and Stubble The ASI represented that 46 percent of their sheep spend part of the year on federal grazing \npermits or allotments, but noted that the availability of federal grazing land is on the decline and private grass, \nsupplemental hay, and crop aftermath are the other available grazing options. The Idaho Wool Growers Association \nidentified the primary times crop residue or stored crops (baled hay and corn) are used for feed is during the fall \nwhen the sheep are coming down off the mountain, in the winter when native food cannot be found, and in times of \ndrought. The Washington State Sheep Producers indicated that the sheep graze for part of the year on crop \naftermath in irrigated crop circles of 100-150 acres in size, and that herders are necessary to move the sheep \namong the crop circles. The Wyoming Livestock Board stated that ``[m]any producers graze also on crop residue, \nprivate leases, vineyards and other parcels near fixed ranch sites and populated areas'' and that these areas still \nrequire managed herding. Eph Jenson Livestock explained that they have been desperate to find feed for the sheep \nand that allowing sheep to feed on crop residue is an economical means of clearing the field for the farmer. \nCunningham Sheep Company stated that crop residue grazing is healthy for the sheep and the agricultural \neconomy because it allows producers to remove residue without burning or using another destruction method. The \ndistance crop residue grazing takes place from the ranch, and from urban areas, may vary by operation and by \ngeographic location. For example, numerous commenters, including the Utah Farm Bureau Association, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau and the Sublette County Conservation District, noted that sheep are used for fire prevention \nclose to urban areas, especially in California. Comments indicated that California's sheep industry relies on crop \nresidue grazing near urban areas anywhere from 6 months a year (Roswell Wool) to year-round (California Wool \nGrowers Association). Elgorria Livestock characterized grazing on crop residue as a ``large part'' of the production \ncycle in California. (c) Mobile Housing Although not directly discussing the definition of ``range,'' many commenters, \nsuch as the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, noted that mobile housing is necessary for range work because it \nenables the herder to remain with the herd. As the Colorado Wool Growers Association explained, mobile housing \nis necessary because ``livestock is often grazed far from the nearest town, or the ranch headquarters. It would be \nillegal to build fixed housing on U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management grazing allotments, as well as \nnumerous other locations that livestock are grazing. It is not feasible to drive herders back and forth to work every \nday, leaving sheep unattended and vulnerable to predator attacks, straying too far from water sources, or being \nexposed to poisonous plants. While a lot of predator attacks happen at night, it is not unusual for predators to attack \nin broad daylight. This is why there has been the historic recognition of the necessity for mobile housing to keep \nherders near the sheep.'' However, the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation noted that many livestock workers do \nnot need mobile housing for even 50 percent of the workdays in a contract. Further, as explained by Mountain \nPlains and Western Range, there are a limited number of employers who use stationary bunkhouses on the range \n\n\n\nrather than mobile housing at points throughout the ``vast areas of land'' where cattle are grazing, particularly in \nMontana and Texas. Finally, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment indicated that requiring the use of mobile \nhousing would have the unintended effect of inducing employers to house workers in mobile housing when fixed \nsite housing is available; they stated that the nature and location of work should be the focus instead. iii. Discussion \nBased on the comments received, it is apparent that herding practices have evolved significantly over the last 50 \nyears and the proposed definition of ``open range'' in the NPRM did not reflect these changes. The Final Rule, \ntherefore, adopts a multi-factor test for defining what constitutes the ``range.'' As explained below, the Final Rule's \ndefinition allows more flexibility than the NPRM and offers more guidance than the TEGLs by drawing on the FLSA \nregulatory definition suggested by many commenters as a starting point. The definition maintains a nexus to the \nlongstanding purpose of the special procedures, to provide that herders can be available to tend to the flock in \nremote locations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In response to the information received in the comments, the \nDepartment will no longer use the term ``open range,'' will not use a set minimum number of acres in the definition \nof range, and will not use fencing as a defining feature of the range. We will, however, continue to consider the \nnumber of acres as a relevant factor in the determination of range. We address these considerations below. First, \nthe definition of ``open range'' in state law has limited use for the purposes of determining special procedures for \nherders, and the use of the term ``open range'' in these rules may cause unnecessary confusion in ``open range'' \nstates. Therefore, as a result of the concerns raised by commenters, the Department no longer uses the NRPM \nphrase ``open range,'' and instead the Final Rule defines ``range.'' Second, in response to comments, the \nDepartment has not included a minimum number of acres in the definition of range. However, the amount of \nacreage is relevant as a factor in determining whether the area is considered the range, as discussed further below. \nThird, the Department understands and appreciates the serious concern raised by commenters regarding the use of \nfencing as a proxy for open range as proposed. The comments demonstrate that using the NPRM definition is \nuntenable for many ranchers due to the [[Page 62973]] extensive presence of fencing across many of the lands \nused for grazing, including the fencing present on BLM and Forest Service lands. Therefore, the Department is \neliminating fencing as an indicator of range. For similar reasons the Department also declines to adopt a test using \nthe ``enclosure of livestock'' as the indicator of range, or, as proposed by the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment, \nas an indicator of ranch. Rather, based on the comments, when assessing whether the work takes place on the \nrange or off of the range, the Department will consider the following factors that indicate the range: The land is \nuncultivated; it involves wide expanses of land, such as thousands of acres; it is located in remote, isolated areas; \nand range housing is typically required so that the herder can be close to the herd to fulfill the requirement to be \nconstantly ready to attend to the herd. No one factor is controlling and the totality of the circumstances is \ndeterminative. The question of whether any area on the ranch (beyond the headquarters, discussed below) is \nconsidered on the range, and therefore counts toward the 50 percent threshold requirement, or off of the range \nmust be determined by looking at the factors established in this Final Rule. It is worth noting that when we use the \nterm ``ranch'' as distinguished from the ``range'' in this Final Rule, we are referring to that portion of the ranch that \ndoes not qualify as range after analyzing it under the multi-factor test. The range specifically does not include \nfeedlots, corrals, or any area where the stock would be near headquarters, which is consistent with the FLSA range \nproduction of livestock exemption. The term also does not include any other areas where a herder is not required to \nconstantly be available to attend to the livestock to perform tasks such as ensuring they do not stray off, protecting \nthem from predators, and monitoring their health. The work must be performed away from the headquarters used \nby the employer to qualify as range work. The term ``ranch'' is distinct from the term ``headquarters.'' The term \nheadquarters is limited and does not embrace large acreage. The headquarters is the place where the business of \nthe ranch occurs and is often where the owner resides. The term headquarters only includes the ranchhouse, \nbarns, sheds, pen, bunkhouse, cookhouse, and other buildings in the vicinity, meaning that anything beyond this \nimmediate area is not considered the headquarters. Any work performed at or near the headquarters would not \nqualify as work on the range for purposes of the requirement for herders to spend more than 50 percent of their \ntime on the range. The Department maintains the requirement that the work must be done away from the \nheadquarters in order to preserve the longstanding purpose of the special procedures--that the unique occupational \ncharacteristics require workers to spend extended periods of time in isolated, mountainous, remote areas to be \navailable to attend to the herd's needs on a 24/7 basis, making tracking of the hours worked exceedingly difficult. \nThis situation does not exist when workers are stationed, for example, in a cultivated field near the headquarters \nwhere hours could be easily tracked (and where U.S. workers may be more interested in working). This \n\n\n\nfundamental historical purpose of the special procedures, and DOL's statutory obligation to certify that there are not \nsufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, and qualified to perform herding jobs on the range, require the \nDepartment to maintain geographic parameters for range work. For this reason the Department cannot allow for use \nof the Mountain Plains and Western Range definition of ``grazing livestock production system,'' because it does not \naccount for the location where the work occurs. Although the FLSA definition of range provides a useful starting \npoint, the Final Rule does not fully adopt the FLSA definition of range in three key respects. First, for the reasons \nidentified by the Colorado Wool Growers Association and other commenters, range housing typically is necessary \nfor the workers covered under this Rule. The Final Rule contemplates that range housing is almost always a \nrequirement of range work because the workers must be on call 24 hours, 7 days a week to tend to the needs of \nthe animals, and range work cannot take place near the headquarters. Housing with the herd and away from the \nheadquarters is therefore essential. However, the Department does not intend to provide an incentive to use range \nhousing when it is not appropriate, as noted by the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment. Further, the Department \nacknowledges the comments received about a small subset of workers who use a series of remote, stationary \nbunkhouses on the range while traveling with the herd, while it is grazing over vast areas of land; this practice \nwould not disqualify their employers from using the these regulations. The second modification from the FLSA \ndefinition is for grazing that occurs on crop residue. Many of the descriptions of the land used for herding submitted \nby commenters would easily fall within the FLSA range production exemption's regulatory definition of the range as \ngenerally uncultivated land and land not suitable for cultivation; however, areas where sheep are grazing on crop \nresidue may not always qualify as ``range'' under the FLSA definition. Therefore, to accommodate the comments \nthat many sheep are feeding on crop residue during certain months of the year, often on leased lands at a distance \nfrom the rancher's property as the herd trails to or from BLM or Forest Service allotments, the Department is \nestablishing the multi-factor test, as well excluding the FLSA regulation's language, ``land that is not suitable for \ncultivation because it is rocky, thin, semiarid, or otherwise poor.'' 29 CFR 780.326(b). Allowing for some work on \ncultivated land, depending on the other factors, is consistent with the purpose of this variance (that the work is \nunique because it is remote and requires 24/7 availability, which makes the hours difficult to calculate) from the \nstandard H-2A rules. The modern reality of herding, which the commenters indicate occurs on crop residue during \ncertain seasons, does not necessarily disqualify herders who are operating remotely from the ranchers. However, \nwe note that the FLSA regulation provides that ``generally'' the land is not cultivated and ``typically'' is not suitable \nfor cultivation; therefore, the deletion of the language is not a significant modification, as the Final Rule still asks \nwhether the land actually is cultivated as an indicator of the range. The Department recognizes that, depending on \nan analysis of the factors, the test established in the Final Rule may in certain cases encompass more land as \n``range'' than under the FLSA, as indicated in the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment. Additionally, in other cases, \nan area considered range under the FLSA may not be considered range under the test set forth in the Final Rule, \ndepending on an analysis of the factors. Third, the Department is intentionally omitting the sentence in the FLSA \nregulation stating that ``[t]he balance of the `headquarters ranch' would be the `range.''' 29 CFR 780.329(b). As \ndiscussed above, determining which portions of the balance of the ranch that is away from headquarters are \nconsidered on the range, and therefore count toward the 50 percent threshold requirement, or off the range will be \nassessed using the multi-factor test set forth in the Final Rule. [[Page 62974]] B. Pre-Filing Procedures The Final \nRule establishes pre-filing procedures for employers seeking workers to engage in sheep, goat and cattle herding \njobs. These provisions assist employers in understanding their pre-filing obligations. 1. Section 655.205--Herding \nand Range Livestock Job Orders The two TEGLs do not provide a variance from the standard rules for Form ETA-\n790 filing time frame or location, with one exception. Therefore, under the TEGLs, the standard Form ETA-790 filing \nrequirements in 20 CFR 655.121(a) through (d) apply, except where an agricultural association submits a Form \nETA-790 for a ``master'' job order (i.e., a Form ETA-790 submitted by agricultural association as a joint employer \nwith its employer-members) for range sheep or goat herder positions. Although, under the TEGLs, all Forms ETA-\n790 for standard H-2A job orders must be submitted to the appropriate SWA no more than 75 calendar days and no \nless than 60 calendar days from the employer's start date of need, the TEGL applicable to sheep and goat herding \nemployment permits a Form ETA-790 for a ``master'' job order for range sheep or goat herder positions to be \nsubmitted directly to the National Processing Center (NPC) once annually. In the NPRM, the Department proposed \nvariances from the job order filing requirements in 20 CFR 655.121(a) through (d) for all range herding and livestock \nproduction job orders. Specifically, the NPRM proposed requiring an eligible employer to submit the, Agricultural \nand Food Processing Clearance Order, Form ETA-790, directly to the NPC, rather than to the SWA. As proposed, \n\n\n\nthe employer would submit the Form ETA-790 to the NPC at the same time it submits its H-2A Application for \nTemporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A, as outlined in 20 CFR 655.130 (as modified by Sec. \n655.215 of the NPRM). Also as proposed, an employer submitting its labor certification application electronically \nusing the iCERT Visa Portal System would be required to scan and upload the Form ETA-790 as well as all other \nsupporting documents. The NPRM addressed the TEGL's ``master'' job order annual Form ETA-790 submission \nallowance, available to associations filing master applications for sheep or goat herding or production occupations, \nin the proposed provision about variances from filing procedures at Sec. 655.215. The Department did not receive \ncomments addressing the job order filing requirements proposed in Sec. 655.205, and we therefore adopt the \nproposed Sec. 655.205, with one minor change. As proposed and adopted, this provision essentially requires that \nall employers, whether filing as an individual, an association, or and H-2A Labor Contractor (H-2ALC), submit Form \nETA-790, directly to NPC together with a completed H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification, \nForm ETA-9142A. As we explained in the NPRM, processing of these applications will be improved if we establish \nconsistent filing requirements for employment of all herders in range herding and livestock production occupations. \nAllowing employers to file the Form ETA-790 with the NPC at the same time as the H-2A Application for Temporary \nEmployment Certification, Form ETA-9142A, as proposed, will streamline the application process for both the filers \nand the agency. The only change we have made to the regulatory text of this provision is the deletion of the phrase \n``as required in Sec. 655.130[,]'' which is a reference to the standard H-2A regulations. We conclude that it is more \nhelpful to the regulated public to substitute, ``as required in Sec. 655.215[,]'' which is a reference to the applicable \nherding and range livestock filing requirements. 2. Section 655.210--Contents of Herding and Range Livestock Job \nOrders Provisions in Sec. 655.210 establish certain content requirements for job orders covering the employment of \nall herders in range herding and livestock production occupations. Section 655.210(a) reminds employers that if a \nrequirement of the standard H-2A regulations is not addressed in the herding and range livestock regulations (such \nas workers' compensation, among other requirements), then employer- applicants must comply with the standard \nregulation. We did not receive any comments from the public on this provision and are adopting it unchanged from \nthe NPRM. a. Section 655.210(b)--Job Qualifications and Requirements Section 655.210(b) establishes the \nstandards associated with job qualifications and requirements included in the job offer. Many of the standards \ncontained in this provision have been addressed above, in Sec.IV.A.2., related to the nature of herding and range \nlivestock jobs, and in Sec. IV.A.3., related to definitions. As a result, for the reasons discussed above in Sec. \nIV.A.2., we are adopting the standard unchanged from the NPRM that the job offer must include a statement that \nthe hours of work are ``on call for up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.'' In addition, for the reasons discussed \nin the same section above (Sec. IV.A.2.), we are clarifying the proposed standard that workers must spend ``at \nleast'' 50 percent of their workdays during the contract period on the range. Instead, under the Final Rule, the job \noffer must reflect that workers spend a majority, meaning more than 50 percent, of the workdays during the \ncontract period on the range. Finally, for the reasons discussed above in Sec. IV.A.3. related to definitions, we have \ndecided to eliminate the 20 percent limitation on the number of ranch days that can be spent on work that is closely \nand directly related to herding or the production of livestock, because such work is inextricably linked with those \nprimary tasks. Where such work is, indeed, closely and directly related, it comprises an essential part of the work \nthat employees who are engaged in herding and the production of livestock perform. The Final Rule requires that all \nsuch duties must be specifically disclosed on the job order. i. Background Apart from the issues discussed in the \nparagraph immediately above and in the prior preamble sections referenced in that paragraph, several issues \nrelated to job qualifications and requirements contained in Sec. 655.210(b), including worker experience \nrequirements, are addressed here. Under the H-2A program generally, including under the TEGLs for sheep and \ngoat herding and the range production of livestock, ``job offers may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or \nobligations that will not be imposed on the employer's H-2A workers.'' 29 CFR 655.122(a). Additionally, each \nqualification and requirement included in the job offer must be ``bona fide and consistent with the normal and \naccepted qualifications'' required by employers not using H- 2A workers for those occupations, and the Certifying \nOfficer or the SWA may require supporting documentation to substantiate the appropriateness of any job \nqualification specified in the job order. 29 CFR 655.122(b). The TEGLs provide additional information regarding \npermissible duties, qualifications and requirements. Both TEGLs mandate that the Forms ETA-790 submitted to the \nSWA provide descriptions of required job duties. TEGL 32-10, Attachment A, I(C)(1); TEGL 15-06, Change 1, \nAttachment A, I(C)(1). The TEGLs provide that any additional job duties ``must be normal [[Page 62975]] and \naccepted for the occupation'' and that the SWA and NPC have the authority to request supporting documentation to \n\n\n\nsubstantiate the appropriateness of any the duties. Id. The TEGLs also provide that, ``due to the unique nature of \nthe work to be performed,'' the job offer may specify that applicants possess up to 6 months of experience in similar \noccupations to sheepherding or the range tending or production of livestock (as appropriate to the specific TEGL) \nand employers may require reference(s) to verify such experience. Id. Applicants must provide the name, address \nand telephone number of any employer used as a reference. Id. Both TEGLs note that the ``appropriateness of any \nother experience requirement must be substantiated by the employer and approved by the Chicago NPC.'' Id. The \nNPRM similarly provided that the ``job offer may also specify that applicants possess up to 6 months of experience \nin similar occupations involving the herding or production of livestock on the open range and require reference(s) for \nthe employer to verify applicant experience.'' 80 FR at 20339. The NPRM further proposed that an employer may \nspecify other appropriate job qualifications and requirements. Id. The preamble to the NPRM explained that these \nqualifications ``could include the ability to ride a horse, use a gun for occupational safety to protect the livestock \nherd from predators, or operate certain motorized vehicles.'' 80 FR at 20304. The NPRM also specified that any \nqualification or requirement listed in the job offer must be bona fide, and that the Certifying Officer may require the \nemployer to submit supporting documentation. 80 FR at 20339-20340. The NPRM further provided that any such \nqualifications or requirements must be applied equally to U.S. and H-2A workers, in order to maintain compliance \nwith the prohibition against preferential treatment of foreign workers under the H-2A program. 80 FR 20304. As \ndiscussed further below, the Final Rule retains these provisions. ii. Comments The Department received very few \ncomments directly addressing these provisions. Mountain Plains and Western Range commented that ``the job \nqualifications continue over from the TEGLs and are essential for identifying and hiring workers who possess the \nrequisite skills for this special work.'' As they explained, ``it would be a disaster'' to send a new worker to the range \nwith a herd only to have that worker decide they do not in fact enjoy the work or they do not know how to care for \nand protect the animals. Vermillion and Midland stated that ``[e]stablished job descriptions and requirements for \nvarious open range livestock occupations should be deemed `bona fide' and `appropriate' under [these provisions] \nand should not be questioned.'' Although not addressing this provision directly, several commenters discussed the \nneed for skilled herders and the length of time needed to become skilled in this work. For example, Rocky Mountain \nSheep Marketing Association commented that their shepherds must be able to manage guard dogs and sheep \ndogs, horses, and, often, pack mules, ``have a thorough grasp of basic veterinary medicine,'' and must have the \n``skills and maturity to protect themselves in remote landscapes,'' in addition to many other skills. They further \ncommented that skilled herding is ``essential for modern range management.'' Peter and Beth Swanson \ncommented that fencing must be done correctly to protect the herd; they stated that herders know what fencing is \nneeded, and how to troubleshoot and correct problems. Mantle Ranch explained that their workers ``know how the \nlivestock is handled and where the livestock belong at any given time'' and they are ``capable of moving, \ncontaining, [and] watching over [the herd] for predatory problems, sickness'' and the general welfare of the animals. \nMantle Ranch further noted that there are many miles of fence and watering facilities that must be ``continually \nmonitored, repaired, and updated.'' Kelly Ingalls, a sheep ranch manager, stated that ``[m]ore animals are saved \nbecause of the [H-2A] herder's experience in healing sick and injured animals.'' John & Carolyn Espil stated that \n``[a] master of sheep husbandry generally has years of experience and an exceptional aptitude for his work.'' The \nTexas Sheep and Goat Raisers' Association similarly commented that it takes years to adequately train a worker, \nand loss of a seasoned employee could set a business back. Hilger Hereford Ranch commented that a herder with \nonly six months of experience may not understand or be experienced in all of the skills needed, as different tasks \nand skills are needed throughout the year. In contrast, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment opposed the \nprovisions allowing employers to require up to six months of experience and references to verify this experience. \nThey stated that ``the experience requirement often serves more as an exclusionary mechanism'' rather than a \n``legitimate job qualification.'' As they explained, ``experience requirements are often used as a barrier to exclude \nU.S. workers who may be qualified but do not have experience working with the particular [animal].'' Additionally, \nthe ```verifiable' experience requirement is an undue burden on U.S. workers, as employers often require an official \nreference on the company letterhead of the former employer.'' As they explained, ``migrant workers often do not \nmaintain records of whom they worked for in the past'' and may not have the names, locations or up-to-date contact \ninformation for those employers. Furthermore, they stated that verifiable experience requirements are not equally \nimposed on H-2A foreign workers. Similarly, Brian Clark commented that requiring six months of experience is \nunnecessary. Mr. Clark stated that three months of experience should be sufficient and that qualified U.S. workers \ncould be found with three months of experience. Additionally, he noted that employers could allow for training in lieu \n\n\n\nof experience. iii. Discussion As set out in the TEGLs, the provision allowing job offers to require up to six months of \nexperience and verifiable references is due to the unique nature of the work to be performed, which often involves \nworking alone for extended periods of time in remote locations where the herder is responsible for the safety of a \nherd, which the comments indicate is typically made up of approximately 1,000 ewes. The comments received on \nthe NPRM demonstrate that these occupations require workers with experience in these jobs and the skills \nnecessary to protect the animals and themselves. As explained in the preamble to the NPRM, these skills may \ninclude the ability to ride a horse, use a gun to protect the herd from predators, or operate certain motorized \nvehicles. As noted by Western Range and Mountain Plains, given the remote and unique nature of the work, it \nwould be untenable to hire a worker with little to no occupational experience, who may decide quickly that this work \nis unsuitable or realize that he or she is unprepared to care for the animals. Additionally, as noted by several \ncommenters, for the safety of the animals and the worker, it is important that workers be able to protect the \nanimals and themselves while on the range. Therefore, the Final Rule retains the provisions from the NPRM \nallowing job offers to specify that applicants must possess up to six months of experience in similar occupations \ninvolving herding or range livestock production, [[Page 62976]] and require reference(s) for the employer to verify \nsuch experience. The Department concludes that ``up to six months'' is a reasonable and appropriate limitation on \nthe experience requirement. The six-month experience requirement is a longstanding requirement from the TEGLs, \nbased on the unique characteristics of these occupations. As demonstrated by the comments, herding and range \nlivestock production involve changing conditions throughout the year depending on grazing location, weather, \npredators, animal health, and other evolving circumstances. As these conditions change, different skills may be \nnecessary, as noted by Hilger Hereford Ranch. For some employers, requiring workers to possess up to six \nmonths of experience in these occupations is reasonable, as a worker with less experience may have only \nencountered certain, limited range conditions and may be unprepared for different grazing locations, predator \nconcerns, and weather conditions. Some commenters noted that it may take years of experience to become a \nskilled herder. The Department concludes that a maximum of six months of experience in similar occupations \ninvolving herding or production of livestock on the range, in light of the changing needs and conditions throughout \nthe year, is a normal and accepted job requirement for these unique occupations to ensure that workers are \nsufficiently experienced in these unique occupations, while preventing unduly burdensome experience requirements \nthat may prevent otherwise qualified U.S. workers from obtaining these positions. However, as underscored by the \nWorker Advocates' Joint Comment, experience and qualifications requirements must be bona fide and equally \nrequired of U.S. and foreign workers. For example, if an employer requires less than six months experience of U.S. \nworkers (for example, three months of experience), at least the same experience requirement must be required of \nforeign applicants. Additionally, while employers may require ``reference(s) for the employer to verify applicant \nexperience,'' such reference requirements must be reasonable and may not be used as a barrier to hiring U.S. \nworkers. Requiring the type of formal, written reference on employer letterhead, as described by the Worker \nAdvocates' Joint Comment, is inappropriate under the Final Rule. Employers who want to verify previous \nemployment must make reasonable efforts to locate and contact the previous employer where an applicant \nprovides basic information such as that required under the TEGLs--the prior employer's name, address and \ntelephone number--or similar information facilitating contact, such as an email address, or social media account. As \nnoted above, any reference requirements for U.S. workers must be no more stringent than those imposed on \nforeign workers. b. Section 655.210(c)--Range Housing i. Background The TEGLs required the inclusion of several \nstatements in a job order about the unique aspects of range herder employment, including housing. The TEGLs set \nforth specific requirements, including an employer's obligation to provide mobile housing for range workers. In the \nNPRM, the Department proposed that the employer disclose in the job order seeking workers for range herding \npositions that mobile housing would be used to satisfy the employer's housing obligation under 20 CFR 655.122(d) \n(requiring an employer to provide sufficient housing to workers, at no cost to the workers, where their work does \nnot allow them to reasonably return to their residence within the same day). As proposed, the job order would state \nthat mobile housing, meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235, would be provided to workers. ii. \nComments and Discussion The Department only received a few comments applicable to this requirement. The \ncomments from Mountain Plains and Western Range discussed the use by some employers of fixed-structures in \nremote areas to temporarily house range workers as they move a herd along its grazing trail. These comments are \naddressed below in connection with section 655.230. As discussed further in Sec. IV.E. with regard to range \nhousing, the Department's use of the term ``mobile housing'' was intended to distinguish between permanent, fixed-\n\n\n\nsite housing subject to the standards in 20 CFR 655.122(d) standards and the temporary housing provided workers \nin different locations, usually in remote areas, as their herds move from one grazing area to another, and does not \nto preclude the use of alternative housing structures for range workers. The Department has modified the \nregulation in the Final Rule to enable an employer to accurately indicate the nature of the housing in the job order. \nThe Department, however, received numerous comments on the use of mobile housing, inspection requirements for \nsuch housing, and minimum standards for the mobile housing, including those relating to heating, lighting, cooking, \nsleeping and personal hygiene while occupying such housing and the provision of food, water, and waste removal \nto workers while using mobile housing. These comments are discussed below in Sec. IV.E. of the preamble in \nconnection with Sec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235. c. Section 655.210(d)--Employer Provided Items i. Background All \nH-2A employers, including employers currently utilizing the TEGLs for sheep, goat and cattle herding, must provide \nto their workers, free of charge, all tools, supplies and equipment required to perform their assigned duties. 20 CFR \n655.122(f). The TEGLs further specify that, due to the remote and unique nature of the work to be performed, \nemployers must ``specify in the job order and provide at no cost to workers an effective means of communicating \nwith persons capable of responding to the worker's needs in case of emergency.'' TEGL 32-10, Attachment A, \nC(4); TEGL 15-06, Change 1, Attachment A, C(4). As recognized by the TEGLs, communication means are \nnecessary to perform the work and can include, but are not limited to, satellite phones, cell phones, wireless \ndevices, radio transmitters, or other types of electronic communication systems. Except for those requirements that \nrelate to mobile housing standards, the TEGLs do not identify any additional tools, supplies or equipment that must \nbe provided by the employer under 20 CFR 655.122(f). The NPRM proposed that employers must provide to \nworkers, without charge, all tools, supplies and equipment that are required by law, the employer, or the nature of \nthe work to perform the job safely and effectively. 80 FR at 20340. The NPRM also proposed that employers must \ndisclose in the job order which items it will provide to the worker. Id. The NPRM preamble explained that the \nrequired tools, supplies, and equipment will depend on a number of factors, such as the terrain, weather, or size of \nthe herd, and provided a number of examples of such items, such as binoculars to monitor the herd, a gun to \nprotect the herd and the herder, boots, rain gear, and a horse. 80 FR at 20305. The NPRM also noted that, as \nprovided in proposed Sec. 655.235 regarding mobile housing standards, protective clothing and bedding may be \nprovided as an alternative to heating equipment in certain conditions, and this alternative [[Page 62977]] bedding \nand clothing is required by the job and must be provided free of charge or deposit charge. Id. The Department \ninvited comments on other tools, supplies and equipment that may be required and whether it would be helpful to \ninclude in the regulation a list of items typically required by law or the nature of the work. The Department also \nproposed requiring employers to provide workers, at no cost, an effective means of communicating with persons \ncapable of responding to worker's needs in case of an emergency. 80 FR at 20304-20305. The NPRM provided \nthe same non-exclusive list of acceptable communication devices as in the TEGLs. 80 FR at 20305. Accordingly, \nthe proposed provisions in Sec. 655.210(d) would require employers to specify in the job order the electronic \ncommunication devices that will be provided to workers. Id. However, the Department also noted that a worker's \nlocation may be so remote that electronic communication devices may not operate effectively at all times. Id. To \naddress this concern, the Department proposed to require that employers arrange for workers to be located in \ngeographic areas where electronic communication devices can operate effectively on a regular basis, unless the \nemployer will make contact in-person with the worker regularly. Id. The Department noted that the definition of \n``regularly'' could vary, but a worker must be able to communicate with the employer at intervals appropriate for \nmonitoring the health and safety of the worker. Id. We explained in the NPRM that such contact is in the best \ninterest of both the employer and the worker in the event that there are problems with the herd, the worker \nsuffered a medical emergency, or the worker's safety is threatened. Id. Last, the proposed provision also would \nrequire employers to include a statement in the job order specifying that it will make contact with the worker in- \nperson or using electronic communication devices regularly. Id. Based on the comments received, which we \ndiscuss below, the Final Rule retains the NPRM provisions requiring employers to provide, free of charge or deposit \ncharge, all required tools, supplies and equipment and to disclose which items will be provided in the job order, but \ndoes not include a list of typically required items in the regulatory text. The Final Rule maintains the requirements \nthat employers must disclose and provide to workers, free of charge or deposit charge, an effective means of \ncommunicating with persons capable of responding to the worker's needs in case of an emergency, including, but \nnot limited to, satellite phones, cell phones, wireless devices, radio transmitters, or other types of electronic \ncommunication systems. The Final Rule also revises Sec. 655.210(d) to address situations in which workers are \n\n\n\nstationed in locations where electronic communication devices will not operate effectively. In such cases, the \nemployers must either make arrangements for workers to be located in geographic areas where electronic \ncommunication devices can operate effectively on a regular basis, or provide for regular, pre-scheduled, in-person \ncontact. The Final Rule also revises job order disclosure provisions to require the employer to specify the means \nand frequency with which the employer plans to make contact with the worker when the workers are stationed in \nlocations where electronic communication devices may not operate effectively. Finally, the Department has divided \nsubsection 655.210(d) in the Final Rule into two paragraphs, the first addressing tools, supplies, and equipment \ngenerally, and the second specifically addressing communication. We will address each topic separately below. ii. \nCommunication Devices (1) Comments The Department received a number of comments about the proposal to \nrequire employers to provide electronic communication devices to range herders and livestock production workers \nfree of charge or deposit charge. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment and the Western Watershed Project \nexpressed concern that range herders and livestock production workers often work in remote locations with no \nmeans of communication in case of emergency. Western Watershed Project specifically noted that workers are \nexposed to various hazards in these remote locations, including exposure to disease and attacks from predators. \nSome employers, and employer associations Mountain Plains and Western Range, also agreed that electronic \ncommunication devices can help employers monitor the health and well-being of workers and the herd. One private \ncitizen also suggested that workers should have access to a computer with Skype or similar communication that \nwould allow the workers to contact a trusted person who speaks the workers' language. At least one employer \nalso expressed concern about language barriers. Only one comment, submitted by the Office of the Governor of \nUtah, urged the Department to eliminate the requirement that employers provide an electronic form of \ncommunication, stating that the Department failed to provide adequate justification for the requirement and \nasserting that the requirement would create an excessive encumbrance on employers. This comment also \nsuggested that, because ``there is no apparent history of safety incidence to cause alarm,'' the Department should \nallow employers to develop their own action plans to provide means of communication to workers during \nemergencies. Other comments from employers noted that workers often use their employer- provided cell phones \nto contact their families abroad and suggested that workers should be responsible for the cost of such calls, as well \nas the cost of providing different devices that the workers may choose that are beyond what is necessary to \neffectuate emergency contact with the employer and emergency first responders. We also received comments \nabout workers' access to satellite phones. A comment from the Western Watershed Project urged the Department \nto require employers to provide workers access to satellite phones where in-person or cell phone contact is not \navailable, as well as working batteries or rechargeable batteries and a solar charger to power the device for the \namount of time spent in areas with limited or non-existent communication. This commenter also suggested that \nemployers be required to maintain subscriptions for messaging services in cases of emergency and to provide proof \nof satellite coverage and appropriate equipment with respect to each worker on an annual basis. Some employer \ncommenters indicated that they currently provide satellite phones to their workers for communication in geographic \nareas where there is no cellular service coverage and believed this was an effective way of providing contact in the \nevent of an emergency. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment urged the Department to require employers to \nprovide workers with a satellite phone for communication at all times. They suggested that, without access to \nsatellite phones, workers who are out on the range with no cellular service coverage will have to depend solely on \nmore frequent contact with the employer as the only means of obtaining aid in the event of an emergency, and that \nin- person contact with the employer, unless it occurs daily, is not a reliable way of providing access to assistance in \ncases of emergency. They also stated that the Department's proposal creates a potential conflict of interest for \nemployers in responding to [[Page 62978]] worker emergencies because workers' compensation is triggered in the \nevent of a work-related injury, and the comment alleged that many workers who have reported such injuries have \nbeen denied medical care by their employers. This comment, however, also acknowledged several alternatives to \nrequiring employers to provide satellite phones. According to the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment, the \nDepartment could also give employers the option of providing workers with a mobile phone for everyday use and a \nsatellite phone for times when the workers are out of cell phone service range. The Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment further suggested, as a potentially inexpensive alternative to providing workers a satellite phone for \neveryday use, that employers could station workers in pairs while in areas with unreliable or no cell phone service. \nThey indicated that because there are usually two herders working during the winter season, employers would only \nincur the cost of a second worker during the summer months on the range. They noted that while this arrangement \n\n\n\nwould be less advantageous than having direct access to emergency responders via a satellite phone, the \npresence of a second worker would ultimately benefit both the workers and the employer by allowing workers to \nlocate emergency service sooner while providing for continued care of the livestock in the interim. Comments \nreceived from employers and employer associations reflected general agreement that a satellite phone is not an \nadequate substitute for in-person communication between employers and their workers, and urged the Department \nto adopt a flexible approach in the Final Rule. Mountain Plains and Western Range acknowledged that electronic \ncommunication devices can help employers track the health and well-being of workers, but noted that electronic \ncommunication cannot replace face-to-face communication. One employer stated that he had successfully used \nsatellite phones as an effective alternative means of communicating with workers outside cellular service coverage \nareas, but stressed that employers should be allowed to find solutions that best serve their needs. Other \ncommenters expressed concern about the cost of providing satellite phones and service plans, and one commenter \nreported that satellite phone service plans would cost $300 to $2,000 per year. The Department received \ncomments, from workers and employers, agreeing that employers should be required to establish work locations \nwhere electronic communication devices will work effectively so that workers' safety and health can be monitored. \nOne commenter stated that it was critical for employers to establish locations where a cell phone, satellite phone, or \nother device will work, or where workers can stop at a nearby ranch in the event of an emergency. Some \nemployers indicated that they already provide their workers with cell phones with consistent coverage in the areas \nwhere workers are stationed, and that they intentionally station workers, as much as possible, in areas that \nprovide cell phone coverage, allowing the workers to regularly contact the employer, as well as family and friends \nabroad. The Department also received comments about minimum allowable intervals between contacts initiated by \nthe employer. One commenter, a private citizen, expressed concern that in some cases, it may be over a month \nbefore workers have contact with their employer. Comments from Mountain Plains, Western Range, and other \ntrade associations stated that establishing minimum intervals for employer-employee contact is unnecessary and \ninfeasible given the unpredictable nature of the terrain, weather, and cellular telephone signals, and employers \ncurrently strive to maintain regular communication with their workers. Several employers pointed out that they have \nevery economic incentive for maintaining regular contact with their workers because they are concerned with both \nthe welfare of the workers and the welfare of the livestock. Other employers commented that they currently have \npractices in place that provide for regular contact with their workers, including three employers who reported \nmaintaining contact with workers by designating ``camp tenders,'' who are responsible for resupplying workers' \ncamps and monitoring the health and the well-being of workers and the herd. One employer suggested that \nemployer-employee contact every two to three days should be sufficient. Another employer suggested that as long \nas workers have the ability to contact the employer at any time, employer initiated contact every ten days is \nreasonable and sufficient. The employer further explained that some employers arrange for workers to work in \npairs during the summer when the workers are in remote areas, and in such cases the employer may only have in-\nperson contact with one of the workers in the working pair. They suggested that, to the extent that minimum \ncontacts are imposed, contact with one member of the working pair of employees in such arrangements should be \nsufficient. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment suggested that in-person contact could not be relied upon for \nemergency purposes unless it is daily. They also stated that, for purposes of defining a reasonable amount of time \nbetween in-person visits to deliver necessities (e.g., food and water, hygiene products, first aid supplies, and \nclothing), workers should not go more than seven days without in-person contact with the employer. The Worker \nAdvocates' Joint Comment also emphasized that because workers must rely on their employers for delivery of \nmail, the Department should promulgate a rule prohibiting employers from opening workers' mail. They also \nreported that employers sometimes deny workers access to healthcare professionals, and prohibit workers from \nallowing visitors, using a radio, and possessing reading materials. (2) Discussion Based on the comments received, \nthe Department has decided to maintain the proposed requirement, now located in Sec. 655.210(d)(2), that \nemployers must provide to their workers, free of charge or deposit charge, an effective means of communicating \nwith persons capable of responding to the worker's needs in case of an emergency, including, but not limited to, \nsatellite phones, cell phones, wireless devices, radio transmitters, or other types of electronic communication \nsystems. We found overwhelming agreement among the commenters that this requirement is needed due to the \nisolated nature of sheep, goat and cattle herding on the range. As the Western Watershed Project comment \naccurately noted, workers in these occupations often work in remote locations without sufficient access to medical \nfacilities or means of communication in cases of emergency. Without proper communication equipment, range \n\n\n\nherders and livestock production workers would be unable to seek and obtain assistance in cases of emergency. A \nmajority of employers and employer associations agreed that electronic communication devices can help employers \nmonitor the health and well- being of workers and the herd. Even when working in pairs, a communication device \nremains necessary because in the event that one worker needs emergency assistance on the range, the second \nworker would not likely be able to cause EMTs to arrive quickly without a communication device. Furthermore, we \ninterpret the phrase ``persons capable of responding to the worker's needs in case of an [[Page 62979]] \nemergency'' in paragraph 655.210(d)(2) as necessarily including first responders and other emergency personnel, \nin addition to the employer. Thus, workers must be free to use the electronic communication device to contact \ndirectly, without first contacting the employer, first responders or others capable of responding to the worker's \nneeds in an emergency. We also interpret the phrase ``effective means of communicating'' in paragraph \n655.210(d)(2) to mean that employers must have the ability to address language barriers in the event of an \nemergency. Employers can address language barriers by having on staff or otherwise making available, such as \nthrough a conference call, a person capable of speaking the worker's language and communicating the worker's \nneeds, or by using translation technology (e.g., computer software, translation devices, etc.). However, the \nDepartment has declined to prescribe a specific type of communication device, since the conditions, terrain, and \nparticular circumstances will influence the feasible types of communication. Finally, although employers may \nchoose to do so, we clarify that this Final Rule does not require an employer to pay for workers' personal calls to \nfriends or family or to supply or pay for communication devices beyond what is necessary for emergency contact \nwith the employer and emergency first responders. After considering all the comments on this subject, the \nDepartment also revised and added two subparagraphs in paragraph 655.210(d)(2) to clarify the employer's \nobligations. First, subparagraph 655.210(d)(2)(i) requires employers to include in the job order a simple statement \nspecifying the type of electronic communication device(s) that the employer will provide, free of charge or deposit \ncharge, to the worker during the entire period of employment. Second, under subparagraph 655.210(d)(2)(ii), the \nemployer must specify in the job order the means and frequency with which the employer plans to make contact \nwith the worker to monitor the worker's well-being if there are periods when the worker is stationed in locations \nwhere electronic communication devices may not operate effectively. Subparagraph (ii) also clarifies that such \ncontact must include either (1) arrangements for workers to be located in geographic areas where electronic \ncommunication devices can operate effectively on a regular basis, or (2) arrangements for regular, pre-scheduled, \nin-person visits between workers and the employer, which may include visits between workers and other persons \ndesignated by the employer to resupply the workers' camp (e.g., ``camp tenders''). The Department concludes that \nthis provision provides a suitable solution to the concern--acknowledged by many commenters--that range sheep, \ngoat and cattle herders often work in isolated areas where electronic communication devices will not function at all \ntimes. Comments from employers also indicated that many employers are currently complying with this requirement \nand that this practice is effective in providing workers regular contact with the employer. One commenter \nsuggested that employers that station workers in pairs while in areas with unreliable or no cell phone service \nshould be required to make in-person contact with only one worker in the working pair. The Department concludes \nthat in such instances, in- person contact with only one member of the working pair is sufficient for purposes of \nestablishing an alternative means of communication for the second worker, but only if in making in-person contact \nwith the first worker, the employer verifies the health and safety of the second worker. This rule adequately \nprotects each worker employed, while responding to the employers' need for efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, \nthe disclosure requirements in the Final Rule will serve to inform workers on how best to seek help in the event of \nan emergency, and provide a suitable solution to the concern--acknowledged by all--that range herders and \nlivestock production workers often work in isolated areas where electronic communication devices will not function \nat all times. In light of the comments from numerous employers and employer associations about the need for \nflexibility in determining the best method for providing workers access to emergency services, the Final Rule does \nnot mandate the use of a specific electronic communications device. The Department has also decided not to \nrequire employers to provide workers access to satellite phones as a substitute for in- person employer-initiated \ncontacts. Comments received from employers overwhelmingly rejected this approach, citing the costs and reliability \nof satellite phones, as well as the need for flexibility. The Department, however, clarifies that employers should \nconsider and keep up with advances in technology when selecting appropriate electronic communication devices. A \ncomment from the Western Watershed Project asserted that employers must provide workers with working or \nrechargeable batteries to power electronic communication devices for the amount of time spent in remote areas. In \n\n\n\nresponse, we clarify that the requirement to provide an effective means of electronic communication means that the \ndevice must be operable at all times. Therefore, the employer must provide the worker with an adequate power \nsource for the device. The Department will require the standards set out above without defining ``regular'' contact or \nimposing minimum in-person contacts, but, as mentioned above, will require the employer to disclose the frequency \nof contact in the job order. In the absence of evidence demonstrating pervasive issues with worker access to \nemergency services, a specific frequency requirement for in-person contacts is unnecessary. This choice strikes a \nsuitable balance between the Department's legitimate interest in protecting H-2A sheep, goat and cattle herders \nwith the employers' need for flexibility in determining the appropriate method for providing workers access to \nemergency services.\\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ The Worker Advocates' \nJoint Comment urged the Department to prohibit employers from opening workers' mail, which we note is \notherwise prohibited under federal law. See 18 U.S.C. 1702. They also stated that employers sometimes prohibit \nworkers from allowing visitors (including healthcare professionals); using a radio, or possessing reading materials. \nWe conclude that there is no reasonable basis upon which an employer should restrict a worker's use of a radio or \npossession of reading material obtained at the worker's own expense. With regard to access to visitors, this Final \nRule requires the employer to permit access to emergency personnel to respond to worker illness or injury. We \ndecline to set specific federal standards here governing access other than to emergency personnel. In accordance \nwith the requirement to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, employers are \nreminded of obligations to adhere to local laws providing such access. -----------------------------------------------------------\n---------------- iii. Tools, Supplies and Equipment (1) Comments Employers and their associations generally \ncommented that employers provide all the tools, supplies and equipment needed for the job, at no cost to the \nworkers. Some employer commenters listed examples of items that are provided for their herders. For example, \nF.I.M. Corporation commented that they provide free of charge ``clothes, medicine, blankets, rain coats, boots, etc.'' \nMule Head Growers commented that their herders have ATVs and herding dogs, and that they provide all other \nsupplies requested by the herders. Cindy Siddoway of Siddoway Sheep Company's comment listed the following \nitems as necessary [[Page 62980]] to perform the work safely and effectively, ``[h]orses, tack equipment, rain gear, \nguns, shovels, ax, various tools, sheep hooks, protective clothing and eyewear, gloves, binoculars, flashlights, \nbatteries, lanterns, wood, and fuel.'' Another ranching operation buys what the herders need including clothes, \nboots, and tools. Paul Nelson of Nelson Bros. Farm stated that they make sure the herders have good clothes to \nwear, warm hats and gloves, and tools needed to maintain the fences. The Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation \ncommented that ``[w]e believe that it is important to have proper tools and equipment provided for the worker as \nwell as the necessary supplies for the work that needs to be done. For instance, a saddle for the horse or leather to \nrepair the saddle or dog food for the herding and guard dogs.'' They requested further clarification on the type of \nboots referred to in the preamble to the NPRM. Larson Livestock commented their herders provide them with a list \nof the supplies they want, and that the employer purchases the items at no cost to the workers, ``with the exception \nof any personal items they may order such as cigarettes, DVD players, etc.'' and deliver the supplies to the workers \nat their sheep camps. Employers and their associations commenting on this issue emphasized that required tools, \nsupplies and equipment will vary among ranches due to differing climates, weather conditions, and assigned duties. \nItems required by the employer on one ranch may be completely unnecessary on another ranch due to the nature \nof the work. For example, Eph Jensen Livestock commented that ``[w]ith the diversity of size, location, and \nmanagement practices of sheep ranches, it would be impossible to make a checklist of items that need to be \nprovided. This is already monitored by the WHD and penalties are imposed for violations.'' The employer further \ncommented that, in its view, the trouble is a lack of practical understanding in DOL investigations, and \nrecommended that in enforcement actions, employers should be allowed the opportunity to explain why certain \nitems were or were not provided. Due to variety in the items required, several commenters opposed including a list \nof typically required items in the regulation or in the job order. For example, Billie Siddoway of Siddoway Sheep \nCompany commented that ``[b]ecause the provision of equipment varies among ranches and among employees on \neach ranch, it would be preferable to modify the proposed rule so that an exhaustive list of equipment is not \nrequired. Rather, an employer should be able to state generally that the equipment necessary to carry out the job \nduties will be provided.'' Ms. Siddoway further commented that ``[i]f the Department deems certain equipment to be \nsignificant (e.g., horse, herd dog, guard dog, gun, mobile telephone), then the employer could identify those specific \nitems in addition to the more general statement that necessary equipment will be provided.'' Kay and David O. \nNeves, who own a sheep operation, commented that they ``do provide items necessary for [the] job'' but they ``do \n\n\n\nnot think all these items need to be specified in the job order. The statement that employers provide needed items \nshould be enough.'' Mountain Plains and Western Range commented that the tools, supplies and equipment \nrequired to do the work safely and effectively depends on the time of year or location of the work. They explained \nthat ``[t] he items suggested in the NPRM are among those used on the range, binoculars, firearm, boots, rain gear, \nan ATV or four-wheeler, and/or a horse, but this list should not be considered exhaustive nor mandatory. During \ndifferent times of the year or in different parts of the West, some or all of these items would be strictly necessary \nwhile others would be entirely useless.'' Mountain Plains and Western Range further commented that including \nspecific requirements of items to be provided ``will not increase job safety or efficiency but would simply provide a \n`gotcha' opportunity for ambitious plaintiffs lawyers.'' Additionally, some employer commenters noted that items \nprovided should be ``within reason'' and that the Department's proposal does not take into account personal \npreferences or other factors. Sheep ranchers John and Carolyn Espil stated that ``[i]t is doubtful that the DOL \ninvestigators could, in the scope of their investigation, determine whether the charge was for an item requested by \nthe herder for his personal possession or if it was an item that the employer should provide.'' They gave the \nexample of ``boots'' as a required item, stating that the Department gives no variance for price of items, personal \npreference or frequency of purchase. They commented that they already provide all bedding, clothing and boots \nwithin reason, but that the Department's proposal would eliminate all expense for the worker. Eph Jensen \nLivestock commented that ``there has been no accountability placed on the worker for neglect of tools or \nequipment that employers provide.'' On the other hand, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment suggested that the \nregulation ``include an explicit non-exclusive list of such items that are typically required by the nature of the work \nunder [this rule] to avoid employers circumventing this requirement with their own interpretation'' of what is required \nby the job. As they explained, foreign herders and range workers often bring little with them to the United States \nbecause they have been assured that ``everything will be provided.'' The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment stated \nthat because the TEGLs have never ``described the precise items that need to be provided . . . there has never \nbeen a consistent understanding among the workers and the industry of what this promise truly encompasses,'' so \nthat upon arrival in the United States, foreign workers learn that, while the employer will purchase many of the \nitems needed for the job, the cost of the items is often deducted from the worker's pay. The Worker Advocates' \nJoint Comment listed several items that they find are required by the nature of the work to perform the job safely \nand effectively and should be provided free of charge, including binoculars, a rifle/gun, a knife, a trained horse, \nlighting, bedding, outer wear to protect the worker from the elements, and disposable gloves and disinfectant. They \nfurther recommended that, at a minimum, the Final Rule should specify ``those categories of items that the \nDepartment considers necessary for these jobs, such as `bedding' and `outerwear to protect worker from \nelements.' '' The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment also supported the NPRM provision requiring employers to list \nthe items that will be provided in the job order, as this will ``help employers clarify with the Department the kind of \ntools that must be provided'' free of charge and ``the Department can then review whether an employer's job order \nspecifies many of the common items discussed above and require clarification or correction of any deficiencies.'' \nThey further recommended that the job order include the list they suggested of specific items and blank lines for \nany additional items. (2) Discussion As explained in the NPRM, although the H-2A regulations currently require \nemployers to provide, free of charge, all tools, supplies and equipment necessary to complete the duties assigned, \nDepartmental investigations have found instances where employers have failed to supply the necessary tools, \nsupplies and equipment for the job, such as [[Page 62981]] boots, raingear or an ATV. 80 FR at 20304. The \nDepartment has also found instances where employers charged the workers for such tools, supplies or equipment, \nbringing the workers below the required wage. Id. To address these issues, the NPRM proposed that employers \nmust provide tools, supplies and equipment required by the law, the employer, or the nature of the work to perform \nthe job safely and effectively, and these items must be provided free of charge or deposit charge. Id. The NPRM \nalso proposed to require employers to disclose in the job order those items that will be provided and inquired \nwhether it would be helpful to include a list of typically required items in the regulations. Id. Based on the comments \nreceived, the Final Rule retains the NPRM provisions as proposed, and does not include a specific list of typically \nrequired items in the regulations. The Department concludes that it is appropriate to specify in the Final Rule that \nemployers must provide, free of charge or deposit charge, all tools, supplies and equipment required by law, the \nemployer, or the nature of the work to perform the job safely and effectively and to list which items will be provided \nfree of charge or deposit charge in the job order. The comments reflected that although many employers provide all \nnecessary items and provide them free of charge or deposit charge, it is helpful to include in the Final Rule the \n\n\n\nrequirement that the employer must provide all tools, supplies and equipment free of charge, because it provides \nclarity to workers and employers on the types of items considered required for herding and range production of \nlivestock occupations. If items are only required at certain times of the year, the employer is only required to provide \nthose items during those periods. However, DOL concludes that it is necessary for the employer to disclose that \nthose items will be provided in the job order so that workers are aware of which items will be provided prior to \naccepting the job. If an employer wishes to further specify in the job order that certain items will be supplied only \nduring specific periods, DOL would not object to this. Additionally, while the standard H-2A regulations require \nemployers to provide, free of charge, all tools, supplies and equipment necessary to complete the duties assigned, \nthe language ``by law, by the employer, or by the nature of the work to perform the duties assigned in the job offer \nsafely and effectively'' provides additional guidance on the type of items that must be provided free of charge or \ndeposit charge. This provision does not require employers to provide items for the worker's entertainment, such as \nmagazines, CDs and DVDs, or other items that are not required by the job, but employers may choose to do so. As \nmany employers noted, they already supply all items requested by their workers; the Department encourages \nranchers to continue to these practices. Some charge the worker for personal items that the workers request, \nwhile others do not. We further conclude that requiring employers to list which items will be provided free of charge \nor deposit charge in the job order will ensure that workers are aware of what items to expect to be provided, in \nadvance of accepting the job. Additionally, including this list will serve to notify the Department of the types of items \nrequired in these occupations, and, as noted by the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment, the Department may \nreview those items and ask for clarification or correction of any deficiencies. In the event of an investigation, the \nDepartment may review those items included in the job order; however, the Department is not precluded from \ndetermining that additional items not included in the job order were required for a particular worker under the terms \nof the Final Rule. Additionally, we note that we currently allow, and will continue to allow, an employer in an \ninvestigation to provide its explanation of why certain items were or were not provided. Finally, as noted, we decline \nto include a list of typically required items in the Final Rule. As demonstrated by the comments received, the tools, \nsupplies and equipment required by employers or by the nature of the work will depend on a number of \ncircumstances, such as the terrain, the season, and the climate. As discussed above, the requirement that \nemployers list in the job order those specific items that will be provided to herders will meet the goal of providing \ninformation to workers and to the Department, while avoiding the risk that specifically mandated requirements may \nbecome outdated, unnecessary or irrelevant. We note that the term ``required'' in Sec. 655.210(d)(1) means all \ntools required by law, by the employer, or by the nature of the work to perform the work safely and effectively. The \nDepartment further notes that the preamble discussions here and in the NPRM provide examples of items that may \nbe required by the nature of the work, such as boots, binoculars, a gun, an ATV, or a horse. Additionally, Sec. \n655.230 addresses range housing standards, and as fully discussed in preamble Sec. IV.E., certain items are \nrequired to be provided to meet those housing standards, such as bedding and heating equipment (or protective \nclothing where appropriate). As with all required tools, supplies and equipment, these items must be provided to the \nworker free of charge or deposit charge and listed in the job order. d. Section 655.210(e)--Meals i. Background \nCurrently, as required under the sheep and goat herding TEGL, and pursuant to industry practice for the range \nproduction of cattle, H-2A employers employing workers in these range occupations must provide food, free of \ncharge, to their workers.\\14\\ The TEGL for sheep and goat herding established requirements for meals, and the \ncattle herding TEGL was silent on the issue of meals, leaving the issue to be covered by the standard H-2A \nregulations. The NPRM generally adopted the requirements from the sheep and goat herding TEGL for all range \nemployers; we proposed to require all these employers to specify in the job order and provide to the worker, \nwithout charge or deposit charge, either three sufficient meals per day, or convenient kitchen facilities and adequate \nfood provisions to enable the worker to prepare his own meals.\\15\\ The terms ``sufficient'' and ``adequate'' were \nnew introductions from the requirements in TEGL 32-10.\\16\\ The Department also sought comment on what \nconstitutes a sufficient meal for range workers, given the physically demanding nature of their work, as well as \nwhat constitutes adequate food given the remote location of these workers. 80 FR at 20305. -----------------------------\n---------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Additional background and comments received about the proposed \nrequirement that food be provided without charge to workers are discussed in Sec. IV.C. of the preamble related to \nsetting the herders' wage in Sec. 655.211 of the Final Rule. \\15\\ Cooking and eating facilities are discussed in Sec. \nIV.E.2. of the preamble, which addresses housing standards set in Sec. 655.235 of the Final Rule. \\16\\ Additionally, \nwe proposed to require that employers provide workers with an adequate supply of potable water, or water that can \n\n\n\nbe easily rendered potable, and the means to do so, when working on the range. The potable water requirement is \ndiscussed in Sec. IV.E. of the preamble related to Sec. 655.235(b) of the Final Rule, which establishes the \nrequirements that employers must follow in supplying water for range workers. We have added a cross-reference \nin Sec. 655.210(e)(2), which governs meal standards, to Sec. 655.235(b), related to water standards. ------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------- The Final Rule maintains the requirement that employers must provide \neither three sufficient meals a day, or furnish free and convenient [[Page 62982]] cooking facilities and adequate \nprovision of food to enable the worker to prepare his own meals free of charge or deposit charge. The Department \nis also revising the proposed rule to provide additional guidance to employers on what constitutes ``sufficient'' and \n``adequate'' meals and food. Under paragraph 655.210(e)(1) of this Final Rule, to be considered ``sufficient'' or \n``adequate,'' the meals or food provided to range workers must include a daily source of protein, vitamins, and \nminerals. ii. Comments Comments received from worker advocates, private citizens, an industry magazine editor, a \nState government office, employers, and employer associations reflect general agreement that employers should \nprovide range workers with ``adequate'' meals or ``sufficient'' provisions of food to prepare healthy, nutritious \nmeals. For instance, in their joint comment, Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that, ``[t]he physical \ndemands of the job call for a protein-rich diet for the hearty men that perform this work. . . .'' Billie Siddoway of \nSiddoway Sheep Company, Inc. also stated that ``[d]elivering food is a necessary part of range employment \nbecause employees do not have ready access to shopping markets.'' Other employers agreed that range workers \n``need and deserve good food'' and should be ``adequately fed.'' One employer, in expressing his support for the \nproposal to require sufficient and adequate food, opined that ``if the workers are happy, well-nourished and \ncontent, they will properly care for our animals and properties.'' Commenters disagreed, however, on whether \nemployers are currently providing adequate meals or sufficient food to range workers. Several employers stated \nthat they provide a variety of food, including meat and fresh produce, and accommodate worker preferences for \nspecific foods and quantities. Billie Siddoway of Siddoway Sheep Company, Inc. described their practice of \nproviding hot meals and food to workers as follows: During the winter lambing season, we employ[] a cook who \nprepares three hot meals each day. When the [workers] are on the range, they prepare their own meals. On our \nranch, each [range worker] provides us with a grocery list. Every eight to ten days, depending on terrain and \nconditions, we purchase the items on the list and deliver them to the requesting [range worker]. This comment also \nnoted that Siddoway provides meat to range workers, such as lamb, mutton, elk, and buffalo, which are raised on \nthe Siddoway ranch. Other employers described having similar practices of supplying food that is selected by the \nrange workers and delivered by the employer at intervals that vary depending on the season, terrain, and other \nfactors. At least one other employer indicated that he employed a cook who delivered fresh, hot meals to workers \nthree times a day. On the other hand, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment reported instances when food is not \ndelivered to range workers in a timely manner, and provides accounts of workers ``being sent by employers to \nsteal fruits and vegetables from the nearby orchards for their own consumption.'' A private citizen also recounted \ninstances where employers have forgotten to deliver food supplies to range workers and where employers have \nsupplied food unfit to eat. One other private citizen noted that she visited with range workers who reported going \nover a month without receiving food from the employer. The Department also received a number of comments \nabout how and to what extent the Final Rule should specify the employer's food provision obligation. The Worker \nAdvocates' Joint Comment emphasized that range workers need sufficient quantities of food for health \nmaintenance, disease prevention, and preventing vitamin deficiencies. They stated that the terms ``sufficient'' and \n``adequate'' used in the proposed rule do not provide clear guidance on the amount and kind of food necessary for \nworkers engaged in physically demanding work. Thus, they requested that the Department require in the Final \nRule ``a daily source of protein and vitamins and minerals'' and that employers provide range workers with ``fresh \nfood when possible.'' They suggested meats, beans, and eggs as permissible sources of protein, and fruits, \nvegetables, and oils as examples of the remaining vitamins and nutrients. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment \nalso requested that we set minimum daily calorie requirements, variety recommendations, and food safety \nstandards using federal guidelines, including guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Specifically, they stated employers should provide to each range worker enough food to \nmeet a minimum daily calorie requirement of 3,000 to 4,000 calories (or 21,000 to 32,000 calories per week), and \nprovide range workers with more food during periods when they are engaged in higher levels of activity. One \nprivate citizen also suggested that, given the difficulty with refrigeration on the range, the Department should \nconsider requiring employers to provide extra food in order to take spoilage into account. Comments from \n\n\n\nemployers and employer associations, on the other hand, requested that the Department adopt a flexible, case-by-\ncase approach in defining the employer's food provision obligations. Mountain Plains and Western Range stated \nthat food provision requirements involving calorie counts or menus are unnecessary, arbitrary, and would create ``a \nlogistical nightmare'' for the Department to enforce and for employers to comply with. They also noted that each \nworker has his own preference for food, and a ``one size fits all'' approach mandating a particular diet for range \nworkers would violate those preferences. One employer suggested that imposing calorie requirements and food \ndelivery is beyond the Department's purview. A comment from the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation suggested \nthat the Department should simply provide clear language about what the employer is not required to provide (e.g., \nsoda pop), rather than listing what it must provide. iii. Discussion Based on the comments received, the Final Rule \nretains the proposed standard, now found at paragraph 655.210(e)(1), requiring employers to specify in the job \norder and to provide to range workers, without charge or deposit charge, either three sufficient meals a day, or free \nand convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable range workers to prepare their own \nmeals. Comments from worker advocates, private citizens, employers, and employer associations revealed general \nagreement that, given the unique and isolated nature of range herding, employers should be required to provide \nrange workers with adequate and sufficient meals and food. The Final Rule also revises the proposed regulation by \nadding a clause at the end of paragraph 655.210(e)(1), stating that to be ``sufficient'' or ``adequate,'' meals or food \nprovided by the employer must include a daily source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. The Final Rule reflects a \nbasic nutritional framework and also retains employers' flexibility to accommodate workers' preferences, as well as \ndelivery and storage realities. Such a requirement is appropriate given that range workers are often in isolated \nlocations and entirely dependent upon their employers for adequate food to meet their nutritional needs. This \nprovision also establishes a more objective standard for employers to [[Page 62983]] evaluate the type of food that \nthey must provide to range workers. Having established the general parameters for minimum food requirements, \nwe conclude that further regulating food provisions by mandating a specific calorie count or specific food delivery \nintervals is unnecessary. In addition, a one-size-fits-all approach would create significant difficulties given that \nworkers' preferences may vary and food delivery schedules may depend upon the location of work. Nonetheless, \nwe clarify that employers are encouraged to consult and may rely on existing federal guidelines for minimum calorie \ncounts, variety requirements, and/or food safety standards when making decisions about food provision, taking into \naccount the physical conditions and requirements of this work. We further clarify, consistent with the proposal from \nthe Worker Advocates' Joint comment, that acceptable sources of protein include, but are not limited to, meats, \nbeans, and eggs, and acceptable sources of vitamins and minerals include, but are not limited to, fruits, vegetables, \nand oils. Furthermore, in meeting the food provision requirements under this Final Rule, employers should strive to \nprovide range workers with fresh food when possible. e. Section 655.210(f)--Hours and Earnings Statements i. \nBackground The TEGLs for employers engaged in sheep, goat and cattle herding require job orders to comply with \nthe standard H-2A requirements, ``unless otherwise specified'' in the TEGLs. TEGL 32-10, 4; Attachment A, I(B), \n(C); TEGL 15-06, Change 1, 4; Attachment A, I(B), (C). Both TEGLs provide, with regard to earnings records and \nstatements, that an employer must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to workers' earnings and \nfurnish workers a statement of earnings on or before each pay day (a requirement consistent with the standard H-\n2A requirement, see 20 CFR 655.122(k)). The TEGLs further provide that, because ``unique circumstances'' (i.e., \non call 24/7 in remote locations) prevent the monitoring and recording of hours actually worked each day as well as \nthe time the worker begins and ends each workday, the employer is exempt from reporting on these two specific \nrequirements at 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k). However, all other regulatory requirements related to earnings records \nand statements apply.'' TEGL 32-10, Attachment A, Section I(C)(7); TEGL 15-06, Change 1, Attachment A, Section \nI(C)(5). The NPRM proposed to limit the special exemption from the standard recordkeeping requirements to the \ndays ``when the worker is performing duties on the open range.'' 80 FR at 20340. The NPRM also proposed to \nrequire employers to keep daily records indicating whether the employee worked on the open range or on the ranch \nor farm, and to require employers to ``keep and maintain records of hours worked and duties performed over the \ncourse of the day when the worker is performing work on the ranch or farm.'' 80 FR at 20340. Finally, the NPRM \nproposed to require employers who chose to prorate a worker's wage, based upon the worker's voluntary absence \nfor personal reasons, to keep a record of the reason for the worker's absence. Id. The NPRM stated that, because \nthe proposal requires a monthly wage, keeping and maintaining records of hours worked was not necessary for \ndays spent on the range. 80 FR at 20305. The daily record of where the work was performed would be sufficient for \nthe Department to assess compliance with the requirement that at least 50 percent of the worker's days be spent \n\n\n\non the range. The preamble clarified that, where an employee spends some portion of the day on the range and \nsome portion on the ranch, the day would count as a range day or a ranch day depending upon where the \nemployee spent a majority of the hours worked during the workday. 80 FR at 20306. The NPRM explained that the \nproposed requirement to keep a record of the hours the employees worked and the duties performed for days spent \non the ranch or farm would allow the employer and the Department to determine whether work that did not fall \nsquarely within the definition of the production of livestock satisfied the proposed requirement that it be minor, \nsporadic, and incidental (i.e., occurring during no more than 20 percent of the workdays spent at the ranch). The \nproposed requirement to record the duties performed at the ranch similarly was intended to allow ``the Department \nto distinguish herder- or livestock production- related ranch work from unrelated ranch work to determine whether \nthe work performed at the ranch is in compliance with the job order and the applicable wage rate.'' Id. As discussed \nin Sec. IV.A.3. of the preamble related to Sec. 655.201, the Final Rule eliminates the 20 percent cap on the \nperformance of minor, sporadic, and incidental duties while workers are on the ranch or farm; therefore it also \neliminates the requirement to maintain records of hours worked and duties performed while on the ranch or farm. \nThe Final Rule retains the NPRM's other requirements to record whether each day is spent on the range or the \nranch and, if the employer chooses to prorate the required wage, to record the reason for the worker's absence. ii. \nComments Many employer commenters objected to the recordkeeping requirements associated with the proposed \n20 percent cap on directly and closely related duties while at the ranch. In some cases their concerns were based \nupon a misunderstanding of those requirements. For example, some commenters thought the proposed rule \nrequired them to keep track of the number of hours that workers performed each individual duty while at the ranch, \nor at least to track the time spent on directly related work versus actual livestock production work, rather than simply \nto record the total hours worked each ranch day and a description of the duties performed during the day. Thus, \none herding employer, Martinez Livestock, stated that requiring the employer to individually itemize each of the \nincidental chores and the time spent would be time consuming. The Colorado Wool Growers Association \ncommented that the performance of additional related chores should not ``require the ranch to keep an onerous set \nof records, parsing out every single activity.'' Another rancher stated that ``[k]eeping track of time an employee \nworks in a particular situation or site makes no sense!'' Other commenters specifically opposed any additional \nrequirement to keep records of work performed on the range, stating that the added burden would be unnecessary \nand impractical. Other commenters addressed the proposed recordkeeping requirements. For example, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau stated that keeping ``hourly records for work performed at the ranch and daily records of \nthe work performed on the range'' was burdensome and the Department ``has presented no evidence that farmers \nhave been using herding workers on the ranch more than the allowed 20 percent time.'' The Utah Farm Bureau \nFederation and the Michigan Farm Bureau agreed and further concurred with the statement that the proposal would \nbe particularly burdensome for small ranchers; they stated that such family businesses do not have a human \nresources department for support, and they may not be familiar with the FLSA recordkeeping requirements because \none H-2A worker may be their only employee. Another [[Page 62984]] ranch owner stated that trying to regulate \nhours and document what workers do every day is not practical, because animals can become sick and then ``the \nnext 2 days is spent setting up corrals, treating animals along with all the normal daily chores . . . 20 different \nunexpected events can happen in one day!'' Another owner stated that the requirement to quantify hours spent on \nactual livestock tending, and the need for extensive record-keeping, is not practical or productive. Many other \ncommenters agreed. For example, John Espil Sheep Company stated that keeping track of their workers' time \nhourly or daily would be extremely difficult or impossible, both on the range and at the ranch, because every day is \ndifferent. Another sheep rancher commented that the workers irrigate pastures, harvest livestock feeds, maintain \nfences, clean corrals, doctor sheep and feed them, and it would be ``absurd'' to require recordkeeping for this work. \nIn contrast, Billie Siddoway, on behalf of the Siddoway Sheep Company, stated that it ``would not be unreasonable \nto track the days each employee works on the range or the ranch,'' but that it would be onerous to track hours of \nwork and duties performed every day when workers are on the ranch. This commenter suggested that if an \nemployee undertakes minor, sporadic or incidental work outside the definition of herding, ``the employer could track \nthose hours and job duties only'' in order to allow the Department to evaluate compliance with the 20 percent rule. \nThis commenter further stated that it ``would not be unreasonable to track the hours and duties associated with'' \nsuch incidental tasks as erecting temporary pens and corrals in anticipation of the lambing season, and that limiting \nthe reporting requirement to only incidental work would likely lead to more accurate reporting. In contrast to the \ncomments by employers or their representatives, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment suggested that the normal \n\n\n\nrecordkeeping requirements should be extended to these workers, regardless of where the work is performed, so \nthat start and stop times (including for responses to emergencies), total daily hours, and duties would be recorded \neven for work on the range. They stated that this would allow a more accurate assessment of the appropriate \nnumber of hours per workweek to use for the monthly wage computation, and it would allow for enforcement of the \nhourly AEWR if workers perform duties that fall outside the scope of these regulations, such as if workers are \nrequired to repair irrigation ditches or harvest hay. They stated that relieving employers of the standard \nrequirements to maintain ``records reflecting daily hours and job duties for open range work incentivizes \nmisclassification.'' They also asserted that ``[w]ithout recordkeeping requirements, the Department cannot monitor \ncompliance with those requirements,'' and that workers ``face the daunting task of having to reconstruct covered \nand uncovered work hours and of having to convince a judge or jury that they are telling the truth'' when they seek \nto recover back wages at the higher hourly AEWR rate. In the alternative, they sought clarification that the \nexemption from normal recordkeeping applies only when the worker spends an entire day on the range and not \nwhen both range and ranch duties are performed during a single day. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment also \nnoted that any burden from the extra recordkeeping would fall on the employees, not the employers, but that it \ncould involve a simple daily timesheet or calendar that the employer collected each month. Finally, they stated that \nemployers already have timekeeping systems for their other employees, and that the new requirements would add \nlittle cost but would provide records important for monitoring and enforcement. The Western Watershed Project \nconcurred that records of actual hours worked should be required. iii. Discussion The Final Rule retains the \nproposed requirement to track days at the ranch versus days on the range because that is essential to allowing the \nemployer, and the Department if necessary, to assess compliance with the requirement that a majority (more than \n50 percent) of the workers' days be spent on the range in order for these rules to apply. Moreover, that \nrequirement imposes only a minimal recordkeeping burden. We understand from the comments that employees \ngenerally will work on the range for several months at a time, and then they may be on the ranch for two months, \nsuch as for lambing, before again leaving for months on the range. Because the employer simply needs to record \n(by, for example, checking a box) where the employee worked each day, and because that response will be the \nsame for months at a time, the burden is inconsequential. Moreover, the employer commenters did not object to this \naspect of the proposal. The Final Rule also retains the NPRM's requirement to record the reason for a worker's \nabsence, if the employer chooses to prorate the required wage. The required wage may be prorated only if an \nemployee voluntarily is unavailable for work for personal reasons, such as to return home due to a family member's \nillness. The notation of the reason for the worker's absence will allow the Department to verify whether any \ndeduction that the employer chooses to make from the worker's required wage was made for appropriate reasons. \nThe need to make such an entry is likely to arise only very rarely and for very few workers; therefore, the burden is \nminimal. Moreover, employer commenters did not object to this requirement. Accordingly, the Department retains \nthe requirement so that it will have available for later review a contemporaneous explanation for any deductions \nfrom the required wage. The Final Rule eliminates the proposed requirement to maintain records of hours worked \nand duties performed while on the ranch or farm, because the Final Rule eliminates the proposed 20 percent cap \non the performance of minor, sporadic, and incidental duties while workers are on the ranch or farm. The proposed \nrequirement to track duties performed at the ranch was intended to allow the Department to monitor compliance \nwith the 20 percent cap, by preserving a record of the tasks performed each day, so it could be determined whether \nthe tasks were solely those that fell squarely within the definition of the production of livestock or also included \nsome tasks that simply were closely and directly related to herding or the production of livestock. The proposed \nrequirement to track the hours worked while at the ranch was intended to provide the basis for a remedy for a \nviolation when workers exceeded the 20 percent cap. In light of the decision to remove the proposed 20 percent \ncap from the Final Rule, the associated recordkeeping requirement is no longer necessary for these purposes. The \nDepartment recognizes that records regarding the duties performed and the hours worked would be relevant if the \nrancher violates the rules by assigning duties to the workers that fall outside the scope of the herding and range \nlivestock regulations during periods when they are not working on the range. Thus if an employer assigned a \nworker general ranch hand work rather than work that falls within the definition of the production of livestock (which \nincludes all duties that are closely and directly related to the herding or production of livestock), records of the hours \nworked would be relevant to determining the appropriate [[Page 62985]] remedy for such a violation. That benefit \nhas to be weighed against the burden imposed on all employers by mandating such daily record-keeping regarding \nboth total hours and the length of time various duties were performed. Imposing that burden does not seem \n\n\n\nnecessary because, if such a violation occurs, the Department's enforcement experience demonstrates that it can \nobtain the information necessary to prove such violations, including the information necessary to reconstruct hours \nto compute back wages, via worker and employer interviews during an investigation. For example, a broad variety \nof routine business records could provide an indication whether the worker and the herd were at the ranch or the \nrange during various periods (depending upon the particular rancher's production methods), such as contracts with \nwool shearers, contracts with truck drivers or those purchasing lambs, veterinarian bills, water bills, gasoline bills, \nelectric bills, and cell phone records. The Department's experienced investigators use all relevant records, as well \nas the results of their interviews, when evaluating the facts of cases in which time records do not exist or are \ninaccurate. f. Section 655.210(g) and (h)--Rates of Pay and Frequency of Pay i. Background The wage rate \nrequired by the standards in Sec. 655.210(g) of this Final Rule is also discussed in Sec. IV.C. of the preamble \nrelated to the wage methodology standards in Sec. 655.211, which also governs the applicable wage rate. In \naddition to the many comments received on the wage methodology, we received a handful of comments on \nparagraphs 655.210(g) and (h) related to commissions, bonuses, and other incentives, and pay frequency and \naccess. The TEGLs do not address the issue of whether an employer may pay a wage rate based on commissions, \nbonuses, or other incentives. Under the standard H-2A rules, at 20 CFR 655.122(l)(1), employers are barred from \noffering or paying a wage rate based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives unless the employer \nguarantees and pays at least the required wage for each pay period. Section 655.210(g)(1) of the proposed rule \ndeparted from the standard H-2A requirement, and barred pay rates based on commissions, bonuses, or other \nincentives entirely. The proposed rule further clarified that all payments must be made free and clear without any \nauthorized deductions. Recognizing that herders are often paid through direct deposit or wire transfer given the \nremote nature of the work, the preamble further provided that if the employee: voluntarily requests that the \nemployer deposit the wages into a bank account or send a wire transfer back to the worker's home country, for \nexample, the employer is still responsible for ensuring that wages are paid when due. The employer may not derive \nany benefit or profit from the transaction and must be able to demonstrate that the wage payment was properly \ntransmitted to and deposited in the designated bank account or recipient on behalf of the employee. 80 FR at \n20306. On the issue of pay frequency, Sec. 655.210(g) and (h) of the NPRM continued a long-standing practice \nbased on the TEGLs and required workers to be paid not less frequently than monthly. We specifically invited \ncomment on the issue of how frequently workers should be paid. Id. ii. Comments A few employers commented on \nthe prohibition of wage rates based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives in the NPRM. The joint comment \nfrom Vermillion and Midland opposed this requirement. This comment pointed out that a flat prohibition was \ninconsistent with the rule in the rest of the H-2A program and stated that such payments should be permitted, \nprovided that the employer guaranteed the required wage. Siddoway Sheep recommended that DOL permit \nemployers to withhold a portion of wages as an incentive for the employee to complete the contract period and to \ndiscourage workers from leaving to work in other industries. A third employer, Lava Lake Land & Livestock, stated \nthat it was ``the American way'' to pay for performance and stated that such payments should be permitted if \ndisclosed in the job order and advertised. This employer stated that the required wage should be assessed on an \nannual basis so that any bonuses could be counted toward compliance with the wage requirement. We received \nonly a few comments on the issue of pay frequency. Both Edward Tuddenham, an attorney who represents \nworkers, and the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment stated that DOL should require workers to be paid at least \ntwice monthly, consistent with the requirements in the rest of the H-2A program. See 20 CFR 655.122(m). They \nexpressed the view that payment no less than twice monthly was preferred by workers. One individual employer \nstated that its herders had never requested to be paid more frequently than monthly but had sometimes asked for \nadvances on wages. This employer asserted that it did not object to paying its workers more frequently than \nmonthly if they would prefer that. Both the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment and the Tuddenham comment further \nrequested that DOL take additional steps to provide workers with ``real access to their wages.'' These commenters \nexpressed concerns that workers are not provided with the means or time off to go to the bank or check cashing \nfacility and thus are overly dependent on their employers in accessing wages. The Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment noted that workers typically either receive wages by direct deposit or have wages sent directly to their \nfamilies in their home countries. This comment recommended that DOL require by regulation that employers offer \nthe worker the option to receive wages by check, cash, or direct deposit, and asked that DOL require employers to \nprovide workers with physical access to banking facilities. Both comments asked DOL to impose additional \nregulatory standards, such as requiring by regulation that, if direct deposit is used, all banking information be \n\n\n\nprovided to the worker, and that the worker be provided with the necessary bank cards or other items needed to \nwithdraw these funds. iii. Discussion On the issue of bonuses, commissions, and incentives, we agree that the \nstandard H-2A rule should apply. See Sec. 655.122(l)(1). Accordingly, under this Final Rule, employers may make \npayments based on bonuses, commissions, and incentives provided that the full rate required by Sec. 655.211 of \nthis Final Rule is guaranteed and paid when due. In addition, we agree that the full offered wage rate, including any \ncommissions, bonuses, or incentives, must be included in the job order and advertised to U.S. workers, because \nU.S. workers must be apprised of the full wage offered through the job opportunity. We decline to adopt the other \nrecommendations suggested by commenters regarding commissions, bonuses, and incentives. As explained in the \npreamble to the NPRM, the requirement to pay the required wage necessarily means that payments must be made \nwhen due to the worker (in this case, twice monthly, as discussed below). 80 FR at 20306. Authorizing employers \nto withhold a portion of the workers' pay after work has been performed would be wholly inconsistent with this \nrequirement and with the standard H-2A regulation. The [[Page 62986]] recommendation that DOL only examine \nwhether the required wage rate has been met at the end of the year would have the similar effect of permitting \nemployers to withhold wages due for work performed and is, therefore, rejected. We agree with the comments \nrecommending that we use the standard H- 2A pay frequency, and the Final Rule requires that payments be made \nat least twice monthly. See Sec. 655.122(m). No employers objected to more frequent intervals beyond a single \nmonthly payment, and calculating the twice-monthly payment can be easily accomplished by evenly dividing the \nrequired monthly rate into two payments. On the issue of access to wages, we note that generally payment must be \nin the form of cash or instrument negotiable at par (i.e., cash or cash equivalent). See 29 CFR 531.27. WHD has \ninterpreted this requirement to provide that payment may only be made through direct deposit with the worker's \nconsent and only if the workers have the alternate option of receiving payment through cash or check. See WHD \nField Operation Handbook 30c00(b) (June 30, 2000). The same requirement would apply to the voluntary \nassignment of wages through wire transfers to a designee of the worker. See WHD Field Assistance Bulletin 12-3 \n(May 17, 2012). Neither these general rules nor the regulatory requirements of the general H-2A and H-2B \nprograms require that the employer provide workers with options for how to receive their pay, provided that the \nworker receives payment either in cash or through an instrument negotiable at par. We decline to accept the \ninvitation to develop special rules for the types of payments required to be made to workers in these occupations or \nto set intervals at which workers must be provided physical access to banking facilities, which would go beyond \nDOL's obligation to set standards that will protect against adverse effect to U.S. workers. However, given the \nremoteness of the physical location of work covered by this rule, we encourage employers to continue what \nappears to be the widespread practice of providing the option for workers to receive payments through wire \ntransfers to a designee or through direct deposit. We further clarify that, because direct deposit may only be used \nwhere the worker elects it, an arrangement under which the worker's pay is deposited into a bank account but the \nworker does not have the information needed to access the bank account, such as the account number, suggests \nthat the worker has not consented to receive payment through direct deposit. Therefore such an arrangement is \nnot permitted. C. Section 655.211 Herding and Range Livestock Wage Rate 1. Background: The TEGLs and the \nNPRM Proposals Under the standard H-2A program, an employer must pay the higher of the hourly Adverse Effect \nWage Rate (AEWR), which is based on the combined wage rate for field and livestock workers reported in the \nFarm Labor Survey (FLS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); the prevailing wage rate or \npiece rate; the State or federal minimum wage; or an agreed-upon collective bargaining wage rate.\\17\\ 20 CFR \n655.120(a). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ The AEWR is established in order to \nneutralize any adverse effect on U.S. workers resulting from the influx of temporary foreign workers. Employment \nand Training Administration, Labor Certification Process for the Temporary Employment of Aliens in Agriculture and \nLogging in the United States, 52 FR 20496, 20502 (June 1, 1987); see also 75 FR 6884, 6891-6895 (Feb. 12, \n2010). The AEWR provides that the wages of similarly employed U.S. workers will not be adversely affected by \nbringing in foreign workers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the TEGLs, the AEWR \nfor herder occupations is set at the prevailing wage rate of U.S. workers based on surveys conducted by the State \nWorkforce Agencies (SWAs). For these herding occupations, the wage rate from the prevailing wage survey has \nmost often been a monthly wage rate. The NPRM proposed significant changes to the wage methodology \ngoverning H-2A workers engaged in sheep, goat, and cattle herding. As discussed in the NPRM, the dearth of \ninformation on the wages of U.S. workers in these occupations has made setting the AEWR based on the SWA \nsurveys unsustainable. 80 FR at 20306-20308. Few employers provide U.S. worker wage information in response \n\n\n\nto prevailing wage survey requests for these occupations, making it difficult for SWAs to submit statistically valid \nprevailing wage findings to OFLC. Under the TEGLs, the SWAs use ETA Handbook 385 to collect prevailing wage \nresults. Employers are not required to report data in response to the survey data request. Often, and almost always \nmore recently, the SWAs determine that there are no survey results or the survey does not yield statistically valid \nresults. Thus, for many years, the Department has been unable to determine a statistically valid prevailing wage \nrate in each State in which one is needed, requiring the OFLC Administrator to use the survey results from another \narea or State to set the wage, or, under earlier guidance, to set the wage based on a previous year's wage rate. \nSee Field Memorandum 24-01, TEGL 32-10, TEGL 15-06, and TEGL 15- 06, Change 1. Because almost every \nState experienced years in which no wage report could be statistically verified, wage stagnation across these \noccupations has been the inevitable result in all but two States.\\18\\ Under the current procedures, wage rates are \ncurrently set at $750 per month for sheep and goat herders in most States and $875 per month for cattle in all \nStates.\\19\\ The current minimum salary for sheep herders in California is $1,600.34 per month, and, effective \nJanuary 1, 2016, the minimum monthly salary for sheep herders will be $1,777.98. Under Oregon's minimum wage \nlaw, the required rate is $1,603.33 per month for range workers (calculated based on the State minimum wage \nmultiplied by 2,080 hours and divided by 12 months) and is adjusted annually based on increases to the State \nminimum wage that are based on the CPI-U. Or. Rev. Stat. 653.025(2). ----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------- \\18\\ California and Oregon each have established wage rates applicable to these occupations. See \nCal. Labor Code 2695.2(a) (West 2003); Or. Rev. Stat. 653.020(1)(e), 653.010(9); see also Technical Assistance \nfor Employers in Agriculture, available at http://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx. Oregon's sheep \nand goat herder wage rate for the H-2A program was, until recently, set by a legal settlement in Zapata v. Western \nRange Association, Civ. N. 92-10-25, 244L (Ore. 1994). However, Oregon's current interpretation of its minimum \nwage law, which is applicable to these occupations, requires a payment higher than that required by the Zapata \nsettlement. See            http://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx. \\19\\ Although the most recent \ndetermination for cattle herders in Oregon was $875/month, the current wage rate required by the application of the \nState minimum wage law in Oregon, see footnote directly above, requires a significantly higher wage. ------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------- Unlike the requirements in the standard H-2A program, sheep and goat \nherding employers are required to provide food to the workers free of charge under TEGL 32-10. Although the \ncurrent cattle production TEGL 15-06, Change 1, does not prohibit employers from deducting the cost of food in \naccordance with the standard H-2A program regulations, since 2013 employers have been required to provided \nfood free of charge based on the wage surveys from the SWA. Labor Certification Process for the Temporary \nEmployment of Aliens in Agriculture in the United States: Prevailing Wage Rates for Certain Occupations \nProcessed Under H-2A Special Procedures; Correction and Rescission, 78 FR 19019, 19020 (Mar. 28, 2013). \nSection 655.211(a) of the NPRM proposed to require employers to [[Page 62987]] advertise, offer, and pay a wage \nthat is the highest of the monthly AEWR, an agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum \nwage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action. We proposed to continue to use a monthly AEWR for these \noccupations because of the difficulties in tracking and paying an hourly wage rate to workers engaged in the \nherding or production of livestock on the range due to the remote location of the work and the sporadic and \nunpredictable nature of the duty hours on any given day.\\20\\ If the AEWR was increased during the work period, \nand the new rate is higher than the other wage sources considered, paragraph (a) of this provision proposed that \nemployers adjust the wage rate they pay based on the new wage effective on the date of its publication in the \nFederal Register, consistent with the approach in the standard H-2A program, and with current requirements for \nthese occupations. See 20 CFR 655.122(l) (requiring the applicable AEWR or other wage rate to be paid based on \nthe AEWR or rate in effect ``at the time work is performed''); TEGL 32- 10, App. A at p. 1. ----------------------------------\n----------------------------------------- \\20\\ Employers are similarly exempt from the hourly minimum wage and record-\nkeeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act for these workers. 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(E). -----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------- Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 655.211 set the proposed methodology for \nestablishing the monthly AEWR for these occupations. Due to the challenges in obtaining valid SWA wage results \nand the resulting wage stagnation from the existing methodology, we proposed to use a different wage source to \nset the monthly AEWR--the combined hourly wage rate for field and livestock workers from the FLS (``FLS- based \nAEWR'') used for all other H-2A occupations. In order to derive a monthly wage from this hourly rate, we proposed \nto use an estimate of 44 hours worked per week, which was a compromise between the pre-NPRM submissions of \nan attorney representing worker interests, Edward Tuddenham, and the three primary employer associations, \n\nhttp://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx\nhttp://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx\n\n\nMountain Plains, Western Range, and ASI.\\21\\ The 40-hour proposal from the employer associations was based on \nthe Zapata settlement, in which employer associations agreed to pay sheep herders in Oregon on a monthly salary \nbasis, adjusted annually. The 48-hour estimate from Mr. Tuddenham was based on a review of information \nprovided by employers on Form ETA-9142A about the number of hours employers expected herders to work per \nweek. Consistent with the approach in the sheep and goat herding TEGL and the current SWA prevailing wage \ndeterminations for cattle, the NPRM proposed that employers be required to provide food free of charge. --------------\n------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ These pre-NPRM submissions were included on the rulemaking \nrecord and were available for public inspection and comment. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n---- The NPRM further proposed a four-year transition of the new wage rates, with full implementation at the \nbeginning of year five (the NPRM referred to this as a five-year phase-in). In many States in which the current \nmonthly wage rate for sheep and goat herders is $750, the NPRM methodology would result in a required wage \nrate that triples (or more) the current rate at the end of the transition period. See 80 FR at 20318, Exhibit 6. For the \nreasons discussed below, and as we proposed in the NPRM, this Final Rule requires covered employers to pay a \nwage that is the highest of the monthly AEWR, an agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable \nminimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action. However, based on a review of all the comments \non the rulemaking record, and for the reasons set out below, we have concluded that it is more appropriate and \nconsistent with the Department's obligations under the INA to use the current federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour, \nrather than the FLS-based AEWR, as the basis upon which to set the monthly AEWR for these occupations. In \naddition, for the reasons discussed below, we have made an upward adjustment of the estimate of hours that \nherders work in a week, based on a review of data collected from Form ETA-9142A. Accordingly, we will calculate \nthe monthly wage rate as: $7.25/hour multiplied by the revised 48-hour estimate of hours worked per week. Under \nthe Final Rule, the wage rate for these occupations will be adjusted annually based on inflation, and implementation \nwill be transitioned over two years, with full implementation at the beginning of year three. Finally, the Final Rule \nrequires employers to provide three adequate meals without charge to the range workers. 2. The Wage \nMethodology: Review of Comments and Discussion a. Comments and Discussion of Section 655.211(a) DOL \nreceived only a handful of comments on proposed paragraph 655.211(a) of the wage methodology. We received no \ncomments on the requirement that an employer pay the collective bargaining agreement wage only if it is the \nhighest applicable wage, which is consistent with the standard requirement governing the H-2A program, and no \ncommenters objected to the requirement that the employer pay a higher applicable State or Federal minimum \nwage. In addition, Western Range and Mountain Plains incorporated the requirement to pay a higher applicable \nState wage into their joint wage proposal, which was supported by the ASI and many individual employers, which is \ndiscussed in greater detail below. Therefore, we retain these requirements as proposed in Sec. 655.211(a) with \nonly three clarifying edits. First, the proposed rule stated that the State or Federal minimum wage applied only if the \nwage was ``specific to the occupation(s).'' Because that text might be read overly narrowly to exclude workers from \na State or Federally required wage if the wage was generally applicable to workers (including herders engaged in \nthe range production of sheep, goats, or cattle), this Final Rule deletes that text from Sec. 655.211(a).\\22\\ Second, \nfor clarity, we have removed from Sec. 655.211(a)(2) the requirement to pay the adjusted monthly AEWR if it is \n``higher than the highest of the monthly AEWR.'' Because adjustments will now be based on the Employment Cost \nIndex for wages and salaries, as discussed below, this provision is no longer necessary. Third, we deleted the \nstatement that the AEWR would be adjusted ``under the FLS'' because that survey will not be the basis of the \nwage, as proposed. This paragraph requires the application of State or Federal minimum wage law, if applicable, \nbut as discussed below, employers employing workers in these occupations are currently exempt from application \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) Federal minimum wage. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------- \\22\\ We have made the corresponding deletion of the phrase, ``specific to the occupation[,]'' in Sec. \n655.210(g) as well. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Vermillion and Midland objected to the \ninclusion of the requirement that a higher wage required by judicial action be paid because that requirement is not \nincluded in the standard H-2A regulations, or in the H-2B regulations. In their view, this requirement is unnecessary, \nwould encourage litigation, and creates the possibility of unpredictable wage obligations. This requirement that a \nhigher wage required by judicial action be paid is consistent with ETA's years-long application of the legal \nsettlement from the Zapata case as the required wage for sheep and goat herders in Oregon. Based on our \nexperience with the Oregon settlement, we disagree that this requirement will incentivize litigation. In addition, we \n[[Page 62988]] note that even if the application of a settlement in a legal case related to the applicable wage was \n\n\n\nnot required by our regulation, an employer would nevertheless be required to pay a higher wage if required by a \ncourt order. Accordingly, we retain this requirement as proposed. We received a comment from one employer \nobjecting to the requirement that the new AEWR rate be paid upon announcement in the Federal Register. \nApparently not recognizing that this is a current program requirement, this employer questioned how employers \nwould make immediate adjustments to the new wage rates when their contracts required a specified wage rate over \na certain period. As discussed below, the required wage will be adjusted annually based on inflation, and following \nthe transition period, we do not expect there will be significant adjustments in wage rates required from year to year \nas might have occurred under the TEGLs. As a result, we conclude that it will not be unduly difficult for employers to \nadjust to the annual changes. Because this requirement is our current practice, and presently applies both to range \nherding employers and employers governed by the standard H-2A regulations, we have decided to retain this \nexisting requirement. Accordingly, we maintain this requirement as proposed. b. Use of the Farm Labor Survey-\nBased AEWR To Set the Monthly Wage Rate i. Comments Opposing Use of the FLS-Based AEWR Generally, we \nreceived hundreds of comments opposing the use of the FLS as the basis of the wage proposal from individual \nherding employers; employer associations including Mountain Plains, Western Range, and ASI; State and local \ngovernment officials, including Governor Mead of Wyoming and Representative Jaggi of the Wyoming House of \nRepresentatives; others from Western States with a business interest in the sheep industry, such as accountants \nfor sheep herding employers and wool processors; and SBA Advocacy. These comments primarily provided \nobjections based on the size of the proposed increase, which, as noted previously, see 80 FR at 20318, Exhibit 6, \nwould triple the current wage rate in many States. These comments stated that the proposed wage rate would \njeopardize the entire herding industry. They asserted that the wage increase would cause many employers to either \ngo out of business entirely or to downsize and greatly reduce the number of workers employed. Many commenters \nstated that wages lower than those proposed, and those required under the standard H-2A rules, were appropriate \nto reflect other costs paid by the employer, including food, housing, work supplies and protective clothing, and \ntransportation. Commenters expressed the view that current wages were sufficient because H-2A workers continue \nto accept work at current rates. Some commenters stated that low wages for these occupations were justified, \ngiven that workers were not required to engage in productive labor at all times while on the range, and had time for \nrelaxation and personal pursuits. The vast majority of comments were from commenters affiliated with the \nproduction of sheep; few comments were received specific to cattle herding, a much smaller part of the program \ncompared to sheep and goat herding. The Colorado Wool Growers Association and others asserted that the wage \nproposal was ``not grounded in the market realities'' of the industry. Many employers stated that the wages \nproposed were too high, given that the result would be payment of higher wages for herders than for other workers \nin the U.S. economy, including ranch managers, or that the wages paid substantially exceed what H-2A workers \nwould earn for the same work in their home countries. Some commented that because food and housing are paid \nby the employer, foreign workers are able to send their paychecks in full back to their home countries. SBA Office \nof Advocacy reported that, based on its discussions with small livestock and sheep herding operations in California, \nColorado, Oregon, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming, every business contacted predicted that it would reduce its \noperations or close operations within a few years. SBA Office of Advocacy cited a Mountain Plains Survey, in which \nnearly every one of the association's 214 member respondents commented that it would downsize or shut down \noperations because of the high wage rates proposed. Individual employers and associations provided similar \nreports. The following comment from one sheep herding employer, F.I.M. Corporation, is illustrative: For the period \n2006 to 2013 our gross income from sales of wool, lambs, sheep, and hay averaged about $1,100,000 per year. \nAfter our operating expenses our net income averaged about 2.5% to 3% of gross or approximately $35,000 per \nyear. This proposed tripling of sheepherder wages will require approximately $250,000 per year in additional wage \npayments . . . . That much money is simply not available so the Dept of Labor will force FIM Corp and most other \nsheep producers that employ sheepherders to send the sheepherders home and sell the sheep. Some individual \nemployers also submitted their profit-and-loss statements in support of their comments that the wage increases in \nthe proposal could not be absorbed. The Texas Sheep and Goat Raisers Association provided estimates based \nupon the Idaho enterprise sheep budget \\23\\ showing that hired labor comprises 24 percent of total operating costs \nfor these employers, and that a three-fold wage increase would result in an 80 percent reduction in profitability (from \n$83,000 in profit to less than $17,000). Similarly, Mountain Plains and Western Range submitted an analysis based \non the Wyoming enterprise sheep budget and an analysis of lamb and wool market trends for the past 20 years, \nwhich, in their view, demonstrated that using the wage rate proposed would allow the average sheepherding \n\n\n\nemployer to break even only 30 percent of the time, concluding ``[t]hat is an extinction scenario for employers . . .'' \nThe American Farm Bureau used data from the Utah enterprise budget in its analysis, which similarly purported to \nshow that the proposed wage increase would result in a loss of $16,444. The Texas Sheep and Goat Raisers \nAssociation and others commented that impacts from the wage proposed would not be felt only by ranchers but \nalso through ``multiplier'' effects in related industries, including by lamb processors, wool warehouses, textile mills, \ntrucking and feed companies, veterinarians, and fencing businesses. -------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------- \\23\\ An enterprise budget is a listing of all estimated income and expenses associated with a specific \nenterprise (i.e., single crop or livestock commodity), which will provide an estimate of its profitability and break-even \nvalues. Enterprise budgets are developed and published on an irregular basis by university-based agriculture \nextension services with inputs from ranchers on price, yield, and costs. -----------------------------------------------------------\n---------------- Multiple commenters, including Mountain Plains and Western Range, stated that because American \nwool and lamb represent a small fraction of the world market (less than one percent of wool and meat production \nworldwide, according to an analysis from Dr. Stephen Bronars submitted with the Mountain Plains and Western \nRange comment), producers are unable to pass increased labor costs on to consumers. In addition, the Bronars \nanalysis similarly provided that range cattle account for only eight percent of world beef production. Vermillion and \nMidland provided an economic analysis of the impact of the [[Page 62989]] wage increases under the proposal \nperformed by a national resource law and economic policy analyst at the Linebery Policy Center for Natural \nResource Management. Largely relying on data from the NPRM, this analysis contained little new data, but rather \ndetermined that the total overall wage costs under the proposal would be greater for employers with a larger \nnumber of workers than those employing the three workers estimated in the proposal. The analysis asserted that \n``[w]ith fluctuating prices for livestock products, and ever increasing input costs, the cattle and sheep industries \nstruggle to break even, much less expect a profit.'' The analysis further concluded that the wage increases would \nraise production costs to ``untenable levels'' and stated that even in the highest price years ``the price volatility of \nthe livestock product market could make it difficult to absorb the added wage increase.'' The analysis cited an \nearlier report for the proposition that livestock operations are marginal, with net ranch income per acre of $.55.\\24\\ -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ See Seawolf, R., Fowler, J., & Schickedanz, J., The \nLegacy of New Mexico Property Tax, RITF Report 81 (Jan. 11, 2011), available at:            \nhttp://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF81.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, in \nopposing the wage increase, the American Farm Bureau Federation (American Farm Bureau) submitted an \nanalysis of the effect of the proposed wage rates based on historic price data from 2000-2014. That comment \nstated that prices for wool and lamb over the past five years ($1.70/lb for lamb and $1.45/lb for wool) are \nsignificantly higher (63 percent for lamb and 113 percent for wool) than averages over the 10 preceding years \n($1.04/lb for lamb and $.68/ lb for wool). Although the comment acknowledged that a wage increase of the size set \nout in the proposal was ``manageable'' at current prices, it provided alternate scenarios to evaluate the ability to \nabsorb the wage increase given average prices for the 2000-2014 period, as well as the lowest prices for the 15-\nyear period ($.80/lb for lamb and $.53/lb for wool). At the 15-year average prices, the comment projected \nsignificantly reduced profits in all States if the FLS-based AEWR was paid as compared to the profits that would be \nachieved with current wage rates; at the lowest prices for this period, the comment forecasted a loss in all States if \nthe full rate proposed in the NPRM was paid compared to a slim profit with current wage rates. Further, the Utah \nGovernor's Office submitted a comment asserting that because prices per lamb have increased from $67.94 in \n1994 to $157.15 in 2014 (an inflation-adjusted increase of $48.61 according to the comment) based on analysis \nfrom the Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Program, the wage increase proposed could not be \nabsorbed by employers.\\25\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ See Schulz, Lee, Ag \nDecision Maker: Historic Hog and Lamb Prices, File B2-10 (Feb. 2015), at Table 6, available at:            \nhttp://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF81.pdf\n\nwage increase, the American Farm Bureau comment provided less dire predictions than other commenters or the \nWyoming and Idaho analyses. In addition to economic objections, many of these employers and associations \nfurther objected to the wage increase based on their view that the limited number of U.S. workers in these \noccupations foreclosed the need to provide for any adverse effect. According to Western Range, in 2012 twenty-two \nU.S. workers applied for 1,000 openings. Western Range stated that only two U.S. workers were ``qualified'' and \nwere hired, and neither completed the job contract. Mountain Plains stated that in more than 1,000 openings in \n2014, only two qualified U.S. workers applied. According to Mountain Plains, one U.S. worker was not interested \nin the job and the other was hired but quit before completing his contract. Further, Mountain Plains and Western \nRange commented that, based on their experiences, higher wages in California have not resulted in increased \nnumbers of U.S. workers applying for jobs in these occupations. According to these associations, since 2011, \nMountain Plains has received 18 applications for approximately 400 sheepherder or goat/sheepherder positions in \nCalifornia. No similar data was provided for Western Range. The comment stated that of those 18 prospective \nworkers, 10 were not qualified for the work and the remaining eight withdrew their applications because they were \nnot interested in the job. According to these commenters, in their experience, there are actually fewer applicants in \nCalifornia and fewer U.S. workers who take the jobs advertised there as compared to states like Wyoming or \nColorado. Many employers and associations expressed the view that U.S. workers are unwilling to perform this \nwork due to the remote nature of the work rather than because of low wages, and some expressed disappointment \nwith what they view as the unreliability of the few qualified U.S. workers who apply, stating that they often do not \ncomplete the work contract. Other commenters, such as the Utah Farm Bureau Federation, misunderstood the data \nin the proposal, and stated that the Department ``concedes'' that there are only 18 U.S. workers in range herding \noccupations because 18 U.S. workers were included in the 2014 SWA sheep herding surveys and worked in \nStates with a statistically reportable wage. On the other hand, one SWA employee expressed the view that \n``[q]ualified job seekers often give low wages as one of the reasons they do not apply for these jobs, even though \nhousing and meals are also provided. The number of U.S. job applicants has decreased over the past few years. \nIncreased wages could help to encourage more worker interest in the jobs.'' In addition, several employers noted \nthat they have hired U.S. workers, with varying degrees of success. Further, one herding employer admitted that it \ncould not attract U.S. workers because ``Americans don't like the conditions or low pay.'' Finally, some \ncommenters also objected to the FLS-based AEWR based on their view that it was inappropriate as a wage source \nfor these occupations.\\26\\ For example, the New Mexico Department of Agriculture and Wyoming Department of \nWorkforce Services objected to the use of the FLS-based AEWR on the view that the rate is based on ``generic \nagricultural operations'' and not specific to range herding. Similarly, Western Range and Mountain Plains expressed \nthe view that the FLS is ``a survey of aggregated farmworker positions except herders. Those positions pay by the \nhour, and do not provide housing or food, making those rates of pay completely inapposite to the range production \nof livestock.'' [[Page 62990]] Mountain Plains and Western Range asserted that the AEWR was a measure of ``take \nhome pay'' from which U.S. agricultural employees need to pay a number of expenses not applicable to workers in \nthese occupations. One herding employer stated that it has provided wage data on its workers for purposes of the \nFLS ``for many years'' but nevertheless objected to the FLS-based AEWR because, in its view, DOL had not \nproperly consulted with USDA before proposing use of the FLS for these occupations and because H-2A workers \nreceive additional ``benefits'' not paid to other workers. Siddoway Sheep stated that the use of the FLS-based \nAEWR was arbitrary because in its view sheepherder wages have always been ``well below average,'' and instead \nasked DOL to conduct a comparison of the wage rate from the FLS with the monthly herding AEWR from a point \n``when adequate information regarding sheepherders was available'' and set the current wage based on that \nhistoric but, in their view, valid differential. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ Some \nemployers also objected to the proposed wage based on the misunderstanding that the proposal required payment \nfor all hours worked and tracking of hours on the range. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ii. \nComments Supporting Use of the FLS-Based AEWR We received only a few comments in support of the wage \nproposal in the NPRM, and most of the supportive comments were from individual commenters, including a former \nSWA employee responsible for surveys from the 1980s until 2005. We also received comments generally \nsupporting the wage proposal from groups such as Public Citizen, a public interest group, and Western Watersheds \nProject, a project that works to protect and conserve the public lands of the American West. Most group comments, \nincluding the comment from Public Citizen, were undetailed and expressed only general support. These \ncommenters asserted that the wage methodology was appropriate and necessary to protect against adverse effect \n\n\n\non U.S. workers. Similarly, while he did not comment on the NPRM, Edward Tuddenham, an attorney representing \nworkers, submitted a comment before publication that is part of the administrative record. That comment \nrecommended either that workers be paid for a set estimate of hours multiplied by the FLS-based AEWR rate for \ntime on the range and at the FLS-based AEWR for each hour spent in non-range work, or be paid the FLS-based \nAEWR for all hours actually worked regardless of location. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment was by far the \nmost detailed comment supporting the use of the FLS-based AEWR to set the monthly rate. That comment \ncharacterized using the FLS-based AEWR to set the monthly rate as a ``practical and commonsense approach.'' \nHowever, this comment expressed the view that DOL's use of a transition to the FLS- based AEWR in the proposed \nrule was misguided, and that requiring anything less than immediate implementation would have an adverse effect \non U.S. workers performing work as ranch hands, who, like workers covered by this rule, may also perform work \nthat is closely and directly related to the production of livestock. This comment provided an analysis of purported \ndata flaws in the SWA survey methodology and asked that DOL take into account the ``immense losses'' from prior \nSWA survey use to immediately implement the FLS-based AEWR as the base wage source. The comment \nattributed wage stagnation to DOL's ``outdated'' methodology and to DOL's settlement of various employer lawsuits \nover past wage increases, which in the commenters' view has been ``strongly pro-employer to the detriment of \nworkers in this area and justifies immediate ameliorative action.'' In support of the view that the FLS-based AEWR \nshould be immediately effective, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment pointed to several examples of jobs that, in \ntheir view, demonstrated that the ranching industry already supports workers earning the full FLS-based AEWR \nwho perform similar work, particularly citing ``Sheep, Farmworker General'' in Wyoming, ``Closed Range Herders'' \nin Texas, and ranch hands performing livestock as well as other tasks. They further cited wage rates paid by \nemployers ``in states without large herder populations,'' such as for Maine sheep farmers and sheep farm workers \nin North Dakota (both paid on an hourly basis). Further, they noted that California has a wage rate significantly \nhigher than the current TEGL wages in other States. Finally, the commenters conclude ``the sustained scarcity'' of \nU.S. workers in these occupations: is no doubt in large part a function of the fact that U.S. workers have the \nfreedom to earn at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is substantially higher than the herder \nminimum wage. Several of these commenters asked DOL to require payment for all hours worked, or at least for all \nhours worked when not on the range.\\27\\ Western Watersheds asked that workers either be paid for all hours \nworked or not be required to work longer than the hours estimated by DOL. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment \nstated that workers should be paid the AEWR for all hours worked while living ``at or near the ranch,'' based on the \nview that the exception to payment for all hours worked should be limited to the circumstances animating the FLSA \nexemption for this work, namely, that hours worked be extremely difficult to calculate. Edward Tuddenham similarly \nsupported that workers should be paid for all hours at the ranch. ------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------- \\27\\ A single employer also stated that an hourly wage would be appropriate during the shed lambing \nseason. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- iii. Discussion and Decision--Change in Wage \nRate After reviewing all of the comments, we conclude that using the FLS-based AEWR to set the monthly wage for \nthese occupations, which would triple the wage costs of many employers, is likely to result in adverse effect on U.S. \nworkers by causing a substantial number of herding employers to close or significantly downsize their operations-- \nleaving fewer herding jobs available to U.S. workers. Accordingly, we select a different wage source in this Final \nRule, as discussed in greater detail below. In reaching this conclusion, we do not base our analysis on a single \ncomment or set of comments, but on the record as a whole, including data from budget documents submitted, \nreports from individual employers and associations, and historic pricing data. We recognize limitations on the data \nprovided by employers, their associations, and their other supporters. For example, in some instances, employers \nused ``labor costs'' to attempt to demonstrate the impact of a wage increase, although labor costs may include \nmore than just wages. In addition, enterprise budgets, which we examined carefully, typically include a line item for \npayment to the owner/operator, so that even with reduced or eliminated profits, there is still some payment to the \nowner. In addition, we cannot assume, as some commenters have done, that all labor in the enterprise budgets is \npaid at the TEGL wage levels. This is particularly true given that some H-2A employers noted in comments that \nthey pay workers more than the current TEGL wages. We further recognize that only sparse data was provided on \nthe impact of the proposed increase for cattle employers, which comprise a small subset of H-2A herding \nemployers. However, despite these limitations, based on the size of the proposed increase and the data provided, \nthe record provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the proposed wage increase is too great to be borne by the \nindustry, and thus will result in adverse effect on U.S. workers [[Page 62991]] because fewer herding jobs will be \n\n\n\navailable.\\28\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ Although the American Farm Bureau \ncomment characterized the proposed wage increase with prices at the current levels as manageable, that is not \ndeterminative. We agree with the commenter that it is more reasonable to look to data assessing historic swings in \nprices. Examining those historic price swings helped guide our conclusion that adverse effect on U.S. workers \nlikely would result from using the FLS-based AEWR. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As \ndiscussed further below, this Final Rule imposes a significant wage increase on the industry as compared to the \ncurrent, stagnated wages required under the TEGLs, albeit of a magnitude lower than the wage originally proposed. \nHowever, for several reasons we disagree with worker advocates' comments that setting the wage based on \nanything other than the Farm Labor Survey is inconsistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect. \nFirst, although we acknowledge that wages under the SWA survey methodology have been stagnant for some time, \nwe are concerned, based on the comments received, that the three- fold wage increase in the proposal would, if \nimplemented, likely result in a significant number of employers choosing to down-size or close their herding \noperations, resulting in adverse impact on U.S. workers.\\29\\ Second, although worker advocates cite in support of \nthe proposed FLS-based wage other ranch jobs they view as similar and that are paid the FLS-based AEWR, those \noccupations do not appear to be primarily engaged in range work. To the extent that the worker advocates cited \nrange jobs in Texas to support the proposition that ranchers overall can absorb a wage increase in the magnitude of \nthe FLS-based AEWR, the data provided either reflects a prevailing wage rate significantly below the FLS-based \nAEWR or it is of such a small sample size to be unreportable under existing guidelines. In addition, we disagree \nwith the suggestion that practices in sheep production ``in states without large herder populations'' and without \nrange workers are relevant to the determination of whether employers using the current special procedures can \nabsorb an increase of the scope proposed. Nor are we persuaded by the fact that some individual employers \nvoluntarily provide higher wage rates than will be required under this Final Rule demonstrates that most employers \nwill be able to absorb increases on the scale proposed. Third, we agree that the California sheep herding wage \nrates provide evidence that some employers can viably pay a higher wage, as discussed further below, but it does \nnot support setting wage rates across the United States based on the FLS-based AEWR. Finally, we conclude that \nalthough we use a lower wage rate than is required for ranch hands, this will not have an adverse effect for U.S. \nworkers similarly employed. As discussed in Sec. IV.A.2. in the preamble, we have further defined what work may \nbe performed at the ranch under this Final Rule to prevent herders from being used to perform general ranch hand \nwork. Given this protection, we conclude that the lower wage established for herders will not displace U.S. ranch \nhands.\\30\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ We note that in its analysis of the SWA \nsurvey data, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment appeared to misunderstand data presented in the NPRM. The \ncomment stated that in the NPRM, 80 FR at 20314, DOL ``admitted'' that surveys with results of between 18 and 30 \nworkers were insufficient. However, the NPRM was discussing the total number of U.S. sheep herders identified in \nthe SWA surveys with reportable results located in the mountain plains/western regions. This passage was not a \ndiscussion about the minimum sample size for any individual State. For these occupations, a survey of as few as \nsix U.S. workers is consistent with the methodological requirements of ETA Handbook 385, provided a sufficient \nnumber of employers is represented by the sample. \\30\\ Although we have decided not to use the FLS-based \nAEWR as the basis for the wage in this Final Rule, we must clarify the record with respect to two objections to its \nuse for these occupations. First, we note that the FLS does, in fact, survey the wage of herding workers engaged \nin work on the range, though it is likely that, because there are few workers in these occupations, they may be a \nsmall portion of the sample in any State. Indeed, one herding employer expressly acknowledged that it reports its \nworkers' wages to the FLS. In addition, while some commenters asserted that the FLS-based AEWR is \ninappropriate for range occupations because it fails to account for items such as meals, housing, transportation, \nworkers' compensation, and work supplies, we note that (with the exception of meals), these items are also \nrequired to be provided without charge by H-2A employers paying the FLS-based AEWR and therefore do not \nsupport herding employers paying a lower wage. See 20 CFR 655.120(d)(1) (requiring housing to be provided to H-\n2A workers and any U.S. workers in corresponding employment not reasonably able to return to their residence \nwithin the same day); 20 CFR 655.120(e) (workers' compensation); 20 CFR 655.120(f) (tools, supplies, and \nequipment); 20 CFR 655.120(h) (governing transportation payment requirements). The reasons for applying these \nrequirements throughout the H-2A program are set out in the 2010 H- 2A rule, Temporary Agricultural Employment \nof H-2A Aliens in the United States, Final Rule, 75 FR 6884 (Feb. 12, 2010) and earlier H- 2A regulations. ------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------- We further decline to require payment of the FLS-based AEWR for \n\n\n\nall hours herders work while at the ranch. We note that this decision is consistent with the FLSA exemption, which \npermits the exemption to be taken for the entire year provided that the worker is ``principally engaged in the range \nproduction of livestock.'' 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(E). Given the limitation on duties that may be performed by range \nworkers when they are working at the ranch as discussed in Sec. IVA.2., we conclude that this is not likely to have \nan adverse effect on U.S. workers at the ranch because ranch hands can perform a much broader array of work \nduties. This is particularly true given that range sheep and goat herders have traditionally been granted \ncertifications for a 364-day period to tend the herd throughout the production cycle, including times at the range and \non the ranch. This practice is continued in this Final Rule, which specifically provides that it applies only to workers \nwho spend more than 50 percent of the job order period working on the range, further distinguishing these workers \nfrom general ranch hands. Finally, we decline to adopt Siddoway Sheep's suggestion that DOL conduct a \ncomparison of the wage rate from the FLS with the TEGL wage from a point ``when adequate information regarding \nsheepherders was available'' and set the current wage based on that differential. In the absence of underlying \nrecords from historic SWA surveys, which are unavailable, we cannot pinpoint the year when adequate information \nmay have been available. However, we reiterate that the TEGL wages have suffered significant stagnation when \ncompared to the FLS-based AEWR for more than 20 years.\\31\\ Given this significant wage stagnation compared to \nother H-2A occupations, it is appropriate to require a wage rate under this Final Rule that is well above the TEGL \nlevels in most states. As discussed below, this Final Rule accomplishes that result. -------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------- \\31\\ For example, the Nevada TEGL wages were $700 in 1994 and are currently $800, an \nincrease of approximately 14 percent over two decades. By comparison, the FLS-based AEWR for Nevada in 1994 \nwas $5.57 per hour, and the 2015 rate is $11.37, a greater than 100 percent increase. Labor Certification Process \nfor the Temporary Employment of Aliens in Agriculture in the United States: 2015 Adverse Effect Wage Rates, 79 \nFR 75839 (Dec. 19, 2014); Whittaker, William G., Farm Labor: The Adverse Effect Wage Rate, CRS RL32861 (Apr. \n14, 2005). Similarly, the 1994 sheep TEGL wage in Wyoming was $700 and is currently $750, an increase of \napproximately seven percent. By contrast, the hourly AEWR in Wyoming in 1994 was $5.59 per hour in 1994, and \nis now $11.14, nearly a 100 percent increase. Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are \nmindful of our statutory obligation to protect against adverse effect to U.S. workers, even in cases where the \nnumber of U.S. workers may be small. As a result, we are not persuaded by employer comments suggesting that \nU.S. workers will not be qualified or available for this work, regardless of the wage required.\\32\\ [[Page 62992]] \nAlthough we agree that the remoteness of the job and skills required are significant factors influencing availability of \nU.S. workers, it would be unreasonable to conclude that wages are without any influence on U.S. worker \navailability. As we have noted before with respect to our certification of temporary foreign workers, a basic principle \nof economic supply-and-demand theory is that in market economies, shortages signal that adjustments should be \nmade to maintain equilibrium. Therefore, compensation should rise to attract more workers where employers are \nexperiencing a shortage of available workers in a particular region or occupation. Wage increases may not occur \nas expected because of the availability of foreign workers for certain occupations, thus preventing the optimal \nallocation of labor in the market and dampening increased compensation that should result from the shortage. -------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Though several commenters viewed the data in the NPRM \nas evidence that DOL had ``conceded'' there were at most 18 U.S. workers in these occupations, this is a \nmisinterpretation of the data. The 2014 survey identified 18 U.S. sheep herders among the States with a statistically \nreportable wage result located in mountain plains/western regions of the United States. However, overall in 2012, \n25 workers were included in surveys of sheep herders across those States. In addition, SWA surveys in other \nyears included a higher number of workers, including in 2015. In 2015, 19 U.S. sheep herders were identified in \nSWA surveys across the mountain plains/western regions. In addition, because completion of the SWA survey is \nnot mandatory, there are likely a significant number of additional U.S. workers not reported in the survey. For \nexample, in California in 2015, the SWA survey included 10 U.S. sheep herders, and the SWA received a response \nfrom approximately 36 percent of sheep herding employers in the State. There are almost certainly additional U.S. \nworkers among the remaining 64 percent of employers in that State. Finally, employers may have had an incentive \nto not report wages of U.S. workers in some circumstances because the TEGLs permit a different (and often lower) \nState wage to be used in the event that the SWA survey did not report a wage finding. --------------------------------------\n------------------------------------- The experience cited by Mountain Plains and Western Range in California (and by \nemployers and others in other States)--that few U.S. workers are available for these jobs--does not undermine this \nbasic economic theory for a number of reasons. First, we note that the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment indicated \n\n\n\nthat some employers are using experience requirements as a basis to require references on letterhead of a \nprevious employer. Such a requirement would be difficult for U.S. workers in many occupations, and this is even \nmore true of U.S. workers seeking work in herding occupations.\\33\\ In addition, though Mountain Plains and \nWestern Range state that, in their experience, fewer U.S. workers apply for jobs in California than in other States \neven though the wage is higher in that State, the evidence they provide is contrary to the evidence from the SWA \nsurveys, which suggest that higher wages in California may, in fact, be attracting greater numbers of U.S. sheep \nherders than in other states in the mountain plains/western regions of the United States. In fact, California is \nconsistently among the states with the largest number of U.S. sheep herders identified in SWA surveys in these \nregions. In 2012, California had the largest number of sheep herders who were U.S. workers included in the SWA \nsurvey (10 in California out of 31 overall); in 2013, it was tied for the largest number of U.S. sheep herders in the \nSWA survey (13 in California out of 38 overall); in 2014, it was tied for the second largest number of U.S. sheep \nherders in the SWA survey (three out of 25 overall); and in 2015, it had the third largest number of U.S. sheep \nherders in the SWA survey (10 out of 52 overall).\\34\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ \nWe have clarified in Sec. IV.B.2.A. of this preamble that such a written reference requirement cannot be imposed \nbecause it may result in U.S. workers who are otherwise qualified being rejected for work. \\34\\ In addition, the \nSWA surveys suggest that a significant percentage of California employers are hiring U.S. sheep herders. In 2012, \napproximately 13 percent (6/45) of sheep herding employers in California responding to the SWA survey hired at \nleast one U.S. sheep herder; in 2013, that percentage was 16 percent (5/32); in 2014, that percentage was seven \npercent (2/29); and in 2015, that percentage was 13 percent (4/30). ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------ Further, that the TEGL wages are higher than those H-2A workers could receive in their home countries \nshould not have any bearing on the wage set by DOL. This will ordinarily be the case with foreign temporary \nworkers. This fact supports, rather than refutes, DOL's obligation to require that wages are set at a rate that will not \nundercut the wages of U.S. workers, who have different economic incentives than foreign workers and must \nsupport themselves in this country, not abroad. Finally, we have considered the commenters' anecdotal concerns \nabout the unreliability of the domestic workforce. However, even if those concerns had been supported by more \nsubstantial evidence, the potential costs that may be incurred as a result of U.S. workers leaving before the end of \nthe job order period are outweighed by the benefit to U.S. workers, and by our statutory responsibility to provide \nthat U.S. workers continue to have access to these jobs. c. Alternatives To Use of the FLS-Based AEWR To Set \nthe Base Wage Rate i. Comments on Alternatives Where specific wage proposals were made by those opposed to \nusing the FLS-based AEWR as part of the formula to set the base wage, these commenters generally either \nrecommended that DOL not set any wage minimum for these occupations, that DOL continue to use the TEGL \nmethodology, or that DOL adopt one of the two counter-proposals submitted jointly by the three primary employer \nassociations (Mountain Plains, Western Range, and ASI), discussed further below. For example, several ranchers \nasserted that the federal government should have no role in setting wages for these occupations, but instead wages \nshould be based on the agreement between the worker and employer based on the ``market.'' Although some \ncomments opposed any increase to current wage rates, many, including ASI and a number of individual employers, \nacknowledged that it was important for DOL to adopt a methodology to address wage stagnation in these \nindustries. Mountain Plains and Western Range recommended that DOL either set the monthly AEWR for these \noccupations based on an inflation-adjusted value from the 1994 sheep TEGL wages cited in the NPRM or based on \nthe current FLSA minimum wage multiplied by a set estimate of hours, recommendations that were endorsed by \nASI and a number of individual employers. This comment selected $800/month as the appropriate wage to index, \nstating that it was the highest wage in the 1994 survey.\\35\\ In support of using an inflation-adjusted TEGL \nmethodology, the comment asserted that the single problem identified in the NPRM with the TEGL methodology \nwas the lack of usable wage results from SWA surveys, which has resulted in wage stagnation. The comment \nfurther cited the 1994 sheep wage data cited in the NPRM as data identified by DOL ``as the last year for which \nsuch surveys were conducted with statistically valid results.'' The comment clarified that its proposal would set a \nnational rate for herders, except that if a State had a higher required rate, the State rate would apply. The \nassociations justified a national rate on the basis that given that living expenses would be paid by the employer, \ndifferences in the cost of living in various states need not be considered. ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------ \\35\\ Arizona had the highest wage in 1994, and it was $820/ month. 80 FR at 20307. ----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------- For this approach, the associations recommended adjusting the 1994 \nTEGL wages using a capped version of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for wages and \n\n\n\nsalaries (ECI), with a three year transition followed by full implementation in year four.\\36\\ The comment stated that \nthe ECI is ``the [[Page 62993]] most accurate measure of inflation in wages and salaries.'' \\37\\ The comment \nsuggested that, in each year, the 1994 wage rate should be adjusted by 1.5 percent if the percentage increase in \nthe ECI during the previous calendar year was less than 1.5 percent; by the percentage increase in the ECI if such \npercentage was between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, inclusive; or by 2.5 percent if the percentage increase in the \nECI exceeded that amount.\\38\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ In a pre-NPRM \ncomment submitted by ASI, Western Range, and Mountain Plains, the associations recommended using the ECI for \ntotal compensation and capping it at 2 percent. \\37\\ See, e.g., Russer, John W., The Employment Cost Index: What \nis it?, Monthly Labor Review (Sept. 2001), available at            http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/09/art1full.pdf. \\38\\ \nThe commenters borrowed this formula from the W-agriculture visa program proposed in Section 2232 of the \nBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744, 113th Congress (2013), \npassed by the Senate in 2013. The associations note that that program, including the wage rate applicable to that \nprogram, was the result of negotiations between employer representatives and farmworkers. ------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------- As further support for this approach, the associations noted that the wage rate in \n2019 under this recommendation, which would be above $1,350 per month, would be consistent with the wage that \none of the Mendoza plaintiffs stated in court filings would be acceptable in order to permit him to resume herding. \nThe named plaintiff, Reymundo Mendoza, stated that he would ``be willing to work as a herder if the employer paid \n$1,300 to $1,500 per month,'' along with other benefits not required by this Final Rule, including paid vacation. \nOther plaintiffs in that litigation quoted higher rates necessary in order for them to return to herding, such as the \nminimum wage for all hours worked, or $12.50 per hour. All of the plaintiffs in that action requested additional \nbenefits in excess of those required by this Final Rule in order to resume herding. The second alternative \nrecommended by these associations, which was also endorsed by ASI and many individual employers, was to use \nthe Federal minimum wage, multiplied by the estimate in the NPRM of 44 hours per week, to establish a monthly \nrequired wage. This alternative was also presented with a three-year transition period, with full implementation in \nyear four. As with its first recommendation, if a higher State wage was required, it would apply. This comment \nstates: If DOL is determined to transition away from a survey-based monthly salary in favor of a monthly salary \nusing the 44-hour week estimate and a base wage rate, Commenters submit that the Federal Minimum Wage of \n$7.25/hour is a more reasonable starting point than the Farm Labor Survey based AEWRs. . . . Since many of these \nherds and workers travel across state lines, because food, housing, and clothing are already provided for free, and \nin order to create a more uniform process, Commenters would propose this single monthly rate in all states, except \nto the extent that the California or Oregon state statutes or judicial settlements require a higher rate already. While \nthis will place a greater burden on employers in some states more than others, the FLSA wage rate applies \nuniformly across the nation and serves as a model for this proposal. As with their first recommendation, the \nassociations cited an affidavit from the Mendoza litigation, in which one of the plaintiffs stated that he would return \nto herding if a wage rate of $1,300-1,500 per month, plus other benefits, was offered. As with their first proposal, the \nassociations recommended use of the same ECI methodology to adjust future wage rates if DOL remained \nconcerned about the potential for wage stagnation. In addition to these two primary recommendations, two \ncommenters suggested that DOL use the California herder wage to set wages in the program. An electric fencing \nsupplier for commercial sheep ranches expressed the view that California's wage ``leads the trend'' in wages and \nasked DOL to use California's wage for all employers. The Chairman of ASI's Legislative Action Council similarly \nstated that Oregon and California wages provided useful ``reference'' points. The Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment similarly used the California wage as evidence that herding employers could remain viable while paying a \nwage significantly above those currently required under the TEGLs. Other commenters viewed the California wage \nrate less favorably. Without offering evidence in support, one individual employer stated that the higher California \nwage rate had been ``detrimental'' to the herding industry. Western Range and Mountain Plains asserted, again \nwithout evidence to support the assertion, that the California wage rate had forced employers to reduce the size of \ntheir businesses, hire fewer U.S. and foreign workers, and ask remaining workers to take on additional duties. \nThese associations stated that proposed wage rates in the NPRM would be even more problematic because \nworkers would be required to be paid significantly more but permitted to perform fewer duties. We also received \nseveral alternate recommendations from individual commenters, which were not supported by other comments. \nOne sheep herding employer stated its operation could afford a wage rate of up to $2,500/month, although no \nmethodology or data was provided in support of the $2,500 figure. Based on the employer's belief that U.S. \n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/09/art1full.pdf\n\n\nworkers will not apply for herder jobs, another employer recommended that DOL set a higher wage rate for \ndomestic workers as compared to foreign workers, stating that this ``would address the Secretary's statutory \nresponsibility to consider the domestic workers without challenging the viability of the businesses offering \nemployment.'' Finally, a documentary filmmaker recommended that DOL compare the wage rates in States where \nlarge numbers of foreign workers abandon H-2A work with wage rates in States with lower levels of abandonment \nto determine the appropriate wage. ii. Discussion of Alternatives and Decision To Use Federal Minimum Wage as \nBase As discussed above, DOL received a number of comments asking DOL to retain the current TEGL \nmethodology for setting wages or to let the market establish wage rates for these occupations. Neither of these \nrecommendations is viable or consistent with the Department's statutory obligation to protect against adverse effect \non U.S. workers. As explained in detail above and in the NPRM, SWA surveys no longer provide sufficient \ninformation to permit DOL to use their results to set the AEWR for these occupations, and the persistent lack of \nwage results has led to wage stagnation that may result in adverse effect to U.S. workers. Nor can the ``market'' \nset wages for these workers. The requirement that DOL protect against adverse effect is based on Congressional \nrecognition that bringing in foreign labor has the potential to distort the market for these occupations, and a \nnegotiation between a foreign worker with little bargaining power and a U.S. employer would invariably lead to a \nwage below what a U.S. worker would accept. For similar reasons, we will not base the wage rate in this Final Rule \non whether wages are so low that even foreign workers abandon employment, because such a rate would still be \nsubstantially below that which a U.S. worker could be expected to accept. Further, we decline to adopt a two-tiered \nsystem by which U.S. workers must be offered a higher wage rate than that offered to foreign workers. To do so \nwould disincentive the hiring of U.S. workers, and would institutionalize a second tier of foreign workers willing to \naccept wages below that required for U.S. workers, thus creating the adverse effect on U.S. workers we must \navoid. Further, the three primary employer associations have proposed setting the wage based on a methodology \nthat will result in wages significantly above the current TEGL rates. The employer [[Page 62994]] associations' \nproposals acknowledge that employers in livestock production can absorb a substantial wage increase, which we \nview as compelling evidence that the industry will remain viable even where employers pay a significantly higher \nwage rate to employees in these occupations. This acknowledgment is consistent with the fact that employers in \nOregon and California are currently paying higher wages, and the industry remains viable at those rates in those \nStates. This conclusion is further consistent with the historic pricing data provided by the Utah Governor's Office \nand American Farm Bureau, which, overall and considering variations from year to year, reflect that increases in the \nprices of livestock commodities (e.g., wool and lamb) have outpaced any increases wages. For several reasons, we \ndecline to adopt the associations' first recommendation to index the 1994 TEGL data. First, this recommendation \nwas based on a mischaracterization of the 1994 TEGL data as the ``last year for which such surveys were \nconducted with statistically valid results.'' The NPRM cited the 1994 TEGL data not because it was the last year that \nthe SWA survey produced statistically valid results, but rather because it was the earliest year for which there was \ndocumented wage data when we published the NPRM.\\39\\ In any event, the Department no longer has access to \nthe underlying wage survey data for any of these historic wage rates to determine how many U.S. workers were \nincluded in any of these early surveys or otherwise assess their validity. Given that many commenters discuss the \npersistent lack of U.S. workers in these occupations for decades, and the absence of any data to assess an \nappropriate year and wage rate to index, we are concerned that continued reliance on the TEGL wages, even in \nindexed form, would be inconsistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect on U.S. workers.\\40\\ ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\39\\ Since publication of the NPRM, we have located \nadditional data for 1990, and Vermillion and Midland submitted partial data for 1981 with their comments. \\40\\ We \nalso view a single employer's statement that it could afford to pay $2,500/month as an insufficient basis to set the \nAEWR at that rate. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, we decline to adopt the \nalternate recommendations to use the California wage rate to set the national AEWR. We agree, despite differing \nopinions of some commenters, that the California and Oregon wage rates provide evidence that employers can \nafford a significantly higher wage rate for these occupations than is currently paid, and can do so without job losses. \nDespite Mountain Plains and Western Range's assertion that the salary paid by California has led employers to \nreduce the number of U.S. and H-2A workers employed, this assertion not supported by any evidence. Labor \ncertification data from 2013 and 2014 shows that California remains the second largest user of the herding special \nprocedures. In any event, the California sheep herder wage rate is set through State law, Cal. Labor Code \n2695.2(a)(2), and undoubtedly reflects local considerations that may not be appropriately applied across the other \n\n\n\nStates where employing sheep, goat, and cattle herders typically are employed, which generally have lower wage \nrates than California.\\41\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ See            \nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Instead, in \nview of the necessity to exercise our discretion in setting the wage rate, we view using the current Federal minimum \nwage rate of $7.25 per hour (which will be adjusted annually based on the ECI), multiplied by an 48 hours per week, \nto be a more reasonable basis on which to set the AEWR for several reasons.\\42\\ First, we agree with the Joint \nWorker Advocates' Comment that the persistent lack of workers in these occupations is likely due in part to the \nfact that U.S. workers can earn at least the federal minimum wage elsewhere, so if the new herder wage at least \nmeets the hourly Federal minimum wage, more U.S. workers will likely be available.\\43\\ We further note that, \nalthough requesting additional non-wage benefits, three of the four Mendoza plaintiffs, all U.S. workers, stated that \nthey would return to herding if offered either the wage that results from our methodology or the minimum wage rate \n(although one qualified that he was seeking the minimum wage for all hours worked). Second, we agree with \nMountain Plains and Western Range that because many of these workers travel across State lines, and because \nmost living expenses are required to be provided from the employer free of charge, a single national rate is \nappropriate, unless a higher State wage applies. We view the hourly wage requirement of the current Federal \nminimum wage as the logical, non-arbitrary starting point on which to base the calculation of a national monthly \nwage rate, which sets the herder hourly wage no lower than the hourly minimum wage required for all other jobs in \nthe U.S. economy is consistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect. Although $7.25 for each \nhour worked is generally a floor, using the $7.25 wage rate multiplied by 48 hours is reasonable in this \ncircumstance because of the necessity of setting a monthly wage and because employers must provide housing \nand food without charge to workers in these occupations. Thus it is a reasonable exercise of DOL discretion and \nconsistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect to set the wage rate as $7.25 times 48 hours. -----\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ The hourly calculation is discussed below. \\43\\ Although \nthey did not support the use of the Federal minimum wage to set the herder wage, the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment attributed the scarcity of U.S. workers in these occupations to the availability of the minimum wage in \nother occupations stating, ``the sustained scarcity is no doubt in large part a function of the fact that U.S. workers \nhave the freedom to earn at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is substantially higher than \nthe herder minimum wage.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are borrowing the current \nfederal minimum wage rate for these occupations as the starting point for part of the new wage methodology, which \nwill be indexed, as discussed below, and we do so with full recognition that workers ``principally engaged in the \nrange production of livestock'' are not required to be paid the Federal minimum wage under 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(E). \nWe note that, in recommending use of the Federal minimum wage as the starting point for these calculations, the \nthree primary employer associations and many individual commenters have accepted the use of this wage rate as \nappropriate for calculating the wage rate for these occupations. Further, it is clear from the legislative history that \nthe exemption from the Federal minimum wage for these occupations is based not upon the wage rate itself, but \nrather on the remoteness of these occupations and the difficulty of tracking hours worked. See Hodgson v. Elk \nGarden Corp., 482 F.2d 529, 531-33 (4th Cir. 1973); Hodgson v. Mauldin, 344 F. Supp. 302, 313 (N.D. Ala. 1972), \naff'd by Brennan v. Mauldin, 478 F.2d 702 (5th Cir. 1973). Therefore, using the $7.25 per hour rate, multiplied by an \napproximation of hours to set a monthly salary, is consistent with the exemption or its purposes because it is not an \nhourly wage that requires hourly recordkeeping. This approach is also consistent with the way Oregon has \ninterpreted its own State laws for these occupations, which requires the State minimum wage to be multiplied by a \nset number of hours (the equivalent of approximately 40 hours per week) to establish the herder's minimum \nrequired salary. Or. Rev. Stat. [[Page 62995]] 653.020(1)(e), 653.010(9).\\44\\ Similarly, the California monthly sheep \nherder wage is adjusted each time the State hourly minimum wage rises by the same percentage as the minimum \nwage increase. See Cal. Labor Code. Sec. 2695.2(a)(2). The current California wage rate requires workers to be \npaid for the equivalent of approximately 41 hours per week based on the California minimum wage. ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------ \\44\\ See also Technical Assistance for Employers in Agriculture, available \nat            http://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx. -----------------------------------------------------------------\n---------- In order to prevent wage stagnation from again occurring, we have determined that the new base wage rate \nshould be subject to an adjustment methodology. We agree with those commenters who recommended that we use \nthe ECI for wages and salaries to address the potential for future wage stagnation. Our primary concern in setting \nthe adjustment methodology for these occupations is to confirm that the wages for these occupations will continue \n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm\nhttp://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx\n\n\nto rise apace with wages across the U.S. economy. Although the Department has previously used the Consumer \nPrice Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in other circumstances where adjustment for inflation is warranted, we \nconclude that it is reasonable to use the ECI for these occupations, given that housing and food must be provided \nby the employer under this Final Rule, making the cost of consumer goods less relevant than under circumstances \nin which workers are paying these costs themselves. However, we decline to adopt the minimum and maximum \nECI calculations provided by Western Range and Mountain Plains, which did not provide any economic rationale for \nthe imposition of a cap, and we will instead use the uncapped ECI to adjust wages, beginning with the rate for \ncalendar year 2017. The 1.5 percent minimum adjustment recommended by the employer associations is illusory, \nbecause the ECI has very rarely fallen below 1.5 percent since it was first used in 1981. On the other hand, the ECI \nhas often been above 2.5 percent. Accordingly, the methodology recommended by the employer associations \nwould typically be relevant only in circumstances where the ECI exceeds 2.5 percent. Placing a cap on the ECI-\nbased adjustment has the potential to produce wage stagnation; thus, to protect against adverse effect to U.S. \nworkers, we will not use a capped ECI to adjust wages because herders' wages should not be outpaced by \nchanges to the wages of workers across the U.S. economy in order to avoid adverse effect for U.S. workers. d. \nEstimate of Number of Hours per Week That Herders Work i. Comments on the Proposed Estimate of 44 Hours per \nWeek In order to set the monthly salary, the NPRM proposed a wage based on the estimate that herders work \napproximately 44 hours per week. This estimate was an average of the 40-hour-per-week estimate suggested by \nASI, Western Range, and Mountain Plains, and the 48-hour-per-week calculation submitted by Edward \nTuddenham, an attorney representing workers, both of which were submitted before publication of the NPRM. The \n40-hour calculation submitted by the employer associations was based on the calculation in the Zapata settlement. \nThe Tuddenham comment based the 48-hour calculation on estimates of hours submitted by employers on the \nForm ETA-9142A, which the comment characterized as a ``conservative'' estimate.\\45\\ This comment stated that \nthe 48-hour weighted average of employer-reported data from Form ETA-9142A is ``the most diverse data set \navailable'' on the number of hours worked by herders. The data reported hourly estimates from the two primary \nemployer associations, Mountain Plains (60 hours) and Western Range (40 hours), and is the only data source \nidentified by any commenter that includes data collected across States. ----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------- \\45\\ Tuddenham collected data from 195 applications for certification on which employers stated the \nnumber of hours per week that herders were expected to work. Data supplied in the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment replicated the Tuddenham analysis. Based on employer-reported hours on the Form ETA-9142A from \nsheep and goat herder applications filed between October 2013 and October 2014, the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment also concluded that the average number of worker hours was 48. ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------ Employers essentially agreed to the 44-hour estimate from the proposal. Although the pre-NPRM \nsubmission from Mountain Plains, Western Range, and ASI used a 40-hour calculation, Western Range and \nMountain Plains used DOL's compromise 44-hour calculation in their comment submitted in response to the NPRM, \nand that proposal was endorsed by ASI and many commenters. We received no other concrete estimate of hours \nfrom employers or their representatives, nor did these commenters suggest an alternative data source for an \nestimation of herders' work hours. Employers generally stated that the exact number of hours varied based on a \nnumber of factors, such as seasons and weather. Where they did provide estimates of hours, they were imprecise \n(for example, stating that herders generally work 4-6 hours per day). On the other hand, the Worker Advocates' \nJoint Comment objected to the 44-hour calculation from the proposal. While acknowledging that ``a monthly AEWR \nbased on average hourly totals will never be completely accurate,'' this comment pointed out that the 40-hour \ncalculation from the Zapata settlement did not appear to be based on any judicial finding that workers are actually \nengaged in work 40 hours per week, but rather was likely calculated as a salary derived from a standard 40-hour \nworkweek. They asserted further that employers have an incentive to under-report hours on the Form ETA-9142A \nin order to recruit workers, so that basing an hourly calculation on only employer- submitted data would be arbitrary \nand inconsistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect. In the commenters' view, DOL must \ntherefore either directly survey workers or, if that is not feasible because gathering data from remotely-located \nemployees is difficult, include data from existing worker surveys in establishing an estimate. Commenters cited \nonly a single worker survey, Overworked and Underpaid: H-2A Herders in Colorado, conducted by Colorado Legal \nServices, in which Legal Services surveyed 90 H-2A Colorado sheep herders about their pay.\\46\\ This study found \nthat 62 percent of herders actively worked at least 81 hours per week. Two individual employers expressly disputed \nthe methodology in the Colorado study, stating that it was not a reliable source and was based on biased questions \n\n\n\nfrom interviewers. In addition, a SWA employee commented that the 44-hour estimate was unrealistic given the \nrequirement to be available up to 24 hours a day, seven days per week, but did not offer an alternative \nrecommendation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ The Colorado study was attached \nto the comment, and is also available online at            \n\n2015 USDA release, the permissible deduction under this proposal would be $448.80 per month. ------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ See Official USDA Food Plans: Cost of Food at Home at Four Levels, \nU.S. Average, April 2015, available at            http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodApr2015.pdf. \n\\48\\ Under the USDA plan, the costs given are for individuals in 4-person families. For individuals in other size \nfamilies, the following adjustments are suggested: 1-person--add 20 percent; 2- person--add 10 percent; 3-person--\nadd 5 percent; 4-person--no adjustment; 5- or 6-person--subtract 5 percent; 7- (or more) person--subtract 10 \npercent. To calculate overall household food costs, (1) adjust food costs for each person in household and then (2) \nsum these adjusted food costs. See footnote directly above. -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- Other employers and associations supported some type of food deduction. For example, the comment from \nSiddoway Sheep suggested three alternatives for food deductions: (1) Deducting the cost of purchasing food on \neach employee's grocery list from that employee's wages, (2) a standard ranch-specific deduction based on \nannualized actual expenditures from the prior three year period, \\49\\ or (3) a standard industry-wide deduction \nequal to 128 percent of the liberal USDA Food Plan Cost, which the employer states is ``comparable to the actual \namount that we spend on meals.'' This employer stated that workers sometimes waste food and that requiring \nworkers to pay for food might reduce this incentive. Other commenters, including the Wyoming Farm Bureau \nFederation, offered more general support for the concept that either food costs should be deducted or wages \nshould be set at a level that reflects employer costs, including food and housing. ----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------- \\49\\ The comment cited two different amounts for its cost per worker: $476 per worker per \nmonth and $467 per month. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Vermillion and Midland stated \nthat a food deduction should be permitted for several reasons. The employers cited two legal ``precedents'' for its \nposition that a food deduction should be allowed, an administrative case \\50\\ and Section 3(m) of the FLSA, 29 \nU.S.C. 203(m), which generally permits deduction of the ``reasonable cost'' of ``board, lodging, or other facilities, if \nsuch board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer to his employees.'' 29 CFR \n531.2.\\51\\ The Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation and an individual employer asked DOL to clarify that employers \nwere not required to pay for items like soda and tobacco. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\\50\\ In the Matter of Western Range Association, 95-TLC-4 and 5 (1995). \\51\\ In addition, this comment stated that \nSWA surveys demonstrated that whether meals are required to be provided has a significant impact on the wage \nrate, stating that the 2010 Wyoming range rate was $1600, with deduction of board permitted, but in 2013, it was \n$875 with board required to be provided free of charge. We note that this change was actually based on a change \nin the State that was used to set the wage rate. The 2010 survey was based on a Wyoming survey, while the wage \nrate was later based on the Colorado survey due to insufficient data in a later year. ------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------- [[Page 62997]] On the other hand, several individual employers opposed a food \ndeduction. For example, one noted that payment of food by the employer is a ``longstanding practice of the \nindustry.'' Another stated that it would be difficult to calculate the cost of food provided to an individual worker when \nfood is delivered to a sheep camp containing multiple workers. Similarly, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment \nstated that food deductions should be permitted only if employers paid the full FLS-based AEWR required by the \nproposal at the end of the transition period, reasoning that once the wages of these workers were aligned with the \nwages in the rest of the H-2A program, the workers could afford their own food. This comment recommended that \nthe deduction be limited to the ordinary H-2A wage deduction. The Western Watersheds Project opposed any food \ndeductions. ii. Discussion This Final Rule maintains the current practice under the TEGLs for these industries, and \ndoes not permit employers to deduct the cost of food from workers' wages. The decision to use the $7.25 per hour \nrather than the full FLS-based AEWR, we think it is reasonable to disallow deduction from wages for the costs of \nproviding food to these workers. This is particularly true given that sheep and goat herding employers have \ncontinually been required under the TEGLs to provide food without cost to the workers, and cattle herding \nemployers have been required to pay these costs due to the wage finding in the SWA survey since 2013. In \naddition, as the pre-NPRM comment from ASI, Western Range, and Mountain Plains demonstrates, in adopting a \nlower base wage rate than the FLS-based AEWR, a food deduction would prevent DOL from fully addressing the \nwage stagnation in these occupations. Allowing a food deduction would offset a substantial amount of the benefit to \nthe workers of the increase in the wage rate and result in setting effective wages not significantly above the rates \nrequired two decades ago. The legal precedents cited by commenters do not suggest a different result. The \nadministrative case cited by Vermillion and Midland only states that those employers providing meals without \ncharge should be separately surveyed from those that do not, but takes no position on whether a food deduction \n\nhttp://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodApr2015.pdf\n\n\nshould or should not be permitted. Further, Section 3(m) of the FLSA applies only where the FLSA applies. \nAlthough a few commenters stated that California law permits a food deduction from its sheep herder wage, this is \nincorrect. California Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) Order No. 14-2001, Sec. 4(E), 10(F) (amended Jan., 1 \n2002) expressly bars employers of sheep herders from offsetting the required wage by meals or lodging and \nincorporates by reference the requirement under the H-2A special procedures for employers to pay for meals.\\52\\ In \naddition, Oregon does not appear to authorize a food deduction for workers exempt from the minimum wage. Or. \nRev. Stat. Sec. Sec. 653.020(1)(e), 653.010(9).\\53\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ \nAvailable at:            http://www.dir.ca.gov/Iwc/IWCArticle14.pdf; see also State of California, Department of \nIndustrial Relations: Minimum Wage FAQ, available at            http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm. \n\\53\\ See also Technical Assistance for Employers in Agriculture, available at            \nhttp://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nAs discussed above, applying a food deduction would substantially erode the wage increases in this Final Rule after \ndecades of wage stagnation, and is therefore inconsistent with DOL's statutory obligation under the INA. Finally, in \nresponse to comments, we clarify that the employer is only required to pay for sufficient and adequate food, and \nwater, as discussed in Sections IV.B. and E. in the preamble related to Sec. Sec. 655.210(e) and 655.235, and is \nnot required to provide workers with other items, such as tobacco or soda, free of charge, although the employer is \nfree to do so. f. The Transition Period i. Comments Given the size of the wage increase in the NPRM, we proposed \na four-year transition with full implementation in year five. 80 FR at 20310. Under the proposal, wages would have \nbeen set at 60 percent of the full wage rate in year one, 70 percent in year two, 80 percent in year three, and 90 \npercent in year four. In proposing this approach in the NPRM, we reasoned that a transition period was needed in \norder to avoid the unintended consequence of significant job losses that could be prevented by a gradual \nimplementation. Both the primary Mountain Plains and Western Range recommendations supported a transition, \nmirroring DOL's concerns in the NPRM about significant job losses if the wage increase were implemented \nimmediately. For each proposal, Mountain Plains and Western Range recommended a three-year transition, with \nfull implementation in year four. For their proposal to use an indexed TEGL wage rate, they proposed to start at 80 \npercent of the fully adjusted wage; for their proposal to use the FLSA minimum wage, they proposed to start at 75 \npercent of the adjusted wage. The comment did not provide for any inflation adjustments to the FLSA-based wage \nuntil after full implementation, and did not explain the basis of that recommendation. Several individual employers \nand associations, including the Colorado Wool Growers Association, asked for a longer transition period than \nproposed if the FLS-based AEWR was used to establish the monthly rate. Conversely, the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment stated that a transition to a new wage could not be squared with DOL's statutory obligation to protect \nagainst adverse effect. This comment asserted that no transition of new wage rates was appropriate given the long \nhistory of wage stagnation, which, as discussed above, they attributed to DOL's policy of using SWA survey results \nand implementation of those results. As discussed above, they cited wage rates for several occupations that do not \nprimarily involve range work, were below the FLS-based AEWR, or were based on sample sizes too small for the \nSWA to report a wage. They also cited the current California sheep herder wage rate for the proposition that \nemployers could immediately adjust to the full FLS-based AEWR. This comment stated that a transition would \ncause adverse effect to U.S. workers employed as ranch hands by permitting a much lower wage to be paid for \nsimilar work. It further asserted that DOL provided no ``empirical support'' for the need for a transition in the NPRM, \nand asked DOL to consider the scope of previous wage stagnation from the SWA surveys as the basis to reject any \ntransition period, or at least in deciding what percentage level to set the wage during a transition period. Several \nother comments from the Western Watersheds Projects and a few individual commenters stated, without additional \nelaboration, that the proposed wage rates should apply immediately. ii. Discussion The wage increase under this \nFinal Rule is less than under the proposal, but it remains significant; the final wage rate approximately doubles the \ncurrent required wage rate for sheep herders in a number of States. For the reasons discussed above, consistent \nwith our decision to use an alternative to the FLS-based AEWR to set the monthly AEWR, we conclude that the \ndata submitted in the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment does not require immediate implementation of the new \nwage. Although the California wage [[Page 62998]] provides some evidence that a higher wage can be tolerated, \nwe note that the current California rate was implemented over a number of years, and therefore does not provide \nstrong evidence that employers outside of California can absorb a significant increase quickly without job \nlosses.\\54\\ As discussed above, we disagree with several of the conclusions raised by the Worker Advocates' Joint \nComment about DOL's conduct in administering the SWA surveys, but agree that the lack of wage results from U.S. \n\nhttp://www.dir.ca.gov/Iwc/IWCArticle14.pdf;\nhttp://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm\nhttp://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_taagric.aspx\n\n\nworkers in the surveys has led to wage stagnation for these occupations. -------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------- \\54\\ The California wage rate was first established in 2001 at a rate of $1050 per month. See \nCalifornia IWC Order No. 14-2001, Sec. 4(E). Adjustments are now made to the California monthly sheep herder \nwage rate each time the State hourly minimum wage increases (with the monthly wage increased by the same \npercentage as the State hourly minimum wage increase). Cal. Lab. Code 2695.2(a)(2). -------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------- In light of the scope of the increase and the economic data provided by commenters, \nwe conclude that a limited transition period to the new wage is necessary. However, we recognize that any \ntransition must not be longer than necessary to prevent adverse effect. As a result, this Final Rule requires a two-\nyear transition (rather than the four years proposed, or the three years recommended by Mountain Plains and \nWestern Range) with full implementation in year three. A transition is particularly needed given that the new wage \nrate must be paid by all employers one month after publication of the Final Rule, even if the employer is operating \nunder a current certification, as provided in the discussion above related to paragraph 655.211(a). In addition, \nconsistent with the consensus proposal submitted by Mountain Plains and Western Range, we will require the \nwages to be set at higher percentage levels during the transition years than those proposed, with 80 percent of the \nfull wage rate required in year one and 90 percent in year two. This methodology requires employers to pay more \nthan half of the required increase in in the first year of implementation. The Western Range and Mountain Plains \nproposal did not apply any inflation adjustment until after the transition period in their proposal. We conclude that \nthis is inconsistent with DOL's obligation to protect against adverse effect, because it would result in wage rates in \nfuture years being lower than if no transition had been applied. Accordingly, after setting the wage rate in year one, \nwe will begin to apply the ECI adjustment in year two so that wages in future years will not be reduced by DOL's \ndecision to apply a transition period. D. Filing, Processing and Post-Acceptance Procedures 1. Sec. 655.215 \nProcedures for Filing Herding and Range Livestock Applications a. Geographic Scope, Who May File, What To File \nThe TEGLs provide a variance from the geographic scope limitations applicable to Applications for Temporary \nEmployment Certification filed under the standard H-2A regulations, specifically the geographic limitations of 20 \nCFR 655.132(a) for H-2ALCs and 20 CFR 655.131(b) for master applications. The variance set out in the TEGLs \npermits an employer (whether an individual, an association, or an H-2A Labor Contractor) engaged in range herding \nor livestock production to file an application and Form ETA-790 covering work locations in multiple areas of \nintended employment and within one or more States. The TEGLs require those employers to include an attachment \nlisting the locations, estimated start and end dates, and the names and contact information of all employers where \nwork will be performed under the job order when filing an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification. \nEmployers are expected to identify the locations with as much geographic specificity as possible in order to apprise \npotential U.S. workers of where the work will be performed and to ensure recruitment in all areas of intended \nemployment. The NPRM proposed continuing the TEGLs' approach to the geographic scope of work permitted in \nApplications for Temporary Employment Certification, which would allow applications for both range herding and \nproduction of livestock positions to encompass work in multiple areas of intended employment and in more than two \ncontiguous States, and require the employer to submit a work location list with its application. The Department did \nnot receive any comments directly addressing the proposal related to geographic scope limitations for job orders \nand applications. However, we continue to recognize the transient nature of range herding and livestock production \nwork, as was apparent in other comments received and has been long recognized by the Department. Accordingly, \nwe have adopted this provision in the Final Rule without change. For master applications, the TEGL covering sheep \nand goat herding range workers, but not the TEGL for range livestock production workers, allows an association \nfiling as a joint-employer with its members to submit annually a single Form ETA-790 for a master job order directly \nwith the NPC that identifies all included employer-members, dates of work, and work locations and will remain open \nyear-round, unless modifications are required. The employer-members included in the sheep or goat herding \nmaster job order are not required to have the same date of need, which is a variance from the date of need \nrequirement in the standard H-2A regulations, at 20 CFR 655.131(b). Because the TEGL covering range workers \nengaged in livestock production does not include this variance, an agricultural association filing a master application \nseeking range livestock production workers must submit a new Form ETA- 790 to the appropriate SWA in advance \nof filing each H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification, and that job order may only include \nemployer-members who share the same date of need. In the NPRM, we proposed to allow an agricultural \nassociation filing a master application for a range occupation eligible for processing under these rules to include \nemployer-members with different dates of need in a single application and job order. This proposal would expand \n\n\n\ncurrent practice for sheep and goat herding employers to livestock production employers. We also proposed to \nretain as a variance only for sheep and goat herding positions the allowance for an association to submit a single \nForm ETA-790 for a master job order annually. The Department did not receive comments addressing the filing \nprocedures in proposed Sec. 655.215, and we adopt the provision largely as proposed. Specifically, the Final Rule \nadopts without change the proposed provisions identifying the forms and documents range employers must submit \nto the NPC and allowing employer-members with different dates of need to be included in a single master \napplication, regardless of whether the job order and application involves range sheep or goat herding or other range \nlivestock production. The Final Rule also adopts without change the provision allowing annual submission of Form \nETA-790 for master application job orders for range sheep and goat herding occupations, unless the job order \nrequires modification. We conclude that these filing procedures [[Page 62999]] will increase consistency of \nprocessing job orders and applications for range occupations. For greater clarity, however, we have made a minor \ndeletion from proposed Sec. 655.215(b)(2); we have removed the word ``total'' in both places that it appeared in this \nprovision regarding the period of need identified on an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification \nand Form ETA-790 submitted for processing. The dates of need identified on all Applications for Temporary \nEmployment Certification and job orders must be continuous, making the ``total'' term unnecessary. As we have \nstated above, this section of the Final Rule contains the only variances the Department is making from the general \nH-2A filing procedures for eligible employers seeking workers in range herding and production of livestock \noccupations. Unless specifically addressed in these provisions, employers must comply with the processing \nprocedures in the standard H-2A regulations, at 20 CFR 655.130-655.132. b. Period of Need i. Background The \nrange livestock production TEGL does not address the period of need an employer must identify on its H-2A \nApplication for Temporary Employment Certification. As a result, these employers must demonstrate that the period \nof need identified on the application satisfies the temporary, seasonal need standard in the standard H-2A \nregulations, at 20 CFR 655.103(d). The range sheep and goat herding TEGL, however, permits an employer \nseeking temporary range sheep or goat herders to identify a period of need of up to 364 days and provides for year-\nround posting of master job orders. The NPRM proposed continuing the TEGLs' distinction between sheep and \ngoat herder employers' period of need and the period of need allowed for the range production of livestock. Thus, \nthe NPRM proposed allowing employers of range sheep and goat herders to identify a period of need of up to 364 \ndays on the H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification and for the Form ETA-790 for a master job \norder to be submitted once annually. In addition, the NPRM proposed allowing employers of range livestock \nproduction workers to identify a period of need of up to 10 months and proposed to require a separate, application-\nspecific Form ETA-790, including those associated with master applications, to be filed with each H-2A Application \nfor Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A, as described in proposed Sec. Sec. 655.205 and \n655.215. Also as set out in the NPRM, the proposed continuation of this distinction between range occupations for \nthe purposes of the period of need was intended to maintain overall consistency with the standard H-2A regulations, \nat 20 CFR 655.103(d), and at the same time preserve the unique history of and experience with range sheep and \ngoat production employers. The NPRM sought comment specifically on the issue of the temporary and seasonal \nnature of herder work, including the amount of time spent on the open range during a year. 80 FR at 20311. We \nasked about whether the unique characteristics of herding work exist year-round. Id. Specifically, we sought \ncomment about ``whether sheep and goat herding involve distinct temporary positions at different times of the year \nthat require more than one certification to reflect distinct temporary and/or seasonal needs under the INA.'' 80 FR at \n20303. The NPRM noted that we would consider the application of a similar 10-month limitation to sheep and goat \nherders, to reflect more appropriately their temporary or seasonal need as required by the INA. Id. We asked \nseveral specific questions about seasonal or cyclical variations in herder work, worktime spent on the range versus \nthe ranch, and duties performed during the different periods, among other questions. 80 FR at 20303. ii. Comments \non Temporary Need Many comments by employers of sheep and goat herders indicate that they use the 364-day \nmaximum period of need permitted under current practice. Several employer comments indicate that they re-\nemploy the same H-2A workers over the years. Mountain Plains and Western Range urged the retention of the \n364-day limit on sheep and goat herding, and suggested the extension of the cattle herding limit from 10 to 12 \nmonths, because ``[a]ll of these animals require year-round care[.]'' However, this comment was somewhat vague \nabout any particular seasonal demands of the work: The general response [to the NPRM questions about the \nseasonal nature of the work] is that the work is performed on an ``as the need arises'' basis, and there is no single \ndescription of a worker's typical day. The work is defined first and foremost by the needs of the animals in the \n\n\n\nherder's care. During lambing, kidding, and calving season, the days are longer and the work is focused on the \nhealthy birthing of new animals. Those duties occur at certain times of the year according to the natural cycles of \nthe seasons and the animals. In parts of the West, employers use fixed structures (known as ``sheds'') to keep \nlivestock and their offspring safe and healthy during the birthing process. Other ranches perform birthing in open-air \npastures. The amount of time spent assisting with this phase depends on the natural conditions of the male and \nfemale livestock. The associations explain that the work is not only performed on an ```as needed'' basis, but it is \nalso highly dependent on the weather conditions. The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment included a brief \nstatement supporting separate certifications for the range production of sheep and goats over the 364-day period of \nneed: We applaud DOL for requesting comments on whether more than one H-2A labor certification period should \nbe necessary for workers who tend sheep and herd goats. The best way to protect the wages and working \nconditions of U.S. workers is to have two separate certification periods, one for the birthing period in the spring, \nwhich takes place on the ranch, and one for the open range season which lasts from summer through winter. \nBecause the spring birthing period involves no open range tasks, jobs during this season should fall under the \nnormal H-2A regulations, not the proposed special regulations for open range herders. One of the most informative \ncomments on the nature of herder work and its seasonality was from Siddoway Sheep Company. This comment \nclearly delineated the seasonal aspects of herder work, at least with respect to this particular ranch. In the winter, \nthe work on the ranch is devoted to lambing (some ranches conduct lambing operations later in the spring, \nsometimes on the open range, and others conduct it in sheds on or by the base ranch). The Siddoway Ranch \nconducts lambing in sheds. In January, herders bring the flock closer to the base ranch, and as the herders move \ndown from the winter range, they move into the bunkhouse. Lambing begins in mid-February. Workers are \nengaged in lambing activities at the base ranch for eight to ten weeks. During the next season--spring grazing--\nherders move into mobile housing, also called a ``sheep camp.'' During the spring grazing season, herders move \nthe sheep away from the base ranch toward the summer range, and this period lasts for eight to ten weeks. By the \nfirst day of summer, the herders begin to move the sheep to the high mountain meadows for summer grazing. \nDuring summer grazing, herders move from the ``sheep camps'' into outfitter tents. By mid-September, herders \nbegin to move the sheep down from the mountains for fall grazing, and to separate the market sheep from the rest \nof the herd. The herders move back into the sheep camps. The sheep are bred in October, during the fall grazing \nperiod. Once the [[Page 63000]] sheep are bred, the herders and the flock return to the base camp for the winter. \nThe lambing preparations begin again in January. According to Siddoway's practice, the fall grazing period, which is \napproximately 20 weeks, is the least labor intensive and is the best time for employees to return to their home \nabroad or otherwise take an extended vacation. iii. Discussion We have decided to retain the limitations on period \nof need contained in the TEGLs and proposed in the NPRM. As a result, Sec. 655.215(b)(2) requires that the period \nof need for the range production of cattle must be no more than ten months, which is consistent generally with the \nstandard H-2A maximum period of need, and the period of need for range production of sheep and goats must be \nno longer than 364 days. We make this decision after considering several factors. First, Section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) \nof the INA permits aliens to obtain H-2A visas to come ``temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural \nlabor or services . . . of a temporary or seasonal nature.'' 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a). Section 101 does not define \n``temporary'' work for purposes of H-2A visas, nor does it indicate how long a position may last and still qualify as \n``temporary'' work. The legislative history of the INA is silent about the expected duration of ``temporary'' work. \nUnder current regulations issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), in order to obtain an H-2A visa, an employer must establish that \nemployment is either seasonal or temporary, which, except in extraordinary circumstances, should last no longer \nthan one year. 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(iv)(a). DOL's H-2A regulation on this point is consistent with the DHS regulation. \n20 CFR 655.103(d). Therefore, neither the statute nor the agencies' regulations proscribe the 364-day period of \nneed applicable to the range production of sheep and goats. Second, we have relied for decades on the unique \nhistory and experience of sheep herding in the U.S. to support the 364-day period of need for sheep ranchers. This \nhistory was discussed in great detail in both the NPRM, 80 FR at 20301-20302, and the TEGL governing sheep and \ngoat production, and we see no reason to rescind our reliance on this aspect of these jobs to shorten the period of \nneed. Finally, we have reviewed and considered all the comments on this subject, and it is clear that both the \nranchers and the herders they employ are well accustomed to the longer period of need for range production of \nsheep and goats, and that shortening it would be disruptive to the livelihoods of employers and employees alike. c. \nComments on Filing Procedures Addressing Issues Outside the Scope of the Rulemaking We received several \n\n\n\ncomments on post-certification procedures that were beyond the scope of this rulemaking. First, Mountain Plains \nand Western Range requested clarification about the post-certification ability of an agricultural association filing a \nmaster application to transfer workers between employer-members as needed during the certified period. Similarly, \nEph Jensen Livestock, LLC also commented on the value of an association's ability to transfer workers among \nemployer-members on a master application job order. As the Mountain Plains and Western Range comment \npointed out, the INA allows a master application certified under the H-2A program to be used for the job \nopportunities of any of the employer-members that were disclosed in the master job order, and hired workers may \nbe transferred among the employer-members to perform the services for which the certification was granted. 8 \nU.S.C. 1188(d)(2). This statutory authority, which has not changed, applies to all master applications filed under the \nH-2A program, not only those for range sheep and goat herders. Although the range sheep and goat herding TEGL \nincluded discussion of this INA provision, and explained the Department's expectations where an agricultural \nassociation engages in worker transfers, the allowance is not a variance from standard rules. As it is not a variance \napplicable only to the applications eligible for filing under the herding and range livestock regulations, it is outside \nthe scope of this rulemaking. The Department also received comments from two employers, Maltsberger Ranch \nand Cherry Ranch, suggesting changes to H-2A visa duration and the Department's general processing timeline for \nH-2A applications. McPherrin Damboriena Sheep Co. also expressed the difficulty of aligning visas with actual \nemployment dates. The Department considers these comments beyond the scope of the proposed rule, because \nthey raise issues that cannot be resolved through this regulatory process, which addresses only H-2A range \napplications, and are therefore not within the scope of this rule. 2. Section 655.220--Processing Herding and Range \nLivestock Applications for Temporary Employment Certification The TEGLs do not provide variances from the \nprocessing procedures in the standard H-2A regulations at 20 CFR 655.140-655.145, except as necessary to \naccommodate the variances provided for master job orders for range sheep and goat herding occupations, which \nare submitted annually to the NPC and posted with the SWA year-round, unlike other job orders. Because the \nDepartment proposed in the NPRM to shift the timing and location of filing the Form ETA-790 for range occupation \njob orders from a pre-filing submission to the SWA to concurrent filing to the NPC, we also proposed variations to \nthe standard processing procedures to the extent necessary to reflect the NPC's processing of Forms ETA-790 \nreceived with Applications for Temporary Employment Certification for these occupations. The Department \nproposed that, when the Certifying Officer (CO) determines that an application and job order meet all regulatory \nrequirements, the CO would notify the employer and transmit a copy of the Form ETA-790 to any one of the SWAs \nwith jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites so that recruitment can begin. When an agricultural association filed \na master application and Form ETA-790 on behalf of its employer-members, the NPRM proposed the CO would \ntransmit a copy of the Form ETA-790 to the SWA with jurisdiction over the association's location. The CO's \nnotification would also direct the SWA receiving the Form ETA-790 copy to place the job order promptly in intrastate \nand interstate clearance, including forwarding the application to all States where work will be performed. In addition, \nthe NPRM included a proposed provision intended to clarify how the electronic job registry requirement at 20 CFR \n655.144(b) (i.e., H-2A job orders must be posted in OFLC's electronic job registry until 50 percent of the work \ncontract period has elapsed) would apply to a job order approved for an agricultural association filing a master \napplication, given the different dates of need the NPRM proposed be permitted for individual employer-members \nwithin a single master job order. Specifically, the Department proposed that we would keep the master job order \nposted on the electronic job registry until 50 percent of the work contract period had elapsed for all employer- \nmembers identified on the job order (i.e., the 50 percent period [[Page 63001]] would be measured based on the \nemployer-member with the last date of need). The Department did not receive comments addressing these \nproposed provisions, and we are adopting them unchanged in the Final Rule. These provisions establish a clear, \nconsistent processing framework for applications and job orders for eligible range employers. This section of the \nFinal Rule contains the only variances the Department is making from the general H-2A processing procedures for \neligible employers seeking workers in range herding and production of livestock occupations. Unless specifically \naddressed in these provisions, employers must comply, as they do currently, with the processing procedures in 20 \nCFR 655.140-655.145. 3. Section 655.225--Post-Acceptance Requirements for Herding and Range Livestock The \nTEGL for range livestock production occupations provides no variances from the standard rule's post-acceptance \nprocedures in the standard H-2A regulations, at 20 CFR 655.150-655.158. The TEGL for range sheep and goat \nherding occupations, however, provides a variance from the newspaper advertisement requirement in the standard \nH-2A regulations, at 20 CFR 655.151, and clarifies the Department's expectations for an agricultural association's \n\n\n\nhandling of referrals and U.S. applicants responding to master job orders involving multiple employer-members. In \nthe NPRM, the Department proposed to expand almost all of the range sheep and goat herding TEGL's variances \nto encompass range livestock production occupations as well. The proposed rule waived the requirement for the \nplacement of an advertisement on two separate days in a newspaper of general circulation as provided in the \nstandard H-2A regulations, at 20 CFR 655.151. The NPRM also included a proposed provision intended to clarify \nthat master application job orders for herding and range livestock employers would be handled in the same way \nOFLC handles other job orders approved for an association of agricultural employers filing a master application as a \njoint employer on behalf of its employer-members; the CO would direct the SWAs to keep the job order on its active \nfile until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed for all employer-members identified on the \napproved job order. Moreover, the NPRM proposed to expand and codify an association's obligation to \naccommodate U.S. workers' worksite location preference to all master job orders for range occupations eligible for \nprocessing under this rule. Finally, the NPRM included a proposed provision intended to clarify that an association \nhandling the recruitment requirements for its employer-members must maintain a recruitment report containing the \ninformation required by 20 CFR 655.156 in a manner that allows the Department to see the recruitment results for \neach employer-member identified on the H-2A application and approved job order. We received several comments \non these issues. Mountain Plains, Western Range and the SBA Office of Advocacy commented that employers \nengaged in range herding and livestock production cannot find qualified and available U.S. workers to fill their \npositions despite employers' efforts. ASI indicated that the labor demographics changed in the 1980s and 1990s, \nafter which time the industry has not been able to find U.S. workers who were interested or had a background in \nherding. Western Range stated that in 2012 only 22 U.S. workers applied for approximately 1,000 sheepherder \npositions with its employer-members, and of those 22 applicants, only 2 were considered qualified and ultimately \nhired. However, Western Range reported that neither of the two U.S. workers hired completed the work contract \nperiod. Mountain Plains stated that, in 2014, its employer-members sought to hire workers for more than 1,000 \nrange sheep and goat herding, range livestock production, sheep shearing, and wool grading positions. Of the two \nqualified U.S. workers who applied, one was not interested in the job and the other was hired but didn't complete \nthe work contract. The Department also received a number of comments from other employers, professional \nassociations, and private citizens generally noting the unavailability of U.S. workers. These comments noted that \ndespite recruitment efforts, U.S. workers are not interested in range herding and production of livestock jobs, and \nthat those who do express initial interest tend to not complete a season. One commenter indicated that U.S. \nworkers are not willing to work more than 40 hours a week. A different commenter indicated that the shortage of \nboth sheep shearers and shepherds is not just limited to the United States, but is worldwide. Another commenter \nindicated that the domestic labor force is drawn instead to higher paying job sectors, such as oil and gas, where \njobs are prevalent in the West. Another employer noted low unemployment rates in her State, and indicated that her \nbusiness hires interns through a trade association, the Navajo Nation, and from local colleges, but that these \nworkers are available only on an ad hoc basis, and do not provide a stable and consistent labor force. In addition, a \nnumber of commenters generally urged the Department to maintain the status quo and keep the existing special \nprocedures for these occupations without change, expressing satisfaction with the existing program variances. The \nDepartment also received a comment from a SWA employee commenting as a private citizen, stating that \nemployers should be required to engage in maximum recruitment efforts and affirmatively request a referral report \nfrom the SWA. The commenter also asked the Department to address the commenter's perceived employer \npreference for foreign workers, the experience requirements in the job order, and the difficulty U.S. workers have \nto predict their availability a month or two in advance of the employer's start date. The commenter thus raised \nobligations applicable to all H-2A employers (including the prohibition against preferential treatment of foreign \nworkers and the timing of recruitment in advance of the employer's start date of need). All employers seeking H-2A \nworkers are required to conduct at least the recruitment activity the Department requires, and to cooperate with the \nSWA referring U.S. applicants. These obligations are not new or specific to these range employers. The commenter \ndid not suggest specific additional recruitment activity or suggest that newspaper advertisements should be retained \nas a requirement. We note that we address acceptable experience requirements for these range occupations in \nSection IV.B.2.a. of this preamble. None of the commenters disagreed with the Department's proposed position that \nnewspaper advertisements are impractical and ineffective recruitment tools for these range occupations. \nAccordingly, the Final Rule adopts the proposal to expand the current variance to newspaper advertisements to all \nrange occupations eligible for processing under this rule. After considering all the comments received on this \n\n\n\nsection, we have decided to retain the original Sec. 655.225 as proposed. Because both range herding and \nlivestock production cover multiple areas of intended employment in remote, inaccessible areas within one or more \nStates, and where fewer communities have newspapers, the newspaper advertisement is impractical [[Page \n63002]] and ineffective for recruiting domestic workers for these types of job opportunities. The CO will direct the \nSWAs to keep the job order on its active file until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed for all \nemployer-members identified on the approved job order. The SWA will refer all qualified U.S. workers to the \nassociation, and the association has an obligation to make every effort to accommodate a U.S. worker's worksite \nlocation preference (e.g., the location with an opening nearest to his or her place of residence). In addition, this \nFinal Rule clarifies that an association handling the recruitment requirements for its employer-members must \nmaintain a recruitment report containing the information as required under the standard H-2A regulation, at 20 CFR \n655.156, in a manner that allows the Department to see the recruitment results for each employer-member \nidentified on the H-2A application and approved job order. As we have done above, we note again that this section \nof the Final Rule contains the only variances the Department is making from the general post-acceptance \nprocedures in the standard H-2A regulations for eligible employers seeking workers in range herding and \nproduction of livestock occupations. Unless specifically addressed in these provisions, employers must comply with \nthe post-acceptance procedures in 20 CFR 655.150-655.158. E. Range Housing 1. Section 655.230 Range \nHousing \\55\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\55\\ The title to this section, which was \n``Mobile Housing'' in the NPRM, has been changed to ``Range Housing'' in the Final Rule for the reasons discussed \nin this section of the preamble. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a. Background The TEGLs \nrequire employers to provide free housing to H-2A and corresponding U.S. workers who are not reasonably able to \nreturn from their work location to their residence within the same day. Because of the transient nature of the work--\ngoing where the herd goes, often in remote areas at some distance from the employer's ranch or farm--the TEGLs \nrecognize that permanent housing is not feasible. Instead, the TEGLs recognize the need for housing that could be \nmoved from one area on the range to another. Under the practice permitted under the TEGLs, most workers were \nprovided a mobile camper that would be towed from one location to another as housing. Tents and other shelters \nwere also used for this purpose, typically where there was no practical alternative given limited accessibility by \nvehicle because of remoteness and terrain. In the NPRM, the Department proposed to include in this section the \nfollowing basic requirements that were established under the TEGLs: (1) Employers subject to this rule may use \nmobile housing where more permanent housing is not practicable because of the remote and changing location of \nthe employment or its terrain, or the worker is engaged in the production of livestock or activities minor, sporadic, \nand incidental to herding or production of livestock; (2) OSHA standards for range workers, if promulgated, must be \nfollowed; (3) the mobile housing must be inspected by state officials at least every three years, and, if certified as \nmeeting established standards, annually by the employer until the next scheduled state inspection; (4) if a worker is \nworking on or near the employer's ranch, farm, or other central facility (defined as within a reasonable distance for a \nworker to travel each night), the employer must provide the worker access to a toilet, kitchen, and a cleaning \nfacilities for the worker and his or her clothing, including showers with hot and cold water under pressure; and (5) \nwhere a worker is residing temporarily at the employer's fixed- site housing, rather than using his/her mobile \nhousing for this purpose, the fixed-site housing must meet the requirements of 20 CFR 655.122(d) (the housing \nstandards generally applicable to H-2A employment). The Department explained in the NPRM that since there are \nno specific OSHA standards for mobile housing on the range, employers were required to follow the requirements \nestablished by the TEGLs and that the Department proposed to include these requirements, with some \nmodifications, in this section and section 655.235. The Department invited specific comment on whether an \nemployer should be required to provide a range worker a sleeping facility in fixed-site housing when the worker is \nworking at or nearby the employer's ranch, farm, or some other central location. b. Comments and Discussion A \nfew commenters stated that a range worker's housing should meet the same or similar standards applicable to H-\n2A workers or other workers engaged in agriculture. Most commenters, however, recognized the unique nature of \nrange employment and addressed various aspects of proposed section 655.230, including inspection of mobile \nhousing, and access to kitchen, toilet, washing, and laundry facilities when a worker is at or nearby an employer's \nranch or farm. Worker advocates, employers, and their associations responded to the Department's invitation for \ncomment on whether an employer should be required to provide sleeping accommodations (other than the \nworker's mobile camp) when a worker is performing work at or near an employer's ranch, farm, or some other \ncentral location. Additionally, a few commenters noted that the Department's proposal should be clarified to address \n\n\n\ntemporary bunkhouse-type structures used in remote areas in Texas and Montana, and possibly other areas, to \nhouse workers when working in these areas. The comments on these particular issues and the Department's \nresolution are discussed immediately below by issue. i. Inspection Several employers and a State agency stated \nthat the current inspection system is working and that there is no need to change the system. They explained that \nSWA inspection of mobile housing is occurring as often as once or twice a year in some places. One employer, Eph \nJensen Livestock, however, noted the application of the standards by inspectors and investigators sometimes \nvaries drastically, and asked the Department to better ensure clarity and consistency in inspections. In contrast, \nworker advocates asserted that the mobile units used by employers often failed to meet the existing standards. \nThey stated that the Department should better monitor and track mobile housing by requiring annual inspections \nand instituting a system to track the units inspected, and create an ombudsman position to ensure compliance. \nThey recommended the elimination of the self-inspection process, and stated that if the system was continued there \nshould be more detailed requirements for the self-certification system. In their view, some employers require \nworkers to use uninspected, unsafe units, sometimes in place of those that had been presented for inspection. The \nworker advocates stated, as a general rule, that the mobile housing is not adequately maintained, especially given \nthe rigors of climate and terrain. As stated in the preamble to the NPRM, mobile housing must comply with the \nestablished standards in order to provide a worker with adequate shelter in circumstances where the climate may \nbe harsh and the terrain is often rough. Regular maintenance and inspection of the mobile units are necessary for a \nworker's wellbeing. In the Department's view, the proposed inspection system--properly applied-- including the \ndenial of certification [[Page 63003]] where a mobile unit is deficient and the assessment of an appropriate penalty \nfor failing to maintain standards, provides sufficient remedies to protect workers. SWAs are encouraged to review \ntheir inspection procedures and to increase the frequency of inspections where they deem appropriate. As noted by \nsome commenters, some states require at least annual inspections, and we encourage other states to do so. SWAs \nare encouraged to share best practices to improve inspection procedures, develop checklists to assist employers in \nconducting self-inspections, and take steps to prevent the alleged fraudulent practice in which some employers \nignore the inspection process by providing uninspected mobile units to workers under the guise that they have \nbeen inspected. ii. Providing Kitchen, Toilet, Shower, Laundry and Sleeping Facilities for Workers Performing Work \nat or Near a Ranch or Farm No commenters directly opposed the Department's proposal regarding provision of \nkitchen, toilet, shower, and laundry facilities where a worker is performing work at or near an employer's ranch, \nfarm, or other location where these facilities are already available to other workers. Some commenters stated that \nthey routinely provide these services to the workers. The worker advocates did not oppose the idea that these \nservices must be provided to workers, but, as discussed below, they favored requiring employers to provide fixed-\nsite housing, meeting the usual standards for H-2A housing, for any range worker who was at or nearby a ranch or \nfarm for more than one week. In responding to the Department's inquiry whether employers should be required to \nprovide living facilities separate from the mobile housing while the herder is working at or near the ranch, several \nemployers and employer associations, including Mountain Plains and Western Range, Lava Lake Land and \nLivestock, and the Siddoway Sheep Company, voiced strong opposition to the idea. Many stated that such a \nrequirement would be unreasonable because it would require them to construct a structure that would have to meet \nall the OSHA requirements for fixed-site housing, even though the structure would be used only a few weeks per \nyear. They instead supported the Department's proposal to allow range workers to continue to live in their assigned \nmobile housing unit when located near a fixed-site ranch location. As mentioned above, however, worker \nadvocates disagreed, asserting that workers should be provided fixed-site housing that meets all the OSHA \nstandards, whenever a worker is at or near the ranch or other location for more than a week. In their view, \nproviding access to running water, toilets, and bathing facilities does not replace an employer's requirement to \nprovide housing meeting the normal standards for H-2A workers. The Department is adopting its proposal without \nchange. We recognize that there are times when the mobile housing is located at or near the ranch or a central \nlocation for certain operations that are a normal part of the herding cycle, such as birthing, shearing, or branding. In \nsuch instances, the practice has been for workers to use mobile housing, even where access to fixed housing \nexists. Under the Final Rule, an employer may continue this practice so long as it provides the workers with access \nto the other facilities required by this section. However, the Department encourages employers to make appropriate \nhousing available at the ranch, if they have it and if the workers prefer to stay in that housing. iii. Remote, \nStationary Range Housing A few commenters, including Mountain Plains and Western Range, the Texas Sheep \nand Goat Raisers Association, and an employer, William Ashby Maltsberger, expressed concern about the use by \n\n\n\nemployers of remote, but not mobile, housing in their range operations. The commenters stated that these \noperations, located in Montana and the southern plains states, use strategically located wooden bunkhouses in \nremote areas as they move herds through their grazing routes. The commenters stated that in light of this practice, \nit would be inaccurate for these employers to include a statement about ``mobile housing'' in the job order, as would \nbe required under the Department's proposal. They expressed concerns, too, that unless the Department modified \nits proposal, these employers could be denied use of range workers under the H-2A program. The Department's \nuse of the term ``mobile housing'' in TEGLs and the NPRM was intended to distinguish remote housing provided to \nworkers engaged in range work from fixed-site housing at a ranch or farm. The term's usage was not designed to \npreclude employers from using remote, but stationary, housing. Accordingly, the title to this section has been \nchanged to ``Range Housing,'' not ``Mobile Housing,'' and the regulatory text for Sec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235 \nhas been revised to clarify that such housing may be used to house range workers under this rule while they work \nin remote areas so long as such housing meets all the requirements of this section and the minimum standards \nestablished under Sec. 655.235. 2. Section 655.235 Range Housing Standards.\\56\\ ------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------- \\56\\ The title to this section, which was ``Mobile Housing Standards'' in the NPRM, has \nbeen changed to ``Range Housing Standards'' in the Final Rule for the reasons discussed in the prior section of the \npreamble. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a. Background The NPRM, in large measure, \nproposed to codify the minimum standards historically applied by the Department to mobile housing used by sheep, \ngoat, and cattle herders while working on the range. These proposed standards, which closely track the \nrequirements in both TEGLs, were generally consistent with the housing rules for temporary agricultural workers \npublished under 20 CFR part 654, subpart E, as adapted to the unique circumstances of range workers. Providing \nsuitable housing for workers on the range presents unique challenges, given the continuing movement of the \nrange workers as they lead their herd to new grazing areas, often in remote locations at considerable distance from \nthe herd's starting or interim locations, and the relatively small number of workers engaged in this work. In most \ninstances, the housing, which is defined to include tents, moves along with the worker and the herd to the next \ngrazing location. The housing standards, although providing general requirements regarding their physical structure \nand inspection (see also Sec. 655.230), also specify requirements relating to the provision of facilities (e.g., for \nsleeping, heating, and cooking) and services (e.g, water supply and refuse disposal). These standards are often \nflexible; a particular standard typically allows an employer to select from various options and to make adjustments \nfor particular location, terrain, and other circumstances. The standards necessarily differ, sometimes significantly, \nfrom the requirements for less temporary, fixed-site housing used by other workers engaged in agricultural duties. \nThus, while the Department has standard H-2A regulations governing fixed-site housing for other temporary \nworkers engaged in agriculture, these regulations cannot be readily applied to the range. The term ``mobile \nhousing'' suggests a structure capable of being transported from one location to another. The housing provided to \nherders most often [[Page 63004]] is a wheeled-structure, varying from recreational type-vehicles seen every day \non highways, to other vehicles, more rustic in appearance (``campers''), trailed behind cars or trucks. The proposed \nrule, like the TEGLs, established requirements for these vehicles, but it also included requirements, as did the \nTEGLs, applicable to tents, which may be used in limited circumstances to house herders working on the range. \nThese standards were not intended to prohibit the use of other structures used to temporarily house workers on the \nrange simply because they were not moved or could not be moved. Provided a structure satisfied the ``mobile \nhousing'' standards, the fact that it was not moved would not exclude its use. In the Final Rule, this point is made \nexplicitly, in order to resolve concerns about the use of remote fixed structures in some areas of the country, \nsituated along grazing trails, to temporarily house the herders. The Department proposed to continue the \nrequirement under both TEGLs that each worker must have his or her own comfortable bed, cot, or bunk, along \nwith a mattress, to sleep. As noted in the NPRM, however, the Department recognizes that where the housing is a \none- person unit, occasionally range work requires that two workers must share or use the same bed, because \nterrain, remote location, or demands of the herd, prevent the employer from bringing a separate housing unit to the \nsite, and the camper is a one-person unit. These situations are intended to be rare and the Department proposed to \ncontinue to restrict an employer from requiring workers to share a bed for more than three consecutive days. The \nDepartment proposed to continue the requirement that the employer must provide each worker with a separate \nsleeping bag or other bedding when sharing a bed temporarily. b. Comments and Discussion i. General Worker \nadvocates asserted that the proposed minimum standards too closely mirror the existing housing requirements, \nwhich they criticized as outdated, too general, and inadequate to meet the workers' basic needs for shelter, \n\n\n\nsleeping, cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene. Worker advocates urged the Department: To forbid the use of \nkerosene lanterns and other items using combustible fuel; to require newer, safer heating, lighting, cooking and \nrefrigeration facilities, including solar-powered items, LED lights, and battery packs; to require emergency, hand-\ncranked generators; to require portable camp toilets, and in areas such as corrals, where several individuals may \nbe working, outhouses; and, on at least a monthly basis, to provide each worker the opportunity to take a hot \nshower and use a washing machine. The worker advocates took particular issue with the proposed heating \nstandard. Under the NPMR's standard, an employer was not required to provide heating unless the outside \ntemperature remains below 50 degrees for 24 hours. They stated that this standard ignores the wide temperature \nfluctuations in some locations on the range and exposes range workers to altitude- and cold-related medical \nconditions, such as frostbite, chilblains, and trench foot. They asserted that the Department should establish a \nrequirement that an employer must equip each housing unit with a heater that can maintain at least a minimum \nprescribed temperature inside the unit, advocating for heaters capable of keeping the temperature at or above 68 \ndegrees. In their comments, the worker advocates included a thumbnail sketch of their view of the herders' working \nand living conditions on the range: [Herders part] of the year work and live on the valley floor. During the rest of the \nyear they tend sheep in the mountains and deserts. Living alone, they have no contact with other humans for days \nor weeks. They live in small, dilapidated, one room trailers, called sheep camps, or tents. Most trailers have no form \nof heating or air conditioning. They become unbearably hot in the summer and intolerably cold during the winter. \nThere are no bathing facilities. There's no running water. No field toilets are provided. Acknowledging that the \nworkers traverse many different locations in performing their sometime strenuous herding duties, often in remote \nand rugged areas that require the use of mobile housing, including tents, the employers paint a different picture \nthan the worker advocates. From the employer's perspective, the nature of range work, especially in areas where \nterrain is mountainous or otherwise not easily accessible, limits their ability to provide housing that exceeds the \nexisting standards. Work is often performed on land managed by federal agencies, including the BLM and the \nForest Service, which forbid more permanent housing and regulate such things as waste removal and food storage. \nAt the same time, the employers indicated that where the location of the herders' work permits, workers enjoy \nconditions better than required by the standards, that the mobile housing meets established certification \nrequirements, and that the herders find their housing suitable and appropriate for their line of work. The employers \nstated that the workers are resupplied on a regular basis, prefer their mobile housing to alternative structures, and \nare treated no less well than other employees whose work is essential to an employer's business success. As \nstated by the Texas Sheep and Goat Association: ``The ranchers treat the herders . . . in many cases, as family.'' A \nsimilar sentiment was expressed by the I & M Sheep Company: ``[The H-2A workers] have worked very hard for \nour family and have become more than just employees to us,'' adding that ``[w]ithout these individuals, our sheep \noperation would cease to exist.'' To the extent there are problems with compliance, the employers stated that better \nenforcement, rather than more stringent standards, is the approach that should be taken. No commenter directly \nstated that the existing standards, established under the TEGLs, were too stringent; however, as will be discussed, \nsome comments demonstrated that some employers appeared uncertain about some of these requirements. In \ngeneral, several employers and their associations suggested that the existing standards are just about right, \nprotecting workers' health and safety without imposing excessive or unnecessary costs on employers. As stated by \nan employer, Theressa Dalling: ``The special procedures . . . have worked for [our industry] over the past 35 years. \nThere is no reason to change what has worked.'' Although the worker advocates and employer commenters \ndisagree about the degree to which employers comply with the existing requirements, they agree that some \nemployers fail to comply with the requirements and that compliance can and should be improved. The Department \nagrees. Compliance can be achieved not only through better enforcement but also through outreach efforts to \neducate employers and workers about the applicable requirements. In the Department's view, this rulemaking has \nbrought focus to the difficult circumstances under which herders work, the unique features of their employment, and \nthe difficulties confronted by them and their employers, as they perform their work, conduct their business, and \nattempt to earn a just wage and profit. Although we conclude that the existing standards, overall, adequately protect \nthe health and safety of the herders, some adjustments and clarifications to the standards are appropriate. These \nadjustments can be [[Page 63005]] made without imposing any unreasonable or unnecessary costs or burdens on \nemployers. In its proposal and the Final Rule, the Department has sought to help employers understand and \ncomply with their housing- related obligations, without sacrificing simplicity and flexibility, and to better inform \nworkers and their advocates about the workers' housing-related rights. The comments received on housing-\n\n\n\nrelated issues have been informative and have helped the Department to shape the Final Rule, revising the \nproposed regulatory text, as needed, to address particular concerns raised by commenters. Each change is \ndiscussed below with regard to each standard as set forth in the individual paragraphs of Sec. 655.235. ii. Particular \nStandards (1) Change to Title and Opening Paragraph Both TEGLs and the NPRM stated generally that an \nemployer may satisfy its housing obligations by providing workers use of a mobile unit, camper, or similar mobile \nvehicle that meets the prescribed standards. The NPRM proposed ``Mobile Housing'' as this section's title. As \ndiscussed in Sec. IV.E.1. of the preamble in connection with Sec. 655.210, the term ``mobile housing'' fails to \ninclude remote fixed-site structures that have been used in Texas, Montana, and other areas to temporarily house \nrange workers. These bunkhouse-type structures are not mobile, but are placed at strategic locations on grazing \ntrails to provide housing for workers as they proceed with a herd along the trail. In the Final Rule, we have revised \nthe title to read ``Standards for Range Housing'' and made plain that any structure used to temporarily house \nworkers on the range must meet the standards prescribed by Sec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235. Further, as \ndiscussed below, the Department received several comments that suggest confusion about the use of tents to \nhouse workers on the range and how the particular requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 655.230 and 655.235 apply \nto tents. For added clarity, we have revised the regulatory text to specify that tents are structures covered by these \nsections. (2) Paragraph (a)--Housing Site Both TEGLs and the NPRM provide that a housing site must be well \ndrained and without depressions that would allow stagnant water to collect. No comments were received on this \npoint and the Final Rule adopts the proposal without change. (3) Paragraph (b)--Water Supply (a) Background Both \nTEGLs require employers to provide workers an adequate and convenient supply of water that meets standards \nestablished by the State health authority. The TEGLs require that the employer provide an amount sufficient for the \nnormal drinking, cooking, and bathing needs of each worker. The TEGLs also require an employer to provide an \nadequate supply of potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable, and to provide individual drinking \ncups to each worker. In the NPRM, the Department included these requirements. It clarified that the supply of \nwater must be enough for the worker's normal cooking, consumption, cleaning, and laundry needs. Under the \nproposal, the employer was required to provide the worker with the means to make the water potable. This section \noverlaps with section 655.210(c), which requires an employer to specify in the job order that it will provide potable \nwater or ``water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.'' The preamble to the NPRM \nexplained: ``Potable water is water that meets the water quality standards for drinking purposes of either the state \nor local authority having jurisdiction over supplies of drinking water or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \nNational Primary Drinking Water regulations, 40 CFR part 141.'' 80 FR at 20313. The Department explained that \nthis definition mirrors the OSHA field sanitation regulations that define potable water for agricultural establishments, \n29 CFR 1928.110. Id. It further explained that the supply of readily available, potable water is necessary to ensure \nthat water is available for cooking and consumption by the worker, and that OSHA requires that drinking water \nalways be available in amounts needed to satisfy thirst, cooling, waste elimination, and metabolism. As proposed by \nthe Department: An adequate and convenient supply of water that meets the standards of the state or local health \nauthority must be provided. Water used for drinking and cooking must be potable or easily rendered potable, and \nthe employer must provide the worker with the means to make the water potable. The amount of water provided \nmust be enough for normal cooking, consumption, cleaning, laundry and bathing needs of each worker; . . . and \n[i]ndividual drinking cups must be provided. 80 FR at 20342. The Department specifically invited comment on (1) \nhow much of the water should be potable (or easily rendered potable) for cooking and consumption; (2) how much \nwater is sufficient for cleaning, laundry, and bathing requirements; (3) what alternative water supplies may be used \nwhen exigent circumstances preclude the employer from transporting water to the worker; and (4) what means are \navailable to make alternate water sources potable for cooking and consumption. 80 FR at 20313. As discussed \nfurther below, we received many comments on whether it was necessary to establish a standard other than to \nsimply require that an employer provide an ``[a]dequate and convenient supply of water that meets the standards of \nthe state health authority . . . [in an] amount . . . enough for normal drinking, cooking, and bathing needs of each \nworker,'' as required under the TEGLs. In the Final Rule, the Department, as proposed in the NPRM, specifically \nrequires that the water used for drinking and cooking must be potable or easily rendered potable with the means to \nmake it potable, consistent with the TEGL requirement referring to the State health authority standards. The \nDepartment only received a few comments, discussed below, on the amount of potable water needed for \nconsumption and cooking. The Final Rule requires that employers on a regular basis must supply, i.e., transport to \nthe workers' housing locations, enough water to ensure that each worker has at least 4.5 gallons of potable water \n\n\n\navailable for the worker's use, per day, until resupplied. The Final Rule provides a limited exception for situations \nwhere terrain prevents the delivery of supplies by motorized vehicle. In those circumstances, an employer must \nidentify alternative sources of water, such as springs, streams, or snow, that may be used by workers, and provide \nthe workers the means to test and, by filtering, chemical purification or other methods, to easily render the water \npotable. The Department only received a few comments on the amount of non- potable water required to meet the \ncleaning, laundry, and bathing needs of workers, which are discussed below. The NPRM did not specify an amount \nof water needed for these purposes, nor preclude an employer in exigent circumstances from requiring that \nworkers rely on alternate sources of water, where available, for these purposes. The Final Rule adopts the \napproach taken in the proposal. The Department received several comments on what would constitute an exigent \ncircumstance that would permit [[Page 63006]] an employer to require workers to rely on alternative sources of \nwater, set out below. Worker advocates urged the Department to limit the exception to emergencies, such as \nwhere a forest fire prevented the delivery of potable water. Employers and their associations urged the Department \nto provide a broader exception, many asserting that they should not be required to transport any water to any \nhousing locations where alternate sources of water are available. In the Final Rule, the Department takes a middle \ncourse, allowing an employer to use the exception where housing is located in areas that are not accessible by \nmotorized vehicle. As discussed below, there will be emergency situations where an employer may encounter some \ndelay in providing supplies. We have decided that it is better to address those situations on a case-by-case basis, \nrather than by attempting to define their scope. In our view, it is difficult to anticipate the particular situations that \nmight arise. Stating that such an exception is available, without precisely defining its scope, could be used by some \nemployers to circumvent their obligation to supply enough water to meet the range workers' needs. The \nDepartment received several comments, which we address below, on the means by which water for drinking and \ncooking may be rendered potable. The Final Rule does not require that any particular method or device must be \nused for these purposes. The Final Rule, like the proposal, simply requires that the employer--in those limited \ncircumstances where it is not required to transport potable water for these purposes to a range worker -must \nprovide the means by which the worker may easily render the water potable and clarifies that the employer must \nprovide a worker with the means to test the physical, chemical, and bacteria content of the alternate water sources \navailable so that the worker is able to determine whether it is necessary to treat the water and the most suitable \nmeans of making the water potable. The Department received no comments on its proposal to continue the \nrequirement that an employer must provide individual drinking cups to each worker, and the Department, without \nfurther discussion, is including this requirement in the Final Rule. (b) Comments The worker advocates generally \nsupported the Department's proposal, but suggested that the Department should require employers to provide \npotable and non-potable water in amounts, prescribed by the Department to meet the workers' minimum daily \nneeds. They stated that employers should be required to deliver this water to the worker and should not be \npermitted to require a worker to rely on alternative sources of water to meet any of the worker's needs. They \nasserted that the use of alternate sources of water should be strictly limited to emergency situations such as forest \nfires or other disasters that temporarily prevent employers from reaching the workers. Although the employers and \ntheir associations generally supported the proposed standard, they strongly opposed any limitation on their use of \nnatural sources of water to satisfy this obligation. They acknowledged that workers should always have enough \nwater for drinking, cooking, bathing, and laundry, but were offended by the suggestion that any legitimate employer \nwould ignore this obligation. They expressed a fear that the Department would ``over-regulate'' and, in doing so, \nwould significantly impair their ability to successfully operate their businesses. Mountain Plains and Western Range \nstated that employers regularly supply their herders with water for drinking, cooking, and bathing unless the herders \nare working in remote locations that have natural sources of water. Several employers and two state agencies (New \nMexico and Utah) explained that workers' needs and the means of providing water vary depending on the season, \nlocation, and particular herding operations. Two employers, Henry Etcheverry and Siddoway Sheep Company, \ndescribed the particular difficulties involved in transporting heavy materials, including water, to herders working in \nhigh mountain areas where access is only by horse. Siddoway Sheep Company estimated that it would need an \nadditional eight pack horses per herd to supply workers if natural sources of water could not be used for these \npurposes. Mountain Plains and Western Range and two employers, Cindy Siddoway and Henry Etcheverry, \nexplained that there has been no history of workers becoming sick from using natural water sources. Another \nemployer, Sharon O'Toole, noted that range workers are careful with water because it is often not potable in their \nnative countries. The comments included a variety of cost-effective methods and devices that they stated could be \n\n\n\nused to make natural sources of water potable, including boiling water, straining melted snow through coffee filters, \niodine tablets, ultraviolet purification, bottles, osmosis filters, water purification bottles, and germicidal tablets. One \nemployer, the Siddoway Sheep Company, recommended the use of hand-held bottles designed for water \npurification, because, its experience has been that workers will risk drinking water without testing or treatment if the \nonly method available leaves an unpleasant taste in the water. The Department received only a few comments in \nresponse to its request for input about the minimum amount of water that should be provided to workers on a daily \nor weekly basis. Relying on a statement prepared by an expert on the nutritional requirements of rural populations \nand immigrant workers, the worker advocates asserted that at least 32 gallons of potable water was needed \nweekly for each worker, for consumption and dishwashing, a daily average of a little more than 4.5 gallons. The \nonly employer to comment directly on this point, Sharon O'Toole, estimated that workers need about 40 gallons per \nweek (5.7 gallons per day) for these purposes. The worker advocates recommended that the employers be \nrequired to provide an additional 50 gallons of water (non-potable) for cleaning, bathing and laundry. The worker \nadvocates submitted short statements from three herders, one of whom stated that about 35 gallons would be the \nminimum amount of potable water required for each range worker per week (5 gallons per day). One herder stated \nthat his employer had only provided him with a total of 40 gallons of per week (suggesting this amount was intended \nfor the all the worker's drinking, cooking, dishwashing, bathing, and laundry needs). He explained that sometimes \nhe would run out of water before he was resupplied, forcing him to ask other herders, if any were nearby, for water, \nand that for bathing he had to get water from the sheep's water tank or ponds. Two of the herders said that they \nwere forced to continue wearing dirty clothes if they were not located close to a natural water source. Worker \nadvocates requested the Department to clarify that separate water supplies should be provided to workers, apart \nfrom any supplied for the use of dogs or horses. One commenter, Sims Sheep Co LLC, noted that potable water \nshould be stored in a container appropriate for that purpose. This employer also noted the difficulty of keeping water \nfrom freezing, recommending that employers be required to provide containers small enough to be kept inside the \nworker's housing to prevent the water from freezing. Mountain States and Western Range requested that the \nDepartment not require employers to provide water for [[Page 63007]] clothes washing, if an employer offers \nlaundry services and the worker expresses no preference to do the laundry on his own. Two employers, Carl and \nKaty Day and Warren Roberts, stated that they regularly pick up the workers' dirty clothes and return the clothes \nafter washing, often weekly, when they resupply the camp. A Utah state agency stated that requiring employers to \nprovide water for laundering places an unnecessary burden on employers. (c) Discussion After reviewing and \nconsidering all the comments on this provision, we first determined that workers' health and safety are \nunnecessarily put at risk by requiring an employee, on his or her own, to secure water for essential needs. While \nworking on the range, a worker is always there at the convenience of the employer; thus, it is our view that, at the \nmost fundamental level, it is the responsibility of the employer to ensure the worker's safety while he or she is \nserving the employer's business interests. The provision of water, no less so than providing a shelter to sleep in, or \nfood to eat, is properly an employer's responsibility where the worker's ``residence'' is the range, and all his paid \nand unpaid time there is spent serving the employer's interests. We acknowledge that most employers are \nresponsible and, as such, try to ensure their worker's safety, and that most employers regularly, even in difficult \ncircumstances, extend their best efforts to keep their workers safe. Unfortunately, some employers are not so \nresponsible, and the Department must keep this in mind in setting standards for a workplace, whether it is a factory \nor the range. Our determination that an employer must provide workers with necessary potable water--the only \nalternative to leaving the worker to obtain it on his or her own--rests on the need to regulate the actions of \nnoncompliant employers, as well as because the alternative leaves the range workers at too much risk. They work \nin a place where weather conditions may be severe, temperatures are extreme, drought or near drought conditions \nmay exist, and they are often at considerable distance from their employers and without any ready alternative if \ntheir water runs dry. We next determined that setting a recommended minimum amount of water to satisfy an \nemployer's obligation would benefit both workers and employers. Setting a minimum amount should prompt \nimmediate action by an employer whose practice has been to provide significantly less than this amount, thereby \nendangering, knowingly or not, the health and safety of its workers. In reviewing the comments, it became clear \nthat many employers, especially in some locations and during certain seasons, have relied on natural sources of \nwater primarily, if not exclusively, to meet or attempt to meet the workers' needs. Thus, having determined that it \nshould be the employer's responsibility to provide the water, not one to be borne by the worker, there was a need, \nin our view, to establish a ready benchmark to enable these employers to estimate the amount of water they will \n\n\n\nnow have to provide workers, information that it would need to know in order to establish a plan for transporting \nthis water to their workers. The comments submitted by the worker advocates helped inform the Department about \nsetting the standard at an appropriate amount. Our consideration was guided by a statement included in the worker \nadvocates' comment on this point. The statement was prepared by Sarah A. Quandt, Ph.D., a member of Wake \nForest University's Department of Epidemiology and Prevention. She is a recognized expert on issues relating to \nfood and nutrition among rural populations. She has conducted research involving immigrant workers, including \ncrop and construction workers.\\57\\ Based on her experience and considering research published by the U.S. \nDepartments of the Army and Air Force, she estimated that workers would require about 2.5 to 3 gallons of water \nper day for consumption to which she added .5 gallon per day for cooking and 1 gallon per day for washing dishes. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ A list of Dr. Quandt's publications may be located at       \n     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=PureSearch&term=Quandt%20SA%5BAuthor%5D. -----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------- The employer's estimate, too, was helpful. Although its recommended \nweekly amount was about 8 gallons higher (by about one gallon a day) than Dr. Quandt's estimate, the two were \nclose enough to suggest there might be a shared understanding among stakeholders about the amount of water \nrequired to meet the essential needs of an in individual engaged in range work. In further considering the issue, the \nDepartment consulted two reference guides: The U.S. Army Water Planning Guide, 2008 (Army Water Guide) \\58\\ \nand the Water Guide for Emergency Situations, prepared by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (U.N. Water \nGuide).\\59\\ The Army Water Guide provides various standards for estimating the per capita water need for troops, \ndepending upon the particular operations in which the troops are engaged. The estimates vary by climate: hot-\ntropical, hot-arid, temperate, and cold. The Army Water Guide also provides an overall, per capita estimate for \nsustained operations, again setting standards by climate. We focused on the estimates for hot-arid, temperate, and \ncold climates. Herding in the United States primarily occurs under those conditions. For drinking and food \npreparation, the various estimates follow: 5.23 gallons for hot- arid conditions; 3.58 gallons for temperate \nconditions, and 4.13 gallons for cold conditions. Water Guide, Chart of Standard Planning Factors, at II-A-2. The \nU.N. Water Guide recommended a daily allocation of 15 liters (nearly 4 gallons). Finally, we considered the water \nstandards prescribed by the State of California for various industries, including agriculture.\\60\\ ----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------- \\58\\ The Army Water Guide is available at            \nhttp://www.quartermaster.army.mil/pwd/publications/water/Water_Planning_Guide_rev_103008_dtd_Nov_08_(5-\n09).pdf. \\59\\ The U.N. Water Guide is available at            http://helid.digicollection.org/en/d/Junr01/5.html. \\60\\ See \nState of California, Department of Industrial Relations, Guidance for Employers and Employees on the New \nRequirements of the Heat Illness Prevention Regulation Amendments, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, \nSection 3395 (discussing changes, effective May 1, 2015, concerning employer requirements relating to work \nperformed under hot conditions and continuing the State's requirement that covered employers must make \navailable 2 gallons of drinking, per worker, for each 8-hour shift). ------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------- Based upon our review of the comments and the authoritative sources noted, we conclude that 4.5 gallons \nis reasonable as a recommended daily minimum amount of potable water that an employer should provide for each \nrange worker for drinking and cooking. In setting this amount, we have balanced the need to provide workers a \nsufficient amount of potable water to meet their essential needs and the practical ability of employers to supply the \nappropriate amount of water without undue burden. Setting the minimum recommended standard at 4.5 gallons per \nday for drinking and cooking, rather than at the employer's higher estimated level, frees space on an employer's \ntrailer or truck to transport supplies and other items to locations that may be distant from the employer's ranch or \nfarm. Further, we conclude that a more conservative estimate is reasonable for setting this standard. It reduces the \ninitial burden on employers, while providing greater protection to workers than is provided by the existing standard, \nwhich does not specify a recommended minimum amount. Some of the employers under this standard [[Page \n63008]] will be delivering--for the first time--a large supply of potable water to their workers who previously relied \nupon natural sources of water as their sole or primary source of water for drinking and cooking. The employer may \ntake into account the worker's current supply of potable water when replenishing the water. For example, if an \nemployer resupplies workers on a weekly basis and the worker has consumed only 25 gallons of a week's supply \nof 31.5 gallons, the employer may choose to provide only 25 additional gallons of water until its next resupply. Thus, \nto meet its obligations, an employer must deliver potable water on a regular basis so that its workers will have the \nrequisite daily amount available during the supply and resupply cycle (except in exigent circumstances where \nalternative sources may be used to satisfy this requirement). It deserves emphasis that, even if the employer \n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=PureSearch&term=Quandt%20SA[Author]\nhttp://www.quartermaster.army.mil/pwd/publications/water/Water_Planning_Guide_rev_103008_dtd_Nov_08_(5-09).pdf\nhttp://www.quartermaster.army.mil/pwd/publications/water/Water_Planning_Guide_rev_103008_dtd_Nov_08_(5-09).pdf\nhttp://helid.digicollection.org/en/d/Junr01/5.html\n\n\nprovides the daily recommended minimum amount of potable water, it remains its overriding duty to provide an \nadequate amount for each worker, based on the needs of a particular worker. This need will vary from individual to \nindividual, and the appropriate amount is affected by many factors, including temperature, humidity, wind, the \navailability of shade, an individual's weight, and the length and intensity of physical activity. In other words, \nparticularly in a dry or hot climate, employers may well be required to provide more than the 4.5 gallon general \nminimum. We have determined not to set a minimum amount of non-potable water that an employer must supply for \nbathing, washing clothes, or other uses. We have less confidence in estimating an amount for these additional \npurposes, given that bathing, showering, and laundering practices may vary considerably because they involve \nmatters of personal choice that are affected by the availability of particular facilities. These purposes may require \nsignificantly more water than needed for consumption and food preparation and cleanup. Based on day- to-day \nexperience, obtained in providing water for their workers, employers should be able to readily estimate the amount \nof water actually needed by workers for all their needs, and, where natural water sources are not available, they \nshould be able within a relatively short time to estimate the additional amount of water they will need to provide their \nworkers for bathing and washing their clothes. This approach addresses the concern that if water for laundry is not \nneeded, the employer need not provide water for this purpose. Moreover, this approach allows employers to rely on \nthe worker's use of alternate sources of water for cleaning, bathing and laundry, where such sources are readily \navailable. The text of the rule also addresses other concerns raised by the commenters, including a clarification that \nthis standard establishes a supply of water strictly for the worker's own use, not a source that may be used to \nprovide water for dog, horses, or the herd. We have also retained and clarified the limited exception under which an \nemployer, for exigent circumstances, may require workers to rely on alternate water sources to provide potable \nworkers to employees. We have been persuaded that requiring potable water to be carried on pack horse would \nimpose an unreasonable burden on employers. The regulatory text has been clarified so that an employer will \nqualify for this exception only where terrain would prevent delivery of water by motorized vehicle and the employer \nsatisfies the additional conditions described below. In our view, the worker advocates' suggestion that exigent \ncircumstances be limited to emergency situations, such as a forest fire, that would prevent the delivery of supplies \nto workers, is too restrictive and would impose an unreasonable burden on employers. We have concluded that the \ninterests of range workers and employers are better served by not providing for a broader exception for exigent \ncircumstances. There will be some occasions, such as a fire or a severe storm, which may temporarily prevent an \nemployer from providing supplies. In those instances, an employer will not be held noncompliant so long as it has \nbeen prudent in preparing for such a possibility, such as by providing a reserve supply of water for emergencies, \nhaving developed a plan for the extrication of their employees in such circumstances, and having available contact \ninformation for government and private agencies that are able to provide rescue services. As pointed out by \ncommenters, winter conditions may present particular difficulties because freezing temperatures may prevent the \neasy and immediate consumption of water. Therefore, we have revised the text of the rule to require that wherever \nand whenever the temperature can reasonably be expected to drop below freezing, the employer must provide \ncontainers, appropriate for potable water, that are small enough to be stored in the range housing to prevent \nfreezing. Regarding the requirement that employers must provide water sufficient for bathing and cleaning, we are \nclarifying that this water must be clean and free from anything harmful that could be absorbed by the skin or \nclothing, but the water provided does not need to be potable or easily-rendered potable. For these purposes, an \nemployer may always rely on natural sources of water (springs, streams, fresh snow), when these sources available \nat the location of the worker's housing. Where the alternate water source is the same source that will be used to \nwater the herd, the herder's dogs and horses, or may collect runoff from areas in which herd excretes, the employer \nmust undertake special precautions to protect the worker's health from risk. As discussed above, the Final Rule \npermits an employer, in limited circumstances, to completely rely on natural sources of water to meet the worker's \nneeds, including drinking and cooking. The Final Rule establishes the following conditions to rely on natural sources \nof water for worker consumption:  The terrain or weather conditions of the area in which the\n\n worker's housing is located prevents the delivery of potable water by a\n\n motorized vehicle.\n\n\n\n      The employer has identified natural sources of water that\n\n are potable or may be easily rendered potable in the area in which the\n\n housing will be located and these sources will remain available during\n\n the period the worker will be at that location.\n\n      The employer provides the worker with the means to test\n\n whether the water is potable and, if not potable, the means to filter\n\n out contaminants and treat the water to render it potable.\n\n      The employer must provide this information when it files\n\n its H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification.\n\n     In the Department's view, these conditions carry special importance\n\n given the presence of drought and near-drought conditions in parts of\n\n the United States, particularly in the Southwest, as well as the\n\n significant health risks posed if water sources become contaminated\n\n with harmful pathogens because of the presence of nearby herds.\n\n     Where the employer seeks to use this exception, it must provide the\n\n worker with a device that can test the physical, chemical, and bacteria\n\n content of the water and the means to render the water potable.\n\n Employers may choose from various approved methods and devices to\n\n satisfy this requirement. Potential choices for means to render water\n\n potable would include, among others, water purification tablets,\n\n portable water purification systems, water\n\n \n\n [[Page 63009]]\n\n \n\n\n\n purification bottles, and filtering systems. Whatever method or device\n\n is selected to test and make water potable, the employer must ensure\n\n that the worker is adequately trained in the proper use of the method\n\n or device, so that when necessary, the method or device is used\n\n correctly.\n\n (4) Paragraph (c)--Excreta and Liquid Waste Disposal\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM require that facilities must be provided\n\n and maintained for effective disposal of excreta and liquid waste in\n\n compliance with state or Federal requirements. Where disposal pits are\n\n permitted, the TEGLs and the NPRM state that the pits must be ``fly-\n\n tight'' and maintained in compliance with State and local sanitation\n\n requirements.\n\n     A few commenters expressed concern about the facilities employers\n\n provide to range workers for the disposal of excreta and liquid waste.\n\n A few commenters, including worker advocates, stated that employers\n\n should be required to provide camp-type portable toilets or outhouses\n\n for workers to use on the range. Another commenter stated that\n\n employers do not always provide a shovel with which to bury such waste.\n\n We have revised the regulation to address this concern.\n\n     The rulemaking record does not reflect what particular toilet\n\n facilities, if any, are provided workers. The Department would expect\n\n that an employer would choose to provide a portable, camp-like toilet\n\n for use by its workers. A strictly functional device, shielded from\n\n\n\n view if the herder is working with others, would appear to be\n\n relatively inexpensive and compatible with any State or Federal\n\n requirements concerning the disposal of excreta and liquid waste. The\n\n Department, however, is less convinced about the suggestion that\n\n employers should be required to provide an outhouse, which the\n\n Department interprets to mean a permanent or semi-permanent structure\n\n constructed of wood or similar material. Obviously, it would be\n\n impractical unless workers routinely used the same location to\n\n establish a ``camp,'' and even in these situations, it would entail\n\n construction and maintenance costs and would increase, perhaps\n\n substantially, an employer's disposal costs. The Department assumes\n\n that similar costs would be entailed in the rental, purchase, use, and\n\n transportation of a construction-type ``porta-john.'' Further, the\n\n construction of an outhouse would likely be subject to land use\n\n restrictions on many parcels of land used for grazing, including\n\n Federal lands. Given the absence of information about current employer\n\n practices in this area and uncertainty about legal and cost\n\n considerations, the Department declines the suggestion to revise the\n\n standard to require camp toilets or more substantial structures of this\n\n nature, notwithstanding the benefit they would provide for workers.\n\n (5) Paragraph (d)--Housing Structure\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM required that employers provide structures\n\n that are structurally sound, in sanitary condition, and in good repair\n\n\n\n to protect workers from the elements. Beyond this general duty, the\n\n TEGLs also specified a few particular requirements regarding the\n\n structure of the housing. The general and particular requirements were\n\n included in the NPRM.\n\n     Earlier, in the Sec. IV.E.1. of the preamble related to Sec.  \n\n 655.230, and throughout this section, we discussed various general\n\n comments and comments specific to particular requirements. Many of\n\n these bear on the structural suitability of a housing unit, but the\n\n Department received no comments specifically directed to this\n\n subsection and therefore the Final Rule adopts the proposal on this\n\n point without change, except to clarify that the requirements relating\n\n to housing, including the standard for structure, also apply to tents,\n\n except as discussed below.\n\n     Some employer comments suggested that there may be some confusion\n\n about the application of standards to tents. The proposal did not\n\n modify an employer's obligations under the TEGLs to generally apply the\n\n same requirements to tents as apply to other range housing. The TEGLs\n\n and the NPRM require that an employer may use a tent to house workers\n\n only if the terrain or land use regulations prevent the use of more\n\n substantial housing and the tent is appropriate for the weather\n\n conditions. Further, where tents are used, they are subject to the same\n\n requirements that apply to campers or other structures, unless the\n\n standards provide otherwise. If it is feasible to provide electricity\n\n and mechanical refrigeration at a location, an employer must do so,\n\n even if the worker is housed in a tent. While such opportunities will\n\n\n\n be limited, the obligation remains. If the use of the tent is required\n\n by land use restrictions prohibiting more permanent structures, but\n\n electric service is available, the employer must provide it. See Sec.  \n\n 655.235(f). The TEGLs and the NPRM, however, specifically exempted\n\n tents from the requirements applicable to other structures--that they\n\n have rigid flooring and a second means of egress for escape (unless the\n\n tent is large and has rigid walls), see Sec.  655.235(e)(5). Further,\n\n the TEGLs and the NPRM prohibited the use of heaters in tents unless\n\n the heater was approved for such use and the tent is fireproof. The\n\n Final Rule contains these same requirements and exceptions.\n\n (6) Paragraph (e)--Heating\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM required that stoves or heaters using\n\n combustible fuels be safely vented and be shielded by fireproof\n\n material. They required that if a heater has automatic controls, it\n\n must be of the type that interrupts the fuel supply when the flame\n\n fails or a predetermined safe temperature is exceeded.\n\n     Neither the TEGLs nor the NPRM, however, required that each housing\n\n unit be equipped with a heater or a heating system, nor did either\n\n require the employer to ensure that the temperature inside the housing\n\n could be maintained at or above a certain level. The NPRM continued the\n\n existing standard under which employers could choose not to provide\n\n heated units. Under that standard, no heating is required for housing\n\n located in mild-climate areas unless the temperature is reasonably\n\n expected to drop below 50 degrees and remain continuously below that\n\n temperature for 24 hours. To maintain worker safety, however, employers\n\n\n\n that choose not to provide heating were required to provide the workers\n\n with proper protective clothing and bedding.\n\n     The worker advocates contended that the Department's proposal\n\n ignored the wide temperature fluctuations in some locations where range\n\n workers are employed, and that the proposal would continue to expose\n\n range workers to altitude- and cold-related conditions that could lead\n\n to injury and illness. They asserted that the Department should instead\n\n require an employer to provide heating whenever the temperature inside\n\n the housing facility falls below a prescribed temperature, advocating\n\n in favor of setting this temperature at 68 degrees. The worker\n\n advocates also requested the Department to require that any devices\n\n that use combustible fuels (which would include those for lighting,\n\n heating, and cooking) should have fuel sources stored outside the\n\n housing structure. They further requested that the Department require\n\n that heating devices should be inspected annually by fire departments\n\n or heating specialists. No comments were submitted by employers or\n\n their associations on this point. However, as noted throughout this\n\n section of the preamble, employers and their associations generally\n\n opposed\n\n \n\n [[Page 63010]]\n\n \n\n any requirements that would go beyond those required by the TEGLs.\n\n\n\n     The worker advocates have presented a persuasive argument that the\n\n Department's proposed heating standard does not adequately protect the\n\n health and safety of the workers. It is widely known that the hourly\n\n temperatures in the mountainous and desert areas in which herding is\n\n common can dramatically fluctuate over the course of a day. Even in\n\n areas where temperature changes over the course of a day generally\n\n fluctuate within a narrower range--areas that could be fairly described\n\n as mild and whose usual daily temperature reaches 50 degrees or\n\n higher--it is not for uncommon for the temperature to drop below\n\n freezing or to feel as if it has when the weather is windy, rainy, or\n\n both. In these circumstances, a range worker should be able to obtain a\n\n heated shelter from the elements. Accordingly, the Final Rule revises\n\n the threshold at which heating must be provided. As revised, an\n\n employer must provide heating for a housing unit if the low temperature\n\n for any day in the work contract period is reasonably expected to drop\n\n below 50 degrees. If the low temperature for any day in which the\n\n housing unit is being used is not reasonably expected to drop below 50\n\n degrees Fahrenheit, no separate heating equipment is required as long\n\n as proper protective clothing and bedding are made available, free of\n\n charge or deposit charge, to the workers.\n\n     The Department recognizes that this may require some employers--for\n\n the first time--to equip their range housing with heaters. The existing\n\n standard is simply inadequate to protect the health and safety of the\n\n\n\n range workers. The extra clothing and bedding is a poor substitute for\n\n a heater on a day when the temperature may remain below 50 degrees.\n\n     The Department is unpersuaded by the argument that it should\n\n require employers to provide housing units that will maintain a\n\n specified inside temperature. The Department has no present information\n\n that would allow it to set such a standard, particularly given the wide\n\n variety in the design of the housing units used by range workers and\n\n the uncertainty that a particular temperature could be achieved without\n\n undue expense to employers.\n\n     The Department is not convinced that it is necessary to add either\n\n a requirement that heating or heating system be inspected annually by a\n\n fire department or heating specialist, or a requirement that an\n\n employer can only provide a device in which the fuel source is stored\n\n outside the housing unit, particularly because the type of device and\n\n fuel storage must fit the variety of current and future housing\n\n structures. The Final Rule retains the existing requirement under the\n\n TEGLs that the units in which workers sleep must be constructed and\n\n maintained according to applicable state and local fire and safety\n\n laws. Moreover, the housing unit, including any heating equipment,\n\n would have to meet whatever inspection requirements are established by\n\n the SWA. In our view, this standard adequately ensures the safety of\n\n the workers. Accordingly, except for revising the proposed standard to\n\n limit the ability of an employer to provide an unheated housing unit,\n\n the Final Rule adopts the standard as proposed. Finally, as discussed\n\n\n\n above in Section IV.B.2.c., heating equipment and, where permitted,\n\n protective clothing and bedding, must be listed in the job order along\n\n with other required tools, supplies and equipment that will be provided\n\n free of charge or deposit charge.\n\n (7) Paragraph (f)--Lighting\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM require that electrical service must be\n\n provided if feasible. Both TEGLs and the NPRM required that where\n\n electric service is not provided, the employer must provide at least\n\n one lantern for each worker. Kerosene lamps were permitted.\n\n     The worker advocates, as previously noted, have broadly criticized\n\n the Department for not incorporating modern technology in its range\n\n housing standards. They have objected to the permitted use of kerosene\n\n lamps in the range housing, asserting instead that the Department\n\n should require battery or solar-powered devices. Although some\n\n employers mentioned that they provided solar power sources for some\n\n purposes, none indicated whether they were used to supply power for\n\n lighting. As noted throughout this section of the preamble, employers\n\n and their associations generally opposed any requirements that would go\n\n beyond those required by the TEGLs.\n\n     In the Department's view, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to\n\n mandate, or categorically forbid, the use of any particular device.\n\n Kerosene lanterns have long been used by campers and other outdoors\n\n enthusiasts to provide lighting in temporary structures similar to\n\n range housing. On the present record, there is nothing that would\n\n\n\n justify the Department from banning their use. As discussed previously,\n\n employers are required to construct and maintain units that comply with\n\n applicable state and local fire and safety laws. Where such laws forbid\n\n the use of particular kinds of lanterns or impose conditions on their\n\n use, an employer would be obliged to follow those laws. Moreover, it is\n\n in employers' interest to provide safe lighting options.\n\n     There were no comments received on the requirement that an employer\n\n must provide at least one lantern for each worker. The Final Rule\n\n adopts the proposed lighting standard without change.\n\n (8) Paragraph (g)--Bathing, Laundry, and Hand Washing\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM require employers, if feasible, to provide\n\n hot and cold water under pressure in range housing. Where not feasible,\n\n employers were required to provide movable facilities for bathing,\n\n laundry, and hand washing. Only a few concerns were raised in comments\n\n on this provision.\n\n     Worker advocates requested the Department to provide workers with\n\n sun-shower devices when work is being performed in warm climates. They\n\n also asserted that employers should be required to provide workers with\n\n at least monthly access to facilities where they can have a hot shower\n\n and use of a washing machine. A few employers asserted, as discussed in\n\n connection with the minimum standard for water, Sec.  655.235(b), that\n\n laundry facilities are unnecessary where an employer picks up and\n\n launders a worker's dirty clothes and exchanges the laundered clothes\n\n for dirty ones when it resupplies the worker. The Department is not\n\n\n\n persuaded that these suggested changes are necessary.\n\n     While the suggested use of a camp-type ``sun shower'' may be an\n\n economical means of allowing a worker to bathe, it is only one of\n\n several potential options that may be available to meet the employer's\n\n obligation to provide movable facilities for bathing, and there is no\n\n basis in the record for the Department to conclude that this device is\n\n superior to other methods. Allowing a range worker to obtain a hot\n\n shower and access to a washing machine each month could prove costly to\n\n an employer. We assume that the employer would have to pay for the\n\n services of a substitute worker to watch the herd in the first herder's\n\n absence, and the time and distance between the herder's work location\n\n and the available facilities might be considerable. Given that under\n\n the Final Rule's standard, the workers are provided movable washing and\n\n bathing facilities, imposing such a requirement seems unnecessary and,\n\n depending upon the time and expenses involved, could impose an\n\n unreasonable economic expense on the employer.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63011]]\n\n \n\n     With regard to the suggestion that the standard should be revised\n\n in recognition that some employers launder their workers' clothes, the\n\n Department has determined that the standard should remain unchanged. It\n\n\n\n is important, in the Department's view, that workers be provided the\n\n means--tub, scrub bush, soap, and a line for clothing to dry, and a\n\n sufficient amount of water with which to launder all or some of their\n\n clothing on an as needed basis. Of course, if an employer chooses to\n\n provide laundered clothing regularly, the worker's needs are likely to\n\n be minimal.\n\n (9) Paragraph (h)--Food Storage\n\n     Both the TEGLs and the NPRM required that employers must provide\n\n housing with mechanical refrigeration where feasible. Where mechanical\n\n refrigeration is not feasible, the standard provided the employer the\n\n choice to either provide a propane or butane-powered refrigerator or\n\n provide an alternate means by which food can be used or stored to\n\n prevent or avoid spoilage. The TEGLs mentioned salting as method to\n\n avoid spoilage. In the NPRM, the Department proposed ``dehydration'' as\n\n another example of an acceptable alternative. The Department invited\n\n comment on food preservation options in keeping with food safety and\n\n nutrition concerns. These concerns have been addressed in Sec.\n\n IV.B.2.d. of this preamble, in connection with Sec.  655.210.\n\n     As discussed with regard to the meal requirements established by\n\n Sec.  655.210(e), commenters agreed that employers should be required\n\n to provide range workers with ``adequate'' meals or ``sufficient'' food\n\n to prepare healthy, nutritious meals and appropriate means for food\n\n storage. Insofar as food storage methods are concerned, commenters\n\n disagreed as to whether mechanical refrigeration should be required.\n\n\n\n The worker advocates suggested that the Department adopt a hierarchy of\n\n food storage methods, so that alternatives to refrigeration (e.g.,\n\n salting and dehydration) could only be used where such refrigeration is\n\n not possible. The worker advocates stated that advances in power\n\n options (propane located outside the unit, battery packs, and solar\n\n equipment) make refrigeration available in most instances and that\n\n their use to maintain a temperature at or below 45 degrees would allow\n\n the storage of fresh produce, thereby improving the variety and\n\n nutritional value of the workers' diets.\n\n     Employer and employer association commenters stated that while\n\n refrigeration is provided by some employers in some locations, it\n\n cannot be provided in some remote locations (e.g., in the ``summer high\n\n range'') where workers must live in tents and all supplies must be\n\n transported by pack horses. Further, several commenters indicated that\n\n they must comply with Forest Service and BLM regulations, noting that\n\n in some locations the Forest Service requires food be stored in trees\n\n to minimize encounters with potentially dangerous animals. In those\n\n locations, employers stated that they provide food appropriate to the\n\n available food storage options.\n\n     Mountain Plains, Western Range and some employers, including\n\n Siddoway Sheep Company and Henry Etcheverry, read the proposal to\n\n require refrigeration units when tents are being used, an undue and\n\n likely impossible burden, because an employer's use of tents, in their\n\n view, means that the herd is located in an area where the terrain is\n\n\n\n rugged and supplies and equipment must be transported by pack horses.\n\n The Siddoway Sheep Company proposed that the purpose served by\n\n refrigeration--to ensure that workers receive nutritious meals--could\n\n be achieved by providing the workers with fresh meat and fresh produce\n\n for consumption in the short term, supplemented by a variety of canned\n\n meats, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n     The Department recognizes that range work is performed throughout\n\n the year in a wide variety of locations, including some that are remote\n\n and not accessible by motorized vehicle. Yet it remains appropriate to\n\n establish a minimum standard that is flexible enough to apply to the\n\n variety of situations on the range. The historical approach, embodied\n\n in the TEGLs and the NPPRM, achieves this purpose. It allows\n\n flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that employers provide\n\n adequate and sufficient meals to workers, which cannot be met without\n\n ensuring that appropriate methods of storage are also provided.\n\n     Under the proposal and as adopted in the Final Rule, where\n\n mechanical refrigeration is not feasible, an employer may choose among\n\n alternative means to eliminate or reduce spoilage of food and thereby\n\n meet its obligations under the standard, established in Sec.  655.210,\n\n to provide workers with sufficient and adequate meals. While the\n\n provision of a butane or propane refrigerator, obviously, would best\n\n replicate mechanical refrigeration, we conclude that requiring such use\n\n would be impractical in many instances. The Department also recognizes\n\n that in some instances, regulations by other government agencies,\n\n\n\n including those designed to protect people from potentially dangerous\n\n encounters with wild animals, will determine appropriate storage\n\n methods. Further, as noted below in connection with Sec.  655.235(k),\n\n employers are required to provide sealed containers for storing food\n\n where there is a risk of contamination of the food by insects, rodents,\n\n or other vermin.\n\n (10) Paragraph (i)--Cooking and Eating Facilities\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM required that if workers were permitted or\n\n required to cook in their housing, the employer must provide a space\n\n with adequate lighting and ventilation for this purpose. The TEGLs and\n\n the NPRM required that the wall surfaces next to the areas for food\n\n preparation and cooking must be non-absorbent and easy to clean. They\n\n further required that the wall surface next to cooking areas must be\n\n made of fire-resistant material. No substantive comments were received\n\n on these particular points and the Final Rule adopts the proposal\n\n without change.\n\n (11) Paragraph (j)--Garbage and Other Refuse\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM required employers to provide clean,\n\n durable, and fly-tight containers for each housing unit. If refuse and\n\n garbage cannot be buried, the employer was required to collect the\n\n garbage twice weekly or more often if necessary. The Department\n\n received only a single comment on this standard. The Siddoway Sheep\n\n Company stated that the garbage disposal requirements should be\n\n clarified because a twice-weekly schedule for removal is impractical in\n\n mountain areas, where resupply occurs only once every 8-10 days.\n\n\n\n     In the discussion above related to Sec.  655.235(b), the Department\n\n recognized the impracticality of moving supplies in areas that are not\n\n accessible by vehicle. Similar problems are involved with the disposal\n\n of refuse and garbage by packhorse or other means. Accordingly, the\n\n Final Rule has been revised to provide a limited exception to the\n\n general requirement where garbage and other refuse cannot be buried. In\n\n those situations, the employer must collect and remove the garbage and\n\n other refuse on the return leg of its supply run. The Department\n\n reminds employers that other agencies may regulate the storage and\n\n disposal of garbage and refuse, and employers are required to comply\n\n where such regulations are applicable.\n\n     Accordingly, the text has been revised as discussed. Apart from\n\n this revision,\n\n \n\n [[Page 63012]]\n\n \n\n the Final Rule adopts the proposal without change.\n\n (12) Paragraph (k)--Insect and Rodent Control\n\n     Both TEGLs and the NPRM required the employer to provide\n\n appropriate materials, including sprays, to combat insects, rodents,\n\n and other vermin. The Department received no comment directly on this\n\n point and the Final Rule adopts the proposal without change. A private\n\n individual, worker advocates, and employers submitted comments on\n\n protecting food from insects, rodents, and other wildlife. A private\n\n\n\n citizen, noting the difficulty of keeping insects away even in private\n\n residential areas of the country, recommended that the Department\n\n require employers to provide sealed containers to prevent insect\n\n contamination. While the Department construes its food storage and\n\n insect and rodent control standards to require this practice, the\n\n Department has determined that worker health would be better protected\n\n by making this requirement explicit. Accordingly, in the Final Rule,\n\n the Department has revised the proposal to provide: ``Appropriate\n\n materials, including sealed containers for food storage, must be\n\n provided to aid housing occupants in combating insects, rodents, and\n\n other vermin'' (adding underscored text).\n\n (13) Paragraph (l)--Sleeping Facilities\n\n     The NPRM retained, with minor clarifying edits, the requirement\n\n under the TEGLs that each worker have his or her own comfortable bed,\n\n cot, or bunk with mattress. The NPRM also continued the existing\n\n variance from this requirement for temporary situations of up to three\n\n days, in which two workers could share a mobile housing unit with a\n\n single bed, provided each worker was provided his or her own sleeping\n\n bag or bedding.\n\n     Even though the Department's intent was only to maintain the\n\n existing standard, many commenters, including Mountain Plains, Western\n\n Range, Wyoming Wool Growers, and the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association, perceived the proposal as a new requirement. For example,\n\n the Colorado Wool Growers Association stated that this standard would\n\n\n\n require employers to transport a second mobile unit whenever they have\n\n two workers herding the same flock. An employer, Kay and David O.\n\n Neves, expressed the concern that the proposed standard would prevent a\n\n new herder from living in a two-bed unit with an experienced herder,\n\n denying the worker and the employer the benefit of the seasoned\n\n worker's experience. Other commenters, including the Texas Sheep & Goat\n\n Raisers Association also expressed concern about how the standard\n\n should be applied, i.e., whether employers must provide a physically\n\n separate area for a second herder to sleep in the housing, only\n\n separate cots or beds, or only separate bedding (blanket, other linen,\n\n or sleeping bag). Mountain Plains, Western Range, and Wyoming Wool\n\n Growers requested that we remove the three-consecutive day limit on two\n\n workers sharing a unit with a single bed, stating that winter\n\n conditions and safety considerations often require two workers to care\n\n for the herd, and practical considerations prevent moving a second\n\n camper every few days. They argued in favor of revising the rule to\n\n allow two workers to share a single camper as long as there is space\n\n for two sleeping bags.\n\n     The associations and several other commenters stated that the\n\n phrase ``sleeping facility'' was confusing, leaving them guessing\n\n whether it refers only to a bed or the entire camp structure. The\n\n confusion caused alarm among several commenters who read the proposal\n\n to require that they must have two separate mobile housing units\n\n\n\n whenever two herders would be staying overnight at the same location.\n\n Several mentioned that this requirement would force them to purchase\n\n new units at a cost of $20,000 per vehicle.\n\n     To remedy the concerns noted, Mountain Plains and Western Range\n\n suggested that a ``sleeping unit'' should be defined as ``a comfortable\n\n bed, cot, or bunk with a clean mattress.'' On a separate point, the\n\n worker advocates recommended that the Department revise the standard to\n\n require that mattresses and pads not sit on the floor of a housing\n\n structure and to require that if foam pads are provided, they must be\n\n thicker than two inches and covered completely with a washable\n\n material. On a related point, the Siddoway Sheep Company requested\n\n modification of the sleeping facilities standard to relieve employers\n\n of the requirement to provide mattresses or cots when workers are\n\n living in tents. It stated that its experience has been that range\n\n workers do not use the cots it has provided, preferring instead to use\n\n pine boughs.\n\n     The Department has determined that its use of the term ``sleeping\n\n facility'' rather than a term such as ``sleeping arrangement'' or even\n\n more simply ``a separate bed,'' to describe this standard has\n\n contributed to unnecessary confusion. ``Sleeping facility,'' even as\n\n defined in the TEGLs and the proposal, carries with it the idea of a\n\n physical structure, such as a camper or bunk. As such, the standard can\n\n be read to require that whenever an employer assigns a second range\n\n\n\n worker for longer than three days to work with a another herder, it\n\n must provide a separate structure, a separate area within a single\n\n structure, or separate bed or cot, or some combination of such\n\n requirements, for each worker.\n\n     We have revised the requirement to make plain that an employer is\n\n not permitted to require workers to use or share a single bed for more\n\n than three consecutive days. It should be emphasized that the sleeping\n\n standard establishes the general requirement that each worker, on a\n\n nightly basis, must be provided his or her own separate bed. The shared\n\n sleeping exception is limited to infrequent and temporary (no longer\n\n than 3 days) situations where it is impractical to provide a worker\n\n with a separate bed, mattress, or cot. The exception cannot be used in\n\n other situations to circumvent the requirement of one worker, one bed.\n\n Of course, if the camper is designed and certified for occupancy by two\n\n people, and has two beds, two workers may occupy it.\n\n     In the Final Rule, we have revised the proposed standard to better\n\n distinguish the general requirement from the limited three-day\n\n exception.\n\n     Each worker must be provided housing (including a camper or tent,\n\n when permitted or required) that contains, except in a family\n\n arrangement, his or her own comfortable bed, cot, or bunk with a clean\n\n mattress. An employer may be permitted to require workers to use or\n\n\n\n share a single bed only where:\n\n      The employer makes the request when filing an application\n\n for certification;\n\n      demonstrates to the satisfaction of the CO that it would\n\n be impossible or impractical to provide each worker with a separate\n\n bed; and\n\n      the employer provides the second worker a sleeping bag or\n\n bed roll free of charge or deposit charge.\n\n     With regard to the comment that the Department should revise the\n\n standard to relieve employers from providing a cot and mattress when\n\n workers are staying in tents, the Department disagrees. In doing so,\n\n the Department would be removing a basic measure of sleeping comfort.\n\n At the same time, it should be clear that the standard does not require\n\n a worker to use a mattress and cot if he or she prefers to sleep on\n\n pine boughs or some alternative foundation. An employer meets its\n\n obligations under the standards by making available the mattress and\n\n cot to the worker and allowing him or her to\n\n \n\n [[Page 63013]]\n\n \n\n freely choose whether or not to use these items.\n\n     As a final matter, the Department is not persuaded that it should\n\n mandate a specific thickness or covering for a sleeping pad or require\n\n\n\n an employer to modify its housing to ensure that no worker may be\n\n required to sleep on mattresses and pads that sit on the floor of the\n\n housing structure. The standard requires that the employer provide a\n\n comfortable bed, a standard that admittedly allows room for\n\n interpretation, but ensures that a worker must be provided a mattress\n\n or its equivalent, which must be clean and which provides some comfort\n\n from the alternative of sleeping directly on a hard surface. The\n\n rulemaking record does not provide sufficient information that would\n\n allow the Department to establish a particular thickness for pads,\n\n their covering, or similar particulars for bedding.\n\n (14) Paragraph (m)--Fire, Safety, and First Aid\n\n     The NPRM continued the requirements established under the TEGLs\n\n that:\n\n      An employer must provide housing that must be constructed\n\n and maintained in compliance with applicable state or local fire and\n\n safety laws;\n\n      the storage of flammable or volatile liquids or other\n\n materials in living areas is prohibited, except for those needed for\n\n current household use;\n\n      the housing provide two safe means by which a worker may\n\n escape the unit without difficulty, excepting tents from the\n\n requirement of a second means of escape unless they are large and their\n\n walls are constructed of rigid material; and\n\n      the employers must provide a first aid kit and provide\n\n adequate fire extinguishers in good working condition.\n\n\n\n     The worker advocates commented on three aspects of the proposal,\n\n requesting the Department to require employers: To install smoke\n\n detectors in housing and to provide easily accessible fire\n\n extinguishers; to require that there be an emergency exit, with egress\n\n at rear, of each housing structure; and to include particular items, as\n\n identified by the Department, in first aid kits. The worker advocates\n\n did not suggest the inclusion of any particular items, but asked the\n\n Department to consider the need for items to treat illnesses related to\n\n exposure to cold temperatures.\n\n     In the Department's view, the proposed standard adequately meets\n\n these concerns. The worker advocates have provided no evidence that the\n\n standards are inadequate or that workers have been put at risk by the\n\n application of the standards. The proposed standard requires compliance\n\n with applicable fire and safety laws, including a second means of\n\n escape, and requires the unit to have a fire extinguisher in good\n\n working condition. The proposed language does not explicitly state that\n\n the fire extinguisher must be accessible. We have added this\n\n requirement to the standard.\n\n     Where state and local authorities have determined that smoke or\n\n fire detectors are required for the type of housing provided workers,\n\n employers must comply with those requirements. Where such laws do not\n\n apply to such housing, without any demonstration that the lack of such\n\n devices has caused injury to workers the Department is ill-equipped to\n\n\n\n mandate their use. Similarly, local and state fire departments,\n\n nongovernmental organizations, such as the Red Cross or organizations\n\n comprised of camping, hiking, or wilderness exploring enthusiasts, or\n\n their worker's compensation insurers, are better suited than the\n\n Department, at present, to recommend the items to be included in first\n\n aid kits, especially for treating injuries caused by exposure to the\n\n elements. However, we would expect that employers in stocking the\n\n required first aid kit will take into account the conditions under\n\n which range work is performed, including the risks posed by insects,\n\n wildlife, and the worker's exposure to extremes of heat, cold, storms,\n\n and rugged terrain.\n\n     We decline the worker advocates' suggestion that the Department\n\n should require employers to provide a hand-cranked generator for\n\n emergencies. They have not provided any evidence that would allow the\n\n Department to properly consider this request. With regard to their\n\n comment on first aid kits, they again have not provided sufficient\n\n evidence that would allow the Department to properly consider this\n\n request.\n\n     The Final Rule adopts the proposal on fire, safety, and first aid\n\n without substantive change. The Final Rule makes three minor changes.\n\n We have clarified that an employer must comply with both state and\n\n local fire and safety laws and that the standards apply to all housing\n\n covered by Sec.  655.235, a change, as discussed earlier in connection\n\n with Sec.  655.230, to make plain that stationary housing used by some\n\n\n\n employers on grazing trails must comply with the standards, which were\n\n previously referred to ``mobile housing.'' Finally, we have clarified\n\n that employers must ensure the accessibility of fire extinguishers.\n\n \n\n V. Administrative Information\n\n \n\n A. Executive Order 13563 and Executive Order 12866\n\n \n\n     Executive Order (E.O.) 13563 directs agencies to: Propose or adopt\n\n a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits\n\n justify its costs; tailor the regulation to impose the least burden on\n\n society, consistent with achieving the regulatory objectives; and in\n\n choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, select those\n\n approaches that maximize net benefits. E.O. 13563 recognizes that some\n\n benefits are difficult to quantify and provides that, where appropriate\n\n and permitted by law, agencies may consider and discuss qualitatively\n\n values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including equity,\n\n human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts.\n\n     Under E.O. 12866, the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's)\n\n Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines whether\n\n a regulatory action is significant and, therefore, subject to the\n\n requirements of the E.O. and OMB review. Section 3(f) of E.O. 12866\n\n defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as any regulatory action\n\n that is likely to result in a rule that: (1) Has an annual effect on\n\n the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affects in a material\n\n\n\n way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,\n\n jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or\n\n tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically\n\n significant''); (2) creates serious inconsistency or otherwise\n\n interferes with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)\n\n materially alters the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user\n\n fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients\n\n thereof; or (4) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of\n\n legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth\n\n in the E.O.\n\n     OIRA has designated the Final Rule a significant regulatory action\n\n under sec. 3(f) of E.O. 12866 but not an economically significant rule.\n\n The economic effects of the costs and transfers that would result from\n\n the changes in this Final Rule, above and beyond the impacts of the\n\n program as it is currently implemented, are not economically\n\n significant. The largest impact on employers will result from\n\n implementation of the wage setting methodology. The Final Rule will\n\n result in average annual transfers from employers to employees due to\n\n increased wages of $17.46 million between 2016 and 2025, which includes\n\n \n\n [[Page 63014]]\n\n \n\n a two-year transition period during 2016 and 2017, with full\n\n implementation in 2018.61 62 For those employers engaged in\n\n\n\n the range production of livestock other than sheepherding and goat\n\n herding, the Final Rule requires employers to provide food or meals,\n\n free of charge, to workers at an average annual cost of $1.78 million\n\n (employers engaged in sheepherding and goat herding must already\n\n provide free food under the TEGL, so it is part of the baseline;\n\n although employers engaged in the range production of livestock\n\n currently must provide free food based on the SWA wage survey, that\n\n could change, so we accounted for the cost). The special procedures\n\n guidance currently in place for the range production of livestock and\n\n sheepherding and goat herding require the provision of an adequate and\n\n convenient supply of water that meets the standards of the state health\n\n authority in sufficient amount to provide for drinking, cooking, and\n\n bathing. The Final Rule clarifies the required water supply by\n\n generally requiring the supply of at least 4.5 gallons of potable water\n\n per day for drinking and cooking, and modifies it by including water\n\n for laundry (with certain exceptions). The additional costs incurred by\n\n employers resulting from these requirements in the Final Rule average\n\n $2.36 million annually and include the cost of the potable water,\n\n utility trailers, vehicle mileage, and labor to deliver the water and\n\n food to workers.\\63\\ The Final Rule also includes a requirement that\n\n employers provide access to cooking and cleaning facilities when\n\n workers are located at or near a fixed-site ranch or farm. As the\n\n Department anticipates existing cooking facilities will accommodate\n\n that requirement, the estimated average annual cost to employers for\n\n\n\n costs related to the provision of cleaning facilities is $0.75 million.\n\n The additional cost incurred by employers for recordkeeping is $0.19\n\n million per year and $0.10 million for the heating equipment per year,\n\n respectively. Finally, the cost for the time required to read and\n\n review the Final Rule is $0.01 million per year. The Final Rule\n\n involves some cost reductions for employers, primarily for those who\n\n will no longer be required to place newspaper advertisements, which\n\n amount to $0.06 million per year. Therefore, the average annual cost of\n\n the Final Rule is $5.13 million.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\61\\ Some part of these increased wages will be paid to foreign\n\n workers. Following Circular A-4, these payments may potentially be\n\n considered costs from the perspective of the U,S. economy, but\n\n should be considered transfers if these workers can be considered\n\n ``residents'' of the U.S. or if the global effects of the regulatory\n\n change are analyzed.\n\n     \\62\\ To determine the new required monthly wage rate for 2016,\n\n the Department first multiplies $7.25 per hour times 48 hours per\n\n week times 4.333 weeks per month. For years after 2016, the\n\n Department calculates the average change in the quarterly wages and\n\n salaries Employment Cost Index (ECI) for each year from 2012 through\n\n 2014. We then take the average year-over-year ECI growth rate and in\n\n 2017 apply the resulting value to the 2016 monthly wage, and we\n\n apply the ECI growth rate to the prior year's result again for each\n\n\n\n subsequent year. There is a transition period during 2016 and 2017,\n\n when the resulting monthly wage is multiplied times .8 and .9,\n\n respectively. This methodology is described in detail in Section 4:\n\n Subject-by-Subject Analysis. The $17.46 million in increased wages\n\n likely is an overestimate of the impact as several employer\n\n commenters stated that they already pay wages in excess of the\n\n currently required wages (as well as for other reasons addressed in\n\n Section 4).\n\n     \\63\\ The estimate of $2.36 million is likely an overestimate\n\n based on the fact employers are already required to provide water\n\n for drinking, cooking, and bathing that meets state health\n\n standards, and it presumes delivery 50 weeks of the year when\n\n workers are only required to be on the range for a majority of the\n\n job order period.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n 1. The Mendoza Litigation and Need for Rulemaking\n\n     In Mendoza, et al. v. Solis et al., U.S. workers filed a lawsuit in\n\n the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the\n\n special procedures for sheepherding, goat herding, and occupations\n\n involved in the production of livestock on the range, asserting that\n\n the Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by\n\n adopting ``special procedures'' without first providing notice and an\n\n opportunity for public comment. The district court granted a motion to\n\n\n\n dismiss for lack of standing, but the Court of Appeals for the DC\n\n Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal and held that the\n\n Department's Training and Employment Guidance Letters (TEGLs)\n\n containing special procedures for herding and production of livestock\n\n occupations on the range constituted legislative rules subject to the\n\n APA's procedural notice and comment requirements.\n\n     Through this rulemaking, the Department is complying with an order\n\n issued by the district court on remand to remedy the APA violation\n\n found by the DC Circuit. The lawsuit, however, is only one of the\n\n reasons for the promulgation of this Final Rule. The unique on-call\n\n nature (up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) of the work activity in\n\n isolated areas associated with these occupations, coupled with the\n\n sustained scarcity of U.S. workers employed in herding, has made\n\n determining an appropriate prevailing wage increasingly difficult under\n\n the current methodology for determining wages for these occupations. In\n\n these occupations, the prevailing wage serves as the Adverse Effect\n\n Wage Rate (AEWR). Few employers provide U.S. worker wage information in\n\n response to prevailing wage survey requests for these occupations,\n\n making it difficult for State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) to submit\n\n statistically valid prevailing wage findings to the OFLC Administrator.\n\n For example, based on a review of employer surveys conducted over the\n\n last four years by approximately 10 states located in the mountain\n\n plains/western regions of the United States, all of the SWAs with\n\n reportable wage results under ETA's guidelines reported a combined\n\n total of only 30 (2012), 26 (2013), 18 (2014), and 52 (2015) domestic\n\n\n\n workers performing sheepherding; these numbers are insufficient to\n\n report statistically reliable wage results by state. Therefore, through\n\n this rulemaking, the Department plans to establish a more effective\n\n methodology for determining and adjusting a monthly wage rate for these\n\n unique occupations that adequately protects U.S. and H-2A workers in\n\n these occupations. In addition, the Department has received complaints\n\n concerning housing conditions and has found violations of the housing\n\n standards in both complaint and directed (non-complaint)\n\n investigations. In addition, several cases have been litigated in which\n\n workers' health and safety were at question. See Ruiz v. Fernandez, 949\n\n F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1060 (E.D. Wash. 2013) (denying defendants' motion\n\n for summary judgment where plaintiff-sheepherders alleged mistreatment,\n\n including denied breaks, threats of deportation, inadequate food, and\n\n housing that did not meet the minimum health and safety standards);\n\n Camayo v. John Peroulis & Sons Sheep, Inc., No. 10-CV-00772-MSK-MJW,\n\n 2012 WL 4359086, at *1 (D. Colo. Sept. 24, 2012) (denying defendant's\n\n motion to dismiss where plaintiff-sheepherders alleged severe\n\n mistreatment, including lack of food); In the Matter of: John Peroulis\n\n & Sons Sheep, Inc., ALJ Case No. 2012-TAE-00004 (appeal pending before\n\n ARB) (ALJ upheld the Department's charges against employer for multiple\n\n violations, including lack of adequate housing).\n\n 2. Regulatory Alternatives\n\n     In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Department\n\n proposed to set the monthly AEWR for these occupations based on\n\n\n\n forecasted AEWR values from the Farm Labor Survey conducted by U.S.\n\n Department of Agriculture USDA (FLS-based AEWR) multiplied by an\n\n estimate of 44 hours per week, with a four-year transition and full\n\n implementation in year five (referred to in the NPRM as a five-year\n\n \n\n [[Page 63015]]\n\n \n\n phase-in). In addition, DOL considered the following two alternatives:\n\n (1) Base the monthly AEWR on the FLS-based AEWR multiplied by 44 hours\n\n with a two-year transition and full implementation in year three; or\n\n (2) base the monthly AEWR on the FLS-based AEWR multiplied by 44 hours\n\n with no transition.\n\n     The Department received numerous comments related to the\n\n alternatives considered in the NPRM's EO 12866 analysis. Many\n\n commenters, including Mountain Plains Agricultural Services and Western\n\n Range Association (Mountain Plains and Western Range) and the Texas\n\n Sheep & Goat Raisers Association, as well as Brent Espil, Cunningham\n\n Sheep Co., and Siddoway Sheep Company, Inc. (individual employers)\n\n asserted that the alternatives were not ``true'' alternatives in that\n\n the Department did not consider other ways to determine the AEWR for\n\n occupations involving the herding or production of livestock on the\n\n range. For this reason, some commenters stated that the Department\n\n failed to meet the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility\n\n Act (RFA). They characterized the three alternatives presented by the\n\n Department as one alternative with three transition periods methods,\n\n\n\n and stated that in their view the alternatives therefore do not satisfy\n\n the requirements of Section 603(c) of the RFA to describe ``any\n\n significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the\n\n stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any\n\n significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.''\n\n The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy\n\n similarly asserted that the Department did not analyze any regulatory\n\n alternatives that may minimize the economic impact of the proposed rule\n\n on small businesses, and suggested that the Department publish a\n\n Supplemental Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). The\n\n Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation--a trade association--questioned why the\n\n Department did not consider longer phase-in alternatives. In the Final\n\n Rule, the Department analyzes a different set of alternatives that\n\n utilize different wage rate sources, including the Fair Labor Standards\n\n Act (FLSA) current minimum wage of $7.25/hour, the 1994 TEGL monthly\n\n wage rates indexed by the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for wages and\n\n salaries as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the\n\n FLS-based AEWR.\n\n     The Department carefully reviewed the comments related to the\n\n proposed wage setting methodology and to the alternatives laid out in\n\n the E.O. 12866 analysis and the IRFA. After considering the comments,\n\n the Department has decided to set wage the monthly AEWR for range\n\n herders of sheep, goats, and other livestock using a formula based on\n\n the current FLSA minimum wage of $7.25/hour as a starting point,\n\n multiplied by a revised weekly estimate of 48 hours per week, with\n\n\n\n annual adjustment based on inflation from the ECI for wages and\n\n salaries beginning in year two. This base wage source is generally\n\n consistent with the second of two alternative proposals set forth by\n\n Mountain Plains and Western Range, which was endorsed by the ASI and\n\n many individual employers. DOL adopts a weekly hour estimate of 48,\n\n which is greater than that proposed by these commenters, and a\n\n transition period (two years with full implementation in year three)\n\n shorter than that favored by these commenters. As under the proposal,\n\n the employer is required to pay an applicable Federal or State minimum\n\n wage if higher than the monthly AEWR. As discussed in detail in the\n\n preamble, the Department concludes that this wage rate is both\n\n necessary to provide a meaningful test of the labor market for\n\n available U.S. workers and to protect against adverse effect on workers\n\n in the United States similarly employed.\n\n     As discussed in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA)\n\n that follows, in addition to the wage methodology adopted in this Final\n\n Rule, the Department considered three alternative methods to set the\n\n monthly AEWR: (1) To set the monthly AEWR based on the 1994 TEGL wage\n\n adjusted for inflation using the capped ECI,\\64\\ and a three-year\n\n transition period with full implementation in year four; (2) to set the\n\n monthly AEWR based on an hourly rate of $7.25 multiplied by an estimate\n\n of 44 hours per week and adjusted using the capped ECI beginning in\n\n year five, implemented with a three-year transition period with full\n\n implementation in year four; and (3) to set the monthly AEWR using the\n\n FLS-based AEWR multiplied by an estimate of 65 hours per week without a\n\n\n\n transition and permitting food deductions based on the methodology used\n\n in the rest of the H-2A program.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\64\\ Mountain Plains and Western Range recommended indexing past\n\n wages based on the ECI with a 1.5 percent adjustment if the\n\n percentage increase in the ECI during the previous calendar year was\n\n less than 1.5 percent; by the percentage increase in the ECI if such\n\n percentage was between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, inclusive; or by\n\n 2.5 percent if the percentage increase in the ECI exceeded that\n\n amount. We refer to this methodology throughout as the ``capped\n\n ECI''.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     The selected methodology will most effectively enable the\n\n Department to meet its statutory obligations to determine that there\n\n are not sufficient workers available to perform the labor or services\n\n requested and that the employment of foreign workers will not adversely\n\n affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States\n\n similarly employed before the admission of foreign workers is\n\n permitted. The new wage methodology will begin to address immediately\n\n and substantially the wage stagnation concerns discussed earlier in the\n\n preamble. The transition period recognizes that the full wage increase\n\n\n\n in a single year could lead to disruptions that could be avoided by the\n\n more gradual implementation period. In determining where to set the\n\n monthly AEWR so that it will not result in adverse effect, it was\n\n appropriate for the Department to consider whether a significantly\n\n higher wage could be immediately absorbed by employers or might have\n\n the unintended consequence of reducing the availability of jobs for\n\n U.S. workers because the wage would result in some employers going out\n\n of business or scaling back their operations, as a substantial number\n\n of comments demonstrated.\n\n 3. Economic Analysis\n\n     The economic analysis presented below covers employers engaged in\n\n the herding or production of livestock on the range. The Department's\n\n economic analysis under this Part (III.A) is strictly limited to\n\n meeting the requirements under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. The\n\n Department did not use the economic analysis under this Part as a\n\n factor or basis for determining the scope or extent of the Department's\n\n obligations or responsibilities under the Immigration and Nationality\n\n Act, as amended. Nor did the Department use the economic analysis in\n\n this Part as a relevant factor relating to any requirement under the\n\n Administrative Procedure Act (APA), or any case interpreting the\n\n requirements under the APA.\n\n     The Department derives its estimates by comparing the baseline,\n\n that is, the program benefits and costs under the 2010 Final Rule and\n\n TEGLs 32-10 (Special Procedures: Labor Certification Process for\n\n Employers Engaged in Sheepherding and Goatherding Occupations under the\n\n\n\n H-2A Program) and 15-06, Change 1, (Special Procedures: Labor\n\n Certification Process for Occupations Involved in the Open Range\n\n Production of Livestock under the H-2A Program), against the benefits\n\n and costs associated with the\n\n \n\n [[Page 63016]]\n\n \n\n implementation of provisions contained in the Final Rule. This analysis\n\n assumes that entities subject to the Final Rule are already in\n\n compliance with the 2010 Final Rule and relevant TEGLs. We explain how\n\n the required actions of employers engaged in herding or the production\n\n of livestock on the range are linked to the expected impacts of the\n\n Final Rule.\n\n     The Department has quantified and monetized the impacts of the\n\n Final Rule where feasible. Where we were unable to quantify benefits\n\n and costs--for example, due to data limitations--we describe them\n\n qualitatively and identify which data were not available to quantify\n\n the costs. The analysis covers 10 years (2016 through 2025) to ensure\n\n it captures all major impacts.\\65\\ When summarizing the benefits,\n\n costs, or transfers resulting from specific provisions of the Final\n\n Rule, we present the 10-year averages to estimate the typical annual\n\n effect or 10-year discounted totals to estimate the present value of\n\n the overall effects.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n\n     \\65\\ For the purposes of the cost-benefit analysis, the 10-year\n\n period starts on January 1, 2016.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In the remaining sections, the Department first presents an\n\n overview of general comments received from the public. We then present\n\n a subject-by-subject analysis of the impacts of the Final Rule and a\n\n summary of the costs and transfers, including total impacts over the\n\n 10-year analysis period.\n\n a. General Comments Received on the Economic Analysis\n\n i. Employer Growth Rate\n\n     The NPRM's EO 12866 analysis used an annual growth rate of 2\n\n percent to forecast participation in the H-2A program. Several\n\n commenters stated that this growth rate was inaccurate. Carol Martinez,\n\n Alex (Buster) Dufurrena, and John and Carolyn Espil, individual\n\n employers, stated that the assumed 2-percent annual growth rate of U.S.\n\n sheep producers was inaccurate because the proposed rule would put\n\n additional financial burdens on producers that would force them to\n\n reduce the number of H-2A workers hired or to close. John and Carolyn\n\n Espil referenced the BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook (2014-15\n\n Edition), which predicted that farmers, ranchers, and other\n\n agricultural managers would experience a loss of 179,000 jobs over the\n\n period of 2012-2022, which amounts to a 19 percent reduction.\n\n Similarly, the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association and ASI and\n\n\n\n Public Lands Council stated that after the National Wool Act was phased\n\n out by the Federal government in 1993-1995, tens of thousands of sheep\n\n ranches went out of business and subsequently, in the late 1990's,\n\n linked allied industries also went out of business due to the lack of\n\n lamb and wool. Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that the\n\n assumed 2-percent employer growth rate ``demonstrates how fundamentally\n\n wrong DOL's assumptions are.''\n\n     The Department had estimated the 2-percent annual growth rate based\n\n on historical H-2A program data on labor certifications for\n\n sheepherding, goat herding, and range cattle production employers. For\n\n the Final Rule, the Department updated its analysis by evaluating the\n\n annual change in the number of unique herding employers between FY 2012\n\n and 2014 and found inconsistent results. Between FY 2012 and 2013, we\n\n found a decrease in participation of 114 percent, while the FY 2013 and\n\n 2014 program data indicate an increase in participation of 11 percent.\n\n In light of the comments and this data, in the Final Rule the\n\n Department revises the growth rate to be 0 percent, that is, the\n\n Department assumes the employer participant population in this H-2A\n\n program will neither rise nor fall over the analysis time period.\n\n ii. Comments Received on Impacts on Profitability\n\n     Several commenters stated that the increased costs associated with\n\n the proposed rule, particularly the proposed wage increases, would\n\n destroy the industry. Other commenters questioned the accuracy of the\n\n economic analysis and opposed some of the conclusions presented in the\n\n analysis. For example, Representative Allen Jaggi, an elected official,\n\n\n\n and Skye Krebs, an individual employer, warned that the proposed rule\n\n would force employers out of business because they operate on thin\n\n profit margins. The American Farm Bureau Federation used an industry\n\n standard range sheep farm budget developed by the University of Utah to\n\n analyze the impact of the proposed 2020-2025 forecasted FLS-based AEWR\n\n wage, which resulted in $41,325 per year in additional wages. According\n\n to the American Farm Bureau, if prices fall to year 2002 conditions--\n\n the lowest prices over the period of 2000-2014 ($0.80 per pound for\n\n lambs and $0.53 per pound for wool)--employers in each of the 19 states\n\n analyzed would be operating at a loss (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,\n\n California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico,\n\n Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,\n\n Washington, and Wyoming). They also presented the average prices over\n\n the last five years as well as over the preceding 10 years to\n\n demonstrate the trend in prices. They noted that the average price\n\n received for lamb over the past five years ($1.70 per pound) is 63\n\n percent higher than the price received over the preceding 10 years\n\n ($1.04 per pound), while the average price received for wool over the\n\n last five years ($1.45 per pound) is 113 percent higher than the prices\n\n they received on average over the preceding 10 years ($0.68 per pound).\n\n The State of Utah also submitted data pertaining to the average price\n\n of lamb over time. The State noted that the average price of lamb\n\n increased from $67.94 in 1994 to $157.15 in 2014, which amounts to an\n\n increase of $48.61 over a 20-year period after adjusting for inflation.\n\n Without acknowledging that worker wages have not similarly been\n\n\n\n adjusted for inflation, the commenter stated that this small increase\n\n in the value of lamb cannot support the proposed tripling in the wage\n\n increase and will force producers out of business.\n\n     The Utah Farm Bureau Federation, the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association, and Mountain Plains and Western Range analyzed an\n\n enterprise budget for an Idaho sheep operation with ewes on the range\n\n and selling feeder lambs (Painter, K., Idaho, University of Idaho,\n\n 2014), which earned $60 per head in total returns. Using data for the\n\n State of Utah, the Utah Farm Bureau estimated that after tripling the\n\n wage rate, total returns would decrease 111 percent to negative $6.00\n\n per head, while income above operating costs would decrease 80 percent\n\n from $83,000 to less than $17,000. They stated that tripling the hired\n\n labor rate reduces total returns from a profit of nearly $90,000 to a\n\n loss of approximately $10,200.\n\n     The Wyoming Wool Growers Association stated that the Department\n\n underestimated the cost associated with the proposed wage increase.\n\n They referenced an analysis from the University of Wyoming estimating\n\n that the proposed wage increases would increase the annual operating\n\n costs by more than 40 percent ($39,600) for a Wyoming range sheep\n\n operation with two foreign herders. The analysis also indicated that\n\n income above operating costs would fall by 78 percent (to $11,313)\n\n under current price conditions. The Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association commented that the Department underestimated the cost of\n\n the proposed rule, which included the cost of additional wages over the\n\n period from 2016 to 2020 ($45 million) and non-wage costs ($5 million\n\n\n\n per year).\n\n \n\n [[Page 63017]]\n\n \n\n     John and Carolyn Espil stated that the Department misrepresented\n\n the make-up of the industry as it was presented in the NPRM's Exhibit 2\n\n (The Number and Percentage of H-2A Employers by Occupation and State).\n\n They stated that none of the values in the Exhibit reflected the\n\n Western Range Association's membership numbers. For example, the\n\n Department presented information indicating that Nevada had one\n\n employer, while the Western Range Association had 17 members from\n\n Nevada as of January 2015. Because of what they perceived as an\n\n inaccuracy, they questioned the overall accuracy of the economic\n\n analysis. They also disagreed that the proposed rule was not a major\n\n rule that required review by Congress under the Small Business\n\n Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), asserting that it would\n\n have an economic impact of at least $100 million and would result in\n\n increased costs to consumers, levels of government, and regions due to\n\n failed businesses, the loss of stewardship of the land by livestock\n\n workers, as well as a loss of 40 percent of the sheep industry. They\n\n stated that this would affect competition, employment, investment,\n\n productivity, innovation, and the competitiveness of U.S.-based\n\n businesses.\n\n     Mountain Plains and Western Range, and Vermillion Ranch and Midland\n\n Ranch stated that the economic analysis did not take into account the\n\n\n\n cost of forcing ranches to close or to downsize. The commenters\n\n contended that employers would be forced to sell their herds,\n\n equipment, and land into a buyer's market. Many other commenters\n\n similarly stated that the economic analysis did not estimate the losses\n\n associated with the massive sale of livestock. Since 40 percent of the\n\n nation's sheep graze on ranges, the commenters asserted that the\n\n proposed rule could lead to the sale of breeding ewes for slaughter at\n\n undervalued prices because the market would not be able to absorb them.\n\n Mountain Plains and Western Range, for example, estimated that the\n\n total loss would be $212 million based on the total value of the U.S.\n\n sheep supply. They also emphasized that the ranchers could not simply\n\n raise prices to cover the increased costs because U.S. producers\n\n account for less than seven tenths of one percent of the world's wool\n\n production and less than nine tenths of one percent of the world's lamb\n\n production.\n\n     The commenters focused primarily on the proposed wage increase\n\n because labor is such a significant percentage of their operating\n\n costs, although the statistics they cited were not uniform. The Utah\n\n Farm Bureau Federation referenced an economic analysis conducted by Dr.\n\n Julie Shiflett of Juniper Consulting, which stated that hired labor\n\n accounts for 40 percent of total operating costs for an average western\n\n range sheep operation with two bands of sheep. The Rural Development\n\n Office cited the Utah Woolgrowers Association, which also stated that\n\n labor costs make up 40 percent of total operating costs in Utah sheep\n\n operations.\n\n\n\n     On the other hand, the Wyoming Livestock Board, the Texas Sheep &\n\n Goat Raisers Association, Mountain Plains and Western Range, and ASI\n\n and Public Lands Council summarized that current statistics from ASI\n\n show that, on average, hired labor costs make up 24 percent of a sheep\n\n rancher's total operating costs. The Diamond Sheep Company stated that\n\n wage costs represent approximately 20 percent of its operation's annual\n\n costs. The commenter noted that, in total, nearly 30 percent of its\n\n annual operating costs are labor-related when groceries--which make up\n\n approximately five percent--and travel and labor document fees--which\n\n make up 2 percent--are included.\n\n     Several commenters described the effect the proposed rule's wage\n\n increases would have on their operations, with some indicating that the\n\n proposal would result in annual operating losses:\n\n      FIM Corp. stated that over the period of 2006-2013, its\n\n gross annual income from sales of wool, lambs, sheep, and hay averaged\n\n $1.1 million and that after operating expenses are taken out, its net\n\n income averaged approximately three percent of gross income. FIM Corp.\n\n further stated that the proposed tripling of sheepherder wages would\n\n result in approximately $250,000 per year in additional wage payments.\n\n The commenter also noted that it employs 11 H-2A sheepherders and seven\n\n workers for other ranch work, and stated that it treats them equally;\n\n hence, it would apply any wage increase imposed by the Department to\n\n all workers, which would cost the commenter's operation between\n\n $320,000 and $450,000 per year.\n\n\n\n      David and Bonnie Little stated that they typically employ\n\n 10 sheepherders and that the proposed wage increase would add an\n\n additional $180,000 per year in payroll expenses, which exceeds their\n\n average adjusted gross income of $79,000.\n\n      Steve Raftapoulos, an individual employer, stated that the\n\n proposed wage increase alone would result in a loss of approximately\n\n $120,000 in 2017 and $320,000 by 2020.\n\n      The Siddoway Sheep Company stated that the proposed wage\n\n increase would result in increased costs of $98,354 over the first five\n\n years of implementation, excluding employer liability for payroll\n\n taxes, while using the FLS-based AEWR with no transition would result\n\n in increased costs of $138,539 over the first five years of\n\n implementation. Siddoway stated that the wage increases should be\n\n consistent with average wage growth, and stated (without noting that\n\n there has been almost no wage growth for H-2A herders since 1994) that\n\n the average wage for U.S. workers increased 3.13 percent in 2011, 3.12\n\n percent in 2012, and 1.28 percent in 2013.\n\n      Eph Jensen Livestock, LLC stated that, in 2014, wages paid\n\n to sheepherders accounted for nine percent of the gross revenue and\n\n would have accounted for as high as 30 percent if the proposed rule had\n\n been fully implemented.\n\n     In contrast to the comments from employers, the Worker Advocates'\n\n Joint Comment emphasized that the proposed monthly wage was\n\n inappropriately low. They criticized the weekly number of hours used to\n\n set the proposed monthly wage, presenting data from a survey of 90 H-2A\n\n\n\n herders indicating that only 7 percent worked less than 60 hours per\n\n week, while 62 percent worked more than 81 hours per week, and 35\n\n percent worked more than 91 hours per week. In their view, this study\n\n demonstrates that the 44-hour assumption used in the proposal is a\n\n significant underestimate of the actual number of hours worked. In\n\n support of the view that the FLS-based AEWR should be immediately\n\n effective, the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment pointed to several\n\n examples of jobs that, in the their view, demonstrated that the\n\n ranching industry already supports workers earning the full FLS-based\n\n AEWR who perform similar work, particularly citing ``Sheep, Farmworker\n\n General'' in Wyoming, ``Closed Range Herders'' in Texas, and ranch\n\n hands performing livestock as well as other tasks. They further cited\n\n wage rates paid by employers ``in states without large herder\n\n populations,'' such as for Maine sheep farmers and sheep farm workers\n\n in North Dakota (both paid on an hourly basis). Further, they noted\n\n that California, where employers are significant participants in the H-\n\n 2A program, has a wage rate for herders that is significantly higher\n\n than the current TEGL wages in other States.\n\n     In response to the comments on potential economic losses to H-2A\n\n employers attributable to the proposed\n\n \n\n [[Page 63018]]\n\n \n\n rule, the Department considered enterprise budgets pertaining to range\n\n\n\n sheep production submitted by commenters and the economic analysis\n\n provided by the American Farm Bureau on the range sheep production\n\n industry, in assessing the industry's ability to absorb the increased\n\n wages that would have been required based on the FLS-based wage\n\n methodology in the proposed rule.\\66\\ The Department also considered\n\n the comments from individual employers who provided the data on wage\n\n increases as a percentage of their revenues and profits. We also\n\n reviewed the historic pricing data for lamb and wool, which show\n\n significant fluctuations over the years. The Department also carefully\n\n reviewed the comments from worker advocates regarding the wages paid in\n\n occupations that they view as comparable to range herding jobs and the\n\n hours worked.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\66\\ As discussed below, the enterprise budgets are from various\n\n years when labor, lamb, wool and all other factors were priced at\n\n different levels, making them of somewhat limited utility; however,\n\n they provided a useful starting point for the analysis.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     After carefully evaluating all of the available information, we\n\n found that the data did not warrant setting wages for these occupations\n\n based on the FLS-based AEWR for the reasons discussed in detail in the\n\n preamble and summarized below. If the rule would result in a\n\n\n\n substantial number of range herding employers closing their operations\n\n or significantly reducing the number of workers hired, that would\n\n result in fewer jobs being available to U.S. workers and would thus be\n\n inconsistent with the Department's obligation to protect against\n\n adverse effect to U.S. workers.\n\n     First, the Department received many comments from employers who\n\n have been in the business for many generations asserting that the\n\n proposed wage rate would cause many employers to either go out of\n\n business entirely or to downsize and greatly reduce the number of\n\n workers employed. Commenters provided enterprise budgets for the range\n\n sheep production firms in Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah.\\67\\ The enterprise\n\n budgets for range sheep production show that applying the full FLS-\n\n based proposed AEWR to H-2A workers will lead to a wage increase of\n\n about 290 percent, which under the conditions presented will entirely\n\n eliminate profits in Wyoming and Idaho and substantially diminish them\n\n in Utah. For example, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association estimated\n\n that the proposed wage increase would reduce annual returns to a\n\n negative $16,237. The commenter asserted that based on the past 20\n\n years of total receipts per ewe, the sheep operation would have been\n\n able to pay total operating and ownership costs only eight percent of\n\n the time over the 20-year period if labor costs were as high as\n\n proposed by the Department.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n\n     \\67\\ Wyoming Wool Growers Association, ``Economic Importance of\n\n Sheep Production in Wyoming,'' \nhttp://wyowool.com/NewsandInfo/2015/Supplemental%20Info_UWYO%20Analysis_EconImpactSheep%20in%20W\nY.pdf;\n\n University of Idaho Extension, ``2014 Idaho Livestock Costs and\n\n Return Estimate--Sheep Range,''            http://web.cals.uidaho.edu/idahoagbiz/files/2015/04/EBB-SR1-14.pdf; \nUtah State University,\n\n Extension Economics, E.

The reduced profits are approximately $75,000 on\n\n average per firm in those states. When the 2002 prices are used, which\n\n were the lowest over the 15-year period, profits for range sheep\n\n production firms in all five states will be entirely eliminated. The\n\n American Farm Bureau stated that the historic prices for feeder lamb\n\n and shorn wool have fluctuated greatly over the last 25 years and that\n\n it is probable they will return to prices lower than the current\n\n prices, which in the past few years have been at historic highs.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\68\\ $1.26/lb 60-90 pound feeder lambs, $0.90/lb shorn wool.\n\nhttp://wyowool.com/NewsandInfo/2015/Supplemental%20Info_UWYO%20Analysis_EconImpactSheep%20in%20WY.pdf;\nhttp://wyowool.com/NewsandInfo/2015/Supplemental%20Info_UWYO%20Analysis_EconImpactSheep%20in%20WY.pdf;\nhttp://web.cals.uidaho.edu/idahoagbiz/files/2015/04/EBB-SR1-14.pdf;\nhttp://extension.usu.edu/agribusiness/files/uploads/livestock/pdf/1997%20range%20sheep.pdf\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Nevertheless, after considering variations from year to year, the\n\n data reflect that the increases in the prices of wool and lamb have\n\n outpaced the minimal increases in wages, and that based upon the 15-\n\n year average prices a substantial increase is wages could be absorbed.\n\n Thus, even the three primary employer associations have proposed\n\n setting the monthly AEWR based on a methodology that will result in\n\n wages significantly above the current TEGL rates, which we view as\n\n compelling evidence that the industry will remain viable even where\n\n employers pay a significantly higher wage rate to employees in these\n\n occupations. This is consistent with the fact that employers in Oregon\n\n and California are currently paying substantially higher wages (for\n\n example, in California the higher state minimum wage for sheepherders\n\n produces a monthly salary for sheepherders of $1,600.34, and effective\n\n January 1, 2016 it will increase to $1,777.98). Not only does the\n\n industry remain viable at those rates in those States, but California\n\n has the second highest number of employers participating in the H-2A\n\n sheep and goat herder program.\n\n     This evidence is supported by the few comments we received in\n\n support of the proposed wage methodology in the NPRM. These commenters\n\n stated that wage rates based on the full FLS-based AEWR, as in the\n\n proposed rule, are appropriate and necessary to protect against adverse\n\n effect on workers in the U.S. similarly employed. The Worker Advocates'\n\n Joint Comment provided prevailing wage data for various states based on\n\n\n\n wage surveys that show that some H-2A workers performing similar duties\n\n are paid at wage rates that are comparable to the full AEWR.\n\n     However, as discussed in the preamble, DOL found that data did not\n\n warrant setting wages for these occupations based on the FLS-based\n\n AEWR. The record indicates that the proposed approximate tripling in\n\n the wage rates, which would have resulted in higher wage rates than\n\n those in California in several states, could not be absorbed without a\n\n significant risk of job losses. Based on the comments from ranchers,\n\n the Department concludes that at least some sheepherding or goat\n\n herding employers would decide to leave the industry if, due to the\n\n extra costs, they would be able to earn income outside farming that is\n\n significantly higher than their reduced profits or no profit,\n\n especially due to the risky and unpredictable nature of agriculture and\n\n the fluctuations in prices that they receive with an ever-decreasing\n\n share of the world market. Therefore, we conclude that some ranchers\n\n would not be able to continue to do business if they had to pay H-2A\n\n workers at the FLS-based AEWR, thereby resulting in job losses in the\n\n range sheep production industry and related industries.\n\n     As noted above, the Department relied on the enterprise budget data\n\n submitted by commenters only in conjunction with all the other\n\n information in the record in coming to this conclusion, because there\n\n are several limitations on that data. First, the enterprise budget data\n\n is not available for all range sheep production firms in terms of\n\n\n\n various operational sizes and geographical areas, which are factors\n\n that may significantly affect costs and profitability. Second, budgets\n\n are generally constructed to reflect future actions, and it is\n\n difficult to accurately predict future commodity prices and yields.\n\n High degrees of variability in price and production adversely affect\n\n the reliability of the estimates used in the enterprise budgets. Third,\n\n it likely that some of the workers included in the enterprise budgets\n\n are paid wages above those required by the TEGLs; therefore,\n\n \n\n [[Page 63019]]\n\n \n\n the wage increase costs measured in this analysis may overestimate the\n\n true cost increase for H-2A employers. \\69\\ In addition, errors in\n\n developing an enterprise budget from various data sources can compound\n\n themselves to the point where budgets can have limited value in\n\n assessing profitability and break-even values, particularly for range\n\n sheep production. Finally, a rancher could have multiple enterprise\n\n operations that include both range sheep production and range cattle\n\n production. This would negate the accuracy and reliability of the\n\n profitability analysis of the rancher that is solely based on the\n\n enterprise-budget data pertaining to range sheep production.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\69\\ This is particularly true as the budgets are not limited to\n\n H-2A workers, and some employers stated in their public comments\n\n\n\n that they pay even their H-2A herding workers above the minimum\n\n TEGL-required wage.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In that regard, the Department did not receive any economic\n\n analysis pertaining to range cattle production, which is a much smaller\n\n part of the program than the range production of sheep; the limited\n\n data received for cattle herding is generally consistent with that\n\n received on sheep production. For example, Vermillion Ranch and Midland\n\n Ranch, individual employers, provided a link to a study \\70\\ showing\n\n that the average net income (i.e., profit) for range cow/calf\n\n production is 55 cents per acre in New Mexico and also indicated that a\n\n cow/calf operation running 300 head in New Mexico would need about\n\n 31,000 acres. Using 31,000 acres for a viable range cattle production\n\n firm in New Mexico, it would have an annual profit of $17,050. This\n\n profit would be reduced by almost 90 percent to around $1,700 if wages\n\n were increased by 250 percent based on the monthly FLS-based AEWR for\n\n one H-2A worker hired by the firm.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\70\\ New Mexico State University, Cooperative Extension Service\n\n Agricultural Experiment Station, ``Legacy of Agricultural Property\n\n Tax in New Mexico (2011),''            http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF81.pdf.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF81.pdf\n\n\n \n\n     The Department understands that prices for wool and lamb have\n\n varied widely over the past 15 years, and that they are currently at\n\n historic highs, so that in determining the appropriate wage rate we\n\n cannot consider only what employers presently can pay without resulting\n\n in the loss of jobs. Based on the record in the comments as a whole,\n\n the Department concludes that some ranchers would not be able to\n\n continue to do business if they had to pay H-2A workers at the full\n\n FLS-based AEWR, as proposed; thus, there would be a potential for\n\n significant job losses in the range sheep, goat and cattle industries\n\n and related industries. Therefore, the Department modified the required\n\n monthly AEWR in the Final Rule in a manner generally consistent with a\n\n suggestion offered by Mountain Plains and Western Range and many other\n\n commenters, although modified in a manner suggested in the Worker\n\n Advocates' Joint Comment. Thus, the Department has decided to set wage\n\n rates for range sheep, goat and other livestock herders based on a\n\n formula that uses the current FLSA minimum wage as a starting point and\n\n updates it annually for inflation. These rates are in line with those\n\n set forth in the second of two alternative proposals by Mountain Plains\n\n and Western Range, a proposal that was endorsed by ASI and many\n\n individual employers. However, we modify their suggestion by increasing\n\n the number of hours in setting the monthly rate to 48 hours per week,\n\n and by shortening the transition period before the full monthly AEWR\n\n goes into effect. The record, including the comments from the three\n\n\n\n primary employer associations, demonstrate that such higher wage rates\n\n can be absorbed and will not result in significant job losses. In\n\n addition, the viability of these higher wage rates is supported by the\n\n fact that California has continued to have a vibrant herding industry\n\n (it is the second largest user of the H-2A herder program) even in\n\n light of the increased wage rates in that state. The Department\n\n concludes that the increase in operating costs under the new wage rate\n\n initially based on the FLSA should be manageable for ranchers and is\n\n the minimum necessary to overcome the decades of wage stagnation and\n\n require that the job opportunities are made available to U.S. workers\n\n at appropriate wage rates that will not result in adverse effect.\n\n iii. Economic Impacts of Herding on Other Industries\n\n     The Department received numerous comments related to the economic\n\n impacts of herding on other industries. Many commenters asserted that\n\n up- and down-stream businesses in related industries, consumers, as\n\n well as local, state, and national economies would be negatively\n\n affected by the implementation of the rule.\n\n     Several commenters, including ASI and Public Lands Council, the\n\n Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association, and individual employers,\n\n stated that since 38 percent of U.S. sheep are cared for by H-2A\n\n workers, if the proposed rule forced ranchers out of business, it could\n\n result in up- and down-stream losses. The Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association, ASI and Public Lands Council, and the Utah Farm Bureau\n\n Federation estimated that, in 2014 dollars, $1.00 of revenue produced\n\n by a sheep producer generates $1.71 in backward-linked industries and\n\n\n\n $0.80 in forward-linked good and services industries, for a total of\n\n $3.47 in additional economic impacts generated in the local, rural\n\n economy (Shiflett, ASI, Sheep and Lamb Industry Economic Impact\n\n Analysis, April 2008, Revised March 2011). They stated that the U.S.\n\n sheep industry annually generates approximately $500 million in\n\n backward-linked industries through the sale of items such as lambs,\n\n wool, and cull breeding stock. The direct and value-added multiplier\n\n effects were calculated to be an estimated $486.5 million, which\n\n supports an additional $1.2 billion in economic activity for a total of\n\n $1.7 billion. The sheep industry also supports forward-linked\n\n industries, such as local businesses, through expenditures of sheep-\n\n industry generated income on goods and services. Estimates of sales\n\n from retail lamb and wool-related products indicate that $785.6 million\n\n in production generates an additional $1.9 billion in multiplier\n\n effects. The commenters stated that the total economic impact is $2.7\n\n billion. Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that the estimated\n\n value of the direct production of sheep cared for by H-2A workers is\n\n $275 million, and that revenue created in indirect up- and down-stream\n\n businesses is valued at more than $665 million.\n\n     The Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association and ASI and Public Lands\n\n Council further remarked that an estimated loss of $66,167 per rancher\n\n would generate approximately $229,320 in backward- and forward-linked\n\n businesses, and given that they estimate 598 operations employ herders,\n\n rural communities across the West would experience a loss of\n\n\n\n approximately $137.1 million. The commenters stated that a loss of over\n\n $66,000 per sheep rancher would result in 1.67 jobs being lost at the\n\n ranch, which would subsequently result in a total loss of 2.62 jobs in\n\n the local economy. They estimated that if 598 sheep operations\n\n employing herders suffered this loss, the total rural-employment loss\n\n would be 1,568 jobs.\n\n     Many commenters, including the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association, the Wyoming Livestock Board, the Wyoming Wool Growers\n\n Association, the National Lamb Feeders Association, the Garfield County\n\n Farm Bureau, and TVB Management Company, discussed the broader impact\n\n of the rule. Some\n\n \n\n [[Page 63020]]\n\n \n\n cited industry estimates that suggested that each H-2A open-herder\n\n position creates many full-time U.S. jobs up- and down-stream, most of\n\n which are associated with small, rural communities. Mountain Plains and\n\n Western Range stated that significant losses would occur up-stream and\n\n down-stream, because each production of livestock job creates at least\n\n eight full-time U.S. jobs. Commenters cited related industries and jobs\n\n such as feed suppliers, lamb processors, slaughterhouses, meat packing\n\n plants, truck drivers, shearers, textile mills, fencing companies,\n\n veterinarians, supermarket clerks, and butchers who would be affected.\n\n Other commenters focused on the types of supplies and equipment that\n\n sheep businesses typically buy from local businesses (e.g., groceries,\n\n\n\n propane, campers, animal feed, crop seeds, cloth, insurance, medicine,\n\n parts from agriculture dealers and auto part stores, as well as\n\n vehicles and machinery such as ATVs and John Deere and Bobcat\n\n products). The commenters warned that the effects would not be limited\n\n to western sheep operations--the loss of the supporting industry in the\n\n West would force eastern sheep operations out of business as well. They\n\n noted that losing 2,000 H-2A workers could result in the loss of tens\n\n of thousands of U.S. jobs.\n\n     Some commenters from supporting businesses expressed how the\n\n proposed rule would affect them. Below are three comments that were\n\n typical of the comments provided:\n\n      Oregon Shepherd LLC, which manufactures all-natural wool\n\n building insulation, stated that it is a small business with three\n\n employees that depends on the U.S. sheep industry for raw materials. It\n\n is located in a rural Oregon county with a higher than average\n\n unemployment rate.\n\n      Center of the Nation Wool, Inc. is a primary wool supplier\n\n to the U.S. textile industry and acts as a wool marketing agent for a\n\n large percentage of sheep enterprises, which are mostly small family\n\n operations that would be directly affected by the proposed rule. The\n\n commenter asserted that the implementation of the proposed rule could\n\n lead to a loss of textile jobs and destroy the entire lamb and wool\n\n marketing chain.\n\n      Mountain State Rosen, LLC is an integrated lamb packer and\n\n processor. It employs over 300 people and has national distribution\n\n\n\n with annualized sales of $192 million. It is a producer-owned company\n\n affiliated with Mountain States Lamb Cooperative, which is comprised of\n\n 170 lamb producers located in 17 western states, and 65 percent of the\n\n lambs they market through their cooperative come from ranches with H-2A\n\n herders. The commenter stated that volume is critical to its business,\n\n and the proposed rule would force mass liquidation of western sheep\n\n operations, thereby doing significant harm to its business.\n\n     The New Mexico Department of Agriculture, the Wyoming Department of\n\n Workforce Services, the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, Governor\n\n Matthew H. Mead of the State of Wyoming, and John and Carolyn Espil\n\n suggested that the Department should perform a full economic analysis\n\n on the impacts that the proposed rule would have on local, State, and\n\n national economies. ASI and Public Lands Council stated that for some\n\n western states (e.g., Idaho, Colorado, Oregon and New Mexico), the loss\n\n of sheep-related economic activity would affect three to five percent\n\n of the total agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting gross domestic\n\n product (GDP). For other western states, the loss would be more\n\n significant--for example, sheep-related economic activity accounts for\n\n 14 percent of the GDP in Utah and Wyoming. The Lassen County Board of\n\n Supervisors stated that the value of sheep and lamb livestock\n\n production ($1,332,634) made up approximately 25 percent of Lassen\n\n County's 2012 agricultural economic output. Vermillion Ranch and\n\n Midland Ranch stated that Vermillion Ranch holds grazing permits in\n\n Daggett County, Utah, and pays property taxes; hence, it is a critical\n\n part of the local economy (as are other ranches throughout western\n\n\n\n States). John and Carolyn Espil stated that Bureau of Land Management\n\n (BLM) and Forest Service sheep permits would be rendered valueless.\n\n     Other commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would\n\n result in shortages of lamb and wool, because U.S. citizens could not\n\n afford or would not be willing to pay higher prices for lamb and wool.\n\n A consultant to ASI for military procurement stated that the proposed\n\n rule would disrupt the wool industry's ability and requirement (by the\n\n Berry Amendment) to support the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) with\n\n wool for garments and blankets. The commenter stated that over 80\n\n percent of the wool required by DOD is grown in the West on lands\n\n requiring shepherds. If domestic wool production is reduced by 38\n\n percent, it may be impossible for the national industry to supply DOD.\n\n The commenter cited FY 2015 DOD-published accession, retention, and\n\n clothing issue rates, which indicate that DOD would spend over $300\n\n million on wool-based garments and blankets in FY 2015. The commenter\n\n asserted that this expenditure could support as many as 5,000\n\n manufacturing jobs in the U.S. economy, which may be lost if the\n\n proposed rule were implemented.\n\n     The Department is unable to accurately quantify the potential\n\n indirect economic impacts to related industries in the local and\n\n national economies, due to the lack of data and economic models\n\n necessary to conduct an appropriate analysis. Therefore, the Department\n\n estimated the costs only to the sheep, goat and range cattle production\n\n industries that are directed affected by this regulation, both in the\n\n NPRM's EO 12866 analysis and IRFA and in the Final Rule's analyses. In\n\n\n\n the absence of an economic input-output model or comparative general\n\n equilibrium model of the economy specifically developed for sheep, goat\n\n and range livestock production industries, it is not possible to\n\n measure the aggregate indirect economic impact of the Final Rule on\n\n other related industries in the economy with any degree of accuracy.\n\n     Numerous changes made in the Final Rule make these commenters'\n\n concerns about the impact on the broader economy unlikely. These\n\n include for example, the adoption of a definition of ``range'' that\n\n deletes the reference to fencing that so many commenters opposed, the\n\n adoption of a wage setting methodology that is similar to a suggestion\n\n offered by the three primary employer representatives, and the other\n\n flexibilities such as the deletion of the proposed 20 percent cap on\n\n the days that workers could perform duties at the ranch that are\n\n closely and directly relating to herding and/or the production of\n\n livestock. The Department concludes that the Final Rule will not likely\n\n result in the commenter predictions regarding the impact on the broader\n\n economy.\n\n     The Department also is responding to a few other specific comments\n\n that we received. John and Carolyn Espil stated that the Department\n\n misrepresented the make-up of the industry as presented in Exhibit 2 of\n\n the NPRM, which showed the number and percentage of H-2A employers by\n\n occupation and state derived from H-2A employer applications filed with\n\n the Department during FY 2011 and 2012. The Exhibit was not intended to\n\n reflect the total number of employers in the industry in Nevada as of\n\n January 2015 or the number of members of the Western Range Association.\n\n\n\n In the Final Rule, the Department has updated the number of H-2A\n\n employers by state using H-2A employer applications filed during FY\n\n \n\n [[Page 63021]]\n\n \n\n 2013-14. The Exhibits below present the number of unique herder and\n\n range livestock production employers by state for FY2013 and 2014.\n\n However, due to the fact that these occupations involve performing work\n\n on itineraries covering multiple states, some employers applied for\n\n certification covering areas of employment in multiple states; thus,\n\n the total number of unique employers is overstated.\n\n BILLING CODE 4510-FP-P\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.009\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63022]]\n\n \n\n \n\n BILLING CODE 4510-FP-C\n\n     The Department disagrees with the comment that the proposed rule\n\n (or the Final Rule) should be considered a major rule requiring\n\n Congressional review under SBREFA. As detailed in the FRFA, the\n\n Department does not expect that the impact of the Final Rule will be\n\n over $100 million annually, which is the monetary benchmark of\n\n significance for a rule to be classified as major under SBREFA. The\n\n\n\n Department also does not believe that the Final Rule, which was\n\n significantly modified from the NPRM in response to the comments, will\n\n result in a ``major increase in costs or prices'' for industries,\n\n governments, or consumers, or that it will have a ``significant adverse\n\n effects'' on the economy, such as on competition, employment,\n\n productivity or the ability to compete.\n\n 4. Subject-by-Subject Analysis\n\n     The Department's analysis below considers the expected impacts of\n\n the following provisions of the Final Rule against the baseline (i.e.,\n\n the 2010 Final Rule; TEGL 32-10; and TEGL 15-06, Change 1): (a)\n\n Proportion/type of work permitted at the ranch (i.e., not on the\n\n range); (b) the new methodology for determining the minimum monthly\n\n AEWR to be paid to workers; (c) H-2A application filing requirements;\n\n (d) job order submissions; (e) job order duration; (f) newspaper\n\n advertisements; (g) placement of workers on master applications; (h)\n\n employer-provided items; (i) meals; (j) potable water; (k) expanded\n\n cooking/cleaning facilities; (l) heating equipment; (m) recordkeeping;\n\n and (n) time to read and review the rule.\n\n     For each of these provisions, the Department discusses the relevant\n\n costs, benefits, and transfers. In addition, we provide a qualitative\n\n assessment of transfer payments associated with the increased wages and\n\n protections of U.S. workers. Transfer payments, as defined by OMB\n\n Circular A-4, are payments from one group to another that do not affect\n\n total resources available to society. Transfer payments are associated\n\n\n\n with a distributional effect but do not result in additional costs or\n\n benefits to society.\n\n a. Proportion/Type of Work Permitted at the Ranch\n\n     The Final Rule codifies certain procedures for employers who apply\n\n to the Department to obtain temporary agricultural labor certifications\n\n to hire foreign workers to perform herding or the range production of\n\n livestock. The Final Rule also clarifies the proportion/type of work\n\n that is permitted to be performed by workers at the fixed-site ranch.\n\n Any job duties performed at a place other than the range (e.g., a fixed\n\n site farm or ranch) must be performed on no more than 50 percent of the\n\n workdays in a work contract period, and duties at the ranch must\n\n involve the production of livestock, which includes duties that are\n\n closely and directly related to herding and/or the production of\n\n livestock. The Final Rule thus clarifies and makes more specific the\n\n provision in current TEGL 32-10, which similarly provides that it\n\n applies in the unique situation of sheepherding, which requires\n\n ``spending extended periods of time with grazing herds of sheep in\n\n isolated mountainous terrain,'' and states that workers may perform\n\n ``other farm or ranch chores related to the production and husbandry of\n\n sheep and/or goats on an incidental basis.'' As in current TEGL 32-10,\n\n the Final Rule states that the work activities must also generally\n\n require the workers to be on call 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\n i. Costs\n\n\n\n     This change represents a cost to employers engaged in herding and\n\n range livestock production that have had or will have workers at the\n\n ranch for more than 50 percent of the contracted workdays or have had\n\n workers perform incidental duties at the ranch that are not closely and\n\n directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock. These\n\n employers will be excluded from applying for workers pursuant to the\n\n special procedures unless they commit to complying with the limitations\n\n for such workers in the future. The Department is not able to estimate\n\n this cost, however, because we do not know how many workers currently\n\n spend more than 50 percent of their days working at the farm or ranch,\n\n although we believe the number is very small given the commenters'\n\n descriptions of the typical herding cycles, which generally involve\n\n months spent on the range. Particularly given the Final Rule's revised\n\n definition of the term ``range,'' which no longer includes the word\n\n ``open'' and which deleted the NPRM's proposed limitation to areas that\n\n were not fenced, we anticipate employers will be able to satisfy the\n\n requirement that at least 50 percent of the job order period be spent\n\n on the range. Further, the Final Rule deletes the NPRM's proposed 20\n\n percent cap on the percentage of ranch days that a worker could spend\n\n performing closely and directly related work. Therefore, the Department\n\n anticipates that it is likely that affected employers will make any\n\n necessary adjustments to their practices so that the duties performed\n\n\n\n by herding and range livestock workers at the employer's fixed-site\n\n ranch will be closely and directly related to herding and/or the\n\n production of livestock.\n\n b. New Methodology for Determining the Wages of Workers\n\n     As discussed above, the Department received numerous comments\n\n related to the proposed methodology for determining worker wages. In\n\n particular, employers and their representatives commented on (1)\n\n perceived flaws with the Farm Labor Survey (FLS) data, (2) wages not\n\n accounting for herder benefits, (3) the effect the proposed wage\n\n increases would have on the profitability of operations, and (4) flaws\n\n in the reasoning behind the methodology. Worker advocates commented\n\n that the proposed wage methodology incorporated a weekly number of\n\n hours worked that was too low and that the transition period was\n\n inappropriate.\n\n i. Use of FLS Data\n\n     Several commenters stated that it was inappropriate for the\n\n Department to determine proposed wages based on semi-annual FLS data\n\n produced by USDA's National Agricultural Statistic Service (NASS). For\n\n the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department is not using FLS\n\n data in the Final Rule, but rather is relying on the current FLSA\n\n minimum wage of $7.25 as the starting point in the wage formula for\n\n 2016.\n\n ii. Employee Benefits\n\n     Numerous employer commenters, including Mountain Plains and Western\n\n\n\n Range and Calvin Roberts, an individual employer, stated that the\n\n Department's wage methodology was flawed because it did not account for\n\n the other ``benefits'' employees receive (e.g., food, rent, clothes,\n\n and transportation). Mountain Plains and Western Range remarked that\n\n most H-2A herders are able to send all of their salary to their home\n\n country. Some commenters provided estimates pertaining to the amount of\n\n the benefits provided. Calvin Roberts estimated that the cost of\n\n housing, food, and owning and operating a car could range between\n\n $1,200 and $1,500 per month in western Colorado. Mountain Plains and\n\n Western Range estimated that the proposed wage increases would yield\n\n ``actual wages'' over $2,000 per month using the methodology from the\n\n Colorado Wool Growers' 2010 report. Andre Talbott-Soares, an individual\n\n employer, stated that California's H-2A monthly wage of $1,600\n\n increases to at least $2,100 once the costs of necessities (e.g., food,\n\n housing, supplies, propane, travel, and I-94 visas) are included.\n\n Roswell Wool,\n\n \n\n [[Page 63023]]\n\n \n\n an individual employer, compared the net income of an H-2A worker\n\n making $800 in net pay per month to a U.S. worker making $16.50 per\n\n hour while working 40 hours per week. Once costs for rent, taxes, food,\n\n vehicle expenses, and clothing are taken into account, the commenter\n\n concluded that the H-2A worker would make more than such a U.S. worker\n\n\n\n in monthly net pay. Vermillion Ranch and Midland Livestock stated that\n\n meal credits should be included in the wage methodology in order to\n\n offset the substantial wage increase proposed by the Department.\n\n     The provision of these items does not suggest a different wage is\n\n appropriate. As discussed in the preamble, all H-2A employers are\n\n required to provide housing free of charge. Furthermore, all H-2A\n\n employers are required to provide the tools, supplies, and equipment\n\n necessary to perform the job free of charge as well as any job-related\n\n transportation. Moreover, sheep and goat herder employers are required\n\n under the existing TEGL to provide food free of charge, and livestock\n\n herder employers have been required to do so in recent years based on\n\n the SWA wage survey. Nonetheless, this economic impact analysis\n\n accounts for the cost associated with this requirement for livestock\n\n employers below in a separate section.\n\n iii. Reasoning Behind Wage Methodology--U.S. Workers\n\n     The Utah Farm Bureau Federation and John and Carolyn Espil stated\n\n that the reasoning behind the wage methodology was flawed because the\n\n Department's attempt to protect U.S. workers by increasing wages is\n\n inappropriate. The commenters remarked that U.S. workers do not want to\n\n work in this occupation and are not suited for it. Mountain Plains and\n\n Western Range expressed the view that low wages are not the prime\n\n deterrent for workers and stated that, in their experience, despite\n\n higher wages in California they receive fewer U.S. applicants in sheep\n\n herding occupations in that state than in other states.\n\n\n\n     As discussed above, the Department has decided to set the monthly\n\n AEWR for these occupations based on a calculation of $7.25 per hour\n\n multiplied by 48 hours per week and adjusted annually for inflation.\n\n Because this Final Rule does not use the FLS-based AEWR to set the wage\n\n rates, the Department disagrees that meal credits should be included in\n\n the new wage formula to offset the wage increase because permitting\n\n food deductions under the wage methodology adopted in this Final Rule\n\n would erode much of the wage increase; therefore, it would not be\n\n sufficient address wage stagnation in these occupations.\n\n     As discussed in the preamble, we have elected not to use the FLS-\n\n based AEWR to set the monthly AEWR for these occupations because use of\n\n this wage source is likely to cause, rather than prevent, adverse\n\n effect on U.S. workers. For the reasons discussed above, this decision\n\n is not based upon flaws with the FLS as a data source or on commenters'\n\n views of the effects of the state law wage rate in California. As\n\n explained in the preamble, commenters' observations about California\n\n are inconsistent with DOL's experience that California is consistently\n\n among the states with the largest number of U.S. sheepherders\n\n identified in SWA surveys.\n\n     The Department also received many comments in response to the NPRM\n\n stating that costs related to the proposed wage increases were\n\n underestimated in the economic analysis. Mountain Plans and Western\n\n Range Association commented that the proposed wage requirements should\n\n be classified as costs rather than transfers. They reasoned that since\n\n\n\n most of the money earned by H-2A workers is spent in countries like\n\n Peru or Mexico, the proposed requirement results in a net loss for the\n\n U.S. economy. The Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association and Vermillion\n\n Ranch and Midland Ranch stated that the Department underestimated the\n\n costs of the proposed wage increases, especially for operations with\n\n more than three H-2A workers. The commenters estimated their annual\n\n costs using an estimate of $13,860 per year for one worker based on the\n\n 5-year phase in. Vermillion Ranch, which has 18 workers, would expect\n\n to pay $249,480 in additional wages, while Midland Ranch, which has 13\n\n workers, would expect to pay $180,180.\n\n     In contrast to the employer comments, the Workers Advocates' Joint\n\n Comment stated that the phase-in methodology to the new wage is not\n\n justified. They noted that the current wage rates already reflect\n\n stagnated wages and asked DOL to consider this history of stagnation in\n\n requiring the full FLS-based AEWR to be paid immediately. In the Final\n\n Rule the Department does decrease the transition period to two years,\n\n and we also increase the number of hours per week on which the monthly\n\n AEWR is based.\n\n     In the NPRM's EO 12866 analysis assessing the total costs and\n\n transfers to society, the proposed wage increases were classified as a\n\n transfer. Transfer payments are defined as monetary payments from one\n\n group to another that do not affect total resources available to\n\n society. However, contrary to the commenters' statements, the proposed\n\n wage increases also were classified as additional costs to small H-2A\n\n\n\n employers in IRFA assessing the impact to H-2A employers (as they are\n\n in the analysis in the Final Rule). Wage increases are both transfer\n\n payments (to society) and costs (to employers); however, we recognize\n\n that foreign employees send at least some of their wages to their\n\n families abroad.\n\n     The Final Rule changes the methodology for determining the required\n\n monthly AEWR for workers engaged in the herding or production of\n\n livestock on the range. The Final Rule sets the monthly AEWR for these\n\n occupations by multiplying a $7.25 hourly wage rate by 48 hours per\n\n week, indexed annually beginning in the second year based on the ECI.\n\n The Final Rule uses a two-year transition period (at 80% and 90% of the\n\n full rate in 2016 and 2017, respectively) with full implementation in\n\n year three (2018).\\71\\ The Department analyzes the impact of this\n\n provision relative to the baseline--the 2015 herder monthly wage\n\n rates--which is the most recent AEWR data available and which reflects\n\n what employers currently are paying. To convert the monthly wage rate\n\n to an hourly wage rate, the Department divides the monthly wage rate by\n\n 48 hours and 4.333 weeks (which is derived from 52 weeks/12 months).\n\n Exhibit 3 presents the monthly baseline wages by state.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\71\\ As explained in the FRFA, the Department considered three\n\n other alternatives to set the monthly wage rate: Using (1) the 1994\n\n TEGL wage adjusted using the capped ECI approach and a three-year\n\n\n\n transition period with full implementation in year four; (2) $7.25\n\n multiplied by a 44-hour estimated calculation of weekly hours and\n\n adjusted using the ECI beginning with the wages for year five, using\n\n a three-year transition period with full implementation in year\n\n four; and (3) the FLS-based AEWR multiplied by a 65-hour estimate of\n\n weekly hours, implemented immediately and permitting a food\n\n deduction of the scope allowed under the regular H-2A program.\n\n \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n [[Page 63024]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.010\n\n \n\n      \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\72\\ California's state-required sheep herder wage will increase\n\n to $1777.98 on January 1, 2016, and employers in that state will be\n\n required to pay that increased wage on that date.\n\n     \\73\\ Hawaii's monthly wage of $1,422.52 is based on a 2012\n\n prevailing wage survey conducted by California.\n\n     \\74\\ This wage rate is annually adjusted by the CPI-U. The\n\n average percentage increase of the CPI-U in the past 3 years (2012-\n\n 2014) was 1.54 percent. With the 1.54 percent increase per year, the\n\n\n\n forecasted monthly wage in Oregon in 2016 is $1,628; $1,653 in 2017;\n\n $1,679 in 2018; $1,705 in 2019; $1,731 in 2020; and $1,758 in 2021;\n\n $1,785 in 2022 and $1,812 in 2023. The forecasted monthly wage with\n\n ECI-adjusted $7.25 hourly wage is $1,797 in 2025. Therefore, the\n\n monthly wage in Oregon is always expected to be higher than the\n\n forecasted monthly wage with ECI-adjusted $7.25 hourly wage over the\n\n 10-year period, and, thus, no wage impact is expected for Oregon.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Exhibit 4 presents the number and percentage of employers engaged\n\n in the herding or production of livestock on the range participating in\n\n the H-2A program and the state for which they applied for certified H-\n\n 2A workers. The number of employers is based on the H-2A certification\n\n dataset over FY 2013-2014. Note that each employer is counted once for\n\n each state for which the employer applied for workers, although due to\n\n the itinerant nature of the work, some employers applied for\n\n certification covering areas of employment for workers in multiple\n\n states. Hence, Exhibit 4 overstates the number of employers\n\n participating in the H-2A herder and range livestock program. As\n\n Exhibit 4 illustrates, sheepherders and goat herders are most heavily\n\n concentrated in Arizona, California, Utah, and Colorado, while range\n\n livestock (i.e., cattle) production workers are most heavily\n\n concentrated in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.\n\n \n\n\n\n [[Page 63025]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.011\n\n \n\n     To estimate the new monthly AEWR, the Department first calculates\n\n the average quarterly wages and salaries ECI for each year from 2012\n\n through 2014. We then take the average year-over-year growth rate and\n\n apply the resulting value (2.0 percent) to the initial $7.25 hourly\n\n base wage rate used in 2016 and do so each successive year to forecast\n\n the hourly base wage rates from 2017 to 2025. The new wage setting\n\n methodology will base the calculation on 48 hours per week and includes\n\n a two-year transition period. The Department estimates the hourly base\n\n wage rate for each year of the analysis period as follows:\n\n \n\n [[Page 63026]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.012\n\n \n\n     Exhibit 6 presents the forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 hourly wage\n\n rates with the two-year transition period and full implementation in\n\n 2018.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.013\n\n \n\n     To convert this to a monthly wage rate, the Department multiplies\n\n the above rates times the estimated 48 hours per week and by 4.333\n\n\n\n weeks per month. Exhibit 7 presents the monthly wage rates.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.014\n\n \n\n     Exhibits 8 and 9 present the wage differential between the monthly\n\n AEWR required under this Final Rule and the baseline by state for sheep\n\n and goat herders and range livestock production workers, respectively.\n\n In the case of California, the monthly AEWR wage is lower than the\n\n baseline wage for the first nine years, because state law requires a\n\n higher wage. In those years, the workers will continue to receive the\n\n baseline wage; therefore, no wage differential results. Similarly,\n\n Oregon's state required wage is higher than the rate required under the\n\n AEWR calculation of this Final Rule, and it is adjusted annually for\n\n inflation using the CPI-U. Accordingly, workers in that state will\n\n continue to be paid the state-required rate and employers in Oregon\n\n will not be impacted by the wage increase in this Final Rule. Hawaii's\n\n current monthly wage of $1,422.52 is based on a 2012 prevailing wage\n\n survey conducted by California, and the Final Rule's monthly AEWR is\n\n lower than Hawaii's current baseline wage in the first two years. The\n\n Department assumes that the workers in Hawaii will continue to receive\n\n the baseline wage in those years; therefore, no wage differential\n\n results. Additionally, the hourly wage differentials for states that\n\n did not have a baseline wage because there were no H-2A workers\n\n employed as herders or range livestock workers are denoted as ``N/A.''\n\n\n\n Note that these values are for informational purposes only and were not\n\n used in the analysis.\n\n BILLING CODE 4510-FP-P\n\n \n\n [[Page 63027]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.015\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63028]]\n\n \n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.016\n\n \n\n BILLING CODE 4510-FP-C\n\n     The Department multiplies the average increase in hourly wages per\n\n H-2A worker under this wage determination option in 2016 ($1.53) by the\n\n estimate of weekly hours (48) and the average duration of need (50\n\n weeks) to obtain the total increase per H-2A worker in 2016 ($3,672).\n\n We then multiply the total increase per worker by the number of H-2A\n\n certified workers (2,481) to obtain total transfer due to increased\n\n wages of $9.11 million in 2016.\\75\\ We repeat this calculation for each\n\n year of the analysis period, using the average increases in hourly\n\n\n\n wages.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63029]]\n\n \n\n This results in an average annual transfer payment of $17.46 million.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\75\\ This methodology may result in an overestimate. Using the\n\n number of H-2A workers certified may overestimate the number of\n\n affected workers because employers do not bring into the country all\n\n the workers for whom they are certified each year, and some workers\n\n are double counted because employers file multiple applications for\n\n certification to cover additional states and send the same workers\n\n to those states. In addition, some certifications are not for a full\n\n year, as some commenters indicate that they hire additional H-2A\n\n workers during peak seasons, such as the lambing season. Moreover,\n\n all workers do not stay for the entire period of the certification.\n\n Finally, as noted in the preamble, some employer commenters stated\n\n that they already pay more than the TEGL-required wages, that they\n\n pay bonuses, or that they provide paid vacation. Nevertheless, there\n\n likely are some corresponding workers who would also receive the\n\n increased wages. The number of annual H-2A workers needed by\n\n\n\n employers may also be higher in future years. Therefore, the\n\n Department concludes that using the total number of workers\n\n certified and a 50-week average duration provides a reasonable\n\n estimate of the impact based on the available data.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     The increase in the wage rates for some workers represents an\n\n important transfer from agricultural employers to corresponding U.S.\n\n workers, not just H-2A workers. As noted previously, the higher wages\n\n for workers associated with the Final Rule's methodology for\n\n determining the monthly AEWR will result in an improved ability on the\n\n part of workers and corresponding U.S. workers and their families to\n\n meet their costs of living and spend money in their local communities.\n\n On the other hand, higher wages represent an increase in costs of\n\n production from the perspective of employers that affects economic\n\n profit and creates a disincentive to hire H-2A and corresponding U.S.\n\n workers. The Department does not have sufficient information to measure\n\n the net effect of these countervailing impacts.\n\n     There also may be a transfer of costs from government entities to\n\n employers as a result of lower expenditures on unemployment insurance\n\n benefits claims. Unemployment insurance benefits replace a maximum of\n\n half of prior earnings in most states. However, to the extent that\n\n workers who had been laid off and were eligible for unemployment\n\n\n\n insurance benefits were not willing to accept a job at the current\n\n lower wage, and may now be willing to accept the job at the new higher\n\n wage, they would not need to seek new or continued unemployment\n\n insurance benefits. The Department, however, is not able to quantify\n\n these transfer payments.\n\n c. Filing Requirements\n\n     The Final Rule permits an association of agricultural employers\n\n filing as a joint employer to submit a single job order and master\n\n Application for Temporary Employment Certification on behalf of its\n\n employer-members located in more than two contiguous states with\n\n different start dates of need.\n\n     This provision does not represent a change for an association\n\n filing a master application as a joint employer with its employer-\n\n members for sheepherding or goat herding positions. However, to ensure\n\n consistency in the handling of all employers eligible to use these\n\n procedures, the Final Rule extends this existing practice to employers\n\n in the range herding or production of other livestock.\n\n i. Cost Reductions\n\n     This change represents a minor cost reduction to employers of H-2A\n\n workers in range livestock production occupations that file master\n\n applications as joint employers with their employer-members. Due to\n\n data limitations regarding the time savings realized by filing a master\n\n application relative to separate applications and the extent to which\n\n range livestock production employers would file master applications as\n\n\n\n joint employers with their employer-members, however, the Department is\n\n not able to quantify this impact.\n\n d. Job Order Submissions\n\n     The Final Rule extends the waiver of job order filing requirements\n\n in 20 CFR 655.121(a) through (d) to employers of H-2A workers in range\n\n livestock production occupations. A covered employer will submit its\n\n job order, Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order, Form ETA\n\n 790, directly to the National Processing Center (NPC), not to the State\n\n Workforce Agency (SWA). The employer will submit the job order to the\n\n NPC at the same time it submits its Application for Temporary\n\n Employment Certification, Form ETA 9142A, as outlined in 20 CFR\n\n 655.130.\n\n     This provision does not represent a change for an association\n\n filing a master application as joint employer with its employer-members\n\n for sheepherding or goat herding positions. However, to ensure\n\n consistency in the handling of all employers eligible to use these\n\n procedures, the Final Rule extends this existing practice to all\n\n employers involved in the range herding or production of other\n\n livestock.\n\n i. Cost Reductions\n\n     This change represents a minor cost reduction to employers of H-2A\n\n workers in range livestock production occupations who will no longer be\n\n required to prepare and send a separate ETA Form 790 submission to the\n\n SWA and then communicate directly with the SWA about any concerns the\n\n\n\n SWA raises with the ETA Form 790. Due to data limitations, however, the\n\n Department is not able to quantify the staff time and resource costs\n\n saved relative to the baseline in which submission of the form and\n\n communication with the SWA is required.\n\n e. Job Order Duration\n\n     The Final Rule requires that, where a single job order is approved\n\n for an association of agricultural employers filing as a joint employer\n\n on behalf of its employer-members with different start dates of need,\n\n each of the SWAs to which the job order was transmitted by the\n\n Contracting Officer (CO) or the SWA having jurisdiction over the\n\n location of the association must keep the job order on its active file\n\n until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed for all\n\n employer-members identified on the job order, and must refer each\n\n qualified U.S. worker who applies (or on whose behalf an application is\n\n made) for the job opportunity. The Final Rule also requires that the\n\n Department keep the job order posted on the OFLC electronic job\n\n registry for the same period.\n\n i. Cost Reductions\n\n     This change represents a possible cost reduction for an H-2A\n\n employer association that files a master application as a joint\n\n employer with its employer-members for workers in sheepherding and goat\n\n herding occupations. These employers were previously required to accept\n\n referrals throughout the work contract period. Under the Final Rule,\n\n these employers will only have to accept referrals for 50 percent of\n\n the work contract period, resulting in avoided costs of accepting\n\n\n\n referrals during the second half of the work contract period. Due to\n\n data limitations regarding the number of referrals during the second\n\n half of the work contract period, however, the Department is not able\n\n to quantify this impact.\n\n f. Newspaper Advertisements\n\n     The Final Rule continues for sheepherding and goat herding\n\n occupations and expands to other range livestock production occupations\n\n the TEGL practice of granting a waiver of the requirement to place an\n\n advertisement on two separate days in a newspaper of general\n\n circulation serving the area of intended employment. Because both\n\n herding and the range production of livestock cover multiple areas of\n\n intended employment in remote, inaccessible areas within one or more\n\n states, the newspaper advertisement is impractical and ineffective for\n\n recruiting domestic workers for these types of job opportunities.\n\n i. Cost Reductions\n\n     This change represents a cost reduction to employers of workers in\n\n range livestock production occupations. The Department estimates this\n\n cost reduction by multiplying the estimated number of applications\n\n filed by range livestock production employers each year (107, as\n\n determined from a review of 2013 and 2014 applications for labor\n\n certification in the herding program) by the average cost of placing a\n\n newspaper advertisement ($258.64) and the number\n\n \n\n [[Page 63030]]\n\n\n\n \n\n of advertisements per employer (2).\\76\\ We repeat this calculation for\n\n each remaining year of the analysis period. This results in an average\n\n annual cost reduction of $55,349.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\76\\ This newspaper advertisement cost estimate is based on an\n\n advertisement of 158 words placed in The Salt Lake Tribune for one\n\n day (Source: The Salt Lake Tribune. Available at            \nhttp://placead.yourutahclassifieds.com/webbase/en/std/jsp/WebBaseMain.do.\n\n Accessed Nov. 13, 2014).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Because these activities require time on the part of a human\n\n resources manager on the ranch, we add to the result the incremental\n\n cost of preparing the advertisement, which we calculate by multiplying\n\n the estimated number of applications filed by range livestock\n\n production employers each year (107) by the time required to prepare a\n\n newspaper advertisement (0.5 hours), the hourly labor compensation rate\n\n of a human resources manager at an agricultural business ($78.48), and\n\n the number of advertisements per employer (2).\\77\\ This amounts to an\n\n average annual cost reduction of $8,397.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\77\\ The Department estimates that this work would be performed\n\nhttp://placead.yourutahclassifieds.com/webbase/en/std/jsp/WebBaseMain.do\n\n\n by a human resources manager at an agricultural employer at an\n\n hourly rate of $54.88 (as published by the Department's OES Survey,\n\n O*Net Online), which we multiply by 1.43 to account for employee\n\n benefits to obtain a total hourly labor cost of $78.48.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In total, the cost reduction from not having to place the\n\n advertisement and saved labor yield an average annual cost reduction of\n\n $0.06 million.\n\n     The Department received one comment pertaining to the cost\n\n reductions by waiving newspaper advertisements for workers in range\n\n livestock production occupations. The Department estimated a labor cost\n\n of a human resources (HR) manager to prepare the advertisement. Patrick\n\n O'Toole, a private citizen, stated that family members typically serve\n\n as the HR managers; hence, they do not receive benefits along with\n\n their wages, and they do not spend all of their time acting as the HR\n\n manager.\n\n     Even if family members serve as the HR managers and are not\n\n explicitly compensated for their time and work, it is still considered\n\n a cost reduction under the opportunity-cost approach used in the\n\n economic analysis for costing purposes. This is similar to the\n\n expenditure for family labor in the enterprise budget when family\n\n members are not actually paid for their labor. Thus, the Department\n\n believes that the inclusion of the labor cost of an HR manager is still\n\n\n\n reasonable.\n\n g. Placement of Workers on Master Applications\n\n     The Final Rule requires that eligible U.S. workers who apply for\n\n the job opportunities and are hired be placed at the locations nearest\n\n to them, absent a request for a different location by the U.S. workers.\n\n The Final Rule also requires that associations that fulfill the\n\n recruitment requirements for their members maintain a written\n\n recruitment report for each individual employer-member identified in\n\n the application or job order, including any approved modifications.\n\n i. Cost Reductions and Costs\n\n     The U.S. worker placement requirement represents a minor cost\n\n reduction. Because U.S. workers will be placed at locations nearest to\n\n them, the Final Rule will yield a decrease in travel costs to arrive at\n\n and return from the work site. Due to data limitations regarding travel\n\n costs to arrive at and return from the work site for participating U.S.\n\n workers, however, the Department is not able to quantify this impact\n\n with any certainty.\n\n     The recruitment report requirement represents a cost to an\n\n association of employers of workers in range livestock occupations.\n\n Associations will be required to maintain a written recruitment report\n\n for each individual employer-member; however, associations are\n\n currently required to document all applications and their disposition,\n\n\n\n making this a change in the form of the recordkeeping rather than its\n\n substance. This will likely lead to a marginal increase in costs for\n\n the association to prepare and maintain a more disaggregated\n\n recruitment report for each employer-member named on a master\n\n application. The Department is not able to quantify this impact with\n\n any certainty, however, due to data limitations regarding the time\n\n required for associations to prepared and maintain a more disaggregated\n\n recruitment report.\n\n h. Employer-Provided Items\n\n     In the NPRM, the Department proposed to require that the job offer\n\n specify that the employer will provide, without charge or deposit\n\n charge, those tools, supplies, and equipment required by law, by the\n\n employer, or by the nature of the work to do the job safely and\n\n effectively. Because of the isolated nature of these occupations, an\n\n effective means of communication between worker and employer--to enable\n\n the employer to check the worker's status and the worker to communicate\n\n an emergency to persons capable of responding--is required because it\n\n is necessary to perform the job safely and effectively. The workers'\n\n location may be so remote that electronic communication devices may not\n\n work at all times. Therefore, the NPRM proposed to continue the TEGLs'\n\n current requirement for the employer to provide an effective means of\n\n communicating in an emergency. The Final Rule similarly provides that\n\n where the employer will not otherwise make regular contact with the\n\n worker (e.g., when delivering food or checking on the worker and herd\n\n\n\n in-person), the employer must make arrangements so that the workers\n\n will be geographically located in a place where the electronic\n\n communication device will function on a regular basis (e.g., mobile\n\n phone in an area with adequate reception) so that the workers' safety\n\n and needs can be monitored. The employer must include in the job order\n\n a simple statement identifying the type of electronic communication\n\n device that it will provide and the frequency with which it will make\n\n contact with the workers when the devices may not operate effectively.\n\n     The Department received several comments on the cost of employer-\n\n provided items--including the cost of maintaining regular contact.\n\n Sharon O'Toole, an individual employer, stated that it is not necessary\n\n to quantify the cost of regular contact between employers and herders,\n\n as it has been a common practice for decades to ensure the conditions\n\n of herders, sheep, horses, and dogs, which is in an employer's business\n\n interest. Contact usually occurs when someone delivers items such as\n\n food and water. In contrast, the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation stated\n\n that it is not possible to get a cellular signal in some areas. The\n\n commenter noted that a satellite phone plan that allows 10 minutes of\n\n usage per month costs at least $300 per year, not including the price\n\n of the phone, and that plans can cost as much as $2,000 per year.\n\n     The Department understands that there is a range of different ways\n\n to establish effective communication between employers and their\n\n workers to address the workers' basic needs and to enable contact in an\n\n\n\n emergency. Employers are not required to provide satellite phones, as\n\n they do not always provide reliable service, when other effective means\n\n of communication are available. The Department expects that very few\n\n employers will have to purchase satellite phone to communicate with\n\n their workers.\n\n     The Department also received several comments pertaining to the\n\n quantification and data sources for other items they stated should be\n\n monetized in the economic analysis. For example, Governor Matthew H.\n\n Mead of the State of Wyoming remarked that the\n\n \n\n [[Page 63031]]\n\n \n\n economic analysis did not reflect an analysis of the complete\n\n compensation structure. Several commenters similarly commented on the\n\n cost of providing items to H-2A workers that, in the commenters' view,\n\n supplement the workers' wages. For example, FIM Corp. stated that the\n\n cost of ``benefits'' (listing for example housing, utilities, food,\n\n satellite TV, cell phone service, laundry, workers' compensation\n\n insurance, supplies, travel to and from the home country,\n\n administrative costs for Western Range Service, and banking services)\n\n for each sheepherder is at least $1,220 per month beyond the wages\n\n paid, bringing the total compensation to over $2,000 per month. Donald\n\n Watson expressed that the cost of workers' compensation insurance,\n\n\n\n housing, provisions, and incidental herding costs nearly double the\n\n annual cost per herder from $10,000 to $20,000. Raymond Talbott, an\n\n individual employer, stated that although H-2A wage is $1,600 per month\n\n in California, when the cost of items such as commissary, housing,\n\n supplies, propane, travel, and I-94 visas are included, the wage\n\n increases to at least $2,100.\n\n     Many of these costs, such as the cost of housing and related\n\n provisions (utilities/propane), are required by the H-2A program\n\n generally; thus those costs are not new or unique under this Final\n\n Rule. Other employer business expenses, such as a worker's travel to\n\n and from the home country, visa fees, or employer association fees,\n\n also are the responsibility of the employer under the standard H-2A\n\n regulations. Anything that is newly required by this Final Rule, such\n\n as free meals for range livestock workers, is acknowledged and\n\n discussed separately.\n\n     Finally, many commenters, including Mountain Plains and Western\n\n Range, the Washington State Sheep Producers, and John and Carolyn\n\n Espil, stated that the Department should monetize the impact caused by\n\n the change in the definition of ``open range,'' which they asserted\n\n would exclude approximately 40 percent of employers that currently use\n\n the H-2A program. As explained in detail in the preamble, commenters\n\n explained that livestock grazing varies substantially, depending on the\n\n particular ranch owner and/or the geographic location, and they\n\n emphasized that modern grazing contains fencing. Commenters almost\n\n unanimously opposed using fencing as a defining factor for ``open\n\n\n\n range.'' In response to the comments related to definition of ``open\n\n range,'' the Department decided to use a modified version of the FLSA\n\n definition of ``range'' to provide flexibility and account for the\n\n changes in herding practices over time. The Department believes this\n\n revised definition of ``range'' will not impose any additional costs on\n\n employers, as most comments indicate that employers assign their H-2A\n\n workers to the range for at least the majority of the year.\n\n     In the final rule, employers are also required to provide:\n\n      Containers appropriate for storing and using potable water\n\n and, in locations subject to freezing temperatures, containers must be\n\n small enough to allow storage in the housing unit to prevent freezing;\n\n      facilities, including shovels, for effective disposal of\n\n excreta and liquid waste in accordance with the requirements of the\n\n state health authority or involved Federal agency; and\n\n      appropriate materials, including sprays, and sealed\n\n containers for food storage, to aid housing occupants in combating\n\n insects, rodents and other vermin.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     The requirement that employers arrange for the workers to be\n\n located in a place where the electronic communication device will\n\n operate effectively on a regular basis when they are stationed in areas\n\n where the devices may not work, or to provide regular in-person\n\n contact, represents a possible minor cost to herding or range livestock\n\n production employers. This may impose restrictions on land use or\n\n\n\n require the purchase of particular types of communication devices. The\n\n Department cannot, however, predict this impact or quantify it as a\n\n cost to employers, but we anticipate that it will be minimal as the\n\n current TEGLs contain a similar communication requirement and many\n\n employer commenters stated that they are in routine contact with their\n\n workers to monitor their health and well-being and that of the herd.\n\n     The Department believes that most existing employers already\n\n provide to H-2A workers on the range containers for storing and using\n\n potable water, shovels for effective disposal of excreta and liquid\n\n waste, and insect and rodent control materials such as sprays and\n\n sealed containers for food storage in order to satisfy their current\n\n requirements under the TEGLs. Even for the small fraction of employers\n\n who currently do not provide any such items to H-2A workers on the\n\n range, the additional costs would be trivial, at most $50 in 2016.\n\n i. Meals\n\n     All H-2A employers must provide either three meals a day or free\n\n and convenient kitchen facilities. Currently, as required under the\n\n sheepherding and goat herding TEGL and pursuant to practice in the\n\n industry for range production of livestock occupations, employers with\n\n these range herding occupations must provide food, free of charge, to\n\n their workers. The Final Rule adopts this common practice as a\n\n requirement for employers engaged in the range production of livestock\n\n (who now must provide free food pursuant to the prevailing industry\n\n practice) and continues it for employers engaged in sheep or goat\n\n\n\n herding. The Final Rule also requires employers to disclose it in the\n\n job offer. The Final Rule clarifies that the food must be\n\n ``sufficient'' and ``adequate'' and that it must include a daily source\n\n of protein, vitamins and minerals. The employer commenters agreed that\n\n the physical demands of the job require a protein-rich diet, and that\n\n the workers need and deserve good, nourishing food; they stated that\n\n they currently provide such food to their workers, typically in\n\n response to the workers' expressed preferences for particular food.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     Because this is a current requirement of the sheepherding and goat\n\n herding TEGL, this provision does not represent a cost to sheepherding\n\n and goat herding employers (the Department concludes that the\n\n clarifications requiring that the food be sufficient and adequate, and\n\n include a daily source of protein, vitamins and minerals, impose no\n\n additional quantifiable cost, particularly given the employers'\n\n assertions that they are providing such food now). This provision does,\n\n however, represent a cost to other range livestock production\n\n employers.\\78\\ The Department estimates this cost by multiplying the\n\n number of days workers receive meals on a weekly basis (7), the average\n\n cost of three meals per day ($11.86), and the average duration of need\n\n (50 weeks) to obtain the total cost of meals per worker ($4,151).\\79\\\n\n We then multiply the total cost of meals per worker by the estimated\n\n\n\n number of range livestock\n\n \n\n [[Page 63032]]\n\n \n\n production employers in 2016 (102) and the average number of H-2A\n\n workers per employer needing meals on a weekly basis (4.2) to obtain an\n\n average annual cost of $ 1.78 million.\\80\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\78\\ Since 2013 livestock employers have been required to\n\n provide food free of charge because payment of food is included in\n\n the wage rate identified in the SWA surveys. Therefore, the cost\n\n estimate for this provision is an overestimate.\n\n     \\79\\ The daily meal cost estimate of $11.86 is from Allowable\n\n Meal Charges and Reimbursements for Daily Subsistence published by\n\n the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment & Training Administration\n\n (Source:            http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm. Accessed July 30, 2015).\n\n     \\80\\ The FY 2013 and FY 2014 certification data show an annual\n\n average of 954 applications certified for an average of 2,482\n\n workers in the herding and range production of livestock program, or\n\n 2.6 workers per application. The Department concluded that this\n\n could be an underestimate because some employers file multiple\n\n applications per year. Therefore, we also attempted to identify the\n\n number of unique employers filing applications. We estimate that an\n\nhttp://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm\n\n\n annual average of 485 unique employers filed applications, which\n\n would indicate more than five workers per employer. However, the\n\n Department concluded that this could be an overestimate because\n\n employers do not bring into the country all the workers for which\n\n they are certified each year. Furthermore, some employers file\n\n multiple applications because their itinerary changes and they need\n\n to reapply to receive authorization to send workers to another\n\n state, even though they will be the same workers. Therefore, we\n\n assumed an average of 4.2 workers per employer, which is consistent\n\n with the estimate from the Mountain Plains 2015 telephone survey of\n\n its members discussed by the SBA Office of Advocacy.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In addition to the cost incurred to purchase food, these range\n\n livestock production employers would incur costs to transport the food\n\n to the workers. The Department assumes that food would be transported\n\n to the workers on a weekly basis along with the potable water. The\n\n costs related to transporting food and potable water are accounted for\n\n below in the section on costs related to potable water.\n\n     The Department received only a handful of comments directly\n\n pertaining to the economic analysis of providing meals without charge\n\n to workers. However, as discussed in the preamble, some commenters\n\n\n\n opposed the proposed provision to provide daily meals to workers for\n\n free and wanted to be permitted to take a wage credit for the cost of\n\n meals, while others thought that providing free food was appropriate.\n\n For example, Sharon O'Toole stated that if an employer is not already\n\n providing adequate food to employees, then they are in violation of\n\n other laws and should not be covered by this rule. She also commented\n\n that providing access to expanded cooking facilities is unnecessary\n\n because the workers are already provided with hot meals at the ranch.\n\n     Vermillion Ranch and Midland Ranch stated that the cost of\n\n providing meals increases operating costs substantially when the number\n\n of workers hired increases. They said that for Vermillion Ranch, the\n\n cost of the meal provision requirement would be $72,954 for 18 workers\n\n as opposed to the $12,159 estimated by the Department. The Siddoway\n\n Sheep Company stated that during the winter lambing season it employs a\n\n cook who prepares the workers three meals each day, and that when\n\n workers are on the range, it purchases food every eight to 10 days. The\n\n commenter expressed that actual food expenditures, including meat grown\n\n on the ranch, average $476 per worker per month. Siddoway provided\n\n three alternatives that it supported: (1) Allowing employers to deduct\n\n the cost of purchasing the food products on the employee's grocery\n\n list; (2) a ranch-specific deduction based on annualized expenditures\n\n over a three-year period; and (3) an industry-wide deduction equal to\n\n\n\n 128 percent of the liberal USDA Food Plan Cost, which is what it\n\n estimated it spends on meals. ASI and Public Lands Council, and\n\n Mountain Plains and Western Range, also pointed to the USDA liberal\n\n meal plan and stated that such a meal plan is more expensive than the\n\n subsistence meal charges that the Department uses for workers. For the\n\n reasons discussed in the preamble, including the current free food\n\n requirements and that the Final Rule uses the FLSA minimum wage rate of\n\n $7.25 as the starting point for the wage requirement, we did not permit\n\n employers to offset the cost of meals to avoid continued wage\n\n stagnation; rather, we have identified it as a cost for range livestock\n\n production employers.\n\n j. Potable Water\n\n     The Department received several comments related to the costs of\n\n transporting meals and potable water to workers. As summarized below,\n\n the commenters (1) stated that the economic analysis did not fully\n\n capture the cost, (2) described the amount of water provided and the\n\n types of containers typically used at their locations, (3) listed\n\n alternative sources of water not specified by the Department, and (4)\n\n were generally opposed to employers being required to provide water for\n\n laundry.\n\n     Several commenters remarked that the Department's economic analysis\n\n underestimated the cost to transport meals and potable water; several\n\n commenters also provided cost estimates. Eph Jensen Livestock, LLC and\n\n Mountain Plains and Western Range stated that the Department did not\n\n account for the actual distances traveled between the ranch and camp or\n\n\n\n how the time needed to travel can vary depending on the type of\n\n terrain. Eph Jensen Livestock, LLC, stated that the Department did not\n\n account for areas in which vehicle travel is prohibited or impossible.\n\n The Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation also commented on the difficulties\n\n associated with using a trailer for water. The trailers must often be\n\n driven on roads that are two tracks or not maintained. These conditions\n\n make it difficult to drive in reverse and drivers occasionally get\n\n stuck. In addition, workers' mobile housing units already have a\n\n trailer attached. Attaching another trailer would make traveling\n\n unsafe, increase traveling time, and result in additional costs. The\n\n commenter also noted that some states prohibit the use of triple\n\n trailers.\n\n     Mountain Plains and Western Range and Sharon O-Toole stated that\n\n the estimated costs for providing meals and water did not include the\n\n cost of purchasing additional trucks or water trailers. Several\n\n commenters stated that in addition to the costs for the truck and\n\n trailer, the Department should include the cost to hire a driver with a\n\n commercial driver's license. They noted that it recently cost them\n\n $45,000 for a cab with 500,000 miles and $8,000 for a used trailer.\n\n Sims Sheep Co. LLC stated that trailers and tanks would be more\n\n expensive than estimated because they would need to be tailor-made to\n\n withstand the weight of the water and poor road/terrain conditions.\n\n Paul Nelson stated that it costs $15 for gas each trip, $30 per worker\n\n to transport water and other necessities. Cindy Siddoway stated that\n\n\n\n transportation to mountain camps would require them to purchase eight\n\n pack horses, which would cost $9,600 in addition to food and pack\n\n saddles. Vermillion Ranch and Midland Ranch stated that the costs of\n\n providing sufficient potable water for drinking, cleaning, and laundry\n\n using the Department's estimate of $4,910.96 per worker would be\n\n $88,397.28 per year and $63,842.28 per year for Vermillion Ranch and\n\n Midland Ranch, respectively, given their large number of employees.\n\n     Paul Nelson and Cindy Siddoway stated they provide water in five-\n\n gallon containers. Donald Watson stated that he provides water in\n\n either five-gallon containers, 50-gallon barrels, 400-gallons tanks, or\n\n from containers filled by hose, depending on the location. A handful of\n\n individual employers warned that large water tanks could restrict\n\n workers' access to water during winter months if the water freezes, and\n\n that a preferable alternative would be smaller potable water containers\n\n that could fit inside the workers' housing units and would thus not be\n\n subject to freezing.\n\n     Several commenters listed alternative sources of water. The Wyoming\n\n Farm Bureau Federation and Sharon O'Toole listed melted snow as an\n\n alternative water source, and Cindy Siddoway listed mountain springs\n\n and streams as alternative sources. Commenters stated that workers have\n\n tools to boil water to\n\n \n\n [[Page 63033]]\n\n\n\n \n\n make it potable, and some commented that their workers have not gotten\n\n sick drinking from these alternative sources and that workers rarely\n\n use purification methods such as water filters or purification tablets\n\n that have been made available by the employer.\n\n     The Department understands that these alternative sources of water\n\n would be almost costless relative to the estimated costs of potable\n\n water in the economic analysis. However, such alternative sources are\n\n not always available, and for health reasons the Department must\n\n require that workers have available potable water (or in exigent\n\n circumstances the means to make water potable) for consumption,\n\n cooking, and dishwashing.\n\n     Several commenters opposed the proposed requirement for employers\n\n to provide enough water for laundry, stating either that non-potable\n\n water sources are often available that are adequate for washing laundry\n\n or, more often, that they wash laundry for the workers and deliver it\n\n when they bring food to the workers. They stated that this is more\n\n cost-effective than transporting water for workers to wash laundry\n\n themselves.\n\n     A few commenters stated how much water was typically needed in\n\n their operations. Sharon O'Toole stated that 40 gallons of potable\n\n water per week is enough for a worker to drink and wash. Eph Jensen\n\n Livestock, LLC commented that the amount of water needed varies\n\n\n\n depending on climate.\n\n     The Workers Advocates' Joint Comment outlined several suggestions\n\n regarding what constitutes an adequate supply of potable water. They\n\n stated that the supply of water should be defined as 4 to 4.5 gallons\n\n of potable water per day in clean and sealed containers, which amounts\n\n to 28 to 31.5 gallons per week. They also noted that the water supply\n\n should include an additional 50 gallons per week for cleaning, bathing,\n\n and laundry, which is based on comments from range workers. The\n\n commenters stated that range workers should be supplied with a means\n\n for water purification only in exigent circumstances (e.g., forest\n\n fires), and that the Department should clarify that the supply of water\n\n is ``for workers only'' and not for the sheep dogs or horses. In the\n\n NPRM the Department assumed that each worker required 28 gallons of\n\n potable water per week. Several commenters stated that this was not a\n\n sufficient amount and suggested the Department use an estimate based on\n\n 4 to 4.5 gallons of potable water per day in clean and sealed\n\n containers.\n\n     For the reasons discussed in the preamble, in the Final Rule the\n\n Department requires employers to provide at least 4.5 gallons of\n\n potable water per day, which amounts to at least 31.5 gallons of\n\n potable water per worker per week (4.5 x 7). The Department does not\n\n specifically define the minimum quantity of water that must be provided\n\n for bathing and laundry. The Final Rule also allows the use of\n\n\n\n alternate sources of water for bathing and laundry where such sources\n\n are readily available. Moreover, we note that if employers provide\n\n laundry services for workers that likely will substantially minimize\n\n their need for water for that purpose. Finally, the Final Rule allows\n\n the employer to request a variance from the requirement to provide 4.5\n\n gallons of potable water when workers are located in areas that are not\n\n accessible by motorized vehicle; the employer must identify an\n\n alternative water supply and disseminate both the means and methods for\n\n testing and making potable the water obtained for drinking and cooking\n\n from such alternative supplies.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     In the NPRM's EO 12866 analysis, the Department estimated that\n\n range sheep, goat, and other livestock production employers already\n\n must incur the cost under the TEGLs of transporting both food and water\n\n for cooking, consumption and bathing to their workers on the range,\n\n which must meet state health authority standards. The NPRM proposed to\n\n add a requirement for additional water for cleaning and laundry. The\n\n Department assumed that the additional water would be transported to\n\n the workers on a weekly basis along with the previously required food\n\n and potable water. The cost of providing a water supply to workers was\n\n estimated as the sum of the cost of the water itself, the cost of\n\n purchasing utility trailers to transport the additional water and\n\n meals, the cost of mileage for those vehicles, and the wages for the\n\n\n\n drivers to transport the additional water and meals. The Department\n\n noted that because employers are currently required to provide food and\n\n water to workers, our cost estimate in the analysis likely was an\n\n overestimate.\n\n     The Final Rule continues the same general approach, with the\n\n modifications discussed above. The Department concludes, given the\n\n changes made in the Final Rule, particularly the employers' ability to\n\n identify alternative sources of water for bathing and laundry, that the\n\n NPRM's general approach remains valid. In addition, because the Final\n\n Rule requires only that workers spend the majority of their time on the\n\n range, we continue to believe that the estimate likely produces an\n\n overestimate because the analysis assumes that the water and food is\n\n transported 50 weeks of the year.\n\n     The Department estimates the cost of purchasing the water by\n\n multiplying the estimated number of employers in each year (485) by the\n\n average number of H-2A workers per employer needing potable water on a\n\n weekly basis (4.2), the number of gallons of potable water needed per\n\n worker on a weekly basis (31.5), the average cost of a gallon of\n\n potable water ($0.005), and the average duration of need (50\n\n weeks).\\81\\ This results in an average annual cost of $16,041.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\81\\ This potable water cost estimate is from the 2014 Water and\n\n Wastewater Survey produced by the Texas Municipal League (Source:\n\n\n\n            http://www.tml.org/surveys. Accessed Nov. 13, 2014). It is estimated\n\n based on the average cost of potable water for commercial entities\n\n in Texas cities with a population below 2,000 and based on the fee\n\n for 50,000 gallons.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Because the employers must have the means to transport the potable\n\n water and food to the workers, the Department estimates the cost of\n\n purchasing utility trailers. We assume that 10 percent of agricultural\n\n employers do not currently have a trailer sufficient to transport the\n\n additional water and food to workers. In the first year of the rule, we\n\n include the cost incurred by existing and new H-2A employers to\n\n purchase trailers; in future years, we include the cost incurred only\n\n by new participants. To calculate the cost for the first year of the\n\n Final Rule, we multiply the total number of participants in the program\n\n (485) by the assumed percentage of employers that would need to\n\n purchase a trailer (10 percent). We then multiply the number of\n\n employers needing to purchase a trailer (49) by the average cost of a\n\n trailer ($839.34) to estimate the total cost of purchasing utility\n\n trailer each year ($40,708).\\82\\ To calculate the cost for each of the\n\n remaining years, we estimate the average number of employers joining\n\n the program that would need to purchase a trailer each year, which we\n\n calculate by multiplying the number of participants joining the H-2A\n\n program (49) by the assumed percentage of employers that would need to\n\nhttp://www.tml.org/surveys\n\n\n purchase a trailer (10%).\\83\\ We\n\n \n\n [[Page 63034]]\n\n \n\n then multiply the number of employers joining the H-2A program needing\n\n to purchase a trailer (5) by the average cost of a trailer ($839.34) to\n\n estimate the total cost of purchasing utility trailers in each\n\n remaining year ($4,071).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\82\\ This trailer cost estimate is based on the average costs\n\n for a 5 x 8 ft. utility trailer from Tractor Supply Co. (Source:\n\n            http://www.tractorsupply.com/en/store/search/utility-trailers.\n\n Accessed Nov. 13, 2014), Lowes, and Home Depot. Given the changes in\n\n the Final Rule, particularly the employers' ability to identify\n\n alternative sources of water for bathing and laundry, we conclude it\n\n is not necessary to assume a cost for a water truck as a few\n\n commenters suggested.\n\n     \\83\\ Based upon H-2A program data, the Department assumes that,\n\n due to turnover, 10% of the average number of employers that\n\n participate in the H-2A program each year (485) join the H-2A\n\n program each year, which results in 49 new employers per year.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nhttp://www.tractorsupply.com/en/store/search/utility-trailers\n\n\n     The Department also estimates the cost of mileage on the employers'\n\n vehicles. The mileage reimbursement rate is intended to cover the costs\n\n of operating a vehicle for business purposes. The costs encompassed by\n\n the standard mileage rate are standard maintenance, repairs, taxes,\n\n gas, insurance, and registration fees. Essentially, the standard\n\n mileage rate is intended to cover the expenses that an individual would\n\n report if using the actual car expenses deduction. While the standard\n\n mileage reimbursement rate is simply an estimate and may end up being\n\n more or less than actual car expenses, it reflects the full cost of\n\n operating a truck for transporting the water and meals. However, the\n\n Department assumed that employers already would have a truck for\n\n delivering food and water as it is currently required by TEGL and\n\n therefore, did not include the cost of purchasing a new truck in this\n\n analysis. We estimate this cost by multiplying the estimated number of\n\n employers in each year (485) by the average cost per mile of owning and\n\n operating an automobile ($0.58), the number of miles driven (roundtrip)\n\n to deliver the water and meals (100), and the number of roundtrips\n\n expected per year (50).\\84\\ This calculation results in an average\n\n annual cost of $1.4 million.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\84\\ This cost per mile of owning and operating an automobile is\n\n based on the average costs in the DOT Bureau of Transportation\n\n\n\n Statistics. (source:            \nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17\n.html Accessed\n\n July 30, 2015), which cites the costs presented by American\n\n Automobile Association Exchange (Source:            http://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-\ntravel/automobiles/driving-costs/ Accessed July 30,\n\n 2015). The Department assumes the workers are all located within the\n\n 100-mile roundtrip distance so only one roundtrip per employer per\n\n week would be needed to transport water and meals to workers.\n\n Although the Department received a handful of general comments\n\n stating that we had underestimated the distances involved and the\n\n time required, they did not provide data or alternative estimates of\n\n their actual distances or time spent. Therefore, the Department has\n\n not modified its assumptions.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Because these activities require time on the part of an\n\n agricultural worker on the ranch, the Department estimates the cost of\n\n transporting the potable water and food to the workers, which we\n\n calculate by multiplying the estimated number of employers in each year\n\n (485) by the assumed time required to transport the potable water and\n\n food (2.86 hours), the hourly labor compensation rate of an\n\n agricultural worker ($13.40), and the number of roundtrips per year\n\n (50).\\85\\ This calculation results in an average annual cost of $0.9\n\n million. As mentioned above, this may be an overestimate as the Final\n\nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17.html\nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17.html\nhttp://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-travel/automobiles/driving-costs/\nhttp://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-travel/automobiles/driving-costs/\n\n\n Rule only requires that workers be on the range for the majority of\n\n workdays in the job order period.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\85\\ The Department assumes that the water delivery will be\n\n performed by an agricultural worker at an hourly rate of $9.37 (as\n\n published by the Department's OES Survey, O*Net Online), which we\n\n multiply by 1.43 to account for employee benefits to obtain a total\n\n hourly labor cost of $13.40. The time required to transport the\n\n potable water and meals roundtrip was estimated using the\n\n assumptions that a roundtrip is 100 miles and that the agricultural\n\n worker would drive at 35 mph. The Department assumes the workers are\n\n all located within the 100-mile roundtrip distance, so only one\n\n roundtrip per employer per week would be needed to transport water\n\n and meals to workers.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     This calculation yields an average annual cost of $2.4 million for\n\n the cost of the water, utility trailers, vehicle mileage, and labor to\n\n deliver the additional water and food.\n\n k. Expanded Cooking/Cleaning Facilities\n\n     The Department recognizes that there are times when workers are\n\n located at or near the ranch or farm (or a similar central location)\n\n\n\n for certain operations that are a normal part of the herding cycle,\n\n such as birthing (in some cases), shearing, or branding. In such\n\n instances, the Final Rule allows workers to continue to use their\n\n mobile housing, which may be preferred by workers, even where access to\n\n fixed housing exists. However, the Final Rule requires (as the NPRM\n\n proposed) in such a situation that workers be granted access to\n\n facilities, including toilets and showers with hot and cold water under\n\n pressure, as well as cooking and cleaning facilities that satisfy the\n\n standard housing requirements if the employer does not provide meals.\n\n     The Department received a couple of comments in response to the\n\n NPRM pertaining to the cost to provide expanded cooking facilities at a\n\n ranch or farm. Sharon O'Toole commented that providing access to\n\n expanded cooking facilities is unnecessary because the workers are\n\n already provided with hot meals at the ranch. Vermillion Ranch and\n\n Midland Ranch objected to the term ``ranch'' in conjunction with the\n\n proposed locations of the expanded cooking facilities.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     As the Department stated in its NPRM economic analysis, we do not\n\n expect any additional costs for construction or expansion of cooking\n\n facilities because existing farm kitchens will be able to increase\n\n production to a sufficient extent to provide for the additional\n\n workers. As several commenters stated, some employers already provide\n\n hot meals to H-2A workers at the ranch. Alternatively, employers need\n\n\n\n not incur any additional cost to construct or expand cooking facilities\n\n as they could simply provide the workers with access to the existing\n\n farm kitchen to prepare their own meals.\n\n     The requirement to provide access to facilities such as toilets and\n\n showers with hot and cold water under pressure, however, will likely\n\n impose a cost on herding and range livestock production employers that\n\n do not have such facilities for worker use. To estimate the cost of\n\n constructing or expanding the cleaning facilities for the first year of\n\n the Final Rule, the Department estimates the number of existing H-2A\n\n participants that would need to construct/expand cleaning facilities,\n\n which we calculate by multiplying the number of existing H-2A\n\n participants (485) by the assumed percentage of employers that would\n\n need to construct or expand their facilities (20%). We then multiply\n\n the number of existing employers that would need to construct/expand\n\n facilities (97) by the average cost per square foot to construct or\n\n expand cleaning facilities ($270.00) and the assumed size of the\n\n cleaning facility (150 sq. ft.).\\86\\ This calculation results in a cost\n\n of $3.93 million in 2016.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\86\\ This cost per square foot estimate is based on the average\n\n cost to add a bathroom to a building from The Nest (Source:            http://budgeting.thenest.com/average-cost-per-\nsquare-foot-add-addition-house-23356.html. Accessed Nov. 13, 2014).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://budgeting.thenest.com/average-cost-per-square-foot-add-addition-house-23356.html\nhttp://budgeting.thenest.com/average-cost-per-square-foot-add-addition-house-23356.html\n\n\n \n\n     To calculate the cost for each of the remaining years of the Final\n\n Rule, we estimate the average number of employers joining the program\n\n that would need to construct such facilities, which we calculate by\n\n multiplying the number of participants joining the H-2A program (49) by\n\n the assumed percentage of employers that would need to construct or\n\n expand their facilities (20%). We then multiply the number of employers\n\n joining the H-2A program needing to construct or expand their\n\n facilities (10) by the average cost per square foot to construct or\n\n expand cleaning facilities ($270.00) and the assumed size of the\n\n cleaning facility (150 sq. ft.) to estimate the total cost of\n\n constructing or expanding facilities in each remaining year ($0.4\n\n million). Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an average\n\n annual cost of $.75 million to existing and new employers.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63035]]\n\n \n\n l. Heating Equipment\n\n     In the Final Rule, as specified in Sec.  655.235, the mobile\n\n housing unit provided to workers must include operable heating\n\n equipment that supplies adequate heat for workers in locations where\n\n required for the health and safety of the workers by the climate. Where\n\n the climate in which the housing will be used is mild and the low\n\n temperature for any day in the work contract period is not reasonably\n\n\n\n expected to drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, no separate heating\n\n equipment is required as long as proper protective clothing and bedding\n\n are made available, free of charge or deposit charge, to the workers.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     The Department acknowledges that this may impose a cost on some\n\n employers, but we do not have sufficiently accurate location and\n\n temperature available to identify how many workers may require such\n\n additional heating units or how many of the mobile housing units\n\n already contain built-in heating equipment. The Department evaluated\n\n possible portable heating equipment units that are suitable for a\n\n housing unit of approximately 150 square feet to determine the range of\n\n costs required to purchase heating units. We found 12 different types\n\n of portable heating equipment suitable for heating at least 150 square\n\n feet, including propane units, kerosene units, and electric units. The\n\n propane units range in cost from approximately $69 to $280; \\87\\ the\n\n kerosene units range in cost from approximately $119 to $188; \\88\\ and\n\n the electric units range from approximately $147 to $218.\\89\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\87\\             http://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Portable-Gas-Heater-12H991;             \nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-15k-25k-BTU-Propane-Convection-Heater-RMC-LPC25DG/202223055;        \n     http://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Tank-Top-Portable-Gas-Heater-WP105137;            \nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Convection-Portable-Gas-Heater-WP105135 (Accessed 07/27/15).\n\n     \\88\\            http://www.homedepot.com/p/DuraHeat-23-000-BTU-Kerosene-Portable-Heater-\nDH2304/100045793;            http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Duraheat-Compact-Convection-Heater-\nDH1051/202221099;\n\nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Portable-Gas-Heater-12H991;\nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-15k-25k-BTU-Propane-Convection-Heater-RMC-LPC25DG/202223055;\nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Tank-Top-Portable-Gas-Heater-WP105137;\nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Convection-Portable-Gas-Heater-WP105135\nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/DuraHeat-23-000-BTU-Kerosene-Portable-Heater-DH2304/100045793;\nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/DuraHeat-23-000-BTU-Kerosene-Portable-Heater-DH2304/100045793;\nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Duraheat-Compact-Convection-Heater-DH1051/202221099;\nhttp://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Duraheat-Compact-Convection-Heater-DH1051/202221099;\n\n\n            http://www.grainger.com/product/SENGOKU-Omni-Radiant-4NHH2;            \nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/SENGOKU-Radiant-Convection-Heater-5UDU3(Accessed 07/27/15).\n\n     \\89\\            http://www.grainger.com/product/PRO-TEMP-Portable-Heater-32MY65;            \nhttp://www.grainger.com/category/hvac-and-refrigeration/ecatalog/N-k00;            \nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-Electric-Space-Htr-3VU34;            \nhttp://www.grainger.com/product/PRO-TEMP-Portable-Heater-32MY66(Accessed 07/27/15).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     The Department estimates the number of existing H-2A participants\n\n that would need to purchase portable heating equipment, which we\n\n calculate by multiplying the number of existing H-2A participants (485)\n\n by the assumed percentage of employers that would need to purchase\n\n portable heating equipment (20%). We then multiply the number of\n\n existing employers that would need to purchase portable heating\n\n equipment (97) by the average cost of a portable propane heating unit\n\n ($150.00). This calculation results in a cost of $14,550 in 2016. The\n\n Department added gas costs to employers by assuming that the average\n\n price of propane is $3 per gallon and that it would require\n\n approximately 323 gallons \\90\\ of propane to adequately supply heat for\n\n workers in locations where the temperature is expected to drop below 50\n\n degrees Fahrenheit.

The total cost of providing portable heating equipment and\n\n propane is $95,448 in 2017 and thereafter.\\93\\ Over the 10-year period,\n\n this calculation yields an average annual cost of $96,758 to existing\n\n and new employers for purchasing the equipment and propane.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\93\\ $95,448 = $93,993 + $1,455.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n m. Recordkeeping\n\n     The NPRM required that employers generate a daily record of the\n\n\n\n site of the employee's work, whether it was on the range or on the\n\n ranch or farm, and for periods when the worker was on the ranch a\n\n record of the hours worked and duties performed. The Department\n\n received several comments on the costs of generating daily records of a\n\n worker's hours and duties in response to this requirement. Several\n\n commenters stated that the Department underestimated the costs\n\n associated with the proposed requirement, while one commenter stated\n\n that the Department overestimated the costs.\n\n     For example, the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation and Sims Sheep Co.\n\n LLC commented that the Department underestimated the costs. The Wyoming\n\n Farm Bureau stated that the Department used flawed assumptions in its\n\n estimation and remarked, along with John and Carolyn Espil, that most\n\n employers do not have an HR manager--often family members are used to\n\n perform these tasks. Secondly, the commenter stated that ranch\n\n operations do not occur in locations such as offices or manufacturing\n\n facilities that are convenient for record keeping. Without access to a\n\n clock, it is difficult to track the amount of time spent on activities,\n\n which may change unexpectedly (e.g., if an animal gets sick and its\n\n care must be immediately prioritized). Thirdly, the commenter stated\n\n the proposed requirement would require a clerk as herders do not have\n\n the necessary skills. Finally, additional costs would be required for\n\n an employer to transfer the employees' records onto a time sheet for\n\n the Department's records. The Wyoming Farm Bureau concluded that the\n\n benefits do not outweigh the costs.\n\n\n\n     The Worker Advocates' Joint Comment stated that the Department's\n\n methodology for estimating the cost of complying with the proposed\n\n record keeping requirement was reasonable; however, they stated the\n\n cost may have been overestimated. The commenter noted that operations\n\n that employ workers who are not covered by the current herder\n\n exemptions are already required to have payroll systems that meet Fair\n\n Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requirements, and that it would not require\n\n much time to incorporate herder information into those systems. The\n\n commenter stated that the benefit of having these records available for\n\n monitoring and enforcement outweigh the minor cost of compliance, as\n\n the employees generally would bear the responsibility for recording\n\n their own time.\n\n     The Final Rule modifies the NPRM's proposed recordkeeping\n\n requirements by eliminating the requirement to record hours worked when\n\n workers are not on the range and by eliminating the requirement to\n\n record the duties performed each day when workers are not on the range.\n\n The Final Rule retains only the requirement to record daily whether\n\n work was performed on the range or at the farm or ranch.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63036]]\n\n \n\n i. Costs\n\n     This change represents a minor cost to herding or range livestock\n\n production employers who are not already creating and retaining\n\n\n\n records. Given that the Department received contradictory comments that\n\n it had either overestimated or underestimated the costs of the proposed\n\n recordkeeping requirement, the Department maintains its average\n\n estimate of the time required. The Department estimates the cost by\n\n multiplying the time required to prepare and store the records by the\n\n average compensation of a human resources manager at an agricultural\n\n business. In the first year of the rule, the Department estimates that\n\n the average employer will spend approximately 6 minutes each week or\n\n approximately 5 hours a year (based on a 50 week average period of\n\n need) to prepare and store the records, which amounts to approximately\n\n $392.40 ($78.48 x 5) in labor costs per year.\\94\\ For the 485\n\n employers, the total is 2,425 minutes (485 employers x 5 minutes) per\n\n week, or 40 hours per week for recording, with an annualized reporting\n\n burden of 2,000 hours per year (40 hours per week x 50 weeks). The\n\n total recordkeeping burden for 485 employers is 485 minutes (485\n\n employers x 1 minute) per week, or 8 hours per week, with an annualized\n\n recordkeeping burden of 400 hours per year (8 hours per week x 50\n\n weeks). When these two sums are added together, the total employer\n\n reporting and recordkeeping burden is 2,400 hours per year. Therefore,\n\n the total annual respondent hourly cost for this new reporting and\n\n recordkeeping burden placed on the employers in herding and the range\n\n production of livestock is estimated at 2,400 hours x $78.48 = $0.19\n\n million per year.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n\n     \\94\\ The Department estimates that herding and range livestock\n\n production employers will spend 5 minutes each week to record and 1\n\n minute to store these records. The average period of need for an H-\n\n 2A worker is 50 weeks a year. The median hourly wage for a human\n\n resources manager is $54.88 (as published by the Department's OES\n\n survey, O*Net Online), which we multiply by 1.43 to account for\n\n private-sector employee benefits (Source: Bureau of Labor\n\n Statistics). This calculation yields an hourly labor cost of $78.48.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n n. Time To Read and Review the Rule\n\n     During the first year that this rule would be in effect, herding\n\n and range livestock production employers would need to learn about the\n\n new requirements. The Department received a couple of comments related\n\n to the cost to read and review the proposed rule, which expressed the\n\n view that the Department's estimate was too low. For example, Sheep!\n\n Magazine commented that it would take longer than two hours to read and\n\n review the proposed rule. The commenter stated that the average\n\n American cannot read 400 words per minute, especially when reading\n\n regulatory language. Vermillion Ranch and Midland Ranch stated that the\n\n Department's estimate of the average annual cost ($15.18) to review the\n\n NPRM was an underestimate because employers or associations would have\n\n to hire counsel and experts to review the NPRM and prepare feedback and\n\n guidance. The commenters suggested that it would cost $15,000 per\n\n employer.\n\n\n\n     In response to comments, the Department revised its estimate of\n\n time to read and review the Final Rule upward to four hours. While the\n\n Department understands that different employers may take more or less\n\n time to read and review the rule, it believes that four hours on\n\n average is a reasonable estimate of the time needed to learn about the\n\n new requirements. The text of the regulation is quite limited in length\n\n and scope as it addresses only the subset of requirements for herding\n\n and the range production of livestock that are exceptions from the\n\n standard H-2A regulations. Further, the Final Rule does not require\n\n employers to retain counsel or other advisors to assist them, and the\n\n Department will make available compliance assistance materials,\n\n including a specific small business compliance guide, that many\n\n employers may choose to read in lieu of reading the regulation itself.\n\n i. Costs\n\n     This requirement represents a cost to herding and range livestock\n\n production employers in the first year of the rule. The Department\n\n notes that the cost of reading and reviewing the rule ($313.92) is\n\n incurred only in the first year; amortized over the rule's 10-year\n\n lifespan, the average annual cost is only $31.39. The Department\n\n estimates this cost by multiplying the time required to read and review\n\n the new rule (4 hours) by the average compensation of a human resources\n\n manager at an agricultural business ($78.48).\\95\\ The Department\n\n estimates the cost of reading and reviewing the rule by multiplying\n\n $31.39 times the number of employers (485). This calculation results in\n\n a cost of $152,251 in 2016 and an average annual cost of $15,225.\n\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\95\\ The median hourly wage for a human resources manager is\n\n $54.88 (as published by the Department's OES survey, O*Net Online),\n\n which we multiply by 1.43 to account for private-sector employee\n\n benefits (source: Bureau of Labor Statistics). This calculation\n\n yields an hourly labor cost of $78.48.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n 5. Summary of Impacts\n\n i. Costs and Transfers\n\n     Exhibit 10 presents a summary of first-year and average annual\n\n costs and transfers by affected entity.\\96\\ The Department estimates\n\n the total first-year costs and transfers of the Final Rule to be $8.49\n\n million and $9.11 million, respectively. The transfer from all herding\n\n and range livestock production employers to workers due to the revised\n\n wage determination methodology, which bases the monthly AEWR on the\n\n forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 base wage, times 48 hours per week with a\n\n 2-year transition period, amounts to $9.11 million. The largest first-\n\n year cost is the cost to expand cooking/cleaning facilities at $3.93\n\n million, followed by the cost of providing water to workers, the cost\n\n of providing food to workers, recordkeeping, heating equipment, and the\n\n time required to read and review the Final Rule. These costs and\n\n transfers are incurred by all sheep and goat herding and range\n\n\n\n livestock production employers with the exception of the cost of\n\n providing food to workers, which is incurred only by range livestock\n\n production employers. Range livestock production employers experience a\n\n cost reduction of approximately $0.06 million in the first year of the\n\n rule due to the elimination of the newspaper advertising requirement.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\96\\ Transfer payments, as defined by OMB Circular A-4, are\n\n payments from one group to another that do not affect total\n\n resources available to society. Transfer payments are associated\n\n with a distributional effect but do not result in additional costs\n\n or benefits to society. In this case, the Department classifies the\n\n wage increases as both transfer payments (to society) and costs (to\n\n employers).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In general, average annual transfers are larger than those in the\n\n first year because of the transition period for the monthly wage\n\n increases and because the Department adjusted the base wage based upon\n\n the wages and salaries ECI over the 10-year analysis period. The\n\n average annual transfer from employers to employees due to the revised\n\n wage determination methodology for the AEWR amounts to $17.46 million\n\n per year. The largest average cost is providing water to workers at\n\n\n\n $2.36 million per year, followed by the cost of providing meals to\n\n workers at $1.78 million per year, the cost of expanding cooking/\n\n cleaning facilities at $0.75 million per year, the cost of\n\n recordkeeping at $0.19 million per year, the cost of the heating\n\n equipment and propane at $0.10 million, and the time required to read\n\n and review the Final Rule at $0.02 million per year. Range livestock\n\n production employers experience an average annual cost\n\n \n\n [[Page 63037]]\n\n \n\n reduction of approximately $0.06 million. The Department estimates the\n\n average annual cost of the Final Rule to be $5.13 million.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.017\n\n \n\n     Exhibit 11 presents a summary of the economic impact analysis of\n\n the Final Rule. The monetized net costs and transfers displayed are the\n\n yearly summations of the calculations described above. In some cases,\n\n the totals for one year are less than the totals of the annual averages\n\n described above. The total (undiscounted) costs and transfers of the\n\n rule sum to $51.26 million and $174.64 million over the 10-year\n\n analysis period, respectively. This amounts to an average annual cost\n\n and transfer of $5.13 million and $17.46 million per year,\n\n respectively. In total, the 10-year discounted costs of the Final Rule\n\n range from $36.87 million to $44.16 million (with 7 and 3 percent\n\n discounting, respectively). In total, the 10-year discounted transfers\n\n\n\n of the Final Rule range from $117.99 million to $146.52 million (with 7\n\n and 3 percent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n [[Page 63038]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.018\n\n \n\n ii. Benefits\n\n     The Department was able to identify cost reductions of the Final\n\n Rule due to the elimination of the newspaper advertising requirement,\n\n which amount to $0.06 million per year over the 10-year analysis\n\n period. The Department also expects there to be cost reductions due to\n\n the revised job order submission requirements and the revised master\n\n application filing requirements. However, the Department was not able\n\n to quantify those cost reductions resulting from the Final Rule.\n\n     Due to data limitations, the Department also did not quantify\n\n several of the important benefits to society provided by the revised\n\n policies. Through this rulemaking the Department is establishing a new\n\n methodology for determining a monthly AEWR and clarifying employer\n\n obligations for these unique occupations with the aim of protecting the\n\n wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and better assessing their\n\n availability for these jobs based on appropriate terms and conditions\n\n of employment. The higher wages for workers will result in an improved\n\n\n\n ability on the part of workers and their families to meet their costs\n\n of living and spend money in their local communities. Higher wages may\n\n also decrease turnover among U.S. workers and thereby decrease the\n\n costs of recruitment and retention to employers. Reduced worker\n\n turnover is associated with lower costs to employers arising from\n\n recruiting and training replacement workers. Because seeking and\n\n training new workers is costly, reduced turnover leads to savings for\n\n employers. Research indicates that decreased turnover costs partially\n\n offset increased labor costs (Reich, Hall, and Jacobs 2003; Fairris,\n\n Runstein, Briones, and Goodheart 2005).\\97\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\97\\ Reich, Michael, Peter Hall, and Ken Jacobs, ``Living Wages\n\n and Economic Performance: The San Francisco Airport Model''\n\n Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California,\n\n Berkeley, March 2003.

For example, Holzer (1990) \\98\\ finds\n\n that high-wage firms can sometimes offset more than half of their\n\n higher wage costs through improved productivity and lower hiring and\n\n turnover costs.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\98\\ Holzer, Harry, ``Wages, Employer Costs, and Employee\n\n Performance in the Firm.''

Due to data limitations, the Department was\n\n not able to quantify or monetize the impact of these protective\n\n\n\n measures.\n\n \n\n B. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\n \n\n     The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) at 5 U.S.C. 603 requires\n\n agencies to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis to determine\n\n whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a\n\n substantial number of small entities. Section 605 of the RFA allows an\n\n agency to certify a rule in lieu of\n\n \n\n [[Page 63039]]\n\n \n\n preparing an analysis if the regulation is not expected to have a\n\n significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n Further, under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act\n\n of 1996, 5 U.S.C. 801 (SBREFA), an agency is required to produce\n\n compliance guidance for small entities if the rule has a significant\n\n economic impact. This rule will have a significant economic impact on a\n\n substantial number of small entities.\n\n 1. Need for, and Objectives of, the Rule\n\n     Among the reasons for the current rulemaking was the decision of\n\n the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Mendoza case,\n\n which required the Department to engage in notice and comment\n\n rulemaking to set standards governing the employment of foreign herders\n\n because those standards were legislative rules governed by the\n\n\n\n Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1024-\n\n 1025. In addition to the Mendoza decision, ETA's traditional method of\n\n determining the monthly AEWR for these occupations--the use of SWA\n\n surveys--has become increasingly difficult with few states reporting\n\n wage results because their surveys included so few U.S. workers that\n\n they could not report statistically valid results. Wage stagnation has\n\n resulted from this methodology with herders in most states earning only\n\n slightly higher nominal wages today than they were 20 years ago, and\n\n therefore they are making significantly less in real terms. 80 FR\n\n 20307. Accordingly, we needed to engage in notice and comment\n\n rulemaking as a result of both the Mendoza decision and to address the\n\n faulty wage methodology that over years contributed to herder wage\n\n stagnation.\n\n 2. Significant Issues Raised by the Public Comments and the\n\n Department's Response\n\n     This section presents an analysis of the significant issues raised\n\n by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory\n\n flexibility analysis (IRFA) and a summary of the Department's response\n\n to those issues. We discuss many of these issues in detail in the\n\n preamble and the EO 12866 analysis and, therefore, we incorporate those\n\n discussions by reference.\n\n a. Comments on the Number of H-2A Workers per Small Business\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy, the Mountain Plains Agricultural\n\n Services and Western Range Association (Mountain Plains and Western\n\n\n\n Range), the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, Vermillion Ranch and\n\n Midland Ranch, and others stated that the Department underestimated the\n\n cost of the proposed rule for small herding operations because these\n\n operations may hire more than three H-2A workers, which is the value\n\n the Department used to estimate costs. They emphasized that, for small\n\n businesses that hire more than three H-2A workers, the cost of the\n\n proposed rule could be higher than the 19 to 24 percent of revenues the\n\n Department identified in the IRFA. The commenters referenced a survey\n\n by the Colorado Wool Growers Association, The Real Wage Benefits\n\n Provided to H-2A Sheep Herders and the Economic Cost to Colorado\n\n Ranchers, which showed that its members hired an average of five H-2A\n\n workers per employer. The commenters also cited a recent phone survey\n\n by Mountain Plains, which showed that its members hired an average of\n\n 4.2 H-2A workers per employer. Vermillion Ranch and Midland Ranch\n\n stated that although their ranches' gross revenues are generally higher\n\n than the average annual revenue of $252,050 estimated by the\n\n Department, they would incur significantly greater costs because they\n\n hire 18 and 13 workers, respectively, each year.\n\n     Some commenters provided the number of workers hired on their\n\n ranches per year:\n\n      Etchart Livestock, Inc. stated that it employs five to\n\n seven foreign workers.\n\n      David and Bonnie Little stated that they employ 10\n\n\n\n sheepherders.\n\n      FIM Corp. stated that it employs 11 H-2A sheepherders.\n\n      Julian Land & Livestock stated that it employs 12 to 22\n\n men.\n\n     In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) economic analysis, the\n\n Department estimated the average number of H-2A workers per employer as\n\n three based on actual H-2A certifications issued during FY 2011 and FY\n\n 2012. Based on a review of more recent H-2A certifications issued\n\n during FY 2013 and FY 2014, the Department revised the average number\n\n H-2A workers per employer to 4.2 in the final regulatory flexibility\n\n analysis (FRFA).\\99\\ The Department notes that this is the average\n\n number of H-2A workers per employer, meaning that some employers may\n\n choose to employ more than 4.2 H-2A workers while others employ fewer.\n\n The Department agrees that ranchers involved in sheep and goat herding\n\n operations who employ more than 4.2 H-2A workers, and who earn no more\n\n than an average revenue of $252,050, will incur a revenue loss of more\n\n than the estimated percentage of annual revenues. Based on the revised\n\n average number of H-2A workers per employer, the Department believes\n\n that the Final Rule will have a significant economic impact on a\n\n substantial number of affected small entities. DOL has a statutory\n\n obligation to set wages and working conditions in the H-2A program at a\n\n level that protects against adverse effect on U.S. workers due to the\n\n\n\n employment of foreign workers. For the reasons discussed in the\n\n preamble, DOL has determined that the requirements in this rule are\n\n needed to protect against adverse effect on U.S. workers; therefore,\n\n DOL could not lower requirements for small businesses.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\99\\ The FY 2013 and FY 2014 certification data show an annual\n\n average of 953 applications certified for an average of 2,481\n\n workers in the herding and range production of livestock program, or\n\n 2.6 workers per application. The Department concluded that this\n\n could be an underestimate because some employers file multiple\n\n applications per year. Therefore, we also attempted to identify the\n\n number of unique employers filing applications. We estimate that an\n\n annual average of 485 unique employers filed applications, which\n\n would indicate 5.1 workers per employer. However, the Department\n\n concluded that this could be an overestimate because employers do\n\n not bring into the country all the workers for which they are\n\n certified each year. Furthermore, some employers file multiple\n\n applications because their itinerary changes and they need to\n\n reapply to receive authorization to send workers to another state,\n\n even though they will be the same workers. Therefore, we assumed an\n\n average of 4.2 workers per employer, consistent with the estimate\n\n\n\n from the Mountain Plains 2015 telephone survey of its members\n\n discussed by the SBA Office of Advocacy.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n b. Comments on the Calculation of the Number of Affected Small Entities\n\n     The Department received comments on the calculation of the number\n\n of affected small entities. The commenters asserted that most or all of\n\n the businesses affected by the proposed rule are small entities.\n\n     John and Carolyn Espil stated that most or all of the ranches\n\n affected by the proposed rule would be small entities. They cited (1)\n\n the Nevada Department of Agriculture (NDA), which stated that 82.78\n\n percent of agricultural operations in Nevada are engaged in livestock\n\n production and (2) the NDA's Economic Contribution of Agriculture\n\n Report, which stated that 82.2 percent of farms and ranches are owned\n\n by families or individuals. The commenters also disagreed with the\n\n Department's estimate in the IRFA that the average small farm makes\n\n $252,050 in annual revenue. The commenters remarked that farms cannot\n\n make this much without off-farm income and stated that any other\n\n estimates using this annual revenue figure should be considered\n\n inaccurate as well. Sharon O'Toole stated that since nearly all of the\n\n \n\n [[Page 63040]]\n\n \n\n businesses affected by the proposed rule are small entities, the\n\n proposed rule is a violation of existing law.\n\n\n\n     Mountain Plains and Western Range and Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers\n\n Association cited the ASI, which stated that 99.98 percent of sheep\n\n operations in the United States are small businesses. In addition, the\n\n commenter noted that nearly all of the members of Mountain Plains and\n\n Western Range would meet the statutory definition of a ``small\n\n business'' for an agricultural enterprise. The SBA Office of Advocacy\n\n confirmed that approximately 99 percent of U.S. farms in the relevant\n\n industries are considered small businesses under the SBA definition.\n\n The Siddoway Sheep Company referenced the U.S. Department of\n\n Agriculture's most recent census, which stated that 92 percent of sheep\n\n and goat operations are family businesses. ASI and Public Lands Council\n\n and Patrick O'Toole stated that changes to the H-2A sheepherder program\n\n would have a significant negative impact on the 79,500 family farms and\n\n ranches that raise sheep in the United States. The Wyoming Livestock\n\n Board, the Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association, ASI, and the Pilster\n\n Ranch stated that 38 percent of sheep production in the United States\n\n is under the care of H-2A sheepherders and that the proposed rule would\n\n negatively impact the 79,500 family farms in the U.S. sheep industry.\n\n     The Department agrees with the commenters that almost all of the H-\n\n 2A employers affected by the rule are small entities that meet the\n\n SBA's small business size standards, which was reflected in the IRFA\n\n and is repeated in the FRFA. However, the Department maintains that its\n\n estimate of the average revenue of a small entity ($252,050 in 2013\n\n dollars) is consistent with the average revenue from the Idaho farm\n\n enterprise budget for range sheep herding submitted by Mountain Plains\n\n\n\n and Western Range. Please note that in the FRFA, the Department has\n\n updated its analysis to 2014 dollars; thus, the revised estimate of the\n\n average revenue of a small entity is $256,138 in 2014 dollars.\\100\\ In\n\n addition, some ranchers have multiple enterprise operations that\n\n include both range sheep production and range cattle production.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\100\\ According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, the average\n\n revenue (i.e., the average market value of agricultural products\n\n sold and government payments) per farm in the relevant industries is\n\n $248,411. After adjusting for inflation using the CPI-U, the\n\n Department estimates that the average revenue per farm in the\n\n relevant industries is approximately $252,050 in 2013 dollars and\n\n $256,138 in 2014 dollars. Thus, the Department estimated that a\n\n small farm in the relevant industries would have average annual\n\n revenues of approximately $252,050 and $256,138 in the NPRM and\n\n Final Rule, respectively.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n c. Comments on the Calculation of the Significant Economic Impact on a\n\n Substantial Number of Small Entities\n\n     The Department received several comments stating that the proposed\n\n rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number\n\n of small entities. The Department also received a couple of comments\n\n suggesting that the Department publish a Supplemental IRFA for public\n\n\n\n comment.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy, Mountain Plains and Western Range, the\n\n Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Montana Wool Growers Association,\n\n John and Carolyn Espil, and Sheep! Magazine concluded that the proposed\n\n rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number\n\n of small entities. The SBA Office of Advocacy stated that the\n\n Department's IRFA may have underestimated costs for small businesses\n\n and did not analyze any alternatives that may minimize the economic\n\n impact on small businesses. The commenter suggested that the Department\n\n publish for public comment a Supplemental IRFA analyzing the cost of\n\n the proposed rule and alternatives for small businesses that minimize\n\n the economic impact.\n\n     The Department concluded that the proposed rule would have a\n\n significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n Therefore, the Department published the IRFA and invited comments on\n\n the impact to such small entities. If the small-entity impact estimates\n\n in the IRFA underestimated the true costs to the small entities, such\n\n as because we were not able to quantify the costs of some of items due\n\n to data limitations, we specifically identified those items and invited\n\n comments. Very few, if any, responses were received that provided\n\n specific information on such costs. Moreover, the IRFA identified two\n\n alternatives; we did not identify any less costly alternatives because\n\n we concluded, at that time, that such alternatives would not allow the\n\n Department to fulfill our dual statutory mandate of determining that no\n\n U.S. workers are available for the job and that the employment of\n\n\n\n foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working\n\n conditions of workers similarly employed in the United States.\n\n     With respect to the ``downstream'' economic impacts on related\n\n industries in the U.S. economy, the Department was unable to quantify\n\n such impacts due to a lack of data and statistical input-output models\n\n necessary to conduct an accurate analysis. Therefore, such impacts are\n\n beyond the scope of this economic analysis.\n\n     Based upon the comments received on the NPRM, the Final Rule makes\n\n a number of changes to the NPRM, all of which are analyzed below. The\n\n Department decided to set the monthly wage rates for range herders of\n\n sheep, goats, and other livestock using the current Fair Labor\n\n Standards Act (FLSA) minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour as a starting\n\n point, with annual adjustments to account for inflation, and an assumed\n\n 48-hour workweek; we also considered and address below alternative wage\n\n setting proposals submitted by commenters, including two less costly\n\n alternatives.\n\n d. Alternatives Considered in the Analysis\n\n     As discussed in detail in the EO 12866 analysis, the Department\n\n received comments related to the alternatives considered in the IRFA.\n\n Many commenters asserted that the alternatives were not ``true''\n\n alternatives in that the Department did not consider other ways to\n\n determine the monthly Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR). They commented\n\n that the Department only considered alternatives related to the timing\n\n of the monthly wage rate increases, and thus they characterized it as\n\n\n\n one alternative with three transition periods. For this reason, some\n\n commenters stated that the Department failed to meet the requirements\n\n set forth in Section 603(c) of the RFA to describe ``any significant\n\n alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated\n\n objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant\n\n economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.''\n\n     The Department carefully reviewed the comments related to the\n\n proposed wage-setting methodology and to the alternatives laid out in\n\n the EO 12866 analysis and the IRFA. After considering the comments, the\n\n Department has decided to set the monthly AEWR for range herders of\n\n sheep, goats, and other livestock using a formula based on the current\n\n FLSA minimum wage as a starting point, with annual adjustment based on\n\n inflation. This decision is in line with the second of two alternative\n\n proposals set forth by Mountain Plains and Western Range, which was\n\n endorsed by the ASI and many individual employers; however, it also was\n\n slightly modified consistent with the suggestions in the Worker\n\n Advocates' Joint Comment. As discussed in detail in the preamble, the\n\n Department concludes that this wage rate is both necessary to provide a\n\n meaningful test of the labor market for\n\n \n\n [[Page 63041]]\n\n \n\n available U.S. workers and to protect against adverse effect on workers\n\n in the United States similarly employed.\n\n\n\n     The Department has considered three alternatives in addition to the\n\n new wage setting methodology in the Final Rule analysis:\n\n     (1) To base the monthly AEWR on the 1994 TEGL wage rates ($800,\n\n which was approximately the highest 1994 TEGL rate), adjusted to a 2014\n\n monthly wage using the ECI capped at a maximum annual increase of 2.5\n\n percent, the forecasted ECI for wages and salaries values applied to\n\n the estimated 2014 monthly wage, and which is introduced over a three-\n\n year transition period with full implementation in year four;\n\n     (2) to base the monthly AEWR on the current FLSA minimum hourly\n\n wage, the forecasted ECI for wages and salaries values applied\n\n beginning in year five, a 44-hour workweek, and which is introduced\n\n over a three-year transition period with full implementation in year\n\n four; and\n\n     (3) to base the monthly AEWR on forecasted hourly AEWRs for\n\n combined field and livestock workers by state, a 65-hour workweek, with\n\n full implementation in year one, and incorporating a monthly food\n\n deduction estimate as permitted in the standard H-2A program, which is\n\n adjusted by the average CPI-U over 2012 to 2014.\n\n     The preamble and the EO 12866 analysis describe in detail the\n\n methodology we adopted in the Final Rule and the reasons for its\n\n selection over the three alternatives that we considered. The three\n\n alternatives that we considered are described in detail below.\n\n i. 1994 TEGL Wage Adjusted Based on Capped ECI With a Three-Year\n\n Transition Period\n\n     Under this alternate wage determination methodology, the Department\n\n\n\n adjusts the estimated 1994 TEGL wage ($800.00) as recommended by\n\n Mountain Plains, Western Range, ASI and others using a capped ECI\n\n approach.\\101\\ Under the capped ECI approach, we adjust the wage for\n\n each year as follows:\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\101\\ The employer commenters proposed using $800 as the 1994\n\n wage to index; although $800 is higher than the wage in all but one\n\n state, it was not used in any state and is lower than the $820 sheep\n\n and goat herder wage in Arizona in 1994. The alternative wage\n\n methodology does not account for wages paid by livestock herders,\n\n which are not available for 1994.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n      By 1.5 percent if the percentage increase in the wages and\n\n salaries ECI during the previous calendar year was less than 1.5\n\n percent;\n\n      By the percentage increase if the percentage increase in\n\n the wages and salaries ECI during the previous calendar year was\n\n between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, inclusive; or\n\n      By 2.5 percent if the percentage increases in the wages\n\n and salaries ECI during the previous calendar year was greater than 2.5\n\n percent.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63042]]\n\n\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.019\n\n \n\n     We then apply the growth rate calculated under the Final Rule's\n\n source--the average year-to-year-growth rate of the average quarterly\n\n wages and salaries ECI for each year from 2012 through 2014 (2.0\n\n percent)--to the 2014-indexed wage ($1,261.84) and forecast the indexed\n\n monthly wage required under Alternative 1 for 2016 to 2025. The wage\n\n rate determination methodology includes a three-year transition period,\n\n with full implementation in year four. The Department estimates the\n\n hourly wage rate for each year of the analysis period as follows\n\n (Exhibit 13):\n\n \n\n [[Page 63043]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.020\n\n \n\n     Exhibit 14 presents the forecasted ECI-adjusted cap-indexed 1994\n\n TEGL wage with a three-year transition period and full implementation\n\n in 2019 under Alternative 1.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.021\n\n \n\n     Exhibits 15 and 16 present the wage differential between the\n\n monthly wage under Alternative 1 and the baseline by state for sheep\n\n and goat herders and range livestock production workers, respectively.\n\n\n\n In the case of California and Oregon, the monthly wage under\n\n Alternative 1 is lower than the baseline wage in every year. In the\n\n case of Hawaii, where the monthly wage of $1,422.52 is based on a 2012\n\n prevailing wage survey conducted by California, the monthly wage under\n\n Alternative 1 is lower than Hawaii's current baseline wage in the first\n\n five years. In these instances, the Department assumes that the workers\n\n will continue to receive the baseline wage in the applicable year;\n\n therefore, no wage differential results. Additionally, the monthly wage\n\n differentials for states that did not have a baseline wage because\n\n there were no H-2A workers certified are denoted as ``N/A.'' Note that\n\n these values are for informational purposes only and were not used in\n\n the analysis.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63044]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.022\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63045]]\n\n \n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.023\n\n \n\n ii. Forecasted ECI-Adjusted $7.25 Multiplied by 44 Hours/Week With a\n\n\n\n Three-Year Transition Period\n\n     Under this alternate monthly wage rate determination methodology,\n\n which also was generally suggested by Mountain Plains, Western Range,\n\n ASI, and other employer commenters, the Department estimates the hourly\n\n base wage rate by applying the 2-percent growth rate estimated under\n\n the Final Rule's wage methodology, which is the average year-to-year-\n\n growth rate of the average quarterly ECI for wages and salaries for\n\n each year from 2012 through 2014, to $7.25 for each year beginning in\n\n 2020.\\102\\ The wage rate determination methodology uses a three-year\n\n transition period, with full implementation in year four. The\n\n Department estimates the hourly wage rate for each year of the analysis\n\n period as follows (Exhibit 17):\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\102\\ Because the average year-to-year ECI growth rate was 2.0\n\n percent, it fell within the cap range (1.5 to 2.5 percent) suggested\n\n by Mountain Plains and Western Range; therefore, the increase is the\n\n same whether using the capped or uncapped methodology.\n\n \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n [[Page 63046]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.024\n\n \n\n\n\n     To convert the hourly base wage rate to a monthly wage rate, the\n\n Department multiplies the hourly wage rate by 44 hours per workweek and\n\n 4.333 weeks per month. Exhibit 18 presents the monthly AEWR.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.025\n\n \n\n     Exhibits 19 and 20 present the wage differential between the\n\n monthly wage under Alternative 2 and the baseline by state for sheep\n\n and goat herders and range livestock production workers, respectively.\n\n In the case of California and Oregon, the monthly wage under\n\n Alternative 2 is lower than the baseline wage in every year. In the\n\n case of Hawaii, where the monthly wage of $1,422.52 is based on a 2012\n\n prevailing wage survey conducted by California, the monthly wage under\n\n Alternative 2 is lower than Hawaii's current baseline wage in the first\n\n five years. In these instances, the Department assumes that the workers\n\n will continue to receive the baseline wage in the applicable year;\n\n therefore, no wage differential results. Additionally, the monthly wage\n\n differentials for states that did not have a baseline wage are denoted\n\n as ``N/A.'' Note that these values are for informational purposes only\n\n and were not used in the analysis.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63047]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.026\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n [[Page 63048]]\n\n \n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.027\n\n \n\n iii. Forecasted FLS-Based AEWR, 65-Hour Week, With Food Deductions and\n\n No Transition Period\n\n     Under this alternate wage rate determination methodology, based\n\n generally upon the recommendation made in the Joint Workers' Advocate\n\n Comment, the Department first calculates the annual percentage change\n\n in each state's average FLS-based AEWR for each year from 2013 to 2015.\n\n We then take the averages of the resulting two values to estimate the\n\n average annual percentage changes by state as shown in Exhibit 21.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63049]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.028\n\n \n\n     Using each state's geometric average annual percent change, we\n\n forecast each state's FLS-based AEWR for 2016 to 2025.\\103\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\103\\ The geometric mean of the annual percent changes provides\n\n the rate of growth which, if experienced each year, would lead to\n\n\n\n the same total change in wages as that observed between 2013 and\n\n 2015. In this case, the formula for the geometric mean is: (see\n\n equation above) where rmean is the geometric mean and\n\n r2013-2014 and r2014-2015 are the annual\n\n percent changes between 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, respectively.\n\n \n\n Using Alabama as an example, the geometric average annual percent\n\n change over the two years is 1.1 percent. The Department applies the\n\n 1.1-percent growth rate to the 2015 hourly AEWR to obtain the\n\n forecasted 2016 hourly AEWR ($10.00 x 1.011 = $10.11). We then apply\n\n the same 1.1 percent growth rate to the forecasted 2016 hourly AEWR to\n\n forecast the 2017 hourly AEWR ($10.11 x 1.011 = $10.22). We repeat this\n\n calculation to forecast the hourly AEWRs for the remaining years in the\n\n analysis period. Exhibit 22 presents the forecasted hourly AEWRs for\n\n each state.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.038\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63050]]\n\n \n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.029\n\n \n\n     As recommended in the Worker Advocates' Joint Comment, this wage\n\n\n\n rate option does not use a transition period. To convert the hourly\n\n FLS-based AEWR to a monthly wage rate, the Department multiplies the\n\n hourly wage rate by 65 hours per workweek and 4.333 weeks per month. To\n\n account for the food deduction, we convert the 2015 daily food\n\n deduction of $11.86 per worker to the monthly food deduction of $359.73\n\n per worker by multiplying the daily food deduction by the number of\n\n days per week (7) by the number of weeks per month (4.333).\\104\\ We\n\n then apply the average year-to-year change in the CPI-U from 2012 to\n\n 2014 (1.5 percent) to the monthly food deduction for each year\n\n beginning in 2016. Exhibit 23 presents the monthly food deductions by\n\n year.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\104\\ The daily meal cost estimate of $11.86 is from Allowable\n\n Meal Charges and Reimbursements for Daily Subsistence published by\n\n the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment & Training Administration\n\n (Source:            http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm. Accessed July 30, 2015).\n\n \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n [[Page 63051]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.030\n\n \n\nhttp://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm\n\n\n     We subtract the monthly food deduction from the monthly wage.\n\n Exhibit 24 presents the monthly wages with the food deductions taken\n\n into account.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63052]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.031\n\n \n\n     Exhibits 25 and 26 present the wage differential between the\n\n monthly wage under Alternative 3--the forecasted FLS-based AEWR with\n\n food deductions taken into account--and the baseline by state for sheep\n\n and goat herders and range livestock production workers, respectively.\n\n Additionally, the monthly wage differentials for states that did not\n\n have a baseline wage because there were no H-2A workers employed as\n\n herders or range livestock workers are denoted as ``N/A.'' Note that\n\n these values are for informational purposes only and were not used in\n\n the analysis.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63053]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.032\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63054]]\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.033\n\n \n\n     As discussed in the preamble and the EO 12866 analysis, the\n\n Department concludes that the Final Rule's methodology for setting the\n\n monthly AEWR is the most appropriate as it will begin to address\n\n immediately and substantially the wage stagnation that has occurred\n\n over the past decades. Some transition period is necessary because the\n\n comments indicate that requiring the full monthly increase immediately\n\n could lead to significant disruptions that might cause job losses due\n\n to some employers going out of business or scaling back their\n\n operations. Based on all the information in the comments, including\n\n balance sheet information from individual\n\n \n\n [[Page 63055]]\n\n \n\n employers, the state enterprise budgets, and the other data in the\n\n record such as regarding average prices for lamb and wool over the last\n\n 15 years, the Department concludes that given the Final Rule's\n\n methodology for setting the monthly AEWR a two-year transition period\n\n is sufficient to avoid such disruptions. We do not believe that the\n\n lengthier transition periods in the first two alternatives we\n\n considered are necessary. However, we also do not believe that the\n\n third alternative, with substantially higher wages based on the FLS-\n\n\n\n based hourly wages with no transition period, is appropriate; the\n\n evidence indicates that there is a substantial risk that tripling the\n\n required wage rates will entirely eliminate annual profits for some\n\n employers, which is likely to cause, rather than prevent, adverse\n\n effect on U.S. workers.\n\n     Exhibit 27 presents a summary of average annual transfers over the\n\n 10-year analysis period by wage determination methodology. The\n\n Department estimates the average annual transfer from all herding and\n\n range livestock production employers to workers due to the Final Rule's\n\n wage determination methodology, which bases the monthly AEWR on\n\n forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 base wage, times 48 hours per week with a\n\n 2-year transition period, to be $17.46 million per year. This is a\n\n decrease relative to the average annual transfer from employers to\n\n workers estimated under the NPRM's wage determination methodology,\n\n forecasted AEWR values by USDA region incrementally phased in over a 5-\n\n year period, of $45.08 million per year. Of the three alternatives, the\n\n largest average annual transfer from employers to employees due to\n\n Alternative 3's revised wage determination methodology (i.e., the\n\n forecasted FLS-based AEWR with food deductions taken into account)\n\n amounts to $71.38 million per year, followed by Alternative 1's\n\n methodology (i.e., the forecasted ECI-adjusted cap-indexed 1994 TEGL\n\n wage with a 3-year transition period and full implementation in 2019)\n\n at $12.64 million per year, and Alternative 2's methodology (i.e., the\n\n\n\n forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 base wage, times 44 hours per week with a\n\n 3-year transition period) at $12.47 million per year.\n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.034\n\n \n\n 3. Response to Comments Filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the\n\n SBA\n\n     As discussed in Section 2 above, the SBA Office of Advocacy\n\n submitted substantive comments regarding a number of issues, including\n\n the number of H-2A workers per small business, the calculation of the\n\n number of affected small entities, and the calculation of the\n\n significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This\n\n section summarizes separately the SBA Office of Advocacy's comments and\n\n the Department's responses.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy commented that the Department\n\n underestimated the cost of the proposed rule for small herding\n\n operations because these operations may hire more than three H-2A\n\n workers, which is the value the Department used to estimate costs. In\n\n response to this concern, the Department revised the average number of\n\n H-2A workers per employer in the FRFA to 4.2 based on actual H-2A\n\n certifications issued during FY 2013 and FY 2014. This figure is\n\n consistent with the estimate submitted by the commenters based upon a\n\n recent telephone survey conducted by Mountain Plains involving\n\n responses from 214 of 275 members.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy also commented on the number of small\n\n\n\n entities affected, noting that approximately 99 percent of sheep\n\n operations in the United States are small businesses. The Department\n\n agrees that almost all of the H-2A employers affected by the proposed\n\n rule are small entities that meet the SBA's small business size\n\n standards, which was reflected in the IRFA and is repeated in the FRFA.\n\n However, the Department maintains that its estimate of the average\n\n revenue of a small entity ($252,050 in 2013 dollars) is consistent with\n\n the average revenue from farm enterprise budgets for range sheep\n\n herding reported by commenters. Please note that in the FRFA, the\n\n Department updates its analysis to 2014 dollars; thus, the revised\n\n estimate of the average revenue of a small entity is $256,138.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy stated that the proposed rule would have\n\n a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. SBA\n\n also commented that the Department's IRFA may have underestimated costs\n\n for small businesses and did not analyze any alternatives that may\n\n minimize the economic impact on small businesses. SBA suggested that\n\n the Department publish for public comment a Supplemental IRFA analyzing\n\n the cost of the proposed rule and alternatives for small businesses\n\n that minimize the economic impact. The Department concluded that the\n\n proposed rule would have a significant impact on a substantial number\n\n of small entities. Therefore, the Department published the IRFA and\n\n invited comments on the impact to such small entities. If we were not\n\n able to quantify certain costs due to data limitations, we identified\n\n those items and invited comments. Very few, if any, responses were\n\n received that provided specific information on such costs.\n\n\n\n \n\n [[Page 63056]]\n\n \n\n     The IRFA identified two alternatives for setting the required\n\n monthly wage; we did not identify any less costly alternatives in the\n\n IRFA because we concluded, at that time, that such alternatives would\n\n not allow the Department to fulfill its dual statutory mandate of\n\n ensuring that no U.S. workers are available for the job and that the\n\n employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and\n\n working conditions of workers similarly employed in the United States.\n\n Based upon comments received from the industry, the FRFA identifies two\n\n less-costly alternatives to the Final Rule wage methodology and,\n\n together with the preamble and EO 12866 analysis, explains why the\n\n Department did not find either of those alternatives to be appropriate.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy expressed concern about the NPRM's\n\n definition of ``open range,'' noting that 36 percent of respondents to\n\n a Mountain Plains survey thought they would not qualify for the program\n\n if fences were prohibited. The Final Rule substantially revises the\n\n definition of what qualifies as the ``range'' in recognition of the\n\n fact that fences are used in many locations for many purposes,\n\n including on Forest Service and BLM lands where animals graze.\n\n     The SBA Office of Advocacy also expressed concern that the NPRM\n\n relied upon the same hourly wage rate as is paid to regular H-2A field\n\n and livestock workers, when herding employers provide housing, food,\n\n\n\n clothing, tools, paid vacation, etc. Unlike the NPRM, the Final Rule\n\n does not base the monthly AEWR on the FLS-based hourly wage. Moreover,\n\n we note that all H-2A employers are required to provide free housing\n\n and are required to provide the tools, supplies and equipment necessary\n\n to perform the job free of charge. The Department does not require\n\n herding employers to provide paid vacation, although we support them if\n\n they voluntarily choose to do so.\n\n     With regard to the concern that small herding operations have a\n\n difficult time hiring U.S. workers for this work, we anticipate that\n\n updating the required monthly wage rate to overcome the many years of\n\n wage stagnation may result in more U.S. workers being interested in\n\n this work. California, which has a higher state minimum wage for\n\n herders, is consistently among the states with the largest number of\n\n U.S. sheepherders identified in SWA surveys.\n\n 4. Calculation of the Number of Affected Small Entities\n\n a. Definition of a Small Business\n\n     A small entity is one that is ``independently owned and operated\n\n and which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' The definition\n\n of small business varies from industry to industry, to the extent\n\n necessary, in order to properly reflect industry size differences. An\n\n agency must either use the SBA definition for a small entity or\n\n establish an alternative definition for the relevant industries to\n\n which a rule applies, which in this case includes Beef Cattle Ranching\n\n and Farming (NAICS 112111), Dairy Cattle and Milk Production (NAICS\n\n\n\n 11212), Sheep and Goat Farming (NAICS 1124), and Other Animal\n\n Production (NAICS 1129).\\105\\ The Department has adopted the SBA\n\n definition for these industries, which is an establishment with annual\n\n revenues of less than $0.75 million.\\106\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\105\\ Animal Aquaculture (NAICS 1125) is not considered a\n\n relevant industry for this rulemaking. However, the RFA analysis\n\n uses data from the 2012 Census of Agriculture, which does not\n\n distinguish between Animal Aquaculture (1125) and Other Animal\n\n Production (1129). Due to this data limitation, the Department\n\n includes Animal Aquaculture industry data in the calculations of\n\n this RFA analysis. In addition, the Department excludes farms in the\n\n Cattle Feedlots (NAICS 112112) industry because cattle in feedlots\n\n do not graze on the range; therefore, employers in the cattle\n\n feedlot industry would not be affected by the rule.\n\n     \\106\\ Source: U.S. Small Business Administration. Table of Small\n\n Business Size Standards Matched to North American Industry\n\n Classification System Codes (July 2014). Available at            \nhttp://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf (Accessed\n\n Nov. 13, 2014).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n b. Estimated Number of Affected Small Entities\n\n     Approximately 99 percent of U.S. farms in the relevant industries\n\nhttp://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf\n\n\n have annual revenues of less than $0.75 million and, therefore, fall\n\n within the SBA's definition of a small entity. The Department estimates\n\n that by 2025, there will be approximately 485 employer applications\n\n filed (not necessarily applicants) under the H-2A program for herding\n\n and the range production of livestock. The Department considers a rule\n\n to have an impact on a ``substantial number of small entities'' when\n\n the total number of small entities impacted by the rule is equal to or\n\n great than 15 percent of the relevant universe of small entities\n\n affected in a given industry (in this case, the relevant universe is\n\n the employers participating in the program). Therefore, the Department\n\n concludes the rule will have an impact on a substantial number of small\n\n entities as described by the RFA.\n\n 5. Compliance Requirements of the Final Rule, Including Reporting and\n\n Recordkeeping\n\n a. Impact on Small Businesses\n\n     The Department has estimated the incremental costs for small\n\n businesses from the baseline (i.e., the 2010 Final Rule, TEGL 32-10,\n\n and TEGL 15-06, Change 1) to this rule. We have estimated the costs of\n\n (a) the new methodology for estimating the minimum monthly AEWR\n\n employers must offer to their workers; (b) elimination of requirements\n\n to advertise in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of\n\n intended employment (cost reduction); (c) provision of meals; (d)\n\n provision of potable water; (e) provision of expanded cooking/cleaning\n\n facilities at the ranch; (f) recording and retaining records of the\n\n employees' work locations; (g) providing heating equipment; and (h)\n\n\n\n time to read and review the rule. This analysis includes the\n\n incremental cost of this rule as it adds to the requirements in the\n\n 2010 Final Rule, TEGL 32-10, and TEGL 15-6, Change 1. The cost\n\n estimates included in this analysis for the provisions of the Final\n\n Rule are consistent with those presented in the EO 12866 section.\n\n     The Department identified the following provisions of the Final\n\n Rule to have an impact to industry but was not able to quantify the\n\n impacts due to data limitations: proportion/type of work permitted at\n\n the ranch (i.e., not on the range); application filing requirements;\n\n job order submissions; job order duration; placement of workers on\n\n master applications; and employer-provided items. Thus, although the\n\n Department believes those additional costs are minor, the total cost to\n\n small entities may be higher than the total cost presented in this\n\n analysis (although we conclude the cost of other items may be\n\n overestimated).\n\n i. New Methodology for Estimating the Wages of Workers\n\n     Under the new wage determination methodology, the use of the\n\n forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 base wage times 48 hours per week and\n\n times 4.333 weeks per month to set the required monthly AEWR, with a\n\n two-year transition period, results in an increase of $1.53 in hourly\n\n wages (using the assumed 48 hours per week computation) paid to H-2A\n\n workers in 2016. The Department multiplies this average hourly wage\n\n increase by 48 hours per workweek to obtain a weekly cost per worker of\n\n\n\n $73.44 ($1.53 x 48) in 2016. The Department then multiplies this weekly\n\n cost by 50 weeks, which is the average\n\n \n\n [[Page 63057]]\n\n \n\n period of need for workers in these industries. This results in an\n\n average increased cost of $3,672.00 ($73.44 x 50) per H-2A worker in\n\n 2016. For employers hiring the average number of H-2A workers (4.2),\n\n this results in an average increased cost of $15,422.40 ($3,672 x 4.2)\n\n paid to workers in wages for 2016.\n\n     To estimate the average annual cost of increased wages paid to H-2A\n\n workers under the Final Rule's wage determination methodology, the\n\n Department first calculates the average annual assumed hourly wage\n\n increase over the period of analysis. Given the average annual assumed\n\n hourly wage increase ($2.93), a 48-hour workweek, and an average period\n\n of need for workers of 50 weeks, the Department estimates an average\n\n annual increased cost of $7,039.20 ($2.93 x 48 x 50) per H-2A worker.\n\n For employers hiring the average number of H-2A workers (4.2), this\n\n results in an average annual increased cost of $29,564.64 ($7,039.20 x\n\n 4.2) paid to workers in wages over the 10-year analysis period.\\107\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n\n     \\107\\ If the results of the FRFA, using an estimated average of\n\n 4.2 workers per employer, were multiplied times 485 (the number of\n\n employers), it would not produce identical results to the total\n\n impact results estimated in the EO 12866 analysis. As we discussed\n\n above, the Department concludes that the EO 12866 analysis produces\n\n an overestimate of the likely results, in part because that analysis\n\n was based on an assumption that all 2,481 workers for whom employers\n\n receive a labor certification enter the country each year. The FRFA\n\n uses an estimate of 4.2 workers per employer, which mirrors the\n\n estimate from the Mountain Plains 2015 telephone survey of its\n\n members and is based upon estimates from the Department's data from\n\n H-2A applications for labor certification.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     To estimate the average annual cost of increased wages paid to H-2A\n\n workers under the first wage determination methodology alternative--the\n\n forecasted ECI-adjusted cap-indexed 1994 TEGL wage with a three-year\n\n transition--the Department first calculates the average annual monthly\n\n wage increase over the period of analysis. Given the average annual\n\n monthly wage increase ($441.66), an average period of need for workers\n\n of 11.54 months,\\108\\ the Department estimates an average annual\n\n increased cost of $5,096.71 ($441.66 x 11.54) per H-2A worker. For\n\n\n\n employers hiring the average number of H-2A workers (4.2), this\n\n alternative results in an average annual increased cost of $21,406.19\n\n ($5,096.71 x 4.2) paid to workers in wages over the 10-year analysis\n\n period.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\108\\ 11.54 months are equivalent to 50 weeks.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     To estimate the average annual cost of increased wages paid to H-2A\n\n workers under the second wage determination methodology alternative--\n\n the forecasted ECI-adjusted $7.25 wage rate with a three-year\n\n transition based on a 44-hour workweek--the Department calculates the\n\n average annual hourly wage increase over the period of analysis. Given\n\n the average annual hourly wage increase ($2.28), a 44-hour workweek,\n\n and an average period of need for workers of 50 weeks, the Department\n\n estimates an average annual cost of $5,024.80 ($2.28 x 44 x 50) per H-\n\n 2A worker. For employers hiring the average number of H-2A workers\n\n (4.2), this alternative results in an average annual increased cost of\n\n $21,104.16 ($5,024.80 x 4.2) paid to workers in wages.\n\n     To estimate the average annual cost of increased wages paid to H-2A\n\n workers under the third wage determination methodology alternative--the\n\n forecasted State AEWR with food deductions based on a 65-hour\n\n\n\n workweek--the Department calculates the average annual hourly wage\n\n increase over the period of analysis. Given the average annual hourly\n\n wage increase ($8.85), a 65-hour workweek, and an average period of\n\n need for workers of 50 weeks, the Department estimates an average\n\n annual increased cost of $28,772.25 ($8.85 x 65 x 50) per H-2A worker.\n\n For employers hiring the average number of H-2A workers (4.2), this\n\n results in an average annual increased cost of $120,843.45 ($28,772.25\n\n x 4.2) paid to workers in wages.\n\n ii. Newspaper Advertisements\n\n     Through the Final Rule, the Department will expand to production of\n\n livestock occupations on the range the historical practice of waiving\n\n the regulatory requirement to place two advertisements in a newspaper\n\n serving the area of intended employment for sheepherding and goat\n\n herding occupations. This will result in a minor cost reduction. To\n\n estimate this cost reduction, the Department multiplies the number of\n\n newspaper advertisements required for each range livestock employer\n\n application (2) by the average cost of placing a newspaper\n\n advertisement ($258.64) to obtain an avoided cost of purchasing\n\n advertising space equal to $517(2 x $258.64) per range livestock\n\n employer application per year.\\109\\ The Department also estimates the\n\n labor cost required to prepare the advertisements by multiplying the\n\n number of newspaper advertisements required per open range livestock\n\n production employer (2) by the assumed time required to prepare a\n\n\n\n newspaper advertisement (0.5 hours) and the hourly compensation of a\n\n human resources (HR) manager ($78.48), which amounts to $78.48 (2 x 0.5\n\n x $78.48) in avoided labor costs per range livestock employer\n\n application per year.\\110\\ In total, this requirement will result in a\n\n cost reduction of $595.76 ($517.28 + $78.48) per application per year\n\n for employers involved in the range production of livestock.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\109\\ The newspaper advertisement cost estimate is based on an\n\n advertisement of 158 words placed in The Salt Lake Tribune for one\n\n day. Available at            http://placead.yourutahclassifieds.com/webbase/en/std/jsp/WebBaseMain.do (Accessed \nNov. 13, 2014).\n\n     \\110\\ The Department assumes estimates that range livestock\n\n production employers will spend 0.5 hours to prepare each newspaper\n\n advertisement. In addition, the Department estimates that the median\n\n hourly wage for a human resources manager is $54.88 (as published by\n\n the Department's OES survey, O*Net Online), which we increased by\n\n 1.43 to account for private-sector employee benefits (Source: Bureau\n\n of Labor Statistics) for an hourly compensation rate of $78.48.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n iii. Meals\n\n     Under the Final Rule, the Department will require H-2A employers to\n\n provide either three sufficient meals per day or free and convenient\n\n kitchen facilities and food provisions to workers. This change\n\nhttp://placead.yourutahclassifieds.com/webbase/en/std/jsp/WebBaseMain.do\n\n\n represents a cost to range livestock production employers but not to\n\n sheepherding or goat herding employers because this is already a\n\n requirement under TEGL 32-10. To estimate this cost, the Department\n\n multiplies the number of days per week workers receive meals (7) by the\n\n average daily cost of meals ($11.86) and the average duration of need\n\n in weeks (50) to obtain a cost of $4,151.00 (7 x $11.86 x 50) per range\n\n livestock production worker per year.\\111\\ For employers hiring the\n\n average number of 4.2 H-2A workers, the average annual cost increase is\n\n $17,434.20 ($4,151 x 4.2).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\111\\ The meal cost estimate of $11.86 is from Allowable Meal\n\n Charges and Reimbursements for Daily Subsistence published by the\n\n U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration\n\n (source:            http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm; accessed on July 30, 2015).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     In addition to the cost to purchase food, range livestock\n\n production employers would also incur costs to transport the food to\n\n the workers. The Department assumes that food would be transported to\n\n the workers on a weekly basis along with the potable water. The costs\n\n related to transporting food and potable water are accounted for below\n\n in the section on costs related to potable water.\n\nhttp://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/meal_travel_subsistence.cfm\n\n\n iv. Potable Water\n\n     The Final Rule requires that the herding or range livestock\n\n production employer provide to the workers adequate provision of\n\n potable water (4.5 gallons per day) for drinking and cooking, which is\n\n similar to the TEGLs' requirement. The Final Rule continues\n\n \n\n [[Page 63058]]\n\n \n\n the TEGLs' requirements for water for bathing and adds a requirement\n\n for sufficient water for laundry, although the Final Rule does not\n\n define a specific minimum quantity for these purposes. Moreover, the\n\n Final Rule allows employers to identify an alternate readily available\n\n source of water for bathing and laundry. The Department estimates the\n\n additional cost of these requirements above the baseline by summing the\n\n cost of purchasing the water, the cost of purchasing a trailer to\n\n transport the water and meals, the cost of vehicle mileage, and the\n\n labor cost of the time required to transport the water and meals to the\n\n workers.\n\n     As discussed above, in the NPRM the Department assumed that each\n\n worker required 28 gallons of water per worker per week. Several\n\n commenters stated that this was not a sufficient amount and suggested\n\n the Department use an estimate based on 4 to 4.5 gallons of potable\n\n water per day in clean and sealed containers. In the Final Rule, the\n\n Department revises this assumption to be 4.5 gallons of potable water\n\n\n\n per day, which amounts to approximately 31.5 gallons of potable water\n\n per worker per week (4.5 x 7).\n\n     The Department estimates the cost of purchasing the water by\n\n multiplying the cost per gallon of potable water ($0.005) by the number\n\n of gallons of water per worker per week (31.5) and the average duration\n\n of need in weeks (50). This calculation yields a cost of providing\n\n potable water equal to $7.88 ($0.005 x 31.5 x 50) per worker per year\n\n and $33.08 ($7.88 x 4.2) for employers hiring the average number of 4.2\n\n H-2A workers.\\112\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\112\\ The potable water cost estimate is calculated using data\n\n published in the 2014 Water and Wastewater Survey produced by the\n\n Texas Municipal League. (Source:            http://www.tml.org/surveys.\n\n Accessed Nov. 13, 2014). The estimate is based on the average cost\n\n of potable water for commercial entities in all Texas cities with a\n\n population below 2,000 using the fee for 50,000 gallons.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     The Department estimates the cost of purchasing a utility trailer\n\n to be $839.34.\\113\\ This results in a one-time cost of $839.34 for the\n\n average employer who must purchase a trailer in the first year of the\n\n rule. This value yields an average annual cost of $83.93 over the 10-\n\nhttp://www.tml.org/surveys\n\n\n year analysis period.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\113\\ The trailer cost estimate is based on the average cost for\n\n a 5 x 8 ft. utility trailer from Tractor Supply Co., Lowes, and Home\n\n Depot.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     The Department estimates the cost of vehicle mileage per employer\n\n by multiplying the average vehicle mileage cost ($0.58) by the number\n\n of miles driven to transport the potable water and meals roundtrip\n\n (100) and the average number of roundtrips per year (50).\\114\\ This\n\n calculation yields a mileage cost equal to $2,900.00 ($0.58 x 100 x 50)\n\n per employer per year.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\114\\ The cost per mile of owning and operating an automobile is\n\n based on the average costs in the DOT Bureau of Transportation\n\n Statistics. (Source:            \nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17\n.html. Accessed\n\n Nov. 13, 2014), which cites the costs presented by American\n\n Automobile Association Exchange (Source:            http://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-\ntravel/automobiles/driving-costs/ Accessed July 30,\n\n 2015).\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17.html\nhttp://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_03_17.html\nhttp://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-travel/automobiles/driving-costs/\nhttp://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-travel/automobiles/driving-costs/\n\n\n \n\n     The Department estimates the labor cost of time to transport the\n\n water and meals to workers by multiplying the average number of\n\n roundtrips required per employer (50) by the assumed time required to\n\n transport the water and meals (2.86 hours) and the hourly compensation\n\n of an agricultural worker ($13.40), which amounts to $1,916.20 (50 x\n\n 2.86 x $13.40) in labor costs per employer per year.115 116\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\115\\ The Department assumes that a roundtrip would be 100 miles\n\n and that an agricultural worker would drive at 35 mph. We divide the\n\n 100 miles by 35 mph to estimate that it would take an agricultural\n\n worker 2.86 hours to drive roundtrip (100/35).\n\n     \\116\\ The Department assumes estimates that herding and range\n\n livestock production employers will spend 2.86 hours transporting\n\n water and meals. In addition, the Department estimates that the\n\n median hourly wage for an agricultural worker is $9.37 (as published\n\n by the Department's OES survey, O*Net Online), which we increased by\n\n 1.43 to account for private-sector employee benefits (Source: Bureau\n\n of Labor Statistics) for an hourly wage rate of $13.40.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Finally, the Department sums the cost of purchasing water, the cost\n\n\n\n of purchasing a trailer to transport the water and meals, the cost of\n\n vehicle mileage, and the labor cost of the time required to transport\n\n the water and meals to the workers. This requirement will result in a\n\n cost of $5,663.42 ($7.88 + $839.34+ $2,900.00 + $1,916.20) per employer\n\n hiring only one H-2A worker during the first year of the rule. The\n\n average annual cost of this provision for employers hiring only one H-\n\n 2A worker is $4,908.01 ($7.88 + $83.93 + $2,900.00 + $1,916.20) over\n\n the 10-year analysis period. For employers hiring the average number of\n\n 4.2 H-2A workers, the first-year cost increases to $5,688.62 ($33.08 +\n\n $839.34+ $2,900.00 + $1,916.20) and the average annual cost increases\n\n to $4,933.21 ($33.01 + $83.93 + $2,900.00 + $1,916.20).\n\n v. Expanded Cooking/Cleaning Facilities\n\n     Where a worker continues to use the mobile housing that was\n\n provided by the employer for herding or production of livestock\n\n operations on the range while the worker is temporarily stationed at\n\n the ranch to perform production of livestock duties (which includes\n\n those that are closely and directly related to herding and/or the\n\n production of livestock), the Final Rule requires that the employer\n\n provide the worker with access to facilities such as toilets and\n\n showers with hot and cold water under pressure. To estimate this cost,\n\n the Department multiplies the average cost per square foot to\n\n construct/expand cleaning facilities ($270.00) by the assumed size of\n\n\n\n the facility that will be required to be constructed/expanded (150\n\n square feet). This calculation results in a one-time cost of $40,500.00\n\n ($270.00 x 150) for the average employer who must construct such a\n\n facility, which amounts to an average annual cost of $4,050.00 over the\n\n 10-year analysis period.\\117\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\117\\ The Department assumes that the average employer will\n\n require a cleaning facility of approximately 150 square feet.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n vi. Heating Equipment\n\n     In the Final Rule, as specified in Sec.  655.235, the mobile\n\n housing unit provided to workers must include operable heating\n\n equipment that supplies adequate heat for workers in locations where\n\n necessary for the health and safety of workers due to the climate. The\n\n Department estimates the average cost per portable gas heating unit is\n\n $150.00 and the propane cost to adequately supply heat for workers in\n\n locations where the temperature is expected to drop below 50 degrees\n\n Fahrenheit is $969.00 per year.\\118\\ This calculation results in the\n\n total cost of $1,119.00 ($150.00 + $969.00) for the average employer\n\n who must purchase the equipment, which amounts to an average annual\n\n cost of $984.00 ($15.00 + $969.00) over the 10-year analysis period.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n\n     \\118\\ $969.00 = $3 x 323 gallons.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n vii. Maintaining Records of Work Location\n\n     In response to comments, including from small businesses, the Final\n\n Rule modifies the NPRM's proposed recordkeeping requirements by\n\n eliminating the requirement to record hours worked when workers are not\n\n on the range and by eliminating the requirement to record the duties\n\n performed each day when workers are not on the range. The Final Rule\n\n retains only the requirement to record daily whether work was performed\n\n on the range or at the farm or ranch so that the Department can\n\n evaluate employers' compliance with the requirement that herding and\n\n range livestock workers must spend at least 50 percent of the job order\n\n period on the range.\n\n     The Department estimates the cost by multiplying the time required\n\n to prepare\n\n \n\n [[Page 63059]]\n\n \n\n and store the records by the average compensation of a human resources\n\n manager at an agricultural business. In the first year of the rule, the\n\n Department estimates that the average employer will spend approximately\n\n 6 minutes each week or approximately 5 hours a year (based on a 50 week\n\n\n\n average period of need) to prepare and store the records, which amounts\n\n to approximately $392.40 ($78.48 x 5) in labor costs per year.\\119\\ For\n\n the 485 employers, the total is 2,425 minutes (485 employers x 5\n\n minutes) per week, or 40 hours per week for recording, with an\n\n annualized reporting burden of 2,000 hours per year (40 hours per week\n\n x 50 weeks). The total recordkeeping burden for 485 employers is 485\n\n minutes (485 employers x 1 minute) per week, or 8 hours per week, with\n\n an annualized recordkeeping burden of 400 hours per year (8 hours per\n\n week x 50 weeks). When these two sums are added together, the total\n\n employer reporting and recordkeeping burden is 2,400 hours per year.\n\n Therefore, the total annual respondent hourly cost for this new\n\n reporting and recordkeeping burden placed on the employers in herding\n\n and the range production of livestock is estimated at 2,400 hours x\n\n $78.48 = $188,352 per year.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\119\\ The Department estimates that herding and range livestock\n\n production employers will spend 5 minutes each week to record and 1\n\n minute to store these records. The average period of need for an H-\n\n 2A worker is 50 weeks a year. The median hourly wage for a human\n\n resources manager is $54.88 (as published by the Department's OES\n\n survey, O*Net Online), which we multiply by 1.43 to account for\n\n private-sector employee benefits (Source: Bureau of Labor\n\n Statistics). This calculation yields an hourly labor cost of $78.48.\n\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n viii. Time to Read and Review the Final Rule\n\n     During the first year that the Final Rule would be in effect,\n\n employers involved in the herding or production of livestock on the\n\n range would need to learn about the rule provisions and the\n\n requirements necessary to remain compliant. In the first year of the\n\n rule, the Department estimates that the average small farm will spend\n\n approximately 4 hours of staff time to read and review the new rule,\n\n which amounts to approximately $313.92 ($78.48 x 4) in labor costs per\n\n employer in the first year of the rule. This amounts to an average\n\n annual cost of $31.39 ($313.92/10) over the 10-year analysis\n\n period.\\120\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\120\\ The Department estimates that employers will spend 2 hours\n\n to read the new rule. In addition, the Department estimates that the\n\n median hourly wage for a human resources manager is $54.88 (as\n\n published by the Department's OES survey, O*Net Online), which we\n\n increased by 1.43 to account for private-sector employee benefits\n\n (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) for an hourly compensation rate\n\n of $78.48.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n b. Total Cost Burden for Small Entities\n\n\n\n     The Department's calculations indicate that the total average\n\n annual cost is $39,955.64 (or 15.6 percent of annual revenues) for the\n\n average small entity employing 4.2 workers in sheepherding or goat\n\n herding occupations.\\121\\ The total average annual cost is $56,794.08\n\n (or 22.2 percent of annual revenues) for the average small entity\n\n employing 4.2 workers in range livestock production occupations.\\122\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\121\\ For illustration, the total average annual cost of\n\n $39,939.95 for the results from summing the average annual totals\n\n for the various rule requirements described above as follows:\n\n $39,939.95 = $29,565.64 + $4,933.21 + $4,050.00 + $984.00 + $392.40\n\n + $15.70.\n\n     \\122\\ For illustration, the total average annual cost of\n\n $56,778.39 results from summing the totals for the various rule\n\n requirements described above as follows: $56,778.39 = $29,564.64--\n\n $595.76 + $17,434.20 + $4,933.21 + $4,050.00 + $984.00 + $392.40 +\n\n $15.70.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     For small entities that apply for one worker instead of 4.2--\n\n representing the smallest of the small farms that hire workers--the\n\n Department estimates that the total average annual cost of the rule is\n\n $17,405.00 (or 6.8 percent of annual revenues) for entities employing a\n\n\n\n worker in a sheepherding or goat herding occupation.\\123\\ The\n\n Department estimates that the total average annual cost of the rule is\n\n $20,960.24 (or 8.2 percent of annual revenues) for small entities\n\n applying for one worker in a range livestock production\n\n occupation.\\124\\\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\123\\ For illustration, the total average annual cost of\n\n $17,389.31 results from summing the totals for the various rule\n\n requirements described above as follows: $17,389.31 = $7,039.20 +\n\n $4,908.01 + $4,050.00 + $984.00 + $392.40 + $15.70.\n\n     \\124\\ For illustration, the total average annual cost of\n\n $20,944.55 results from summing the totals for the various rule\n\n requirements described above as follows: $20,944.55 = $7,039.20-\n\n $595.76+ $4,151 + $4,908.02 + $4,050.00 + $984.00 + $392.40 +\n\n $15.70.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Exhibit 28 presents a summary of the average annual cost per\n\n employer. The Department focuses on the average annual cost of the rule\n\n rather than costs in the first year because the wage methodology\n\n increases the costs of compliance over the analysis time period. The\n\n total cost per employer varies depending on whether the employer is a\n\n sheepherding or goat herding employer or a range livestock production\n\n\n\n employer. The Department defines a ``significant economic impact'' as\n\n an impact that amounts to at least three percent of annual revenues.\n\n Due primarily to the increase in wages paid to H-2A workers, the\n\n proposed rule is expected to have a significant economic impact on\n\n affected small entities. The average annual costs reflected in Exhibit\n\n 28 are an overestimate for most employers as they would apply only to\n\n an employer who must bear all the possible costs, including purchasing\n\n a trailer to deliver water, constructing a cleaning facility, and\n\n purchasing portable heating equipment. Because those costs apply to\n\n only a small percentage of the participating employers, the actual\n\n average annual cost for most employers will be substantially less than\n\n the cost shown.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63060]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.035\n\n \n\n c. Alternatives to the Final Rule\n\n     The Department has considered three alternatives to the wage\n\n methodology contained in the Final Rule, in which the monthly AEWR is\n\n based on the current FLSA minimum hourly wage as a starting point\n\n (i.e., the $7.25 hourly wage rate), the forecasted ECI for wages and\n\n salaries as published by the BLS applied beginning in year two, a 48-\n\n hour workweek, 4.333 weeks per month, and is introduced over a two-year\n\n transition period with full implementation in year three. Those three\n\n\n\n alternatives are: (1) To base the monthly AEWR on the 1994 TEGL wages\n\n ($800) adjusted to the 2014 monthly wage using the ECI capped at 2.5\n\n percent, the forecasted annual ECI for wages and salaries values\n\n applied to the estimated 2014 monthly wage, and to introduce it over a\n\n three-year transition period with full implementation in year four; (2)\n\n to base the monthly AEWR on the FLSA minimum hourly wage, the\n\n forecasted ECI for wages and salaries values applied beginning in year\n\n five, a 44-hour workweek, and to introduce over a three-year transition\n\n period with full implementation in year four; and (3) to base the\n\n monthly AEWR on forecasted hourly AEWRs for combined field and\n\n livestock workers by state, a 65-hour workweek, with full\n\n implementation in year one, incorporating a monthly food deduction\n\n estimate, which is adjusted by the average CPI-U over 2012 to 2014.\n\n     The Department believes that the option adopted in the Final Rule\n\n will most effectively enable the Department to meet its statutory\n\n obligations to determine that there are not sufficient workers\n\n available to perform the labor or services requested, and that the\n\n employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and\n\n working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed\n\n before the admission of foreign workers is permitted, given these\n\n occupations and their unique characteristics that have historically\n\n resulted in a limited number of U.S. workers interested in performing\n\n these jobs. The new wage methodology will begin to address immediately\n\n\n\n the wage stagnation concerns discussed earlier.\n\n     Exhibit 29 presents a summary of the average annual cost per\n\n employer for the Final Rule, the NPRM, and the three alternatives. The\n\n Final Rule and three alternatives vary only due to their respective\n\n revised wage determination methodologies. Note that the average annual\n\n cost per employer for the NPRM is in 2013 dollars and did not include\n\n annual costs associated with earnings records or heating equipment. In\n\n each case, the total cost per employer varies depending on whether the\n\n employer is a sheepherding or goat herding employer or a range\n\n livestock production employer.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63061]]\n\n \n\n [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC15.036\n\n \n\n \n\n [[Page 63062]]\n\n \n\n \n\n     The Department estimated the total cost burden on small entities\n\n for each of the alternatives as follows.\n\n i.

Steps Taken To Minimize the Economic Impact on Small Entities\n\n     This Final Rule will have a significant economic impact on a\n\n substantial number of small entities. We recognize the concerns\n\n expressed by small businesses and have made every effort to minimize\n\n the burden on all users to the extent consistent with DOL's obligations\n\n under the INA. The Department's responsibilities under the INA,\n\n however, severely constrain our ability to make adjustments to program\n\n requirements in an effort to address concerns unique to small business.\n\n The Department's mandate under the H-2A program is to set requirements\n\n for employers who wish to recruit and hire foreign agricultural\n\n workers. Those standards are designed to provide both that foreign\n\n workers are hired only if qualified domestic workers are not available\n\n and that bringing in H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages\n\n and working conditions of similarly employed domestic workers. These\n\n regulations set those standards for range herding occupations. To\n\n create different and likely lower standards for small businesses would\n\n essentially sanction the very adverse effect that the Department is\n\n compelled to prevent. The need for parity among employers regardless of\n\n size is illuminated by the fact that Congress within the INA carved out\n\n a specific dispensation for small businesses in a specific area of the\n\n statute. Section 218(c)(3)(B)(ii) of the INA (8 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n 1188(c)(3)(B)(ii)) exempts certain small businesses from the\n\n application of the 50-percent rule regarding the period that priority\n\n hiring rights for U.S. applicants exist. Where Congress has so clearly\n\n demonstrated its ability to modify H-2A program requirements to\n\n accommodate small businesses, it would be inappropriate and outside of\n\n the Secretary's authority for the Department to carve out additional\n\n exceptions. Moreover, because commenters indicated that more than 99\n\n percent of sheep operations in the United States qualify as small\n\n businesses under the SBA definition, there is no basis for considering\n\n special relief for small businesses.\n\n     As previously discussed, after considering the comments, DOL\n\n determines that it is appropriate and consistent with the Department's\n\n obligation to protect against adverse effect to U.S. workers to set the\n\n monthly AEWR for these occupations by borrowing the current federal\n\n minimum wage of $7.25/hour, multiplied by an estimated 48 hours per\n\n week, and adjusted annually based on the ECI. In reaching this result,\n\n DOL concludes that the wage source proposed in the NPRM was likely to\n\n result in adverse effect to U.S. workers by causing a substantial\n\n number of herding employers to close or significantly downsize their\n\n operations. In addition to other reasons discussed fully above, we\n\n conclude that $7.25/hour is an appropriate starting point to set the\n\n monthly rate because the persistent lack of workers in these herding\n\n occupations is likely due in part to the reality that U.S. workers can\n\n\n\n earn at least the federal minimum wage elsewhere. We use the uncapped\n\n ECI to adjust wages beginning in year two to require that wages in\n\n these occupations continue to rise apace with wages across the U.S.\n\n economy and adopt an estimate of 48 hours worked per week, a\n\n calculation from data reported on Form ETA-9142A, because it is the\n\n most comprehensive and detailed data source from which to establish an\n\n hourly calculation. In light of the scope of the increase and the\n\n economic data provided by commenters, discussed above, a transition\n\n period to the new wage is needed. Recognizing that any transition must\n\n not be longer than necessary to prevent adverse effect, we adopt a two-\n\n year transition with full implementation in year three. As noted above,\n\n the Final Rule does not provide any different wage or implementation\n\n period for small businesses, as virtually all employers subject to the\n\n Rule are small businesses. However, we believe that the Final Rule's\n\n monthly AEWR methodology (which was modeled on one of the methodologies\n\n suggested by the three leading industry representatives), together with\n\n the other changes made in the Final Rule, such as those relating to the\n\n definition of the ``range'' and the deletion of the 20 percent cap on\n\n incidental work at the ranch, will allow small businesses to continue\n\n to participate successfully in the program.\n\n     In addition to the wage methodology adopted, DOL considered several\n\n significant alternative methodologies for setting the monthly AEWR.\n\n First, we considered setting the monthly wage rate based on the 1994\n\n TEGL wages adjusted based on the capped ECI, with a three-year\n\n transition and full implementation in year four as recommended by\n\n\n\n Mountain Plains, Western Range, and many others including individual\n\n small employers. As discussed further above, we do not adopt this\n\n recommendation because it is premised on a misunderstanding of the 1994\n\n data in the NPRM. Further, given the absence of any data to assess an\n\n appropriate year and wage rate to index, and what many commenters\n\n characterize as the persistent lack of U.S. workers in these\n\n occupations for decades, we are concerned that continued reliance on\n\n the TEGL wages, even in indexed form, could be inconsistent with DOL's\n\n obligation to protect against adverse effect on U.S. workers. In\n\n addition, capping the ECI as recommended by commenters would lead to\n\n further wage stagnation.\n\n     Second, we considered setting the monthly AEWR by borrowing the\n\n current federal minimum wage rate of $7.25/hour and multiplying it by\n\n 44 hours per week, with a three-year transition and full implementation\n\n in year four, using the capped ECI to adjust wages after year four as\n\n recommended by Mountain Plains, Western Range and many individual small\n\n employers. As discussed fully above, we have adopted the $7.25 rate\n\n from this recommendation as the starting point, but have used a 48-hour\n\n estimate rather than a 44-hour estimate so that the hourly estimate is\n\n based on the most comprehensive data source available. Recognizing that\n\n any transition must not be longer than necessary to prevent adverse\n\n effect, this Final Rule requires a two-year transition, rather than the\n\n three-year transition recommended by these commenters.\n\n     Third, we considered setting the monthly wage rate using the FLS-\n\n\n\n based AEWR, multiplied by a compromise number of weekly hours (65)\n\n between the data submitted by workers from the Colorado Legal Services\n\n survey, which found that 62 percent of herders worked at least 81 hours\n\n per week, and the 48-hour estimate from the Form ETA-9142A data. This\n\n option would have been implemented immediately and permitted a food\n\n deduction. As discussed above, DOL did not elect to use the FLS-based\n\n AEWR to set the monthly wage rate because we conclude that the FLS-\n\n based methodology is likely to cause adverse effect to U.S. workers by\n\n causing a substantial number of herding employers to close or\n\n significantly downsize their operations--leaving fewer herding jobs\n\n available to U.S. workers and creating significant economic\n\n dislocation. We do not adopt a 65-hour threshold because this Final\n\n Rule relies only on the Form ETA-9142A data, the most comprehensive and\n\n detailed data source from which to establish an hourly calculation,\n\n rather than the calculation based on worker data in a single state.\n\n Finally, we do not require immediate implementation because we conclude\n\n that a brief transition period is needed for the reasons discussed\n\n above.\n\n \n\n [[Page 63064]]\n\n \n\n C. Unfunded Mandates Reform\n\n \n\n     Executive Order 12875--This Final Rule will not create an unfunded\n\n\n\n Federal mandate upon any State, local or tribal government.\n\n Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n     Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C.\n\n 1531) directs agencies to assess the effects of Federal regulatory\n\n actions on State, local, and Tribal governments, and the private\n\n sector. This Final Rule has no Federal mandate, which is defined in 2\n\n U.S.C. 658(6) to include either a ``Federal intergovernmental mandate''\n\n or a ``Federal private sector mandate.'' A Federal mandate is any\n\n provision in a regulation that imposes an enforceable duty upon State,\n\n local, or Tribal governments, or imposes a duty upon the private sector\n\n which is not voluntary. A decision by a private entity to obtain an H-\n\n 2A worker is purely voluntary and is, therefore, excluded from any\n\n reporting requirement under the Act.\n\n     The SWAs are mandated to perform certain activities for the Federal\n\n Government under this program, and are compensated for the resources\n\n used in performing these activities.\n\n     This Final Rule includes no new mandates for the SWAs in the H-2A\n\n application process and does not include any Federal mandate that may\n\n result in increased expenditures by State, local, and tribal\n\n governments, in the aggregate, of $100 million or more. It also does\n\n not result in increased expenditures by the private sector of $100\n\n million or more, because participation in the H-2A program is entirely\n\n voluntary. SWA activities under the H-2A program are currently funded\n\n by the Department through grants provided under the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\n 29 U.S.C. 49 et seq. The Department anticipates continuing funding\n\n\n\n under the Wagner-Peyser Act. As a result of this Final Rule, the\n\n Department will analyze the amounts of such grants made available to\n\n each State to fund the activities of the SWAs.\n\n \n\n D. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n \n\n     The Department has determined that this Final Rule will impose a\n\n significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities\n\n under the RFA; therefore, the Department will be required to produce a\n\n Compliance Guide for Small Entities as mandated by SBREFA. The\n\n Department has concluded that this Final Rule is not a major rule\n\n requiring review by the Congress under SBREFA because it will not\n\n likely result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million\n\n or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,\n\n individual industries, Federal, State or local Government agencies, or\n\n geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,\n\n employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of\n\n U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in\n\n domestic or export markets.\n\n \n\n E. The Congressional Review Act\n\n \n\n     The Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) requires rules\n\n to be submitted to Congress before taking effect. We will submit to\n\n Congress and the Comptroller General of the United States a report\n\n\n\n regarding the issuance of this Final Rule prior to its effective date,\n\n as required by 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1).\n\n \n\n F. Executive Order 13132--Federalism\n\n \n\n     The Department has reviewed this Final Rule in accordance with E.O.\n\n 13132 regarding federalism and has determined that it does not have\n\n federalism implications. The Final Rule does not have substantial\n\n direct effects on States, on the relationship between the States, or on\n\n the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels\n\n of Government as described by E.O. 13132. Therefore, the Department has\n\n determined that this Final Rule will not have a sufficient federalism\n\n implication to warrant the preparation of a summary impact statement.\n\n \n\n G. Executive Order 13175--Indian Tribal Governments\n\n \n\n     This Final Rule was reviewed under the terms of E.O. 13175 and\n\n determined not to have Tribal implications. The Final Rule does not\n\n have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, on the\n\n relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on\n\n the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal\n\n Government and Indian Tribes. As a result, no Tribal summary impact\n\n statement has been prepared.\n\n \n\n H. Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families\n\n\n\n \n\n     Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations\n\n Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency\n\n Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat.\n\n 2681) requires the Department to assess the impact of this NPRM on\n\n family well-being. A rule that is determined to have a negative effect\n\n on families must be supported with an adequate rationale. The\n\n Department has assessed this Final Rule and determines that it will not\n\n have a negative effect on families.\n\n \n\n I. Executive Order 12630--Government Actions and Interference With\n\n Constitutionally Protected Property Rights\n\n \n\n     This Final Rule is not subject to E.O. 12630, Governmental Actions\n\n and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,\n\n because it does not involve implementation of a policy with takings\n\n implications.\n\n \n\n J. Executive Order 12988--Civil Justice\n\n \n\n     This Final Rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with\n\n E.O. 12988, Civil Justice Reform, and will not unduly burden the\n\n Federal court system. The regulation has been written to minimize\n\n litigation and provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct, and\n\n has been reviewed carefully to eliminate drafting errors and\n\n\n\n ambiguities.\n\n \n\n K. Plain Language\n\n \n\n     The Department drafted this Final Rule in plain language.\n\n \n\n L. Executive Order 13211--Energy Supply\n\n \n\n     This Final Rule is not subject to E.O. 13211. It will not have a\n\n significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of\n\n energy.\n\n \n\n M. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n \n\n     As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent\n\n burden, the Department of Labor (the Department) conducts a\n\n preclearance consultation process to provide the general public and\n\n Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and\n\n continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork\n\n Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)).\n\n     This helps to ensure that the public understands the Department's\n\n collection instructions; respondents can provide the requested data and\n\n in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources)\n\n is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the\n\n Department can properly assess the impact of collection requirements on\n\n\n\n respondents. Persons are not required to respond to a collection of\n\n information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number as\n\n required in 5 CFR 1320.11(l).\n\n     The information collected is mandated in this Final Rule at Sec.  \n\n 655.210(f). The Department did not create a specific form for this new\n\n \n\n [[Page 63065]]\n\n \n\n collection requirement. The Final Rule requires that employers keep\n\n daily records indicating the site of the employee's work, whether it\n\n was on the open range or on the ranch or farm. Any absences from work\n\n for which the employer prorates a worker's monthly wage pursuant to\n\n section 655.210(g)(2) must include the reason for the worker's absence.\n\n Such records will enable the employer, and the Department, if\n\n necessary, to determine whether the worker performed work on the range\n\n at least 50 percent of the days during the contract period.\n\n     In accordance with the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501, information collection\n\n requirements that must be implemented as a result of this regulation\n\n must receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\n Therefore, a clearance package containing the new requirements was\n\n submitted to OMB on April 15, 2015 as part of the proposed rule for the\n\n hiring of foreign workers in the H-2A program for herding or production\n\n of livestock on the open range in the United States under OMB Control\n\n\n\n Number 1205-0519. The public was given 60 days to comment on this\n\n information collection. OMB filed a comment asking the Department to\n\n resubmit the information collection at the final rule stage after\n\n considering public comments on the NPRM. The Department did resubmit\n\n the package prior to publication of this Final Rule. As of publication\n\n of this rule, OMB has not approved the information collection under OMB\n\n control number 1205-0519. No person is required to respond to a\n\n collection of information request unless the collection of the\n\n information has a valid OMB control number and expiration date.\n\n Therefore, until the Department publishes a Federal Register notice\n\n informing the public of the approval by OMB and the expiration date of\n\n the information collection, the affected parties do not have to comply\n\n with this information collection.\n\n     The Department received more than fifty comments about the new\n\n recordkeeping requirement as described in the NPRM. Forty seven of the\n\n comments opposed the new requirement and four supported the\n\n requirement. Many of those who opposed the new requirement\n\n misunderstood the requirement and thought that employers would need to\n\n keep hourly logs. In actuality, the logs only needed to reflect days on\n\n the range; and on those days when an employee worked on the ranch or\n\n farm, the employer needed to write down the number of hours worked and\n\n a description of the duties performed. The duties did not need to be\n\n accounted for by hour and minutes. Those who agreed with the new\n\n requirement thought the burden was minimal.\n\n     However, in light of these and other comments, and as discussed\n\n\n\n above in Sec. IV.B.2.e. of the preamble related to Sec.  655.210(f),\n\n the Department has decided to change this requirement in the Final\n\n Rule. Employers will now only be required to notate whether employees\n\n spend days on the ranch or on the range and the reason for any prorated\n\n salary paid.\n\n     This information collection in this Final Rule creates an\n\n associated paperwork burden on the employers that must be assessed\n\n under the PRA. Based on the average number of employers filing\n\n applications for H-2A workers to perform herding work filed with the\n\n Department in 2013 and 2014, the Department estimates that the\n\n information collection will affect 485 employers employing foreign\n\n sheepherders, goat herders, and other workers engaged in the open range\n\n production of livestock. The Department further estimates that it will\n\n take each employer, on average, 5 minutes each week to prepare\n\n timesheets for its employees, and 1 minute each week to store these\n\n timesheets. Thus, the reporting burden for 485 employers is 2,425\n\n minutes (485 employers x 5 minutes) per week, or approximately 40 hours\n\n per week. When annualized, the total reporting burden is 2,000 hours\n\n per year (40 hours per week x 50 weeks). The total record keeping\n\n burden for 485 employers is 485 minutes (485 employers x 1 minute) per\n\n week, or 8 hours per week. When annualized, the total recordkeeping\n\n burden is 400 hours per year (8 hours per week x 50 weeks). When these\n\n two sums are added together, the total employer reporting and\n\n recordkeeping burden is 2,400 hours per year.\n\n     When estimating the cost burden of paperwork requirements, the\n\n\n\n Department used the average salary of a Human Resources Manager based\n\n on the national cross-industry mean hourly wage rate for a Human\n\n Resources Manager ($54.88), from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau\n\n of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics survey wage\n\n data,\\137\\ and increased by a factor of 1.43 to account for employee\n\n benefits and other compensation, for a total hourly cost of $78.48.\n\n This number was multiplied by the total hourly annual burden created\n\n for this new requirement, which, as noted above, is 2,400 hours per\n\n year. The total annual respondent hourly costs for this new burden\n\n placed on the employers in the sheepherding and open range production\n\n of livestock is estimated as follows:\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     \\137\\ Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational\n\n Employment Statistics: May 2014 National Occupational Employment and\n\n Wage Estimates; Management Occupations.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n     Total burden cost of this provision is 2,400 hours x $78.48 =\n\n $188,352 per year. The total costs other than the time associated with\n\n the information collections required under this Final Rule, as defined\n\n by the PRA, are zero dollars per employer.\n\n     As noted above, this collection of information is subject to the\n\n PRA. Accordingly, this information collection in this Final Rule has\n\n been submitted to OMB for review under 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) of the PRA.\n\n\n\n For an additional explanation of how the Department calculated the\n\n burden hours and related costs, the PRA package for this information\n\n collection (OMB Control Number 1205-0519) can be obtained from the\n\n RegInfo.gov Web site at            http://www.reginfo.gov/public/dol/pramain or by\n\n contacting the Department at Office of Policy Development and Research,\n\n U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC\n\n 20210 or by phone request to 202-693-3700 (this is not a toll-free\n\n number) or by email at DOL_PRA_PUBLIC@dol.gov\n\n Overview of the Information Collection\n\n     Type of Review: New Collection.\n\n     Agency: Employment and Training Administration.\n\n     Title: H-2A Sheepherder Recordkeeping Requirement.\n\n     OMB Number: 1205-0519.\n\n     Affected Public: Farm businesses.\n\n     Form(s): None.\n\n     Total Annual Respondents: 485.\n\n     Annual Frequency: Weekly (50 weeks).\n\n     Total Annual Responses: 242,250.\n\n     Average Time per Response: 6 minutes.\n\n     Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 2,400 hours per year.\n\n     Total Annual Start-up/Capital/Maintenance Costs for Respondents:\n\n $0.\n\n \n\n List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 655\n\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/dol/pramain\nmailto:DOL_PRA_PUBLIC@dol.gov\n\n\n \n\n     Administrative practice and procedure, Employment, Employment and\n\n training, Enforcement, Foreign workers, Forest and forest products,\n\n Fraud, Health professions, Immigration, Labor, Passports and visas,\n\n Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Unemployment,\n\n Wages, Working conditions.\n\n \n\n     For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Department of Labor\n\n amends 20 CFR part 655 as follows:\n\n \n\n [[Page 63066]]\n\n \n\n PART 655--TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS IN THE UNITED\n\n STATES\n\n \n\n 0\n\n 1.

The purpose of Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 is to\n\n establish certain procedures for employers who apply to the Department\n\n of Labor to obtain labor certifications to hire temporary agricultural\n\n foreign workers to perform herding or production of livestock on the\n\n range, as defined in Sec.  655.201. Unless otherwise specified in\n\n Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235, employers whose job opportunities meet the\n\n qualifying criteria under Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 must fully comply\n\n with all of the requirements of Sec. Sec.  655.100-655.185; part 653,\n\n\n\n subparts B and F; and part 654 of this chapter.\n\n     (b) Jobs subject to Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235. These procedures\n\n apply to job opportunities with the following unique characteristics:\n\n     (1) The work activities involve the herding or production of\n\n livestock (which includes work that is closely and directly related to\n\n herding and/or the production of livestock), as defined under Sec.  \n\n 655.201;\n\n     (2) The work is performed on the range for the majority (meaning\n\n more than 50 percent) of the workdays in the work contract period. Any\n\n additional work performed at a place other than the range must\n\n constitute the production of livestock (which includes work that is\n\n closely and directly related to herding and/or the production of\n\n livestock); and\n\n     (3) The work activities generally require the workers to be on call\n\n 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.201  Definition of herding and range livestock terms.\n\n \n\n     The following are terms that are not defined in Sec. Sec.  655.100-\n\n 655.185 and are specific to applications for labor certifications\n\n involving the herding or production of livestock on the range.\n\n     Herding. Activities associated with the caring, controlling,\n\n feeding, gathering, moving, tending, and sorting of livestock on the\n\n range.\n\n\n\n     Livestock. An animal species or species group such as sheep,\n\n cattle, goats, horses, or other domestic hooved animals. In the context\n\n of Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235, livestock refers to those species raised\n\n on the range.\n\n     Production of livestock. The care or husbandry of livestock\n\n throughout one or more seasons during the year, including guarding and\n\n protecting livestock from predatory animals and poisonous plants;\n\n feeding, fattening, and watering livestock; examining livestock to\n\n detect diseases, illnesses, or other injuries; administering medical\n\n care to sick or injured livestock; applying vaccinations and spraying\n\n insecticides on the range; and assisting with the breeding, birthing,\n\n raising, weaning, castration, branding, and general care of livestock.\n\n This term also includes duties performed off the range that are closely\n\n and directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock. The\n\n following are non-exclusive examples of ranch work that is closely and\n\n directly related: repairing fences used to contain the herd; assembling\n\n lambing jugs; cleaning out lambing jugs; feeding and caring for the\n\n dogs that the workers use on the range to assist with herding or\n\n guarding the flock; feeding and caring for the horses that the workers\n\n use on the range to help with herding or to move the sheep camps and\n\n supplies; and loading animals into livestock trucks for movement to the\n\n range or to market. The following are examples of ranch work that is\n\n not closely and directly related: working at feedlots; planting,\n\n irrigating and harvesting crops; operating or repairing heavy\n\n\n\n equipment; constructing wells or dams; digging irrigation ditches;\n\n applying weed control; cutting trees or chopping wood; constructing or\n\n repairing the bunkhouse or other ranch buildings; and delivering\n\n supplies from the ranch to the herders on the range.\n\n     Range. The range is any area located away from the ranch\n\n headquarters used by the employer. The following factors are indicative\n\n of the range: it involves land that is uncultivated; it involves wide\n\n expanses of land, such as thousands of acres; it is located in a\n\n remote, isolated area; and typically range housing is required so that\n\n the herder can be in constant attendance to the herd. No one factor is\n\n controlling and the totality of the circumstances is considered in\n\n determining what should be considered range. The range does not include\n\n feedlots, corrals, or any area where the stock involved would be near\n\n ranch headquarters. Ranch headquarters, which is a place where the\n\n business of the ranch occurs and is often where the owner resides, is\n\n limited and does not embrace large acreage; it only includes the\n\n ranchhouse, barns, sheds, pen, bunkhouse, cookhouse, and other\n\n buildings in the vicinity. The range also does not include any area\n\n where a herder is not required to be available constantly to attend to\n\n the livestock and to perform tasks, including but not limited to,\n\n ensuring the livestock do not stray, protecting them from predators,\n\n and monitoring their health.\n\n     Range housing. Range housing is housing located on the range that\n\n meets the standards articulated under Sec.  655.235.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n Sec.  655.205  Herding and range livestock job orders.\n\n \n\n     The employer whose job opportunity has been determined to qualify\n\n for these procedures, whether individual, association, or H-2ALC, is\n\n not required to comply with the job order filing requirements in Sec.  \n\n 655.121(a) through (d). Rather, the employer must submit\n\n \n\n [[Page 63067]]\n\n \n\n Form ETA-790, directly to the National Processing Center (NPC)\n\n designated by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC\n\n Administrator) along with a completed H-2A Application for Temporary\n\n Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A, as required in Sec.  655.215.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.210  Contents of job herding and range livestock orders.\n\n \n\n     (a) Content of job offers. Unless otherwise specified in Sec. Sec.  \n\n 655.200-655.235, the employer, whether individual, association, or H-\n\n 2ALC, must satisfy the requirements for job orders established under\n\n Sec.  655.121(e) and for the content of job offers established under\n\n part 653, subpart F of this chapter and Sec.  655.122.\n\n     (b) Job qualifications and requirements. The job offer must include\n\n a statement that the workers are on call for up to 24 hours per day, 7\n\n\n\n days per week and that the workers spend the majority (meaning more\n\n than 50 percent) of the workdays during the contract period in the\n\n herding or production of livestock on the range. Duties may include\n\n activities performed off the range only if such duties constitute the\n\n production of livestock (which includes work that is closely and\n\n directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock). All\n\n such duties must be specifically disclosed on the job order. The job\n\n offer may also specify that applicants must possess up to 6 months of\n\n experience in similar occupations involving the herding or production\n\n of livestock on the range and require reference(s) for the employer to\n\n verify applicant experience. An employer may specify other appropriate\n\n job qualifications and requirements for its job opportunity. Job offers\n\n may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or obligations that\n\n will not be imposed on the employer's H-2A workers engaged in herding\n\n or the production of livestock on the range. Any such requirements must\n\n be applied equally to both U.S. and foreign workers. Each job\n\n qualification and requirement listed in the job offer must be bona\n\n fide, and the Certifying Officer (CO) may require the employer to\n\n submit documentation to substantiate the appropriateness of any other\n\n job qualifications and requirements specified in the job offer.\n\n     (c) Range housing. The employer must specify in the job order that\n\n range housing will be provided. The range housing must meet the\n\n requirements set forth in Sec.  655.235.\n\n\n\n     (d) Employer-provided items. (1) The employer must provide to the\n\n worker, without charge or deposit charge, all tools, supplies, and\n\n equipment required by law, by the employer, or by the nature of the\n\n work to perform the duties assigned in the job offer safely and\n\n effectively. The employer must specify in the job order which items it\n\n will provide to the worker.\n\n     (2) Because of the unique nature of the herding or production of\n\n livestock on the range, this equipment must include effective means of\n\n communicating with persons capable of responding to the worker's needs\n\n in case of an emergency including, but not limited to, satellite\n\n phones, cell phones, wireless devices, radio transmitters, or other\n\n types of electronic communication systems. The employer must specify in\n\n the job order:\n\n     (i) The type(s) of electronic communication device(s) and that such\n\n device(s) will be provided without charge or deposit charge to the\n\n worker during the entire period of employment; and\n\n     (ii) If there are periods of time when the workers are stationed in\n\n locations where electronic communication devices may not operate\n\n effectively, the employer must specify in the job order, the means and\n\n frequency with which the employer plans to make contact with the\n\n workers to monitor the worker's well-being. This contact must include\n\n either arrangements for the workers to be located, on a regular basis,\n\n in geographic areas where the electronic communication devices operate\n\n\n\n effectively, or arrangements for regular, pre-scheduled, in-person\n\n visits between the workers and the employer, which may include visits\n\n between the workers and other persons designated by the employer to\n\n resupply the workers' camp.\n\n     (e) Meals. The employer must specify in the job offer and provide\n\n to the worker, without charge or deposit charge:\n\n     (1) Either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient\n\n cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the worker\n\n to prepare his own meals. To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or\n\n food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins, and\n\n minerals; and\n\n     (2) Adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered\n\n potable and the means to do so. Standards governing the provision of\n\n water to range workers are also addressed in Sec.  655.235(e).\n\n     (f) Hours and earnings statements. (1) The employer must keep\n\n accurate and adequate records with respect to the worker's earnings and\n\n furnish to the worker on or before each payday a statement of earnings.\n\n The employer is exempt from recording the hours actually worked each\n\n day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the\n\n nature and amount of work performed, but all other regulatory\n\n requirements in Sec.  655.122(j) and (k) apply.\n\n     (2) The employer must keep daily records indicating whether the\n\n\n\n site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range. If the\n\n employer prorates a worker's wage pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this\n\n section because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons,\n\n it must also keep a record of the reason for the worker's absence.\n\n     (g) Rates of pay. The employer must pay the worker at least the\n\n monthly AEWR, as specified in Sec.  655.211, the agreed-upon collective\n\n bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or\n\n State law or judicial action, in effect at the time work is performed,\n\n whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or\n\n portion thereof.\n\n     (1) The offered wage shall not be based on commissions, bonuses, or\n\n other incentives, unless the employer guarantees a wage that equals or\n\n exceeds the monthly AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage,\n\n or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or\n\n judicial action, or any agreed-upon collective bargaining rate,\n\n whichever is highest, and must be paid to each worker free and clear\n\n without any unauthorized deductions.\n\n     (2) The employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay\n\n periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the\n\n beginning or ending dates of the job order. The employer also may\n\n prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for\n\n personal reasons.\n\n     (h) Frequency of pay. The employer must state in the job offer the\n\n\n\n frequency with which the worker will be paid, which must be at least\n\n twice monthly. Employers must pay wages when due.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.211  Herding and range livestock wage rate.\n\n \n\n     (a) Compliance with rates of pay. (1) To comply with its obligation\n\n under Sec.  655.210(g), an employer must offer, advertise in its\n\n recruitment and pay each worker employed under Sec. Sec.  655.200-\n\n 655.235 a wage that is the highest of the monthly AEWR established\n\n under this section, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the\n\n applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial\n\n action.\n\n     (2) If the monthly AEWR established under this section is adjusted\n\n during a work contract, and is higher than both the agreed-upon\n\n collective bargaining\n\n \n\n [[Page 63068]]\n\n \n\n wage and the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or\n\n judicial action in effect at the time the work is performed, the\n\n employer must pay that adjusted monthly AEWR upon publication by the\n\n Department in the Federal Register.\n\n     (b) Publication of the monthly AEWR. The OFLC Administrator will\n\n publish a notice in the Federal Register, at least once in each\n\n\n\n calendar year, on a date to be determined by the OFLC Administrator,\n\n establishing the monthly AEWR.\n\n     (c) Monthly AEWR Rate. (1) The monthly AEWR shall be $7.25\n\n multiplied by 48 hours, and then multiplied by 4.333 weeks per month;\n\n and\n\n     (2) Beginning for calendar year 2017, the monthly AEWR shall be\n\n adjusted annually based on the Employment Cost Index for wages and\n\n salaries published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (ECI) for the\n\n preceding October--October period.\n\n     (d) Transition Rates. (1) For the period from the effective date of\n\n this rule through calendar year 2016, the Department shall set the\n\n monthly AEWR at 80% of the result of the formula in paragraph (c) of\n\n this section.\n\n     (2) For calendar year 2017, the Department shall set the monthly\n\n AEWR at 90% of the result of the formula in paragraph (c) of this\n\n section.\n\n     (3) For calendar year 2018 and beyond, the Department shall set the\n\n monthly AEWR at 100% of the result of the formula in paragraph (c) of\n\n this section.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.215  Procedures for filing herding and range livestock\n\n applications for temporary employment certification.\n\n \n\n     (a) Compliance with Sec. Sec.  655.130-655.132. Unless otherwise\n\n\n\n specified in Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235, the employer must satisfy the\n\n requirements for filing an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment\n\n Certification with the NPC designated by the OFLC Administrator as\n\n required under Sec. Sec.  655.130-655.132.\n\n     (b) What to file. An employer must file a completed H-2A\n\n Application for Temporary Employment Certification (Form ETA-9142A),\n\n Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order (Form ETA-790), and an\n\n attachment identifying, with as much geographic specificity as possible\n\n for each farmer/rancher, the names, physical locations and estimated\n\n start and end dates of need where work will be performed under the job\n\n order.\n\n     (1) The H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification and\n\n Form ETA-790 may be filed by an individual employer, association, or an\n\n H-2ALC, covering multiple areas of intended employment and more than\n\n two contiguous States.\n\n     (2) The period of need identified on the H-2A Application for\n\n Temporary Employment Certification and job order for range sheep or\n\n goat herding or production occupations must be no more than 364\n\n calendar days. The period of need identified on the H-2A Application\n\n for Temporary Employment Certification and job order for range herding\n\n or production of cattle, horses, or other domestic hooved livestock,\n\n except sheep and goats, must be for no more than 10 months.\n\n     (3) An association of agricultural employers filing as a joint\n\n employer may submit a single Form ETA-790 and master H-2A Application\n\n for Temporary Employment Certification on behalf of its employer-\n\n\n\n members located in more than two contiguous States with different start\n\n dates of need. Unless modifications to a sheep or goat herding or\n\n production of livestock job order are required by the CO or requested\n\n by the employer, pursuant to Sec.  655.121(e), the association is not\n\n required to re-submit the Form ETA-790 during the calendar year with\n\n its H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.220  Processing herding and range livestock applications for\n\n temporary employment certification.\n\n \n\n     (a) NPC Review. Unless otherwise specified in Sec. Sec.  655.200-\n\n 655.235, the CO will review and process the H-2A Application for\n\n Temporary Employment Certification and the Form ETA-790 in accordance\n\n with the requirements outlined in Sec. Sec.  655.140-655.145, and will\n\n work with the employer to address any deficiencies in the job order in\n\n a manner consistent with Sec. Sec.  655.140-655.141.\n\n     (b) Notice of acceptance. Once the job order is determined to meet\n\n all regulatory requirements, the NPC will issue a Notice of Acceptance\n\n consistent with Sec.  655.143(b)(1). The CO will provide notice to the\n\n employer authorizing conditional access to the interstate clearance\n\n system; identify and transmit a copy of the Form ETA-790 to any one of\n\n the SWAs having jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites, and direct\n\n the SWA to place the job order promptly in intrastate and interstate\n\n clearance (including all States where the work will take place); and\n\n\n\n commence recruitment of U.S. workers. Where an association of\n\n agricultural employers files as a joint employer and submits a single\n\n Form ETA-790 on behalf of its employer-members, the CO will transmit a\n\n copy of the Form ETA-790 to the SWA having jurisdiction over the\n\n location of the association, again directing that SWA to place the job\n\n order in intrastate and interstate clearance, including to those other\n\n States where the work will take place, and commence recruitment of U.S.\n\n workers.\n\n     (c) Electronic job registry. Under Sec.  655.144(b), where a single\n\n job order is approved for an association of agricultural employers\n\n filing as a joint employer on behalf of its employer-members with\n\n different start dates of need, the Department will keep the job order\n\n posted on the OFLC electronic job registry until 50 percent of the\n\n period of the work contract has elapsed for all employer-members\n\n identified on the job order.\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.225  Post-acceptance requirements for herding and range\n\n livestock.\n\n \n\n     (a) Unless otherwise specified in this section, the requirements\n\n for recruiting U.S. workers by the employer and SWA must be satisfied,\n\n as specified in Sec. Sec.  655.150-655.158.\n\n     (b) Interstate clearance of job order. Pursuant to Sec.  \n\n\n\n 655.150(b), where a single job order is approved for an association of\n\n agricultural employers filing as a joint employer on behalf of its\n\n employer-members with different start dates of need, each of the SWAs\n\n to which the Form ETA-790 was transmitted by the CO or the SWA having\n\n jurisdiction over the location of the association must keep the job\n\n order on its active file until 50 percent of the period of the work\n\n contract has elapsed for all employer-members identified on the job\n\n order, and must refer to the association each qualified U.S. worker who\n\n applies (or on whose behalf an application is made) for the job\n\n opportunity.\n\n     (c) Any eligible U.S. worker who applies (or on whose behalf an\n\n application is made) for the job opportunity and is hired will be\n\n placed at the location nearest to him/her absent a request for a\n\n different location by the U.S. worker. Employers must make reasonable\n\n efforts to accommodate such placement requests by the U.S. worker.\n\n     (d) The employer will not be required to place an advertisement in\n\n a newspaper of general circulation serving the area of intended\n\n employment, as required in Sec.  655.151.\n\n     (e) An association that fulfills the recruitment requirements for\n\n its members is required to maintain a written recruitment report\n\n containing the information required by Sec.  655.156 for each\n\n individual employer-member identified in the application or job order,\n\n including any approved modifications.\n\n\n\n \n\n [[Page 63069]]\n\n \n\n Sec.  655.230  Range housing.\n\n \n\n     (a) Housing for work performed on the range must meet the minimum\n\n standards contained in Sec.  655.235 and Sec.  655.122(d)(2).\n\n     (b) The SWA with jurisdiction over the location of the range\n\n housing must inspect and certify that such housing used on the range is\n\n sufficient to accommodate the number of certified workers and meets all\n\n applicable standards contained in Sec.  655.235. The SWA must conduct a\n\n housing inspection no less frequently than once every three calendar\n\n years after the initial inspection and provide documentation to the\n\n employer certifying the housing for a period lasting no more than 36\n\n months. If the SWA determines that an employer's housing cannot be\n\n inspected within a 3-year timeframe or, when it is inspected, the\n\n housing does not meet all the applicable standards, the CO may deny the\n\n H-2A application in full or in part or require additional inspections,\n\n to be carried out by the SWA, in order to satisfy the regulatory\n\n requirement.\n\n     (c)(1) The employer may self-certify its compliance with the\n\n standards contained in Sec.  655.235 only when the employer has\n\n received a certification from the SWA for the range housing it seeks to\n\n use within the past 36 months.\n\n     (2) To self-certify the range housing, the employer must submit a\n\n\n\n copy of the valid SWA housing certification and a written statement,\n\n signed and dated by the employer, to the SWA and the CO assuring that\n\n the housing is available, sufficient to accommodate the number of\n\n workers being requested for temporary labor certification, and meets\n\n all the applicable standards for range housing contained in Sec.  \n\n 655.235.\n\n     (d) The use of range housing at a location other than the range,\n\n where fixed site employer-provided housing would otherwise be required,\n\n is permissible only when the worker occupying the housing is performing\n\n work that constitutes the production of livestock (which includes work\n\n that is closely and directly related to herding and/or the production\n\n of livestock). In such a situation, workers must be granted access to\n\n facilities, including but not limited to toilets and showers with hot\n\n and cold water under pressure, as well as cooking and cleaning\n\n facilities, that would satisfy the requirements contained in Sec.  \n\n 655.122(d)(1)(i). When such work does not constitute the production of\n\n livestock, workers must be housed in housing that meets all the\n\n requirements of Sec.  655.122(d).\n\n \n\n \n\n Sec.  655.235  Standards for range housing.\n\n \n\n     An employer employing workers under Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 may\n\n\n\n use a mobile unit, camper, or other similar mobile housing vehicle,\n\n tents, and remotely located stationary structures along herding trails,\n\n which meet the following standards:\n\n     (a) Housing site. Range housing sites must be well drained and free\n\n from depressions where water may stagnate.\n\n     (b) Water supply. (1) An adequate and convenient supply of water\n\n that meets the standards of the state or local health authority must be\n\n provided.\n\n     (2) The employer must provide each worker at least 4.5 gallons of\n\n potable water, per day, for drinking and cooking, delivered on a\n\n regular basis, so that the workers will have at least this amount\n\n available for their use until this supply is next replenished.\n\n \n\n \n\n Employers must also provide an additional amount of water sufficient to\n\n meet the laundry and bathing needs of each worker. This additional\n\n water may be non-potable, and an employer may require a worker to rely\n\n on natural sources of water for laundry and bathing needs if these\n\n sources are available and contain water that is clean and safe for\n\n these purposes. If an employer relies on alternate water sources to\n\n meet any of the workers' needs, it must take precautionary measures to\n\n protect the worker's health where these sources are also used to water\n\n the herd, dogs, or horses, to prevent contamination of the sources if\n\n\n\n they collect runoff from areas where these animals excrete.\n\n     (3) The water provided for use by the workers may not be used to\n\n water dogs, horses, or the herd.\n\n     (4) In situations where workers are located in areas that are not\n\n accessible by motorized vehicle, an employer may request a variance\n\n from the requirement that it deliver potable water to workers, provided\n\n the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n     (i) It seeks the variance at the time it submits its H-2A\n\n Application for Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A;\n\n     (ii) It attests that it has identified natural sources of water\n\n that are potable or may be easily rendered potable in the area in which\n\n the housing will be located, and that these sources will remain\n\n available during the period the worker is at that location;\n\n     (iii) It attests that it shall provide each worker an effective\n\n means to test whether the water is potable and, if not potable, the\n\n means to easily render it potable; and\n\n     (iv) The CO approves the variance.\n\n     (5) Individual drinking cups must be provided; and\n\n     (6) Containers appropriate for storing and using potable water must\n\n be provided and, in locations subject to freezing temperatures,\n\n containers must be small enough to allow storage in the housing unit to\n\n prevent freezing.\n\n     (c) Excreta and liquid waste disposal. (1) Facilities, including\n\n\n\n shovels, must be provided and maintained for effective disposal of\n\n excreta and liquid waste in accordance with the requirements of the\n\n state health authority or involved Federal agency; and\n\n     (2) If pits are used for disposal by burying of excreta and liquid\n\n waste, they must be kept fly-tight when not filled in completely after\n\n each use. The maintenance of disposal pits must be in accordance with\n\n state and local health and sanitation requirements.\n\n     (d) Housing structure. (1) Housing must be structurally sound, in\n\n good repair, in a sanitary condition and must provide shelter against\n\n the elements to occupants;\n\n     (2) Housing, other than tents, must have flooring constructed of\n\n rigid materials easy to clean and so located as to prevent ground and\n\n surface water from entering;\n\n     (3) Each housing unit must have at least one window that can be\n\n opened or skylight opening directly to the outdoors; and\n\n     (4) Tents appropriate to weather conditions may be used only where\n\n the terrain and/or land use regulations do not permit the use of other\n\n more substantial housing.\n\n     (e) Heating. (1) Where the climate in which the housing will be\n\n used is such that the safety and health of a worker requires heated\n\n living quarters, all such quarters must have properly installed\n\n operable heating equipment that supplies adequate heat. Where the\n\n climate in which the housing will be used is mild and the low\n\n temperature for any day in which the housing will be used is not\n\n reasonably expected to drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, no separate\n\n\n\n heating equipment is required as long as proper protective clothing and\n\n bedding are made available, free of charge or deposit charge, to the\n\n workers.\n\n     (2) Any stoves or other sources of heat using combustible fuel must\n\n be installed and vented in such a manner as to prevent fire hazards and\n\n a dangerous concentration of gases. If a solid or liquid fuel stove is\n\n used in a room with wooden or other combustible flooring, there must be\n\n a concrete slab, insulated metal sheet, or other fireproof material on\n\n the floor under each stove, extending at least 18 inches beyond the\n\n perimeter of the base of the stove.\n\n     (3) Any wall or ceiling within 18 inches of a solid or liquid fuel\n\n stove or\n\n \n\n [[Page 63070]]\n\n \n\n stove pipe must be made of fireproof material. A vented metal collar\n\n must be installed around a stovepipe or vent passing through a wall,\n\n ceiling, floor or roof.\n\n     (4) When a heating system has automatic controls, the controls must\n\n be of the type that cuts off the fuel supply when the flame fails or is\n\n interrupted or whenever a predetermined safe temperature or pressure is\n\n exceeded.\n\n     (5) A heater may be used in a tent if the heater is approved by a\n\n testing service and if the tent is fireproof.\n\n     (f) Lighting. (1) In areas where it is not feasible to provide\n\n\n\n electrical service to range housing units, including tents, lanterns\n\n must be provided (kerosene wick lights meet the definition of lantern);\n\n and\n\n     (2) Lanterns, where used, must be provided in a minimum ratio of\n\n one per occupant of each unit, including tents.\n\n     (g) Bathing, laundry, and hand washing. Bathing, laundry and hand\n\n washing facilities must be provided when it is not feasible to provide\n\n hot and cold water under pressure.\n\n     (h) Food storage. When mechanical refrigeration of food is not\n\n feasible, the worker must be provided with another means of keeping\n\n food fresh and preventing spoilage, such as a butane or propane gas\n\n refrigerator. Other proven methods of safeguarding fresh foods, such as\n\n dehydrating or salting, are acceptable.\n\n     (i) Cooking and eating facilities. (1) When workers or their\n\n families are permitted or required to cook in their individual unit, a\n\n space must be provided with adequate lighting and ventilation; and\n\n     (2) Wall surfaces next to all food preparation and cooking areas\n\n must be of nonabsorbent, easy to clean material. Wall surfaces next to\n\n cooking areas must be made of fire-resistant material.\n\n     (j) Garbage and other refuse. (1) Durable, fly-tight, clean\n\n containers must be provided to each housing unit, including tents, for\n\n storing garbage and other refuse; and\n\n     (2) Provision must be made for collecting or burying refuse, which\n\n includes garbage, at least twice a week or more often if necessary,\n\n\n\n except where the terrain in which the housing is located cannot be\n\n accessed by motor vehicle and the refuse cannot be buried, in which\n\n case the employer must provide appropriate receptacles for storing the\n\n refuse and for removing the trash when the employer next transports\n\n supplies to the location.\n\n     (k) Insect and rodent control. Appropriate materials, including\n\n sprays, and sealed containers for storing food, must be provided to aid\n\n housing occupants in combating insects, rodents and other vermin.\n\n     (l) Sleeping facilities. A separate comfortable and clean bed, cot,\n\n or bunk, with a clean mattress, must be provided for each person,\n\n except in a family arrangement, unless a variance is requested from and\n\n granted by the CO. When filing an application for certification and\n\n only where it is demonstrated to the CO that it is impractical to\n\n provide a comfortable and clean bed, cot, or bunk, with a clean\n\n mattress, for each range worker, the employer may request a variance\n\n from this requirement to allow for a second worker to join the range\n\n operation.
