{"title": "U.S. limits on imports linked to wave of immigrants from poorer countries", "body": "\nWhen America shuts its doors to clothes from Mexico, coffee from Central America and sugar from the Caribbean, it \ncompels these regions to pour out more of a major illegal export: their people.\n\n \n\n    People migrate from villages to cities and across national borders looking for opportunities to better their lives, \nand the best way America can stanch the inflow of undocumented workers is to boost the economies of its \nimpoverished neighbors, says a federal commission report released Tuesday in Washington.\n\n \n\n    \"The only way to bring about lasting change is through accelerated economic development,\" said Diego Asencio, \na former assistant secretary of state who chaired the Commission for the Study of International Migration and \nCooperative Economic Development.  \"And the only way to do that is to promote international trade.\"\n   Congress authorized the commission as part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The commission \nconsisting of scholars and government and church officials was asked to study the problem of illegal migration and \nsuggest ways to prevent it.\n\n \n\n    The report warns that although creating jobs in other countries could check the flow of migrants after \ngenerations, the results could be paradoxical in the short run. An initial boost in prosperity could \"stimulate \nmigration by raising expectations and enhancing people's ability to migrate,\" the report says.\n\n \n\n    The United States already offers some preferential trade agreements, such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \nwhich gives its southern neighbors duty-free access for manufactured goods. But economic problems in the region \noutweigh such small trade incentives.\n\n \n\n    Although nations such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic are producing more goods for export, there are \nfew markets for them.\n\n \n\n    The United States, their major trade partner, has quotas on items such as clothing that favor older trade partners \nlike Taiwan and South Korea. It also has quotas that restrict imported sugar from the Dominican Republic, even \nthough it is cheaper and subsidies to U.S. companies end up costing the American consumer $ 3-billion a year. \nBecause of American sugar quotas, the Dominican Republic exports less than one-fourth the sugar it did 10 years \nago.\n\n \n\n\n    And without an assured market for their exports, jobs in these nations dry up. Governments use their skimpy \nearnings to pay interest on their huge foreign debt and cut spending in areas such as housing and health, forcing \npeople to migrate.\n\n \n\n    But \"the single most important cooperative measure the United States could take is to correct its own fiscal \ndeficit,\" the report says.  In the 1980s, America became the largest user of the world's savings, and its massive \nborrowing has made credit more expensive for poor nations.\n"}
