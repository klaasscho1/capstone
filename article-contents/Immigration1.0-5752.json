{"title": "DATABASE TO LIST ELLIS ISLAND IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nOld Ellis Island is going high-tech.\n\nThe American Family Immigration History Center will have a computerized database of arrival records on the 17 \nmillion people who passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924, officials said.\nThe center is scheduled to open in 2000.\n\nVisitors to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum will be able to search the database to find the manifests from the \nships their relatives arrived on and get a copy of that record and a picture of the vessel.\n\nAbout 40 percent of Americans can trace their ancestry to Ellis Island.\n\nPublic access to the records was a goal since the foundation was created in 1982, said Lee Iacocca, chairman \nemeritus of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation.\n\nThe records were removed from Ellis Island decades ago and placed on microfilm by the National Archives and \nRecords Administration in Washington. They are being entered into the database by volunteers from the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe project will cost about $15 million, all of which will come from private fund-raising.\n\nThe database will be accessible through 35 computer stations. Visitors will pay a \"nominal\" fee for access; each \nsearch should take seven to eight minutes, Edwin Schlossberg, who designed the center, said. The database has \nbeen set up to search for close matches and phonetic spellings.\n\nSchlossberg, husband of Caroline Kennedy, said people's curiosity about that famous family made him realize how \nmuch family histories matter to the public.\n"}
