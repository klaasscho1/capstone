No charges had been filed, but the authorities were searching for evidence of \nillegal hiring practices at the plant, the House of Raeford. The employees could face deportation and prison time, \nsaid Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The raid followed months of \ninvestigation. In June, arrest warrants were issued for 11 workers on charges of identity theft and entering the \ncountry illegally. Seven have pleaded guilty, two are awaiting trial and two are fugitives. The human resources \ndirector at the plant, Elaine Crump, was also charged with instructing employees to provide fraudulent \ndocumentation. A federal review showed that more than 775 of 825 employees at the plant submitted false \ninformation, said Kevin McDonald, an assistant United States attorney.
