{"title": "MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY;A 1985 Model Immigration Bill", "body": "\nAfter years of arguing about the nation's immigration law, the House and Senate almost agreed on a broad \npackage of revisions near the end of the 1984 Congressional session. But agreement eluded them and the bill \ndied.\nLast week, the Senate approved, 69 to 30, its 1985-model bill.\n\nThe legislation has several by-now-familiar features; it would beef up enforcement of immigration rules, penalize \nemployers who hire illegal aliens and gradually grant legal residence to those who entered the country illegally \nbefore Jan. 1, 1980. But the vote was considerably closer than the margins by which earlier, similar measures had \nbeen adopted, reflecting sharp disagreement over a temporary foreign worker program.\n\nThe program, proposed by Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, and adopted at the urging of Western \nfruit and vegetable growers, would allow as many as 350,000 workers to cross the border. Without these field \nhands, said Senator Wilson, many growers would ''watch their crops rot.'' The foreign worker program was opposed \nby some of the bill's principal backers as well as by such interested bystanders as Secretary of Labor Bill Brock \nand the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\n\nAfter the final head count, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming and chief sponsor of the legislation, \ncalled his handiwork ''a damn good bill that reaches out and even gathers up more interests'' than earlier \nmeasures. The House is not expected to take up its bill until early 1986, and its debate is likely to be as heated as \nthe Senate's.\n"}
