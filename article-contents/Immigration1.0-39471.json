{"title": "JULY 11-17;Adrift on a Sea of Diplomacy", "body": "\nSix hundred and fifty-nine Chinese refugees on three fetid freighters became pawns in an international game last \nweek. Headed for California, they were intercepted by the Coast Guard, rebuffed by a United States already \nconcerned about joblessness and taken in by an eternally impoverished Mexico, ultimately to be returned to China, \nwhere they may face jail terms and fines.\n\nTheir desires were made plain by a crude sign: \"Bread We Want, Freedom We Want.\" But they ran afoul of the \nClinton Administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants seeking political asylum.\n\nFor the record, Mexican officials said the sudden reversal of their refusal to take in the refugees was for \nhumanitarian purposes. Privately, they said they were under intense pressure placed on them by the pending vote \nin Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would unite the two nations and Canada in a \nsingle tariff-free zone.\n\nThe refugees began their voyage from China's Fuzhou Province three months ago. They languished for 11 days \nwhile diplomats debated their fate. On Friday, State Department official said passengers with genuine claims for \npolitical asylum would be heard.\n"}
