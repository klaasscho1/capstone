{"title": "535 PASS FIRST HURDLE ON FIRST DAY OF THE AMNESTY PROGRAM", "body": "\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service gave temporary legal status to 535 illegal aliens on the first day of its \nyear-long amnesty program, the service said Wednesday.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 people picked up applications at the 107 special legalization offices around the nation, said \nVerne Jervis, a spokesman.\n\nBut only 571 people produced completed applications and paid fees of $185 for an individual or $420 for a family. \nOf those, 535 also completed interviews and took home temporary work authorization cards, Mr. Jervis said.\n\n \n\nLight Turnout Confirmed\n\nThose given temporary legal status will be able to apply for permanent legal status after 18 months and can \neventually apply for American citizenship.\n\nThe first-day numbers confirmed reports of a light turnout from around the country Tuesday.\n\n''There were no huge numbers anyplace,'' Mr. Jervis said. ''It was a smooth and relatively light day, which was good \nfor us as well. We had new people, new equipment.''\n\nTuesday was the first day that illegal immigrants could apply for amnesty under the Immigration Reform and \nControl Act of 1986. The service has said that as many as 3.9 million illegal aliens could be eligible to apply under \nrules that require they arrived in the United States before Jan. 1, 1982.\n\nFinal regulations were not published until last Friday, giving most people little time to study them and collect all the \nnecessary documents. Many people are first consulting with social service agencies approved by the Government \nto help the immigrants with their applications.\n\nMr. Jervis said that he expected more activiity next week, when those who had sought help would begin coming \nforward. ''And some people have a tendency to hang back until they see that others have gone through it,'' he \nadded.\n"}
