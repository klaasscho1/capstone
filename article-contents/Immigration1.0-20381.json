{"title": "Cost-Type Awards to Nonprofit and Governmental Entities", "body": "\n Washington, DC:  This Proposed Rule document was issued by the Department of Defense (DOD)\n\n  \n\n  \n <h2>\n  Action</h2>\n \n  Proposed rule.\n <h2>\n  Summary</h2>\n \n\n  This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is the third of a sequence of six NPRM documents in this section of \nthis issue of the Federal Register that propose updates to the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement \nRegulations (DoDGARs). This NPRM proposes to add seven new DoDGARs parts to address the administrative \nrequirements included in general terms and conditions of DoD cost-type grants and cooperative agreements \nawarded to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. \nThe administrative requirements are in areas such as financial and program management; property administration; \nrecipient procurement procedures; financial, programmatic, and property reporting; and subawards. The proposed \nnew parts establish a uniform way for approximately 100 DoD Component awarding offices to organize the \nadministrative requirements in their general terms and conditions. The proposed new parts also provide standard \nwording of terms and conditions for the administrative requirements, with associated regulatory prescriptions for \nDoD Components to provide latitude to vary from the standard wording where variation is appropriate.\n\n <h2>\n  Dates</h2>\n \n  To ensure that they can be considered in developing the final rule, comments must be received at either the Web \nsite or mailing address indicated below by February 6, 2017.\n <h2>\n  Addresses</h2>\n\n\n \n  You may submit comments identified by docket number, or by Regulatory Information Number (RIN) and title, by \neither of the following methods:\n \n\n  The Web site: http://www.regulations.gov.

Executive Summary</h3>\n <h4>\n  A. Purpose of the Regulatory Action</h4>\n <h5>\n  1. The Need for the Regulatory Action and How the Action Meets That Need</h5>\n \n  The Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) implement statutes and \nGovernmentwide guidance for grants and cooperative agreements, as needed in order to ensure that DoD \nComponent offices make and administer assistance awards consistently with agency policy. They are in need of \nupdating, in part due to the issuance of new Office of Management and Budget guidance to Federal agencies on \nadministrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements that apply to Federal grants, cooperative \nagreements, and other assistance instruments (2 CFR part 200). This NPRM provides a major portion of the \nimplementation of that guidance, by addressing the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and \nconditions of DoD Components' awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local \ngovernments, and Indian tribes.\n <h5>\n  2. Legal Authorities for the Regulatory Action</h5>\n \n  There are two statutory authorities for this NPRM:\n \n  \n   10 U.S.C. 113, which establishes the Secretary of Defense as the head of the Department of Defense; and\n  \n   5 U.S.C. 301, which authorizes the head of an Executive department to prescribe regulations for the governance \nof that department and the performance of its business.\n \n <h4>\n  B. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action</h4>\n \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n  This NPRM establishes seven new DoDGARs parts that collectively govern a DoD Component's construction of \nthe administrative requirements portion of its general terms and conditions for awards to institutions of higher \neducation, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. The seven proposed new parts \ncomprise a subchapter of the DoDGARs\u2014Subchapter D in Chapter XI of 2 CFR.\n \n\n  The first of the proposed parts in the subchapter, 2 CFR part 1126, provides an overview of the subchapter's \ncontent. In addition to addressing the purpose and applicability, the overview part describes what the subchapter's \nremaining six parts address and how they are organized. Section II.B of this Supplementary Information section \ndescribes the overview part 1126 in more detail.\n \n\n  Each of the subchapter's other six parts provides both: (1) Standard wording for articles of general terms and \nconditions specifying requirements for recipients and subrecipients within a given subject matter area; and (2) the \nassociated direction to DoD Components on the use of the standard wording for those articles. Those six parts are \ndescribed more fully in sections II.C through II.H of this Supplementary Information section.\n <h4>\n  C. Costs and Benefits</h4>\n \n  The major benefit of this NPRM is greatly increased uniformity across the Department in administrative \nrequirements included in DoD grant and cooperative agreement awards each year to institutions of higher \neducation, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Uniformity helps to lessen \nadministrative burdens and costs for recipients, thereby increasing the productivity of programs supported by DoD \nassistance awards. This regulatory action takes a major step in that direction by proposing to establish a standard \norganization and more uniform wording for administrative requirements included in general terms and conditions of \nmore than 15,000 award actions totaling $4 to $6 billion each year that are issued:\n \n  \n   By approximately 100 offices in the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and 11 other DoD \nComponents that are located across the United States and elsewhere.\n  \n   Under a variety of programs and to diverse types of recipients. Institutions of higher education receive more than \nhalf of the awards, including many awards that support defense research. There also are thousands of awards to \nother types of recipients and for other defense purposes, such as support to States for the National Guard and \neconomic assistance to communities impacted by defense downsizing or costs associated with education of military \ndependents.\n \n \n\n  The administrative burdens and associated costs to recipients due to the regulatory action proposed in this NPRM \nare primarily those resulting from the Governmentwide guidance to agencies that OMB issued in 2 CFR part 200. \nSome variations from the guidance noted in sections II.C through II.H of this Supplementary Information section \ncould cause a relatively small increase in burdens, while others reduce burdens and costs. The Department invites \ninput on any area in which potential recipients of DoD awards perceive an increase in burden relative to the OMB \nguidance that is not justified by the commensurate value of an improvement in DoD's ability to carry out its \nresponsibilities for good stewardship of Federal taxpayers' dollars.\n <h3>\n  II. General Background and Detailed Overview of the DoDGARs Parts Proposed in This NPRM</h3>\n <h4>\n  A. General Background</h4>\n \n\n\n\n  The first and second NPRMs in the sequence of six notices in this section of this issue of the Federal Register \n(i.e., the two NPRMs preceding this one) provide additional context pertinent to the seven DoDGARs parts \nproposed in this NPRM. In particular, the NPRM immediately preceding this one proposes a new DoDGARs part \nthat establishes a standard award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements. That format \nhas three major elements, the third of which is the general terms and conditions that address administrative \nrequirements, national policy requirements, and programmatic requirements.\n \n  This notice proposes seven DoDGARs parts that establish a standard organization and content for the \nadministrative requirements portion of the general terms and conditions in awards to institutions of higher \neducation, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Those are the types of recipient \nentities addressed by the OMB guidance to Federal agencies on administrative requirements, cost principles, and \naudit requirements that is in 2 CFR part 200. Therefore, the seven new DoDGARs parts proposed in this notice also \ncomprise the proposed DoD implementation of that guidance as it applies to general terms and conditions.\n \n\n  The seven new parts proposed in this notice are in Subchapter D of Chapter XI in title 2 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations (note that the first of the six NPRMs in this section of this issue of the Federal Register proposed the \nestablishment of that subchapter). The first of the parts proposed in this notice, 2 CFR part 1126, provides an \noverview of Subchapter D. Each of the other proposed parts (2 CFR parts 1128, 1130, 1132, 1134, 1136, and \n1138) addresses the organization and content of general terms and conditions for one segment of the \nadministrative requirements, such as property administration or recipient procurement procedures.\n \n  Each of the proposed parts 1128, 1130, 1132, 1134, 1136, and 1138 is organized into subparts and appendices. \nThe appendix to each proposed part provides standard wording of general terms and conditions for one article of \ngeneral terms and conditions. For each appendix addressing a particular article, the proposed part has an \nassociated subpart that provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording for that article. \nThe subpart associated with each article identifies the portions of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 that the \narticle implements, as those portions of the guidance apply to general terms and conditions. For example:\n \n  \n   Appendix D to the proposed 2 CFR part 1128 contains standard wording of an article of general terms and \nconditions addressing revisions of budget and program plans under awards; and\n  \n\n   The corresponding Subpart D of that proposed part: (1) Contains the prescription for DoD Components' use of the \nstandard wording in appendix D when constructing that article of their general terms and conditions; and (2) in \nsection 1128.400, lists the portions of the OMB guidance that the article implements.\n \n \n\n  Organizing the proposed parts 2 CFR 1128 through 1138 in that manner more clearly differentiates requirements \nfor recipients from those for DoD awarding officials or administering officials than the DoDGARs have done \npreviously. In the past, it was not unusual for a DoDGARs paragraph on administrative requirements to include \nrequirements for both DoD Components and recipients, which made it more difficult for each intended audience to \ndetermine what the regulations required of them. For example, DoDGARs requirements on revisions to budget and \nprogram plans for both DoD Components and institutions of higher education or nonprofit recipients were \ninterwoven in section 32.25 of 32 CFR part 32 (the now-superseded DoD implementation of OMB Circular A-110). \nWith the organization of the content in the proposed parts 2 CFR 1128 through 1138, requirements for DoD \nComponent officials are in the subparts of the parts and therefore separate from requirements for recipients, which \nare communicated through award terms and conditions based on the standard wording in the appendices to the \nparts. That organization should make it easier for all affected parties to understand the applicable requirements \nand, therefore, to comply with them.\n \n\n\n\n  Three other features of the proposed parts with standard wording of general terms and conditions are designed to \nfurther promote ease of understanding for those who need to use and comply with them.\n \n  \n   The proposed standard wording is in plain language, with use of personal pronouns such as \u201cyou\u201d to denote the \nrecipient and \u201cwe\u201d to mean the Federal Government. Use of personal pronouns is a recognized means to help a \nreader better relate to words addressed to him or her and, in the case of regulations, more likely understand his or \nher responsibilities.\n  \n   The proposed organization of administrative requirements reflects a conscious attempt to promote clarity by \ngrouping requirements into 39 articles of general terms and conditions that present the subject matter in the most \ncoherent manner possible. For example, the consolidation of requirements related to subawards in twelve articles \nwithin the proposed 2 CFR part 1138 is intended to simplify a recipient's task of determining which requirements of \nthe prime award flow down to subrecipients.\n  \n\n   The proposed establishment of the standard wording in the appendices to parts in the Code of Federal \nRegulations enables a DoD Component to construct the administrative requirements portion of its general terms \nand conditions by: (1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article by reference; and (2) stating any variations \nit has from the standard wording of that article. Section 1120.515 in the proposed 2 CFR part 1120\u2014the part that \nestablishes a standard award format (see the NPRM immediately preceding this one in this section of this issue of \nthe Federal Register)\u2014strongly encourages DoD Components to use this method in their general terms and \nconditions, rather than including the full text of each article. Incorporating the standard wording by reference to the \nCFR should allow a recipient that receives awards from multiple DoD Component awarding offices to quickly \nidentify how each office's general terms and conditions vary from the DoD standard wording.\n \n \n\n  It should be noted that the seven parts proposed in this NPRM do not address administrative requirements for \nDoD Components' fixed-amount awards, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.201. Fixed-amount DoD \nawards will be addressed by DoDGARs rules to be proposed in the future. To the extent that DoD Components \npermit recipients or subrecipients to make fixed-amount subawards at lower tiers below cost-type prime awards and \nsubawards, however, the proposed 2 CFR part 1138 includes requirements for those fixed-amount subawards (an \noverview of that proposed part is in section II.H of this Supplementary Information section).\n \n\n  The remainder of this Supplementary Information section provides overviews of the seven new DoDGARs parts \nproposed in this NPRM. Specifically, sections II.B through H address the proposed 2 CFR parts 1126 through \n1138, respectively.\n <h4>\n  B. Proposed Part 1126\u2014Subchapter D Overview</h4>\n \n  The proposed 2 CFR part 1126 provides an overview of Subchapter D of chapter XI, title 2 of the CFR. \nSpecifically, it:\n \n  \n   Provides general information about the purposes of the subchapter.\n  \n   Specifies the applicability of the subchapter. It states that the subchapter: (1) Directly applies to DoD \nComponents; and (2) only indirectly applies to recipients through its regulation of DoD Components' construction of \nthe administrative requirements portion of their general terms and conditions for cost-type grant and cooperative \nagreement awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian \ntribes.\n\n\n\n  \n   Specifies the conditions under which exceptions from the provisions of the subchapter are permitted. The only \nprovision that varies from the conditions for exceptions included in OMB guidance to agencies, at 2 CFR 200.102, is \na provision allowing exceptions for small awards. This continues a policy included in DoD's interim implementation \nof the OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 1103, which it published in the Federal Register on December 19, 2014 [79 FR \n76047], and broadens it to include small awards to States, local governments, and Indian tribes.\n  \n   Acknowledges the complementary relationship between the parts of the subchapter and two other DoDGARs \nparts that specify administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreement awards to for-profit entities and \nfor Technology Investment Agreements.\n  \n\n   Provides, in the proposed section 1126.5, a table showing a high-level summary of the contents of the other six \nparts of the subchapter. The table lists each article of the administrative requirements portion of the general terms \nand conditions that is addressed in the subchapter.\n  \n   Describes how each of the other six parts of the subchapter is organized.\n \n <h4>\n  C. Proposed Part 1128\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Financial and Program Management</h4>\n \n  The proposed part 1128 addresses seven articles of general terms and conditions within the broad area of \nfinancial and program management. The seven articles are designated as FMS Articles I through VII of the general \nterms and conditions. The proposed standard wording for the articles is in the seven appendices to the proposed \npart 1128. The prescriptions to DoD Components for use of the standard wording of the articles are in the seven \nassociated subparts of the part. The articles with their related prescriptions implement the financial and program \nmanagement provisions of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200, as that guidance applies to general award terms \nand conditions. The subjects covered by the seven articles (and the appendices and subparts containing the \narticles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Financial management system standards (in Subpart A and appendix A).\n  \n   Payments (in Subpart B and appendix B).\n  \n   Allowable costs, period of availability of funds, and fee or profit (in Subpart C and appendix C).\n  \n   Revision of budget and program plans (in Subpart D and appendix D).\n  \n   Non-Federal audits (in Subpart E and appendix E).\n  \n   Cost sharing or matching (in Subpart F and appendix F).\n  \n   Program income (in Subpart G and appendix G).\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.C.1 through 7 of this Supplementary Information section focus on whether and how \nthe proposed implementation of the OMB guidance in each article and its associated prescription for DoD \nComponents varies from, or clarifies, the related guidance.\n <h5>\n  1. Financial Management System Standards</h5>\n\n\n\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article I, \u201cFinancial management system standards,\u201d and associated prescription includes no \nvariations or clarifications relative to the portions of the OMB guidance on financial management systems \nstandards.\n <h5>\n  2. Payments</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article II, \u201cPayments,\u201d and associated prescription include one variation and one clarification \nrelative to the guidance on payments:\n \n  \n   The variation is relative to OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.305(b)(3), which concerns the timing of awarding agency \npayments to recipients. The OMB guidance states that an awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar \ndays after receipt of the billing, unless the agency reasonably believes the request to be improper. The proposed \nprescription for DoD Components in 2 CFR 1128.215(c)(4) implements that guidance for general terms and \nconditions of construction awards that specify reimbursement as the payment method. That proposed prescription \nstates that DoD generally makes, rather than \u201cmust\u201d make, payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the \nrequest. This continues existing DoD policy for awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit \norganizations, which is cited at 2 CFR 1103.205 in DoD's interim implementation of the OMB guidance, and \nbroadens the policy to States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Note that this proposed wording in FMS Article \nII is limited to the general terms and conditions of construction awards. For non-construction awards, the \nreimbursement method should be used only in award-specific terms and conditions because the general terms and \nconditions of those awards authorize recipients to request advance payments as long as they maintain, or \ndemonstrate the willingness to maintain, written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between their receipt of \neach payment and disbursement of the funds for program purposes.\n  \n\n   The clarification relates to OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9), which states that a recipient may retain up to \n$500 per year in interest it earns on advance payments. The proposed paragraph B.6.d of FMS Article II, clarifies \nthat the $500 limit applies to the aggregate amount of interest a recipient earns annually under all of its Federal \ngrants and cooperative agreements and not separately to the amount it earns under each award.\n \n <h5>\n  3. Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article III, \u201cAllowable costs,\u201d and associated prescription supplement the OMB guidance, as \nwell as implement it, by providing a central source within the general terms and conditions for requirements on \nwhether and when costs incurred by recipients, subrecipients, and contractors under awards and subawards are \nallowable. It also includes the long-standing DoDGARs policy on fee or profit. The proposed article includes one \nvariation and two clarifications relative to the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.461 on the allowability of costs \nassociated with professional journal publications:\n \n  \n\n   The variation is a specification in Section B of FMS Article III that costs of publishing in professional journals are \nallowable only if the recipient charges them consistently, either as direct or indirect costs. The purpose of this \nspecification is to ensure that the Government does not pay more than its fair share of journal publication costs that \nare increasingly being addressed through charges that authors pay prior to publication. That can happen if an \ninstitution directly charges those payments for federally supported researchers to their Federal awards while \n\n\n\nincluding payments by other researchers in a pool of costs, a share of which the Government reimburses as indirect \ncosts charged to Federal awards.\n  \n\n   The first clarification also is in Section B of the article and is intended to help avoid confusion that might result \nfrom the use of the wording \u201ccost of publication or sharing of research results\u201d in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3). That wording \ncould be interpreted to mean something broader than \u201ccharges for professional journal publications,\u201d which is the \nwording in the lead-in 2 CFR 200.461(b) that should circumscribe the costs allowed under \u00a7&thinsp;200.461(b)(3).\n  \n\n   The other clarification is in paragraph C.3 of FMS Article III. It clarifies wording in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) indicating \nthat a recipient may charge an award up to the time of closeout of the award for costs of publishing in professional \njournals that are incurred after the end of the period of performance. The proposed clarification provides that the \nrecipient may charge those costs to an award if its request for payment of the costs is received no later than the \ndate on which it submits its final financial report under the award. That clarification is needed because the closeout \nprocess relies on the final financial report being the ultimate statement of financial status. Any subsequent change \nin financial status due to incurrence of additional publication costs would disrupt the ongoing closeout process and \ncreate added burdens and costs for DoD's award administration office, which would have to require the recipient to \nsubmit a revised final report.\n \n <h5>\n  4. Revision of Budget and Program Plans</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article IV, \u201cRevision of budget and program plans,\u201d and associated prescription include no \nvariations or clarifications relative to the guidance on changes in a recipient's budget and program plans.\n <h5>\n  5. Non-Federal Audits</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article V, \u201cNon-Federal audits,\u201d and associated prescription supplement, as well as implement, \nthe OMB guidance by providing a central location within the general terms and conditions at which a recipient can \nfind requirements for non-Federal audits of all types of recipients and subrecipients, including for-profit entities. The \nproposed article and prescription include no variations or clarifications relative to portions of the OMB guidance \nthat they implement.\n <h5>\n  6. Cost Sharing or Matching</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed FMS Article VI, \u201cCost sharing or matching,\u201d and associated prescription include no variations or \nclarifications relative to the OMB guidance on cost sharing or matching. Paragraph E.2 of the proposed article \ndoes refer to a clarification contained in another article of the general terms and conditions, PROP Article I. That \nclarification, which concerns the Federal interest in property donated to a project under an award, is addressed in \nthe discussion of PROP Article I in subsection II.D.1 of this Supplementary Information section.\n <h5>\n  7. Program Income</h5>\n \n\n  The prescription for DoD Components related to FMS Article VII, \u201cProgram Income,\u201d which is in subpart G of the \nproposed 2 CFR part 1128, includes one clarification from the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. The prescription \npermits a DoD Component's general terms and conditions to specify a combination of the three alternatives that the \nOMB guidance identifies for recipients' use of program income\u2014i.e., the additive, deductive, and cost sharing or \nmatching alternatives. This is a clarification because the guidance in 2 CFR part 200 does not explicitly recognize \nthat an award may use more than one of the three alternatives. This clarification provides continuity with previous \n\n\n\nGovernmentwide and DoD policy that permitted use of more than one alternative. Specifically, use of a combination \nof alternatives was allowed for awards to:\n \n  \n   Institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations under OMB Circular A-110 and the associated \nDoD implementation in DoDGARs part 32 (32 CFR part 32).\n  \n   States, local governments, and Indian tribes under the Governmentwide common rule implementing OMB Circular \nA-102, which was adopted by DoD in DoDGARs part 33 (32 CFR part 33).\n \n <h4>\n  D. Proposed Part 1130\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Property Administration</h4>\n \n  The proposed part 1130 addresses six articles of general terms and conditions concerning property acquired by \nrecipients under awards and federally owned property furnished to recipients by the Government. The articles are \ndesignated as PROP Articles I through VI of the general terms and conditions. The proposed standard wording for \nthe articles is in appendices A through F to the proposed part. The prescriptions for DoD Components' use of the \nstandard wording is in the associated Subparts A through F of the proposed part. The articles with their related \nprescriptions implement the property administration provisions of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200, as that \nguidance pertains to general award terms and conditions. The subjects covered by the six articles (and the \nappendices and subparts containing the articles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Title to property (in Subpart A and appendix A)\n  \n   Recipients' property management systems (in Subpart B and appendix B)\n  \n   Use and disposition of real property (in Subpart C and appendix C)\n  \n   Use and disposition of equipment and supplies (in Subpart D and appendix D)\n  \n   Use and disposition of federally owned property (in Subpart E and appendix E)\n  \n   Intangible property (in Subpart F and appendix F)\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.D.1 through 6 of this Supplementary Information section focus on whether and how \nthe proposed implementation of the guidance in each article and its associated prescription for DoD Components \nvaries from, or clarifies, the related OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n  1. Title to Property</h5>\n \n  The proposed PROP Article I, \u201cTitle to property,\u201d and associated prescription implement portions of the OMB \nguidance that address title vesting and the property trust relationship. They implement the guidance with no \nvariations.\n <h5>\n  2. Property Management System</h5>\n \n  The proposed PROP Article II, \u201cProperty management system,\u201d and associated prescription implement portions of \nthe OMB guidance that specify the standards for a recipient's property management system. The proposed \nimplementation includes one variation from the guidance.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The one variation is the inclusion of property management system requirements for federally owned property. \nAlthough the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 does not explicitly address those management system \nrequirements, they are needed to ensure proper stewardship of any federally owned property for which a recipient \nis accountable under an award. The requirements are included for States in Section B of the proposed PROP \nArticle II and for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes in \nSection C of the proposed article. The requirements in the proposed PROP Article II continue long-standing DoD \npolicy in the DoDGARs, for States under 32 CFR 33.32(f) and for other recipients under 32 CFR 32.34(f). Those \nrequirements also were included at 2 CFR 1103.201 in the interim DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR \npart 200.\n <h5>\n  3. Use and Disposition of Real Property</h5>\n \n  The proposed PROP Article III, \u201cUse and disposition of real property,\u201d and associated prescription implement the \nportions of the OMB guidance pertinent to that subject. The proposed implementation includes one variation from \nthe guidance.\n \n  The variation is that the proposed article authorizes a recipient's use of real property acquired under an award for \nother projects or programs either: (1) During its use on the project or program for which it was acquired, on a non-\ninterfering basis; or (2) subsequently, by deferral of final disposition of the property, if the recipient obtains DoD \napproval for use on other federally sponsored projects or programs with purposes consistent with those supported \nby the award. The use on a non-interfering basis during the performance period of the award parallels provisions in \nthe OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.313(c)(2) for equipment acquired under an award. The potential to use real \nproperty after the end of the performance period continues long-standing policy in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR \n32.32(b) for awards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations and extends that \npolicy to States, local governments, and Indian tribes.\n <h5>\n  4. Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies</h5>\n \n  The proposed PROP Article IV, \u201cUse and disposition of equipment and supplies,\u201d and associated prescription \nimplement the portions of the OMB guidance on that subject. The proposed implementation includes one variation \nfrom the guidance.\n <h5>\n  5. Use and Disposition of Federally Owned Property</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed PROP Article V, \u201cUse and disposition of federally owned property,\u201d and associated prescription \nimplement the OMB guidance on that subject, with no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  6. Intangible Property</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed PROP Article VI, \u201cIntangible property,\u201d and associated prescription implement the provisions of the \nOMB guidance that address copyrights, inventions, and data. The proposed implementation includes one \nclarification of the guidance.\n \n\n  The one clarification, which is in Section D of the proposed article, relates to a patent, patent application, \ncopyright, or other intangible property that is acquired under an award by a means other than being developed or \nproduced under the award. This is an important distinction because policies concerning vesting of title to the \nproperty and use and disposition of the property appropriately differ from the corresponding policies for intangible \nproperty that is developed or produced under awards. This distinction was previously made in the DoDGARs at 32 \n\n\n\nCFR 32.36(e) for awards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations, and was \nincluded for awards to those types of recipients in DoD's interim implementation of the OMB guidance at 2 CFR \n1103.215. The incorporation into PROP Article VI extends the distinction to awards DoD Components make to \nStates, local governments, and Indian tribes.\n <h4>\n  E. Proposed Part 1132\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Recipient Procurement Procedures</h4>\n \n  The proposed part 1132 addresses three articles of general terms and conditions specifying procedural \nrequirements for recipients' purchases of property and services under awards. The articles, which are designated \nas PROC Articles I through III, are in appendices A through C to the proposed part. The prescriptions for DoD \nComponents' use of the standard wording of the articles are in the corresponding Subparts A through C of the \nproposed part. The articles and the associated prescriptions implement the procurement provisions of the OMB \nguidance in 2 CFR part 200 as they relate to general award terms and conditions. The subjects covered by the \narticles (and the appendices and subparts containing the articles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Procurement standards for States (in Subpart A and appendix A)\n  \n   Procurement standards for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian \ntribes (in Subpart B and appendix B)\n  \n   Contract provisions for recipient procurements (in Subpart C and appendix C)\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.E.1 through 3 of this Supplementary Information section address whether and how \nthe proposed implementation of the guidance in each article and its associated prescription for DoD Components \nvaries from, or clarifies, the related OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n  1. Procurement Standards for States</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed PROC Article I, \u201cProcurement standards for States,\u201d and the associated prescription implement the \nOMB guidance on those standards, with no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  2. Procurement Standards for Institutions of Higher Education, Nonprofit Organizations, Local Governments, and \nIndian Tribes</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed PROC Article II, \u201cProcurement standards for institutions of higher education, nonprofit \norganizations, local governments, and Indian tribes,\u201d and the associated prescription implement the OMB guidance \non those standards, with no clarifications or variations relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  3. Contract Provisions for Recipient Procurements</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed PROC Article III, \u201cContract provisions for recipient procurements,\u201d and the associated prescription \nimplement the OMB guidance on that subject, with no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h4>\n  F. Proposed Part 1134\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Reporting</h4>\n \n  The proposed part 1134 addresses four articles of general terms and conditions on recipient reporting \nrequirements. The articles are designated as REP Articles I through IV and are in appendices A through D to the \n\n\n\nproposed part. The associated prescriptions for DoD Components are in Subparts A through D of the proposed \npart. The articles and associated prescriptions implement the provisions of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 on \nreporting, as those provisions relate to general award terms and conditions. The subjects covered by the articles \n(and the appendices and subparts containing the articles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Performance management, monitoring, and reporting (in Subpart A and appendix A)\n  \n   Financial reporting (in Subpart B and appendix B)\n  \n   Reporting on property (in Subpart C and appendix C)\n  \n   Reporting on subawards and executive compensation (in Subpart D and appendix D)\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.F.1 through 4 of this Supplementary Information section address whether and how \nthe proposed implementation of the guidance in each article and its associated prescription for DoD Components \nvaries from, or clarifies, the related OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n  1. Performance Management, Monitoring, and Reporting</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed REP Article I, \u201cPerformance management, monitoring, and reporting,\u201d implements portions of the \nOMB guidance pertinent to that subject. It does so with no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  2. Financial Reporting</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed REP Article II, \u201cFinancial reporting,\u201d implements the OMB guidance on that subject, with one \nclarification. That clarification is in Section D of the proposed article and the related prescription for DoD \nComponents. Section D authorizes recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim and final financial \nreports. That authorization continues long-standing DoD policy in: (1) The DoDGARs at 32 CFR 32.52(a) and \nunderlying provisions of OMB Circular A-110 for awards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other \nnonprofit organizations; and (2) the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 33.41(a)(7) and the underlying Governmentwide common \nrule for awards to States, local governments, and Indian tribes.\n <h5>\n  3. Property Reporting</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed REP Article III, \u201cProperty reporting,\u201d provides a single location within the general terms and \nconditions at which a recipient may find all of the property reporting requirements listed. With its associated \nprescription, it implements portions of the OMB guidance concerning property reporting that are not implemented in \nother articles of the general terms and conditions. For the reporting requirements that are addressed in other \narticles, the proposed REP Article III includes references to those articles rather than restating the requirements. \nThe proposed article and prescription include no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  4. Reporting on Subawards and Executive Compensation</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed REP Article IV, \u201cReporting on subawards and executive compensation,\u201d directly implements the \nGovernmentwide guidance in 2 CFR part 170 that is based on statutory reporting requirements in the Federal \nFunding Accountability and Transparency Act, as amended. The proposed article also implements portions of the \n\n\n\nOMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 that cite those statutory requirements and 2 CFR part 170. The proposed article \nincludes no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance it implements.\n <h4>\n  G. Proposed Part 1136\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Other Administrative Requirements</h4>\n \n\n  The proposed part 1136 addresses seven articles of general terms and conditions. The seven articles specify the \nrecipients' and Government's rights and responsibilities in areas of administrative requirements other than financial \nand program management, property administration, recipient procurement procedures, and reporting (which are the \nfour areas addressed in the proposed parts 1128, 1130, 1132, and 1134 and discussed in sections II.C through F \nof this Supplementary Information section). The articles and associated prescriptions for DoD Components \nimplement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 in these other areas of administrative requirements, as the \nguidance relates to general award terms and conditions.\n \n  The articles are designated as OAR Articles I through VII and are in appendices A through G to the proposed part. \nThe associated prescriptions are in Subparts A through G of the proposed part. The subjects covered by the articles \n(and the appendices and subparts containing the articles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Submitting and maintaining recipient information (in Subpart A and appendix A)\n  \n   Records retention and access (in Subpart B and appendix B)\n  \n   Remedies and termination (in Subpart C and appendix C)\n  \n   Claims, disputes, and appeals (in Subpart D and appendix D)\n  \n   Collection of amounts due (in Subpart E and appendix E)\n  \n   Closeout (in Subpart F and appendix F)\n  \n   Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities (in Subpart G and appendix G)\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.G.1 through 7 of this Supplementary Information section address whether and how \nthe proposed implementation of the guidance in each article and its associated prescription for DoD Components \nvaries from, or clarifies, the related OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n  1. Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article I, \u201cSubmitting and maintaining recipient information,\u201d and related prescription for DoD \nComponents addresses requirements to register in the System for Award Management, report information to the \nFederal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and disclose evidence of certain \nintegrity-related matters to the DoD Inspector General. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25, 2 \nCFR 200.113, and 200.210(b)(1)(iii). The article includes one clarification of the guidance.\n \n\n  The clarification concerns the guidance in 2 CFR 200.113 that relates to mandatory disclosures of certain \nviolations of Federal criminal law. The proposed implementation in Section C of OAR Article I provides more \nspecifics than the OMB guidance\u2014e.g., by specifying transmission of the information to the DoD Inspector \n\n\n\nGeneral's office and grants officer and providing assurances about the safeguarding of the information provided to \nthe Government.\n <h5>\n  2. Records Retention and Access</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article II, \u201cRecords retention and access,\u201d and associated prescription for DoD Components \nimplement the OMB guidance on that subject in 2 CFR part 200. They do so with two clarifications.\n \n\n  The first clarification concerns the period during which the Government may disallow costs and recover funds on \nthe basis of an audit or other review of a recipient. The three portions of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 \npertinent to this clarification are in: (1) 2 CFR 200.333(b) on records retention requirements, which states that an \nagency may extend the records retention period by notifying the recipient in writing; (2) 2 CFR 200.336(c), which \nstates that the Government's right to access records is not limited to the records retention period but lasts as long \nas the recipient retains the records; and (3) 2 CFR 200.344 on post-closeout adjustments, which states that an \nagency must make any cost disallowance determination and notify the recipient within the record retention period. \nTo conform the period during which DoD may disallow costs with the period during which it may access the \nrecipient's records, the proposed OAR Article II specifies that the recipient is not required to retain records beyond \nthe standard records retention period delineated in 2 CFR 200.333 but, if it elects to do so, the records retention \nperiod for purposes of post-closeout adjustments is extended to be the same as the period during which the records \nare retained. This provision in OAR Article II thereby provides the written notification to recipients that is described \nin 2 CFR 200.333(b).\n \n\n  The second clarification concerns the retention period for records concerning exempt property. The clarification, \nwhich is in paragraph A.1 of the proposed article, is that the recipient must keep whatever property records it needs \nto keep for exempt property acquired under a DoD award, for as long as it needs to keep them, to ensure that any \nresidual Federal share of the value of that property is not later used as a contribution toward cost sharing or \nmatching requirements of another Federal award.\n <h5>\n  3. Remedies and Termination</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article III, \u201cRemedies and termination,\u201d and related prescription for DoD Components \nimplement the OMB guidance on that subject in 2 CFR part 200. The article and prescription include one variation \nfrom, and two clarifications of, the guidance.\n \n\n  The one variation is with respect to OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.342 that describes the conditions under which \ncosts incurred during a suspension or after a termination are allowable. To avoid potential confusion, Section C \nsegregates the implementation of the guidance into two paragraphs: (1) Paragraph C.1, to address costs resulting \nfrom obligations incurred by a recipient before the effective date of the suspension or termination; and (2) \nparagraph C.2, to address costs resulting from obligations incurred after that effective date. Paragraph C.1 includes \none condition not explicitly stated in the OMB guidance, which is that costs resulting from obligations incurred \nbefore the date of a termination are allowable only if they are noncancellable after the termination. This will provide \ngood stewardship of Federal funds by restoring a long-standing DoDGARs requirement for allowability of costs in \nthe case of termination, previously in 32 CFR 32.62(c) for awards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and \nother nonprofit organizations, and in 32 CFR 33.43(c) for awards to States, local governments, and Indian tribes.\n \n\n  The two clarifications are with respect to OMB guidance in:\n \n  \n\n\n\n   2 CFR 200.339(a)(1), which specifies that a Federal agency may unilaterally terminate an award based on a \nrecipient's failure to comply with award terms and conditions. To make clear that there must be an adequate reason \nfor a DoD Component to unilaterally terminate an award, which is a serious remedy, paragraph B.1.a of the \nproposed article affirms that the DoD standard is a recipient's \u201cmaterial\u201d failure to comply with award terms and \nconditions.\n  \n   2 CFR 200.339(a)(2), which adds termination for cause as a basis for unilateral termination of an award by the \nGovernment. For added clarity, since \u201ctermination for cause\u201d is not defined and likely would be interpreted by DoD \nofficials to be the same as termination for default (i.e., material failure to comply with award terms and conditions), \nparagraph B.1.a of the proposed article describes that added basis for a DoD Component's unilateral termination in \nplain language.\n \n <h5>\n  4. Claims, Disputes, and Appeals</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article IV, \u201cClaims, disputes and appeals,\u201d and associated prescription for DoD Components \nimplement existing DoDGARs requirements in 32 CFR 22.810. They also implement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR \n200.341 on recipients' opportunities to object to remedies taken for non-compliance. The article and prescription do \nso with no variations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  5. Collection of Amounts Due</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article V, \u201cCollection of amounts due,\u201d and related prescription for DoD Components \nimplement the OMB guidance on that subject, which is in 2 CFR 200.345. The article does not vary from the \nguidance but does clarify that the existing DoDGARs procedures in 32 CFR 22.820 for issuing demands for \npayment and transferring debts for collection continue to apply. That same clarification is stated at 2 CFR \n1103.225 in DoD's interim implementation of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.\n <h5>\n  6. Closeout</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article VI, \u201cCloseout,\u201d implements the OMB guidance on that subject. The article includes no \nvariations or clarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h5>\n  7. Post-closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed OAR Article VII, \u201cPost-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities,\u201d and associated \nprescription for DoD Components implement the OMB guidance on that subject. It does so with no variations or \nclarifications relative to the guidance.\n <h4>\n  H. Proposed Part 1138\u2014General Terms and Conditions on Requirements Related to Subawards</h4>\n \n  The proposed part 1138 addresses twelve articles of general terms and conditions related to subawards that \ninstitutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes make to all \ntypes of subrecipient entities under DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements. The articles and \nassociated prescriptions for DoD Components implement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 concerning \nsubawards, as that guidance relates to general terms and conditions.\n \n\n\n\n  The articles are designated as SUB Articles I through XII and are in appendices A through L to the proposed part. \nThe associated prescriptions are in Subparts A through L of the proposed part. The subjects covered by the articles \n(and the appendices and subparts containing the articles and associated prescriptions) are:\n \n  \n   Distinguishing subawards and procurements (in Subpart A and appendix A)\n  \n   Pre-award and time of award responsibilities (in Subpart B and appendix B)\n  \n   Informational content of subawards (in Subpart C and appendix C)\n  \n   Financial and program management requirements for subawards (in Subpart D and appendix D)\n  \n   Property requirements for subawards (in Subpart E and appendix E)\n  \n   Procurement procedures to include in subawards (in Subpart F and appendix F)\n  \n   Financial, programmatic, and property reporting requirements for subawards (in Subpart G and appendix G)\n  \n   Other administrative requirements for subawards (in Subpart H and appendix H)\n  \n   National policy requirements for subawards (in Subpart I and appendix I)\n  \n   Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration (in Subpart J and appendix J)\n  \n   Requirements concerning subrecipients' lower-tier subawards (in Subpart K and appendix K)\n  \n   Fixed-amount subawards (in Subpart L and appendix L)\n \n \n\n  The following subsections II.H.1 through 12 describe these twelve articles and each instance in which an article or \nits associated prescription for DoD Components varies from, or clarifies, the related OMB guidance in a way not \nalready described in sections II.C through II.G of this Supplementary Information section. The reason that some \nvariations and clarifications already were described in sections II.C through II.G is that SUB Articles IV through \nVIII address the administrative requirements that recipients are to include in their subaward terms and conditions. In \ndoing so, SUB Articles IV through VIII often instruct recipients to flow down to subrecipients the same administrative \nrequirement that applies to recipients, which therefore is in one of the 27 articles of general terms and conditions \ndescribed in sections II.C through II.G of this Supplementary Information section. For any of those articles that \nvaries from or clarifies the OMB guidance, that variation or clarification is described in sections II.C through II.G \nand will not be described again in the following subsections II.H.1 through 12.\n <h5>\n  1. Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements</h5>\n \n  The proposed SUB Article I, \u201cDistinguishing subawards and procurements,\u201d addresses the need for a recipient to \ndetermine the nature of each transaction into which it enters at the next lower tier under its award.\n <h5>\n  2. Pre-award and Time of Award Responsibilities</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article II, \u201cPre-award and time of award responsibilities,\u201d and associated prescription for DoD \nComponents include no variations or clarifications relative to the pertinent portions of the OMB guidance.\n\n\n\n <h5>\n  3. Informational Content of Subawards</h5>\n \n  The proposed SUB Article III, \u201cInformational content of subawards,\u201d and the related prescription for DoD \nComponents include one variation relative to the OMB guidance. The variation is from the guidance in 2 CFR \n200.331(a)(1)(xiii) that provides for the recipient's inclusion of the subrecipient's indirect cost rate as an information \nelement in every subaward. Because many nonprofit and for-profit entities deem their indirect cost rates to be \nproprietary, in order to protect confidential business information, the proposed SUB Article III varies from the \nguidance by providing flexibility for a recipient in that situation to exclude information about the subrecipient's \nindirect cost rate from the subaward.\n <h5>\n  4. Financial and Program Management Requirements for Subawards</h5>\n \n  The proposed SUB Article IV, \u201cFinancial and program management requirements for subawards,\u201d addresses the \ntypes of administrative requirements for subawards that FMS Articles I through VII address for awards under which \nthe subawards are made.\n <h5>\n  5. Property Requirements for Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article V, \u201cProperty requirements for subawards,\u201d covers the property administration \nrequirements for subawards that PROP Articles I through VI cover for awards under which the subawards are \nmade. SUB Article V and the related prescription for DoD Components include one clarification relative to the \nOMB guidance that sections II.D.1 through 6 of this Supplementary Information section did not already describe. \nThe added clarification is that a subrecipient would submit a request for property disposition instructions through \nthe recipient, and not directly to DoD as a recipient would do.\n <h5>\n  6. Procurement Procedures To Include in Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article VI, \u201cProcurement procedures to include in subawards,\u201d addresses the types of \nadministrative requirements for subawards that PROC Articles I through III address for awards under which the \nsubawards are made. SUB Article VI and the associated prescription for DoD Components include no variations or \nclarifications relative to the OMB guidance that sections II.E.1 through 3 of this Supplementary Information \nsection did not already describe.\n <h5>\n  7. Financial, Programmatic, and Property Reporting Requirements for Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article VII, \u201cFinancial, programmatic, and property reporting requirements for subawards,\u201d \ncovers the types of reporting for subawards that REP Articles I through IV cover for awards under which the \nsubawards are made. SUB Article VII and the related prescription for DoD Components include no variations or \nclarifications relative to the OMB guidance that sections II.F.1 through 4 of this Supplementary Information \nsection did not already describe.\n <h5>\n  8. Other Administrative Requirements for Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article VIII, \u201cOther administrative requirements for subawards,\u201d covers the administrative \nrequirements for subawards that OAR Articles I through VII cover for awards under which the subawards are made. \nSUB Article VIII and the related prescription for DoD Components include no variations or clarifications relative to \nthe OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  9. National Policy Requirements for Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article IX, \u201cNational policy requirements for subawards,\u201d addresses the flow down to \nsubawards of the requirements in NP Articles I-IV, which are addressed in the DoDGARs parts proposed in the \nNPRM following this one in this section of this issue of the Federal Register. SUB Article IX and the related \nprescription for DoD Components include two clarifications relative to the pertinent portions of the OMB guidance \nin 2 CFR part 200. The clarifications are that a recipient must immediately alert the DoD office administering its \naward if:\n \n  \n   An entity to which the recipient is about to make a subaward will not accept a subaward provision requiring the \nsubrecipient's compliance with an applicable national policy requirement; or\n  \n   At any time during the performance of a subaward, the recipient learns that\u2014or receives a credible allegation \nthat\u2014the subrecipient is not complying with an applicable national policy requirement.\n \n <h5>\n  10. Subrecipient Monitoring and Other Post-Award Administration</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article X, \u201cSubrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration,\u201d addresses \nrequirements for recipients' monitoring of subrecipients and related post-award administration of subawards that \nthey make under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. SUB Article X and the related prescription for DoD \nComponents include no variations or clarifications relative to the OMB guidance.\n <h5>\n  11. Requirements Concerning Subrecipients' Lower-Tier Subawards</h5>\n \n\n  The proposed SUB Article XI, \u201cRequirements concerning subrecipients' lower-tier subawards,\u201d specifies \nrequirements that a recipient must include in any subaward in which it judges that the subrecipient may make lower-\ntier subawards. SUB Article XI and the associated prescription for DoD Components include no variations or \nclarifications relative to the OMB guidance that sections II.H.1 through 10 of this Supplementary Information \nsection did not already address.\n <h5>\n  12. Fixed-Amount Subawards</h5>\n \n  The proposed SUB Article XII, \u201cFixed-amount subawards,\u201d specifies policy and procedures concerning recipients' \nuse of fixed-amount subawards under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. The article and associated \nprescription for DoD Components includes two variations relative to the OMB guidance concerning fixed-amount \nsubawards. Specifically, SUB Article XII does not provide for:\n \n  \n   A subrecipient's certification to the recipient at the end of the subaward that it completed the project or activity or \nexpended the level of effort, as described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.201(b)(3). A certification is not \nneeded because the article defines appropriate uses of a fixed-amount subaward based on well-defined outcomes \nthat are sufficiently observable and verifiable by the recipient so as to obviate the need to rely on a subrecipient's \nassurances. The article clarifies that outcomes are distinct from inputs, such as level of effort, needed to achieve \nthe outcomes.\n  \n   The need for a recipient's prior approval for a change in the subrecipient's principal investigator or other project \nleader, as described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.201(b)(5). It is inappropriate to require prior approvals for \n\n\n\nchanges in inputs, such as which individuals carry out the project or program, because the article links the \nappropriate use of fixed-amount subawards to well-defined outcomes.\n \n <h3>\n  III. Relationship of Administrative Requirements in This NPRM to Future DoD Implementation of the OMB \nGuidance</h3>\n \n\n  As noted in section III of the Supplementary Information section of the first of the NPRMs in this section of this \nissue of the Federal Register, DoD will complete the remaining needed updates of the DoDGARs in a subsequent \nset of proposals for public comment. That future set of proposals will include implementation of the OMB guidance \non administrative requirements in 2 CFR part 200 as it applies to both: (1) award-specific terms and conditions of \nDoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements; and (2) post-award administration. Those future proposals \nwill complement the proposed DoDGARs parts 1128 through 1138 in this NPRM, which implement the guidance on \nadministrative requirements as it applies to general award terms and conditions.\n \n  The reason for these separate implementations is that they address distinct audiences at different points during \nthe award life cycle. The implementation in this NPRM addresses an individual in a DoD awarding office who is \nresponsible for drafting general terms and conditions to be used in the office's many future awards under one or \nmore programs with similar requirements (e.g., its research programs or its training programs). In contrast, the \nimplementations of the guidance as it applies to:\n \n  \n   Award-specific terms and conditions will address awarding officials in that awarding office who will later be making \nthe individual awards under the programs. The portions of the DoDGARs addressing those officials must be tailored \nto their responsibilities, which include considering the specific circumstances of each award before deciding which, \nif any, provisions in the general terms and conditions need to be supplemented or even overridden by terms and \nconditions specific to that award.\n  \n   Post-award administration will address officials responsible for subsequently administering the awards. In DoD, \nthose officials often are located in offices specifically designated to provide award administration services that are \norganizationally and physically separate from the awarding offices. The officials' responsibilities differ in kind and \nnot just in degree from those of the awarding officials. Again, the portions of the DoDGARs addressing those \nofficials needs to be tailored to their distinct responsibilities.\n \n \n  Segregating the DoDGARs implementation of the guidance for these three sets of DoD officials enables the \nregulations to more clearly address each of the different audiences. Doing so makes it easier for each audience to \nunderstand what the regulations require of them, and thereby promotes compliance.\n <h3>\n  IV. Desired Inputs</h3>\n \n  DoD welcomes comments on all aspects of the seven proposed parts in this NPRM, as inputs from affected \nentities will help make the final regulations better. Questions on which commenters' inputs would be helpful include:\n \n  \n\n   Do the seven proposed parts appear to include any substantive variations from the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part \n200, as that guidance applies to general award terms and conditions\u2014other than those noted in section II of this \nSupplementary Information section?\n  \n\n\n\n   In each of the proposed parts 1128 through 1138, does the separation of administrative requirements into two \nportions\u2014i.e., the wording of terms and conditions for recipients in the appendices to the part and the prescriptions \nfor DoD Components in the corresponding subparts of the part\u2014help make requirements clearer for affected \nparties?\n  \n   Does the use of plain language and pronouns improve the readability and understandability of the content of the \nproposed parts?\n \n <h3>\n  V. Regulatory Analysis</h3>\n <h5>\n  Executive Order 12866, \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d and Executive Order 13563, \u201cImproving Regulation \nand Regulatory Review\u201d</h5>\n \n\n  Executive Order 12866, as supplemented by Executive Order 13563, directs each Federal agency to: propose \nregulations only after determining that benefits justify costs; tailor regulations to minimize burdens on society, \nconsistent with achieving regulatory objectives; maximize net benefits when selecting among regulatory \napproaches; specify performance objectives, to the extent feasible, rather than the behavior or manner of \ncompliance; and seek the views of those likely to be affected before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, where \nfeasible and appropriate. The Department of Defense has determined that a regulatory implementation of 2 CFR \npart 200 that includes standard wording of general terms and conditions for DoD Components' grant and \ncooperative agreement awards will maximize long-term benefits in relation to costs and burdens for recipients of \nthose awards. In providing\u2014for the first time\u2014uniformity across research and other awards, the approach will \nbenefit institutions of higher education and other types of recipients that receive awards from diverse defense \nprograms and numerous DoD Component awarding offices. The Department informally consulted representatives \nof the most affected recipient community during development of this regulatory proposal. This rule has been \ndesignated a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, although not an \neconomically significant one. Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed by OMB.\n <h5>\n  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</h5>\n \n\n  Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Unfunded Mandates Act) (2 U.S.C. 1532) requires \nthat a Federal agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before issuing a rule that includes any Federal \nmandate that may result in the expenditure in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in the \naggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2015, \nthat inflation-adjusted amount in current dollars is approximately $146 million. The Department of Defense has \ndetermined that this proposed regulatory action will not result in expenditures by State, local, and tribal \ngovernments, or by the private sector, of that amount or more in any one year.\n <h5>\n  Regulatory Flexibility Act</h5>\n \n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency that is proposing a rule to provide a regulatory flexibility analysis \nor to certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

It thereby implements OMB \nguidance in:\n \n  (a) 2 CFR 200.302, 200.303, and 200.328; and\n \n  (b) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance \naccomplishments and reporting under awards.\n\n\n\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.105\n \n  Content of FMS Article I.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for recipients' \nfinancial management systems.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for FMS \nArticle I.\n \n  (2) Exceptions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:\n \n\n  (i) Reserve Section A of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will \nreceive:\n \n  (A) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or\n \n  (B) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.\n \n  (ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of \nawards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments (e.g., \nthrough unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between \nfinancial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve \nparagraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.\n <h2>\n  Subpart B Payments Fms Article Ii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.200\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article II.\n \n  FMS Article II contains requirements related to payments under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in \n2 CFR 200.305.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.205\n \n  Content of FMS Article II.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address payment method; payment \ntiming and amounts, which relate to cash management; frequency of payment requests; and matters related to \nrecipients' depositories, including interest earned on advance payments.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for FMS Article II with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as \ndescribed in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.210 through 1128.220.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.210\n \n\n\n\n  Payment requirements for States.\n \n  (a) Policy. Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR \npart 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with \ndistinct requirements that apply to different programs:\n \n  (1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under \u201cmajor programs,\u201d as \ndefined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. \nThose agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest \nliability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well \nas the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the \nfunds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so subpart A applies relatively infrequently.\n \n  (2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grant and cooperative agreement awards to States\u2014\ni.e., awards that are not under major programs.\n \n\n  (b) Default wording. Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part \nincludes default wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of subpart B of 31 CFR part \n205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if \nno award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program \nin the applicable Treasury-State agreement.\n \n  (c) Exception for awards under major programs. If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions \nthat will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in subpart \nA of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:\n \n\n  (1) Use appendix B's default wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and\n \n\n  (2) In each award subject to subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make \npayments to the recipient subject to the requirements in subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-\nState agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.215\n \n  Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian \ntribes.\n \n\n  (a) Policy. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for awards\u2014advance \npayments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's \ngeneral terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.\n \n\n  (1) Advance payments. With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this \nsection, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in \nadvance as long as the recipient maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both:\n \n  (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government \nand its disbursement of the funds for program or project purposes; and\n \n\n\n\n  (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the \nwording of FMS Article I (see subpart A and appendix A to this part).\n \n  (2) Reimbursement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if \nthe awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the \nFederal Government.\n \n\n  (b) Default award terms and conditions. Appendix B provides default wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a \nDoD Component:\n \n  (1) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request \nadvance payments; and\n \n  (2) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those \nawards to request advance payments.\n \n\n  (c) Alternative award terms and conditions. A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's default \nwording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to \nspecify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:\n \n  (1) Would replace Appendix B's default wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement \nmethod of payment;\n \n  (2) Must include appendix B's default wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be \nrenumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;\n \n  (3) Should omit appendix B's default wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply \nspecifically to advance payments; and\n \n  (4) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after \nreceipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably \nbelieved to be improper.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.220\n \n  Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.\n \n  (a) Policy. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by \nelectronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury \nregulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) Electronic funds transfer. Appendix B provides default wording for Section C \nof FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from \nthe Governmentwide requirement.\n \n  (2) Other payment procedures or instructions. A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its \ngeneral terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions \nor information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may \ninsert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, \nformats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.\n\n\n\n <h2>\n  Subpart C Allowable Costs Period of Availability of Funds and Fee or Profit Fms Article Iii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.300\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article III.\n \n\n  FMS Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies what costs are allowable as charges to awards and \nwhen they are allowable. It also specifies restrictions on payment of fee or profit. It thereby implements OMB \nguidance in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;200.209 and 200.309 and subpart E of 2 CFR part 200. It also partially implements 2 CFR \n200.201(b)(1)and 200.323(c), as those sections apply to the cost principles to be used in relation to subawards \nand contracts, respectively.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.305\n \n  Content of FMS Article III.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address allowability of costs and \npermissibility of fee or profit.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording \nappendix C to this part provides for FMS Article III with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as \ndescribed in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.310 through 1128.325.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.310\n \n  Cost principles.\n \n  (a) Policy. The set of Governmentwide cost principles applicable to a particular entity type governs the allowability \nof costs that may be:\n \n  (1) Charged to each cost-type:\n \n  (i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;\n \n  (ii) Subaward to a subrecipient of that entity type at any tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement; and\n \n  (iii) Procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type awarded by a recipient of a DoD grant or \ncooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative \nagreement.\n \n  (2) Considered in establishing the amount of any:\n \n  (i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under an award, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or\n \n  (ii) Fixed-price procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type that is awarded by either a recipient of \na DoD award or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.\n \n\n\n\n  (b) Default wording. Because almost all DoD grants and cooperative agreements are cost-type awards, appendix \nC includes default wording for Section A of FMS Article III that specifies use of the applicable Governmentwide cost \nprinciples in the determination of the allowability of costs.\n \n\n  (c) Alternative award terms and conditions. A DoD Component may reserve any paragraph of appendix C's default \nwording for Section A of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the Component is certain that no \nentities of the type to which the paragraph applies could be recipients of awards using those general terms and \nconditions or recipients of subawards or procurement transactions at any tier under those awards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.315\n \n\n  Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge \npublication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to \nDoD grants and cooperative agreements.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's \ngeneral terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS \nArticle III.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and \nconditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using \nthose general terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.320\n \n  Period of availability of funds.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the period during which Federal \nfunds are available for obligation by recipients for project or program purposes.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording \nappendix C to this part provides for Section C of FMS Article III to specify the period of availability of funds.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.325\n \n  Fee or profit.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients may neither \nreceive fee or profit nor pay fee or profit to subrecipients.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for \nSection D of FMS Article III to specify the limitation on payment of fee or profit.\n <h2>\n  Subpart D Revision of Budget and Program Plans Fms Article Iv</h2>\n \n\n\n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.400\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article IV.\n \n  FMS Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to changes in recipients' budget \nand program plans. It thereby implements OMB guidance in \u00a7&thinsp;200.308 of 2 CFR part 200 and partially \nimplements \u00a7&thinsp;200.209 and subpart E of that part.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.405\n \n  Content of FMS Article IV.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the changes in budget and \nprogram plans for which a recipient is required to request DoD Component prior approval and the procedures for \nsubmitting those requests.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article IV \nthe default wording appendix D to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.410 through 1128.430.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.410\n \n  Approved budget.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. As described in 2 CFR 200.308(a), the approved budget for a grant or cooperative agreement \nmay include both the Federal and non-Federal shares of funding under the award or only the Federal share.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. For DoD grants and cooperative agreements, the approved budget includes the Federal \nshare and any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must include the \ndefault wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of FMS Article IV.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.415\n \n  Prior approvals for non-construction activities.\n \n\n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for \nrevisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction award, which includes for the \npurposes of this section non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-\nconstruction.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation of the guidance. The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of \nthe DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the \ncorresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction \nawards may only require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (i.e., prior approvals other than \nthose authorized by this subpart) in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.\n \n\n\n\n  (c) Scope or objective, cost sharing or matching, and additional Federal funds. A DoD Component's general terms \nand conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:\n \n  (1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).\n \n  (2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI \nrequires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).\n \n  (3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR \n200.308(c)(1)(viii).\n \n  (d) Personnel changes, disengagements, or reductions in time. A DoD Component must include the following prior \napproval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and also may include them in general \nterms and conditions of other non-construction awards:\n \n  (1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).\n \n  (2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project, \nas described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).\n \n  (e) Costs requiring prior approval under the cost principles. With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by \nthe cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):\n \n  (1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for \nindirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and \nconditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient \nentities.\n \n  (2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before \ncharging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior \napproval requirement individually and decide:\n \n  (i) Which, if any, to waive; and\n \n  (ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions (e.g., a DoD \nComponent might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases \nunder an award, but elect to waive it only for equipment that is to be used primarily in carrying out the project or \nprogram supported by the award).\n \n  (f) Transfers of funds and subawards. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction \nawards may include prior approval requirements for:\n \n  (1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).\n \n  (2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).\n \n  (3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the \ngeneral terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using \nthose terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. \nNote that, as a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is \nnot appropriate for grants and cooperative agreements that support research.\n \n\n\n\n  (g) Pre-award costs, carry forward of unobligated balances, and no-cost extensions. (1) A DoD Component's \ngeneral terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the \nbeginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance \nin 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards and a DoD Component \nshould override the default and require recipients to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for pre-award costs \nonly in exceptional circumstances.\n \n  (2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of \nperformance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent \nperiods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.\n \n  (3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in \nthe periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR \n200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the \ngeneral terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies (e.g., \nthe incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD \nFinancial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.\n \n\n  (h) Award terms and conditions. Appendix D to this part provides default wording for inclusion in a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. \nSpecifically:\n \n\n  (1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-\nconstruction awards must include the default wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of \nFMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and \nconditions, paragraph B.1.g.\n \n\n  (2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for \nresearch awards must include the default wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS \nArticle IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for \nother non-construction awards.\n \n\n  (3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-\nconstruction awards must include the default wording that Appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article \nIV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to \nobtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects \nto waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific \ntypes of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the \nother prior approval requirements in the cost principles).\n \n\n  (4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions \nfor non-construction awards may include the default wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, \nand B.1.h and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the default wording as appropriate to \nthe awards using its general terms and conditions (e.g., to limit the authorization for pre-award costs to a period \nless than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).\n \n\n  (5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, \nthe DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the default wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.\n\n\n\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.420\n \n  Prior approvals for construction activities.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for \nrevisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction award or construction activities under an \naward that supports both construction and non-construction activities.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation of the guidance. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) \nthrough terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for \nconstruction awards may only require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (i.e., prior \napprovals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR \n1126.3.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or \nawards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:\n \n  (1) Must include the default wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.\n \n\n  (2) May reserve or remove the default wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C \nof FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction \nactivities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as \nSection C).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.425\n \n  Additional prior approval for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. Guidance on an additional prior approval requirement for awards that support both \nconstruction and non-construction activities is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5).\n \n  (b) DoD implementation of the guidance. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5) through terms and \nconditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. If a DoD Component establishes general terms and conditions for awards that \nsupport both non-construction and construction activities, the DoD Component may add the prior approval \nrequirement for funding or budget transfers between construction and non-construction activities that is described in \nOMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5). The default wording that appendix D to this part provides for Section B of \nFMS Article IV includes a reserved paragraph B.3 in which the DoD Component may add appropriate wording to \ninclude that prior approval requirement.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.430\n \n  Procedures for prior approvals.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. Guidance on procedures related to recipient requests for prior approval is contained in 2 CFR \n200.308(h) and (i).\n \n\n\n\n  (b) DoD implementation of the guidance. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i) for prior \napproval requests through award terms and conditions.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component must:\n \n  (1) Include the default wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph D.1 of FMS Article IV of its general \nterms and conditions.\n \n  (2) Insert appropriate wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph D.2 that appendix D to this part includes in FMS \nArticle IV to specify:\n \n  (i) The format the recipient must use when it requests approval for budget revisions. As described in 2 CFR \n200.308(h), the award term may allow the recipient to submit a letter of request but otherwise must specify that the \nrecipient use the same format it used for budget information in its application or proposal.\n \n  (ii) Any other procedural instructions related to requests for prior approvals for budget or program revisions (e.g., \nto whom requests must be submitted) that are common to the awards using the general terms and conditions. For \nprocedural instructions that will vary from one award to another, it is appropriate to include wording that points to \nthe award-specific terms and conditions as the source of the information.\n <h2>\n  Subpart E Non Federal Audits Fms Article V</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.500\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article V.\n \n  FMS Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to audits required under the \nSingle Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C., chapter 75).

A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the default wording in appendix E if there will be no \nsubawards to for-profit entities under any award using those terms and conditions.\n <h2>\n  Subpart F Cost Sharing or Matching Fms Article Vi</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.600\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article VI.\n \n  FMS Article VI sets forth requirements concerning recipients' cost sharing or matching under awards. It thereby \nimplements OMB guidance in:\n \n\n\n\n  (a) 2 CFR 200.306 and 200.308(c)(1)(vii); and\n \n  (b) 2 CFR 200.434, in conjunction with FMS Article III in appendix C to this part.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.605\n \n  Content of FMS Article VI.\n \n  (a) Requirement. General terms and conditions for DoD grants and cooperative agreements under which there \nmay be required cost sharing or matching must specify the criteria for determining allowability, methods for \nvaluation, and requirements for documentation of cost sharing or matching.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as \nFMS Article VI the default wording appendix F to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are \nauthorized by \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.610 through 1128.635.\n \n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve FMS Article VI of its general terms and conditions if it determines \nthat there will be no cost sharing or matching required under any of the awards using those terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.610\n \n  General requirement for cost sharing or matching.\n \n  (a) Requirement. (1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:\n \n  (i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover \npages.\n \n  (ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not \nvoluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any \nthat involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.\n \n  (iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of \ncost share or match.\n \n  (2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's \nprior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific \ncontributions included in the approved budget (e.g., to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the \napproved budget).\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms \nand conditions must include the default wording Section I of Appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS \nArticle VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require \nrecipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as \ndescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.615\n \n  General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.\n \n\n\n\n  (a) OMB guidance. The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost \nsharing or matching under Federal awards.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the \ndefault wording Section II of appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the \nallowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms \nand conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to \naccept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general \nterms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.620\n \n  Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides that unrecovered indirect costs may only be \nincluded as part of cost sharing and matching with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD Components must allow any recipient that either has an approved negotiated \nindirect cost rate or is using the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f) to count unrecovered indirect costs \ntoward any required cost sharing or matching under awards. The basis for this policy is that recipients' indirect costs \nthat are allowable and allocable to DoD projects and programs are legitimate costs of carrying out those projects \nand programs.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. To implement the policy in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component's \ngeneral terms and conditions must include the default wording Section III of appendix F to this part provides as \nSection C of FMS Article VI unless a statute requires otherwise.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.625\n \n  Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(3) specifies that, with the prior approval of the Federal \nawarding agency, recipients may use program income to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of their \nawards.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the \ndefault wording Section IV of appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII \nof those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using \neither:\n \n  (i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of \u00a7&thinsp;1128.720; or\n \n  (ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of \u00a7&thinsp;1128.720, that includes use of at \nleast some program income as cost sharing or matching.\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and \nconditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.630\n \n  Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:\n \n  (1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or \nmatching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and\n \n  (2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are \nallowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the \ndonations are to be valued in those cases.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, \nwith the following clarifications:\n \n  (1) Cost principles to be used for valuation. (i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or \nproperty toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to \nthe entity making the contribution. Note that the applicable cost principles are in subpart E of 2 CFR part 200 only if \nthe entity making the contribution is an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local \ngovernment, or Indian tribe.\n \n  (ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and \nequipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property (i.e., counting \nthe full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). Note, however, that depreciation included in a \nrecipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an \nindividual award.\n \n  (2) Donations of property to projects or programs under awards. (i) In addition to donations of buildings or land \ndescribed in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, \ndonate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for \nclarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD \nComponent's approval:\n \n  (A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and\n \n  (B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or \nmatching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).\n \n  (ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, \nDoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion \nof the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of \nthe acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Government \nacquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best \navoided if possible.\n \n  (iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an \naward, it should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing \n\n\n\nso enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost \nrate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the \ncomputation of the rate.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the \ndefault wording Section V of appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.\n \n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the default \nwording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, \nor other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.635\n \n  Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(e) through (j) and 2 CFR 200.434(b) through (g) specifies \nhow to value and document various types of third-party in-kind contributions or donations for cost sharing or \nmatching purposes.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the OMB guidance described in paragraph (a) of this \nsection as it applies to valuation and documentation of third-party in-kind contributions and donations, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the default wording Section VI of appendix F to this part \nprovides as Section F of FMS Article VI.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve any paragraph of the default \nwording Section VI of appendix F to this part provides for Section F of FMS Article VI if the DoD Component \ndetermines that there will be no third-party in-kind contributions of the type the paragraph addresses under awards \nusing those terms and conditions.\n <h2>\n  Subpart G Program Income Fms Article Vii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.700\n \n  Purpose of FMS Article VII.\n \n  FMS Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for program income that recipients \nearn. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.80 and 200.307.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.705\n \n  Content of FMS Article VII.\n \n  (a) Requirement. General terms and conditions for DoD grants and cooperative agreements must address the \nkinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the \nrecipient's accountability for it, and related matters.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article \nVII the default wording appendix G to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording of Sections A, D, and E \nof the article that are authorized by \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.710 through 1128.725.\n\n\n\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.710\n \n  What program income includes.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. Under the definition of \u201cprogram income\u201d at 2 CFR 200.80, and related OMB guidance at 2 \nCFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or award terms and conditions may include as program income:\n \n  (1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and\n \n  (2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation. Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after \nopportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed \nin paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the \nFederal Government.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD \nComponent must use the default wording provided in Section I of appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS \nArticle VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and \n(2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.\n \n\n  (2) Exceptions. If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including one or both of the types of \nincome described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the default \nwording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:\n \n\n  (i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c \nand insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the \nlist of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.\n \n\n  (ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD \nComponent would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, \nthereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.715\n \n  Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.\n \n  (a) Policy. Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for \npublic comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that \nrecipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and \nroyalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including \nthe default wording provided in Section III of appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Exception. If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for establishing recipient obligations for the \nlicense fees and royalties described in paragraph (a) of this section, it may reserve Section D of FMS Article VII in \nits general terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.720\n \n  Program income use.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might \nspecify that recipients use program income they earn.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use \nprogram income under awards using those terms and conditions.\n \n  (1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:\n \n  (i) Addition. A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, \nwhich consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.\n \n  (ii) Deduction. A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine \nnet allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or \nmatching.\n \n  (iii) Cost sharing or matching. A recipient under this alternative counts program income toward its required cost \nsharing or matching.\n \n\n  (iv) Combination. The fourth alternative is a combination of the three described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) \nof this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar \nlimit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.\n \n\n  (2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and \nconditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.\n \n\n  (3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described \nin paragraph (a) of this section. However, note that the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of \na combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at \nthe time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required \ncost sharing or matching.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. (1) Default\u2014addition alternative. In accordance with the DoD implementation in \nparagraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the default wording provided in Section IV of appendix \nG to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:\n \n  (i) Research awards; and\n \n  (ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Deduction alternative. A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program \nincome should modify the default wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:\n \n  (i) Substituting the following wording for the default wording of paragraph E.1: \u201c1. You must use any program \nincome that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved \nbudget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of the award.\u201d\n \n  (ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4 such as the following to inform recipients how the award will change if \nprogram income is deducted: \u201cIf you report program income on the SF-425, we will recalculate the Federal share of \nthe budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share \nor shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the \noriginally approved and recalculated budget amounts.\u201d\n \n\n  (3) Cost-sharing or matching alternative. A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching \nalternative for use of program income should replace the default wording appendix G to this part provides for \nSection E with the following wording: \u201cYou must use any program income that you earn during the period of \nperformance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program \nincome must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.\u201d\n \n\n  (4) A combination of alternatives. A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, \nand cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies \nrequirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that \nalternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1128.725\n \n  Program income after the period of performance.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency \nregulations, award terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that \na recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of \nperformance.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be \naccountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of \nFMS Article VII the default wording for that section that is provided in Section V of appendix G to this part. That \nwording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after \nthe end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly \naddressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.\n <h3>\n  Appendix A to Part 1128\u2014Terms and Conditions for FMS Article I, \u201cFinancial Management System \nStandards\u201d</h3>\n \n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in FMS Article I in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;1128.105 \nof this part:\n \n  FMS Article I.

Your system of internal controls must conform to OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.303. \nWith respect to paragraph (e) of 2 CFR 200.303, your internal control system must include measures to safeguard \nany information that Federal statute, Executive order, or regulation requires to be protected (e.g., personally \nidentifiable or export controlled information), whether generated under the award or provided to you and identified \nas being subject to protection.\n <h3>\n  Appendix B to Part 1128\u2014Terms and Conditions for FMS Article II, \u201cPayments\u201d</h3>\n \n  DoD Components must use the following default wording in FMS Article II in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1128.205 \nthrough 1128.220 of this part, which permit substitution or addition of wording, or both, when appropriate:\n \n  FMS Article II. Payments. (December 2014)\n \n\n  Section A. Awards to States. If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award do not identify it as an award \nsubject to subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 (Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the Cash \nManagement Improvement Act), then this award is subject to subpart B of that part. Consistent with subpart B of 31 \nCFR part 205:\n \n  1. Payment method, timing, and amounts. You must:\n \n  a. Minimize the time between your receipt of a payment under this award and your disbursement of those funds for \nprogram purposes.\n \n  b. Limit the amount of each advance payment request to the minimum amount you need to meet your actual, \nimmediate cash requirements for carrying out the program or project.\n \n  c. Submit each advance payment request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested \namount for program purposes, so that your receipt of the funds will be as close in time as is administratively feasible \nto your actual cash outlay for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect \ncosts.\n \n  2. Interest. Unlike awards subject to subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, neither you nor we will incur any interest \nliability due to a difference in timing between your receipt of payments under this award and your disbursement of \nthose funds for program purposes.\n \n\n  Section B. Awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian \ntribes.\n \n  1. Payment method. Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you are \nauthorized to request advance payments under this award. That authorization is contingent on your continuing to \nmaintain, or demonstrating the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between \nyour receipt of each payment and your disbursement of the funds for program purposes. Note that you are not \n\n\n\nrequired to request advance payments and may instead, at your option, request reimbursements of funds after you \ndisburse them for program purposes.\n \n  2. Amounts requested. You must:\n \n  a. Limit the amount of any advance payment request to the minimum amount needed to meet your actual, \nimmediate cash requirements for carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project, including direct \nprogram or project costs and a proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.\n \n  b. Exclude from any payment request amounts you are withholding from payments to contractors to assure \nsatisfactory completion of the work. You may request those amounts when you make the payments to the \ncontractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of the work.\n \n  c. Exclude from any payment request amounts from any of the following sources that are available to you for \nprogram purposes under this award: program income, including repayments to a revolving fund; rebates; refunds; \ncontract settlements; audit recoveries; and interest earned on any of those funds. You must disburse those funds \nfor program purposes before requesting additional funds from us.\n \n  3. Timing of requests. For any advance payment you request, you should submit the request approximately 10 \ndays before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for program purposes. With time for agency processing \nof the request, that should result in payment as close as is administratively feasible to your actual disbursements for \nprogram or project purposes.\n \n  4. Frequency of requests. You may request payments as often as you wish unless you have been granted a \nwaiver from requirements to receive payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT). If you have been granted a \nwaiver from EFT requirements, the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify the frequency with \nwhich you may submit payment requests.\n \n  5. Withholding of payments. We will withhold payments for allowable costs under the award at any time during the \nperiod of performance only if one or more of the following applies:\n \n  a. We suspend either payments or the award, or disallow otherwise allowable costs, as a remedy under OAR \nArticle III due to your material failure to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of this \naward. If we suspend payments and not the award, we will release withheld payments upon your subsequent \ncompliance. If we suspend the award, then amounts of payments are subject to adjustment in accordance with the \nterms and conditions of OAR Article III.\n \n  b. You are delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, \u201cPolicies for Federal Credit \nPrograms and Non-Tax Receivables,\u201d in which case we may, after reasonable notice, inform you that we will not \nmake any further payments for costs you incurred after a specified date until you correct the conditions or liquidate \nthe indebtedness to the Federal Government.\n \n  c. The award-specific terms and conditions include additional requirements that provide for withholding of \npayments based on conditions identified during our pre-award risk evaluation, in which case you should have been \nnotified about the nature of those conditions and the actions needed to remove the additional requirements.\n \n  6. Depository requirements.\n \n  a. There are no eligibility requirements for depositories you use for funds you receive under this award.\n \n\n\n\n  b. You are not required to deposit funds you receive under this award in a depository account separate from \naccounts in which you deposit other funds.

Clarifications concerning charges for professional journal publications. For an entity that Section A of \nthis article makes subject to the cost principles in subpart E of 2 CFR part 200:\n \n  1. Costs of publishing in professional journals are allowable under 2 CFR 200.461(b) only if they are consistently \napplied across the organization. An organization may not charge costs of journal publications as direct costs to this \naward if it charges any of the same type of costs for other journal publications as indirect costs.\n \n  2. \u201cCosts of publication or sharing of research results\u201d in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) are the \u201ccharges for professional \njournal publications\u201d described in 2 CFR 200.461(b) and subject to the conditions of 2 CFR 200.461(b)(1) and (2).\n\n\n\n \n\n  Section C.

Federal interest in donated property. Donating buildings, land, or other property to the project, rather than \ncharging depreciation, results in a Federal interest in the property in accordance with PROP Article I of these terms \nand conditions.\n \n\n  VI. SECTION F OF FMS ARTICLE VI. DoD Components must use the following default wording in Section F of \nFMS Article VI or reserve the section, in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;1128.635 of this part:\n \n\n  Section F. Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.\n \n  1. General. If a third party furnishes goods or services to you or subrecipients that are to be counted toward cost \nsharing or matching under this award, the entity to which the third party furnishes the goods or services (i.e., you or \na subrecipient) must document the fair market value of those in-kind contributions and, to the extent feasible, \nsupport those values using the same methods the entity uses internally.\n \n  2. Valuation of third-party services. You must establish values for third-party volunteer services and services of \nthird parties' employees furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:\n \n  a. Volunteer services. Volunteer services furnished by third party professional and technical personnel, \nconsultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor must be valued in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(e).\n \n  b.

When a third-party organization furnishes the services of its employees to \nyou or a subrecipient, values for the contributions must be established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(f).\n \n  c. Additional requirement for donations to nonprofit organizations. For volunteer services or services of third \nparties' employees furnished to a nonprofit organization:\n \n  i. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.434(e) also applies and may require the nonprofit organization to allocate a \nproportionate share of its applicable indirect costs to the donated services.\n \n\n\n\n  ii. The indirect costs that the nonprofit organization allocates to the donated services in that case must be \nconsidered project costs and may be either reimbursed under the award or counted toward required cost sharing or \nmatching, but not both.\n \n  2. Valuation of third-party property. You must establish values for third-party property furnished to you or \nsubrecipients as follows:\n \n  a. Supplies donated by third parties. When a third party organization donates supplies (e.g., office, laboratory, \nworkshop, or classroom supplies), the value that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed \nthe fair market value of the supplies at the time of donation.\n \n  b. Equipment, buildings, or land donated by third parties.\n \n  i. The value of third-party donations of equipment, buildings, or land that may be counted toward cost sharing or \nmatching when the third party transferred title to you or a subrecipient depends on the purpose of the award in \naccordance with the following:\n \n  A. If one of the purposes of the award is to assist you or the subrecipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings, \nor land, you may count the aggregate fair market value of the donated property toward cost sharing or matching.\n \n  B. If the award's purposes instead include only the support of activities that require the use of equipment, \nbuildings, or land, you may only charge depreciation unless you obtain our prior approval to count as cost sharing \nor matching the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land.\n \n  ii. The values of the donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the \nentity to which the third party transferred title to the property, with the qualifications specified in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(1) \nand (2) for donated land and buildings and donated equipment, respectively.\n \n  c. Use of space donated by third parties. If a third party makes space available for use by you or a subrecipient, \nthe value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable \nspace as established by an independent appraisal, as described in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(3).\n \n  d. Equipment loaned by third parties. If a third party loans equipment for use by you or a subrecipient, the value \nthat you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed its fair rental value.\n <h3>\n  Appendix G to Part 1128\u2014Terms and Conditions for FMS Article VII, \u201cProgram Income\u201d</h3>\n \n\n  I.

Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Government and \nrecipients.\n \n  (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the \ncorresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some \nsituations.\n \n  (c) The following table shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A \nthrough F to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in subparts A through F, respectively):\n \n  \n   \n    &emsp;\n   \n    \n     \n      In . . .\n     \n      You will find terms and conditions specifying recipients' rights and responsibilities related to . . .\n     \n      That would appear in an award within PROP Article . . .\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     \n      Appendix A\n     \n      Title to property\n     \n      I.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix B\n     \n      Property management system\n     \n      II.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix C\n     \n      Use and disposition of real property\n     \n      III.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix D\n     \n      Use and disposition of equipment and supplies\n     \n      IV.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix E\n     \n      Use and disposition of federally owned property\n     \n      V.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix F\n     \n      Intangible property\n     \n      VI.\n    \n   \n  \n \n <h2>\n  Subpart a Title to Property Prop Article I</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.100\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article I.\n \n  PROP Article I specifies in whom and under what conditions title to property vests under the award. It thereby \nimplements OMB guidance:\n \n  (a) Pertaining to vesting of title to property, in 2 CFR 200.311(a), 200.312(a), 200.313(a), 200.314(a), and \n200.315(a).\n \n  (b) Pertaining to the property trust relationship in 2 CFR 200.316.\n \n\n\n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.105\n \n  Title to property acquired under awards.\n \n\n  (a) General policy. Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, \nconstruction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other \nthan by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in \nPROP Articles II-IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.\n \n  (b) Exceptions to the general policy when there is statutory authority\u2014(1) Exempt property in general. If a DoD \nComponent has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either \nunconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II-IV and VI. This subpart refers to \nacquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority\u2014and elects to use it\u2014as \u201cexempt \nproperty.\u201d\n \n  (2) Research awards. (i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property \n(i.e., equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary \npurpose is conducting scientific research\u2014without further obligation to the Government or subject to conditions the \nDoD Component deems appropriate\u2014if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative \nagreement for basic or applied research.\n \n  (ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and \nresearch-related education and training, DoD Components shall make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. \n6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three \nconditions:\n \n  (A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no \nlonger needed for those purposes.\n \n  (B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see \nsubpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal \nparticipation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that \nthe recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or \nmatching purposes on Federal awards.\n \n  (C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the \nPrincipal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. Unless a DoD Component has a statute authorizing it to identify \nacquired property as exempt property, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, it must use the default wording \nAppendix A to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article I.\n \n\n  (2) Exceptions. (i) If a DoD Component has statutory authority such as described in paragraph (b) of this section, \nand elects to use that authority for awards subject to its general terms and conditions, it must insert wording in \nparagraph A.2 of PROP Article I to:\n \n  (A) Identify the type or types of property it is excepting from the standard requirements for title vesting, use, and \ndisposition contained in PROP Articles II through IV and VI and reporting requirements contained in REP Article III \nof the general terms and conditions.\n \n\n\n\n  (B) If it is excepting the property from some, but not all, of the standard requirements, identify the requirements to \nwhich the exempt property will be subject.\n \n\n  (ii) Paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I in general terms and conditions used for research awards to institutions of \nhigher education generally should provide for vesting of title to acquired equipment in those institutions subject only \nto the three conditions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.110\n \n  Property trust relationship.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:\n \n  (1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or \ncooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was \nacquired or improved; and\n \n  (2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that \npersonal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's \nuse and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title \nto real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative \nagreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:\n \n\n  (1) Must include the default wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except \nthat a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real \nproperty, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards \nunder those awards.\n \n\n  (2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the default wording of Section B of PROP Article I to \nrequire recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.115\n \n  Title to federally owned property.\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default wording appendix A \nto this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I to affirm that title to federally owned property remains with the \nGovernment.\n \n\n  (b) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve Section C if it provides no federally owned property under its \nawards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.120\n \n\n\n\n  Federal interest in donated property.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Government \nacquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the \nrecipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or \nmatching, rather than charging depreciation.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the \nFederal interest in donated real property or equipment; or\n \n\n  (2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market \nvalue of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.125\n \n  Federal interest in property improved under awards.\n \n  (a) Requirement. General terms and conditions for DoD grants and cooperative agreements must address the \nFederal interest in improvements to real property or equipment that results if a recipient directly charges the costs of \nthe improvements to an award.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the \nFederal interest in improved real property or equipment; or\n \n\n  (2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under \nawards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.\n <h2>\n  Subpart B Property Management System Prop Article Ii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.200\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article II.\n \n  (a) PROP Article II prescribes standards for:\n \n  (1) Insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards;\n \n  (2) The system that a recipient uses to manage both equipment that is acquired or improved in whole or in part \nunder awards and federally owned property.\n \n  (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310, and 200.313(d)(1) through (4), and partially \nimplements 2 CFR 200.313(b).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.205\n \n\n\n\n  Insurance coverage for real property and equipment.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 includes a requirement for recipients' insurance coverage for \nreal property and equipment acquired or improved under awards and states that federally owned property need not \nbe insured unless required by Federal award terms and conditions.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to provide \ninsurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards. However, unless a statute \nor program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies \notherwise, DoD awards will not require recipients to insure federally owned property.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article II; or\n \n\n  (2) Reserve Section A of PROP Article II if there will be no real property or equipment acquired or improved under \nawards using those terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.210\n \n  Other management system standards for States.\n \n  (a) Requirement. DoD Components' general terms and conditions must address the standards for States' property \nmanagement systems.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article II; or\n \n\n  (2) Reserve Section B of PROP Article II if no State will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be \naccountable for federally owned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards \nunder those awards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.215\n \n  Other management system standards for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local \ngovernments, and Indian tribes.\n \n  (a) Requirement. DoD Components' general terms and conditions must address the standards for property \nmanagement systems of institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian \ntribes.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article II; or\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Reserve Section C of PROP Article II if no institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local \ngovernment, or Indian tribe will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be accountable for federally \nowned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.\n <h2>\n  Subpart C Use and Disposition of Real Property Prop Article Iii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.300\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article III.\n \n  PROP Article III specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of real property acquired or improved \nunder an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) and (c).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.305\n \n  Use of real property.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) states that, except as otherwise provided by Federal \nstatute or the Federal awarding agency, a recipient must use real property acquired or improved under an award for \nthe originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the recipient must not \ndispose of the property or encumber its title or other interests.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after \nopportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards must permit recipients to do the following:\n \n  (1) While real property acquired or improved under an award still is needed for the authorized purpose, also use it \nfor other projects or programs that either are supported by DoD Components or other Federal agencies or not \nfederally supported, as long as that use does not interfere with the property's use for the authorized purpose.\n \n  (2) After the real property no longer is needed for the authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award \nadministration office, use the property on other federally supported projects or programs that have purposes \nconsistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property \nwas acquired or improved.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. DoD Component general terms and conditions must either:\n \n\n  (1) Include the default wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article III; or\n \n\n  (2) If a statute or program regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies different requirements for \nrecipients' use of real property, substitute alternative wording for Section A to specify those requirements.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.310\n \n  Disposition of real property.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c):\n \n  (1) Addresses the recipient's responsibility to request disposition instructions for real property when the recipient \nno longer needs it for the originally authorized purpose; and\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Identifies three alternative disposition methods those instructions may specify.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c) through award terms and conditions \nthat govern disposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default \nwording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article III to specify requirements concerning \ndisposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.\n <h2>\n  Subpart D Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies Prop Article Iv</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.400\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article IV.\n \n  PROP Article IV specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of equipment and supplies in which \nthere is a Federal interest. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:\n \n  (a) 2 CFR 200.313(a) through (c), 200.313(d)(5), and 200.313(e) as that guidance applies to requirements for use \nand disposition of equipment; and\n \n  (b) 2 CFR 200.314, as that guidance applies to requirements for use and disposition of supplies acquired under an \naward.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.405\n \n  Property subject to PROP Article IV.\n \n  (a) Requirement. DoD Components' general terms and conditions must identify the types of non-exempt property \nto which requirements for use and disposition of equipment and supplies apply.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the default wording appendix D to this part provides for \nSection A of PROP Article IV. That wording identifies the categories of equipment and supplies in which there is a \nFederal interest, which are the categories to which the requirements for use and disposition apply.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.410\n \n  Requirements for a State's use and disposition of equipment.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) sets forth basic conditions for use of equipment acquired under an award that apply when \ntitle to the equipment is vested in a recipient conditionally, because the awarding agency either does not have \nstatutory authority to vest title in the equipment unconditionally or elects not to do so.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.313(b) provides that a State must use, manage, and dispose of equipment in accordance with State \nlaws and procedures.\n \n\n\n\n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements 2 CFR 200.313(a) and (b) through award terms and conditions that \ngovern States' use and disposition of equipment.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix D to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for a State's use and \ndisposition of equipment in which there is a Federal interest.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.415\n \n  Use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) sets forth basic conditions for use of equipment acquired under an award that apply when \ntitle to the equipment is vested in a recipient conditionally, because the awarding agency either does not have \nstatutory authority to vest title in the equipment unconditionally or elects not to do so.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.313(c) provides for use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, \nlocal government, or Indian tribe.\n \n  (3) 2 CFR 200.313(d)(5) calls for use of sales procedures to ensure highest possible return when selling \nequipment.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. For equipment in which there is a Federal interest under awards to institutions of higher \neducation, nonprofit organizations, local governments, or Indian tribes, DoD implements through award terms and \nconditions the following portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to use of equipment prior to the time of its \ndisposition:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) and (c); and\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.313(d)(5), as it applies to equipment sales prior to the time of disposition, to offset the acquisition \ncost of replacement equipment.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix D to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for use of equipment \ndescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.420\n \n  Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian \ntribe.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.313(e) addresses disposition of original or replacement \nequipment acquired under an award by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, \nor Indian tribe.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements 2 CFR 200.313(e) through award terms and conditions that govern \ndisposition of original or replacement equipment acquired under an award by an institution of higher education, \nnonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe when there is a Federal interest in the equipment.\n \n\n\n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix D to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for disposition of \nequipment described in paragraph (b) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.425\n \n  Use and disposition of supplies.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.314 sets forth requirements for use and disposition of supplies \nacquired under an award.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements 2 CFR 200.314 through award terms and conditions that govern use \nand disposition of supplies acquired under awards either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix D to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for use and \ndisposition of acquired supplies.\n <h2>\n  Subpart E Use and Disposition of Federally Owned Property Prop Article V</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.500\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article V.\n \n  PROP Article V specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of federally owned property. It \nimplements the portion of OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a) that applies to disposition of federally owned \nproperty.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.505\n \n  Content of PROP Article V.\n \n  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:\n \n  (a) Include the default wording appendix E to this part provides for PROP Article V to specify requirements for use \nand disposition of federally owned property; or\n \n  (b) Reserve PROP Article V if there is no possibility of recipients or subrecipients being accountable for federally \nowned property under awards using those terms and conditions.\n <h2>\n  Subpart F Intangible Property Prop Article Vi</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.600\n \n  Purpose of PROP Article VI.\n \n  PROP Article VI sets forth the rights and responsibilities of recipients and the Government with respect to \nintangible property.

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix F to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article VI to affirm the recipient's right to assert copyright in \nworks it develops or otherwise acquires under an award, as well as the Government's right to use the works for \nFederal purposes.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.610\n \n  Inventions developed under awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(c) states that recipients are subject to applicable regulations \nconcerning patents and inventions, including Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR part 401.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. In implementing 2 CFR 200.315(c) for awards for the performance of experimental, \ndevelopmental, or research work, DoD:\n \n  (1) Extends to other entities the patent rights provisions of chapter 18 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code and 37 CFR part \n401 that directly apply to small business firms and nonprofit organizations. This broadened applicability is in \naccordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in \nExecutive Order 12591, \u201cFacilitating Access to Science and Technology.\u201d\n \n  (2) Establishes a default requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their \nawards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.\n \n  (3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by \nrecipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. (1) Awards for research, developmental, or experimental work. A DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or \nresearch work funded in whole or in part by the Government must include the default wording appendix F to this \npart provides for Section B of PROP Article VI, with one permitted exception. The exception is that a DoD \nComponent may reserve or substitute alternative wording for paragraph B.2.b of Section B of PROP Article VI, as \nappropriate, if it elects to:\n \n  (i) Omit the requirement for final invention reports;\n \n  (ii) Substitute \u201c120 calendar days\u201d for \u201c90 calendar days\u201d to provide an additional 30 days for recipient's \nsubmissions of final reports after the end date of the period of performance; or\n \n  (iii) Include a requirement for recipients to submit information about each patent application they submit for a \nsubject invention, interim listings of all subject inventions, or both, which the Department of Commerce regulations \nat 37 CFR 401.5(f)(2) and (3) permit agencies to require.\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Awards for primarily educational purposes. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards to \nsupport scholarships or fellowships, training grants, or other awards for primarily educational purposes must replace \nthe default wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI with an alternative award \nprovision stating that the Federal Government will have no rights to inventions made by recipients.\n \n\n  (3) A wards for other purposes. A DoD Component developing general terms and conditions for awards other than \nthose described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section should:\n \n\n  (i) Consult its intellectual property counsel if it anticipates that recipients may develop patentable inventions under \nits awards, to identify any applicable statutes or regulations and determine an appropriate substitute for the default \nwording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI; or\n \n\n  (ii) Reserve Section B of PROP Article VI if it does not expect development of any patentable inventions under \nthose awards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.615\n \n  Data produced under awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(d) and (e) addresses rights in data under awards.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements 2 CFR 200.315(d) and (e) through award terms and conditions.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the \ndefault wording appendix F to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article VI.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve paragraph C.2 of Section C of PROP Article VI in its general terms \nand conditions if:\n \n  (i) Those terms and conditions will not be used for research awards; and\n \n  (ii) The DoD Component determines that no research data as defined in 2 CFR 200.315 will be generated under \nthe awards using those terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1130.620\n \n  Intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(a) addresses use and disposition of intangible property that \nis acquired under awards (in addition to vesting of title, which is implemented in \u00a7&thinsp;1130.105 and appendix A \nto this part).\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements 2 CFR 200.315(a) through award terms and conditions that govern use \nand disposition of intangible property that is acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default \nwording appendix F to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article VI.\n\n\n\n <h3>\n  Appendix A to Part 1130\u2014Terms and Conditions for PROP Article I, \u201cTitle To Property\u201d</h3>\n \n\n  I.

Byrd Amendment anti-lobbying requirements. In each contract for an amount exceeding $100,000, you must \ninclude a clause requiring the contractor to submit to you the certification and any disclosure forms regarding \nlobbying that are required under 31 U.S.C. 3152, as implemented by the DoD at 32 CFR part 28.\n \n\n  9. Purchase of recovered materials by States or political subdivisions of States. In each contract under which the \ncontractor may purchase items designated in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in 40 CFR part \n247, subpart B, you must include a clause requiring the contractor to comply with applicable requirements in those \nEPA regulations, which implement Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as \namended (42 U.S.C. 6962).\n \n  10. Fly America requirements. In each contract under which funds provided under this award might be used for \ninternational air travel for the transportation of people or property, you must include a clause requiring the contractor \nto:\n \n  a. Comply with the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 40118, also \nknown as the \u201cFly America\u201d Act), as implemented by the General Services Administration at 41 CFR 301-10.131 \nthrough 301-10.143, which provides that U.S. Government-financed international air travel and transportation of \npersonal effects or property must use a U.S. Flag air carrier or be performed under a cost-sharing arrangement with \na U.S. carrier, if such service is available; and\n \n  b. Include the requirements of the Fly America Act in all subcontracts that might involve international air \ntransportation.\n \n  11. Cargo preference for United States flag vessels.

Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Government and \nrecipients.\n \n  (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the \ncorresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some \nsituations.\n \n  (c) The following table shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A \nthrough D to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in subparts A through D, respectively):\n \n  \n   \n    &emsp;\n   \n    \n     \n      In . . .\n     \n      You will find terms and conditions specifying recipients' rights and responsibilities related to . . .\n     \n      That would appear in an award within REP Article . . .\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     \n      Appendix A\n     \n      Performance management, monitoring, and reporting\n     \n      I.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix B\n     \n      Financial reporting\n     \n      II.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix C\n     \n      Reporting on property\n     \n      III.\n    \n    \n     \n\n\n\n      Appendix D\n     \n      Reporting on subawards and executive compensation\n     \n      IV.\n    \n   \n  \n \n <h2>\n  Subpart a Performance Management Monitoring and Reporting Rep Article I</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.100\n \n  Purpose of REP Article I.\n \n  REP Article I of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to recipient reporting on program \nperformance. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:\n \n  (a) 2 CFR 200.328; and\n \n  (b) Portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that relate to performance reporting.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.105\n \n  Performance reporting for construction awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(c) notes that agencies rely heavily on onsite technical \ninspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under construction awards and states \nthat agencies may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD Components may require performance reports under construction awards only \nwhen necessary and, to reduce recipient burdens, should coordinate the performance reporting with financial \nreporting to the maximum extent practicable.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. (1) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for \nconstruction awards and does not need performance reports for those awards, it:\n \n\n  (i) Should reserve Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions;\n \n\n  (ii) Must follow the specifications in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1134.135 and 1134.145 to include the default wording appendix A to \nthis part provides for Sections E and G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, in order to require recipients \nto promptly report significant developments and reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits.\n \n\n  (iii) Must follow the specifications in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.140 to insert wording in Section F of REP Article I in those \nterms and conditions, to tell recipients where and how to submit any reports of significant developments.\n \n  (2) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and determines that \nit needs performance reports for those awards:\n\n\n\n \n\n  (i) It may tailor the template and content that appendix A to this part provides for Sections A through D of REP \nArticle I in those terms and conditions, as needed to specify the reporting requirements or, as appropriate, instead \nintegrate those requirements into REP Article II on financial reporting. The form, format, or data elements that the \nDoD Component specifies for any of those performance reports must comply with requirements of the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320, to use OMB-approved information collections \nif more than 9 recipients will be subject to the reporting requirement.\n \n\n  (ii) It must follow the specifications in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1134.135 through 1134.145 concerning Sections E through G of \nREP Article I in those terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.110\n \n  When to require and when to waive performance reports for non-construction awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report \nthat it does not need.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation\u2014(1) Interim reports. DoD Components should waive requirements for interim \nperformance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers \nhave an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program \noversight during the period of performance.\n \n  (2) Final reports\u2014(i) Research. DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under \nresearch awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary \npurpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve \nas a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, \nand conclusions or recommendations of the research.\n \n  (ii) Non-construction programs other than research. DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final \nperformance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving \nrequirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.\n \n  (c) Award terms and conditions. Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms \nand conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. \nA DoD Component must either use the default wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, \nin accordance with \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1134.115 through 1134.145, to:\n \n  (1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance \nreporting (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.115);\n \n  (2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see \n\u00a7&thinsp;1134.120);\n \n  (3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.125);\n \n  (4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.130);\n \n  (5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.135);\n \n\n\n\n  (6) Specify reporting procedures (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.140); and\n \n  (7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see \u00a7&thinsp;1134.145).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.115\n \n  Content and forms, formats, or data elements for interim and final performance reporting under non-construction \nawards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328(b)(2) state that Federal awarding agencies must require recipients to use \nstandard OMB-approved information collections for reporting performance information.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) list types of information that performance reports under non-construction \nawards will contain, as appropriate, unless other collections are approved by OMB.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. (1) The content of the information collections that a DoD Component's general terms and \nconditions specify for non-construction awards must include the elements listed in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through \n(iii) that are appropriate to the projects or programs subject to those general terms and conditions.\n \n  (2) Forms, formats, and data elements that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for \nperformance reporting under non-construction awards must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995 to use OMB-approved information collections, as implemented at 5 CFR part 1320.\n \n  (3) To the maximum extent practicable, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction \nawards must specify that recipients use Governmentwide standard forms, formats, and data elements that also are \nused by other agencies for similar programs, recipients, and types of awards (e.g., the Research Performance \nProgress Report format or any successor to it that OMB clears for interim performance progress reports under \nresearch awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit entities).\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD \nComponent must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section A of REP Article I of its general terms and \nconditions for non-construction awards to specify the form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for \ninterim and final performance reports. Section A of REP Article I may specify a different requirement for final \nperformance reports than interim reports.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.120\n \n  Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) addresses performance reporting frequency and due \ndates.\n \n  (1) Reporting frequency. The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent \nthan annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (e.g., when more frequent \nreporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).\n \n  (2) Due dates. The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:\n \n\n\n\n  (i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; \nand\n \n  (ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the \nagency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and \ndue dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and \nadded specifications concerning reporting periods:\n \n  (1) Reporting frequency. DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance \nreports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more \nfrequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the \nbenefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, \ndue to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.\n \n  (2) Reporting periods. For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim \nperformance reports on a cumulative basis\u2014i.e., the second and any subsequent performance report should \naddress only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier \ninterim performance reports.\n \n\n  (3) Due dates. If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual \ncircumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component \nmust specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim \nreports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP \nArticle I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:\n \n  (1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;\n \n  (2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and\n \n  (3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the \nreporting period.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.125\n \n  Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 \ncalendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due \ndate if a recipient submits a justified request.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation\u2014(1) Due dates. Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):\n \n  (i) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's \nsubmission of its final performance report is 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance.\n \n\n\n\n  (ii) Exception. A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30 day extension to the due date in its general conditions by \nspecifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of \nperformance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate \nsubrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.\n \n  (2) Reporting periods\u2014(i) Non-construction programs other than research. A DoD Component's general terms and \nconditions for non-construction programs other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report \nthat is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or \nprogram for future reference.\n \n  (ii) Research. Final reports for research awards should be cumulative (i.e., each final report should cover the entire \nperiod of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) \nbecause a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as \ndescribed in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.110(b)(2).\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD \nComponent in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:\n \n  (1) Must either:\n \n  (i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is 90 days after the end of the period of performance by \nincluding the default wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I; or\n \n\n  (ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, by \nincluding a revision of the default wording for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I with \u201c120 calendar days\u201d inserted in \nlieu of \u201c90 calendar days.\u201d\n \n  (2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for \nfinal reports (i.e., whether the reports must be cumulative).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.130\n \n  Requesting extensions of due dates for performance reports.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that, if a recipient submits a justified request for \nan extension in the due date for any interim or final performance report, an agency may extend the due date.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must \nspecify that a recipient may request an extension of the due date for interim or final performance reports. DoD \nComponents should grant requests that provide adequate justification. For a DoD Component that pre-approves a \n30-day extension of due dates for final performance reports in its general terms and conditions, as described in \n\u00a7&thinsp;1134.125(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii), any award-specific extensions would be beyond the pre-approved 30-day \nextension.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the default wording that \nappendix A to this part provides for Section D of REP Article I on extensions of performance reporting due dates.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.135\n \n\n\n\n  Reporting significant developments.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(d) states that a recipient must promptly notify the awarding \nagency about significant developments.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to report \nsignificant developments, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(d).\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default \nwording that appendix A to this part provides for Section E of REP Article I on reporting of significant \ndevelopments.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.140\n \n  Performance reporting procedures.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients about performance \nreporting procedures.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. (1) To implement the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent in its general terms and conditions must insert wording in Section F of REP Article I (which is reserved \nin the template for REP Article I that appendix A to this part provides), to specify:\n \n  (i) The office or offices to which a recipient must submit its interim and final performance reports, any requests in \ndue dates for those reports, and any reports of significant developments; and\n \n  (ii) How the recipient is to submit those reports and requests (e.g., email or electronic portal).\n \n  (2) For research awards, this wording must comply with the distribution and marking requirements of DoD Manual \n3200.14, Volume 1. This includes the requirement that all significant scientific or technological findings, \nrecommendations, and results derived from DoD endeavors\u2014which shall include the final performance report at a \nminimum\u2014are recorded and provided to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.145\n \n  Site visits.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(e) states that a Federal awarding agency may make site \nvisits as warranted by program needs.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must state that the Government \nreserves the right to make site visits as warranted.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default \nwording that appendix A to this part provides for Section G of REP Article I concerning site visits.\n <h2>\n  Subpart B Financial Reporting Rep Article Ii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.200\n\n\n\n \n  Purpose of REP Article II.\n \n  REP Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to financial reporting. It thereby \nimplements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 and the portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that are specific to \nfinancial reporting.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.205\n \n  Reporting forms, formats, or data elements.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 states that Federal awarding agencies may require \nrecipients to use only the standard OMB-approved Governmentwide data elements for collection of financial \ninformation, unless OMB approves other forms, formats, or data elements for financial information collection.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. DoD Components must collect financial information from recipients using OMB-approved \nforms, formats, or data elements.\n \n  (1) Unless current approvals expire, approved financial information collections include the Governmentwide \nFederal Financial Report (SF-425) and Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270). In the future, they would \ninclude any additional information collections that OMB approves.\n \n  (2) For all but the recipient's final financial report after the end of the period of performance, a DoD Component \nmay rely on financial information the recipient provides on the SF-270 or other OMB-approved payment request \nform, format, or data elements if that financial information is sufficient to meet the DoD Component's needs. For the \nfinal report, the DoD Component must require the recipient to use the SF-425 or other OMB-approved financial \ninformation collection.\n \n  (3) A DoD Component must obtain approval for any variations from OMB-approved forms or formats, including use \nof additional or substitute data elements or modification of the associated instructions for recipient entities \nsubmitting the information.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.210\n \n  Content of REP Article II.\n \n  (a) Requirement. General terms and conditions for DoD grants and cooperative agreements must specify what \nfinancial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.\n \n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD \nComponent must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial \nreporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days \nafter the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.\n \n\n  (2) Required reporting form, format, or data elements for interim and final financial reports. In Section A of REP \nArticle II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-\napproved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the Web site where \nthey can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports \nduring the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed \non the final report.\n \n\n\n\n  (3) Interim financial reports: frequency, reporting periods, and due dates. In Section B of REP Article II, which is \nreserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which \nrecipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it \nis due. Note that this section may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information \nalready provided with payment requests (e.g., on the SF-270).\n \n  (i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually \nand no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (e.g., a need for more frequent reporting for \nmonitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be in coordination with performance \nreporting).\n \n  (ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of \nfinancial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.\n \n  (iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on \npredetermined schedules\u2014which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards\u2014the terms and conditions \nshould provide for at least quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor \nrecipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.\n \n\n  (4) Final financial report. Appendix B to this part provides default wording for Section C of REP Article II to \nimplement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 \nprovides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to \nrecipients, the default wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-\naward administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any \ninformation they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the default wording or supplement \nit if it has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n \n\n  (5) Extensions of due dates. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the default wording \nfor Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of \ndue dates for interim or final financial reports.\n \n\n  (6) Where and how to submit financial reports. In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to \nthis part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must \nsubmit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so (e.g., email or other electronic \nsubmission method).\n <h2>\n  Subpart C Reporting on Property Rep Article Iii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300\n \n  Purposes of REP Article III.\n \n  REP Article III of the general terms and conditions provides a consolidated source that sets out required reports, \nnotifications, requests, and accountings related to federally owned property and property that is acquired or \nimproved under awards. The article is:\n \n  (a) The original source of requirements for recipients to:\n \n  (1) Submit periodic status reports and notifications of critical changes for real property (in paragraphs A.1 and A.2 \nof the article), which thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329;\n\n\n\n \n  (2) Submit an annual inventory of federally owned property (in paragraph C.1 of the article), which thereby partially \nimplements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a);\n \n  (3) Provide information on request about copyrighted works and data produced under awards (in paragraph D.2 of \nthe article).\n \n  (b) A secondary source provided for the convenience of recipients and DoD post-award administrators that lists \nand refers to the original sources of requirements for recipients to:\n \n  (1) Request disposition instructions and account at closeout for real property (in paragraphs A.3 and A.4 of the \narticle), the original sources of which are in PROP Article III and OAR Article VI;\n \n  (2) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for equipment (in \nparagraphs B.2 and B.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and IV, respectively;\n \n  (3) Account at closeout for equipment and supplies (in paragraph B.4 of the article), the original sources of which \nare in OAR Article VI and PROP Article IV;\n \n  (4) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for federally owned \nproperty (in paragraphs C.2 and C.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and V, \nrespectively;\n \n  (5) Disclose and report on inventions developed under awards (in paragraph D.1), the original source of which is in \nPROP Article VI; and\n \n  (6) Request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards \n(in paragraph D.3 of the article), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.305\n \n  Real property: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the real property reporting \nrequirements described in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(a)(1) and provide references to the related requirements described in \n\u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(b)(1).\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the \nwording of Section A of REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must comply with \neither paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.\n \n\n  (1) General. Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property \nunder awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the default \nwording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:\n \n  (i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic \nstatus reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real \nproperty). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which \nprovides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real \nproperty.\n\n\n\n \n  (ii) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.b to specify the due date for each periodic status report \nin terms of the number of calendar days after the end of the period covered by the report (e.g., a report on the \nstatus of the property as of September 30 might be due 30 calendar days after that date).\n \n  (iii) May provide wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.c if there are other instructions\u2014e.g., a form, \nformat, or information elements that a recipient must use (which must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork \nReduction Act) or a particular office to which reports must be submitted, especially if reporting will continue beyond \ncloseout of awards under which the real property was acquired or improved.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve Section A of REP Article III if it determines that there will be no \nacquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.310\n \n  Equipment and supplies: Reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.\n \n  (a) Requirement. REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that there is no \nrequirement for routine periodic reporting about equipment and provide the references described in \n\u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(b)(2) and (3) to requirements in other articles for notifications, requests, and accounting related \nto equipment and supplies.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of \nREP Article III.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.315\n \n  Federally owned property: Inventory, notifications, and requests.\n \n  (a) Requirement. REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting \nrequirement described in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(b)(4) \nto requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.\n \n  (b) Policy. (1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after \nopportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:\n \n  (i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or\n \n  (ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition \ninstructions. Note that any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB \nunder the Paperwork Reduction Act.\n \n  (2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-\naward administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient \nmay arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally \nowned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property \nmanagement system already generates.\n \n\n\n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this \nsection, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides \nfor Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data \nelements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of \nawards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be \naccountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.320\n \n  Intangible property: Disclosures, reports, and requests.\n \n  (a) Requirement. REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirement \ndescribed in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(a)(3) and provide the references described in \u00a7&thinsp;1134.300(b)(5) and (6) to \nrequirements in other articles for disclosures, reports, and requests related to intangible property.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this \nsection, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides \nfor Section D of REP Article III.\n \n  (2) Exceptions. A DoD Component may reserve:\n \n\n  (i) Section D of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, \nor subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will have any intangible property for which they will be \naccountable to the Federal Government; or\n \n  (ii) Any of paragraphs D.1 through D.3, if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and \nconditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable to the Federal Government for \nthe particular types of intangible property addressed by those paragraphs.\n <h2>\n  Subpart D Reporting on Subawards and Executive Compensation Rep Article Iv</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.400\n \n  Purpose of REP Article IV.\n \n  REP Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to report information about \nsubawards and executive compensation.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1134.405\n \n  Content of REP Article IV.\n \n  (a) Source of the reporting requirements. The requirements for recipients to report information about subawards \nand executive compensation originate in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as \namended (31 U.S.C. 6101 note). OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 170 implements those statutory requirements and \nappendix A to that part provides standard Governmentwide wording of an award provision.\n \n\n\n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this \nsection, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording appendix E to this part \nprovides as REP Article IV.\n <h3>\n  Appendix A to Part 1134\u2014Terms and Conditions for REP Article I, \u201cPerformance Management, Monitoring, and \nReporting\u201d</h3>\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following template for REP Article I, using default wording or inserting wording in \nlieu of reserved sections or paragraphs in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;1134.105 through 1134.145 of this part:\n <h3>\n  REP Article I.

That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some \nsituations.\n \n  (c) The following table shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A \nthrough G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in subparts A through G, respectively):\n \n  \n   \n    &emsp;\n   \n    \n     \n      In . . .\n     \n      You will find terms and conditions specifying recipients' rights and responsibilities related to . . .\n     \n      That would appear in an award within OAR Article . . .\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     \n      Appendix A\n     \n      Submitting and maintaining recipient information\n     \n      I.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix B\n     \n      Records retention and access\n     \n      II.\n    \n\n\n\n    \n     \n      Appendix C\n     \n      Remedies and termination\n     \n      III.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix D\n     \n      Claims, disputes, and appeals\n     \n      IV.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix E\n     \n      Collection of amounts due\n     \n      V.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix F\n     \n      Closeout\n     \n      VI.\n    \n    \n     \n      Appendix G\n     \n      Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities\n     \n      VII.\n    \n   \n  \n \n <h2>\n  Subpart a Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information Oar Article I</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.100\n \n  Purpose of OAR Article I.\n \n\n\n\n  OAR Article I sets forth requirements for recipients to maintain current information about themselves in the data \nsystem the Government specifies as the repository for standard information about its business partners, currently \nthe System for Award Management. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in:\n \n  (a) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);\n \n  (b) 2 CFR part 25; and\n \n  (c) The portion of 2 CFR 200.300(b) that cites 2 CFR part 25 and the System for Award Management).\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.105\n \n  Content of OAR Article I.\n \n\n  To implement the requirement described in \u00a7&thinsp;1136.100, DoD Components' general terms and conditions \nmust use the standard wording appendix A to this part provides as OAR Article I. A DoD Component may reserve \nSection B of the article in its general terms and conditions if it is certain that there will be no award using those \ngeneral terms and conditions for which the Federal share of the award's total value will exceed $500,000.\n <h2>\n  Subpart B Records Retention and Access Oar Article Ii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.200\n \n  Purpose of OAR Article II.\n \n  OAR Article II addresses rights and responsibilities concerning retention of records related to awards; access to \nrecipients' records; and collection, transmission, and storage of information. The article thereby implements OMB \nguidance in 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.337.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.205\n \n  Records retention period.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) The lead-in paragraph of 2 CFR 200.333 sets a standard retention period that is generally applicable to \nrecipient records pertinent to Federal awards.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.333(c) and (f) provide different standard retention periods specifically for records that are related \neither to real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or to indirect cost rate proposals and cost \nallocation plans.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the standard retention \nperiods described in paragraph (a) of this section.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the \nwording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of OAR Article II.\n \n\n\n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may substitute alternative wording for paragraph \nA.3 of OAR Article II if the awards using those terms and conditions will be renewed quarterly or annually. The \nalternative wording for awards that will be renewed quarterly or annually would replace the words \u201cfinal financial \nreport\u201d in paragraph A.3 with \u201cquarterly financial report\u201d or \u201cannual financial report,\u201d respectively.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.210\n \n  Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.333(a) provides for an extended retention period for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit \nthat begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.333(b) provides that a recipient also is required to extend the retention period when a Federal \nawarding, cognizant, or oversight agency notifies it in writing to do so.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended \nretention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year \nretention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).\n \n\n  (2)(i) With the one exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require \nrecipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).\n \n  (ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the \u201cretention period,\u201d as that term is used in 2 \nCFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends \nbeyond the standard 3-year retention period described in \u00a7&thinsp;1136.205. That extension will enable \ndisallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to \nretain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. \nWithout that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which \nstates that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient \nwithin the record retention period.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for Section B of OAR Article II.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.215\n \n  Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333(e) provides the retention period for records related to \nprogram income earned after the end of the period of performance, for instances when an agency establishes \nrequirements governing the disposition of program income earned after that time.\n \n\n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions should not establish retention \nrequirements for records related to program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Retention \nrequirements for those records in general terms and conditions would be inconsistent with the statement in 2 CFR \n1128.725 that a DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable for \nprogram income earned after the end of the period of performance. Section 1128.725 provides for use of general \nterms and conditions wording in FMS Article VII that establishes no such requirement. Section 1128.725 further \n\n\n\nstates that exceptions for individual awards are properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms \nand conditions.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for Section C of OAR Article II. If a DoD Component includes a requirement in the \naward-specific terms and conditions of a particular award for the recipient to be accountable for program income \nearned after the end of the period of performance, it also may include a requirement in the award-specific terms and \nconditions for the recipient's retention of the associated records.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.220\n \n  Records for joint or long-term use.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in:\n \n  (1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its \ncustody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that \nthe agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.\n \n  (2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention \nrequirement.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that they may \nbe asked to transfer records, maintain them for joint use, or retain them for a longer period of time.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for Section D of OAR Article II.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.225\n \n  Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 addresses the use of electronic and paper formats in the \ncollection, transmission, and storage of information related to awards.\n \n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include provisions consistent \nwith the guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 for recipients' use of electronic and paper formats to collect, transmit, and store \ninformation.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for Section E of OAR Article II.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.230\n \n  Access to records.\n \n  (a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.336 and 200.337 addresses Federal Government and public \naccess to recipient records related to awards.\n \n\n\n\n  (b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for Government access \nto records consistent with 2 CFR 200.336 and address public access to records to implement the guidance in 2 \nCFR 200.337.\n \n\n  (c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for Section F of OAR Article II.\n <h2>\n  Subpart C Remedies and Termination Oar Article Iii</h2>\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.300\n \n  Purpose of OAR Article III.\n \n  OAR Article III addresses remedies for noncompliance, including suspension and termination of awards. It thereby \nimplements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 through 200.340 and 200.342.\n \n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.305\n \n  Content of OAR Article III.\n \n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify remedies available for \naddressing noncompliance with award terms and conditions, policies and procedures related to termination of \nawards, and effects of suspension and termination on allowability of costs.\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for OAR Article \nIII.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart D Claims Disputes and Appeals Oar Article Iv</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.400\n\n \n\n  Purpose of OAR Article IV.\n\n \n\n  OAR Article IV addresses claims, disputes, and appeals under awards. It thereby provides the award terms and \nconditions required by the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations at 32 CFR 22.815 and also implements OMB \nguidance in 2 CFR 200.341.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.405\n\n \n\n  Content of OAR Article IV.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. The DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations at 32 CFR 22.815 require DoD Components' \ngeneral terms and conditions to incorporate the procedures set forth in that section for processing claims and \ndisputes and deciding appeals of grants officer's decisions.\n\n \n\n\n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a \nDoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR \nArticle IV, with wording inserted in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2 to identify the Component's cognizant Grant \nAppeal Authority and provide his or her mailing or email address.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component may add one or more sections to the wording appendix D to this part provides \nfor OAR Article IV to state a requirement that recipients must provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, \nappeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other \nmatters if:\n\n \n\n  (i) That requirement is in a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for \npublic comment; and\n\n \n\n  (ii) The statutory or regulatory requirement applies to awards using the DoD Component's general terms and \nconditions.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart E Collection of Amounts Due Oar Article V</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.500\n\n \n\n  Purpose of OAR Article V.\n\n \n\n  OAR Article V addresses procedures for establishing, appealing, and collecting debts under DoD awards. It \nthereby:\n\n \n\n  (a) Provides requirements for recipients paralleling those for DoD Components in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR \n22.820;\n\n \n\n  (b) Augments requirements of OAR Article IV in any case in which a claim leads to a determination that a recipient \nowes an amount to DoD; and\n\n \n\n  (c) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.345.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.505\n\n \n\n  Content of OAR Article V.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how grants officers' decisions \nestablish debts under awards, when debts become delinquent, how and when recipients may appeal, and how \ndebts not paid in a timely manner are referred for debt collection.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides for OAR Article \nV.\n\n\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart F Closeout Oar Article Vi</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.600\n\n \n\n  Purpose of OAR Article VI.\n\n \n\n  OAR Article VI addresses recipients' responsibilities for closeout of awards and subawards under them. The article \nthereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.605\n\n \n\n  Content of OAR Article VI.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to closeout \nof awards and subawards, including recipients' liquidations of obligations, refunds of unobligated balances, and \nsubmission of final reports.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a \nDoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for OAR \nArticle VI.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exception related to due dates for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports. \nConsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a), a DoD Component may grant extensions to due dates for final \nreports.\n\n \n\n  (i) To pre-approve a 30-day extension for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports, a \nDoD Component may substitute \u201c120 calendar days\u201d for \u201c90 calendar days\u201d in the default wording appendix F to \nthis part provides for paragraph C.4 of OAR Article VI. These pre-approved 30-day extensions in the general terms \nand conditions are for all awards using those terms and conditions; they therefore are separate and distinct from \nany additional extensions a recipient may later request for an individual award.\n\n \n\n  (ii) The parallel authorities for pre-approved extensions of due dates for final performance, financial, and invention \nreports are elsewhere. DoDGARs provisions in:\n\n \n\n  (A) 2 CFR 1134.125 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of performance \nreports by an appropriate substitution of wording in REP Article I of the general terms and conditions.\n\n \n\n  (B) 2 CFR 1134.210 provide default wording in REP Article II that pre-approves a 30-day extension for due dates \nof financial reports.\n\n \n\n  (C) 2 CFR 1130.610 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of final reports \nlisting subject inventions under awards by an appropriate substitution of wording in PROP Article VI of the general \nterms and conditions.\n\n <h2>\n\n\n\n  Subpart G Post Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities Oar Article Vii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.700\n\n \n\n  Purpose of OAR Article VII.\n\n \n\n  OAR Article VII addresses post-closeout funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after \naward closeout. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1136.705\n\n \n\n  Content of OAR Article VII.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the rights and responsibilities of \nthe Government and recipients with respect to funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after \naward closeout.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix G to this part provides for OAR Article \nVII.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix A to Part 1136\u2014Terms and Conditions for OAR Article I, \u201cSubmitting and Maintaining Recipient \nInformation\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use as OAR Article I the following standard wording in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;1136.105 \nof this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  OAR Article I. Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information. (December 2014)</h3>\n\n \n\n  Section A. System for award management.\n\n \n\n  1. Unless you are exempted from this requirement in accordance with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 25.110, you must \nmaintain the currency of information about yourself in the system the Federal Government specifies as the \nrepository for information about its business partners (currently the System for Award Management (SAM)).\n\n \n\n  2.

You do not need to submit the information again under this award if you already reported current information to \nthe SAM under another Federal grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract.\n\n \n\n  4. Reporting frequency. During any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph B.1 of this \nsection, you must report to SAM at least semiannually following your initial report of any information required in \nparagraph B.2 of this section, either to provide new information not reported previously or affirm that there is no \nnew information to report.\n\n \n\n  5. Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\n \n\n  a. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a \ndetermination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative proceedings, Civilian \nBoard of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This \nincludes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract, \ngrant, or cooperative agreement. It does not include audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of \ndeliverables.\n\n \n\n  b. Conviction means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether \nentered upon a verdict or a plea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere.\n\n \n\n  c.

You must keep records related to any real property and equipment acquired, in whole or in part, using Federal \nfunds under the award for 3 years after final disposition of the property. For any item of exempt property with a \ncurrent fair market value greater than $5,000, and for which final disposition was not a condition of the title vesting, \nyou must keep whatever records you need for as long as necessary to ensure that you can deduct the Federal \nshare if you later use the property in contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes under any Federal award.\n\n \n\n  2. You must keep records related to rate proposals for indirect or facilities and administration costs, cost allocation \nplans, and supporting records such as indirect cost rate computations and any similar accounting computations of \nthe rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback or composite fringe \nbenefit rates) as follows:\n\n \n\n  a. If you are required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computations to your Federal cognizant agency for \nindirect costs, as the basis for negotiation of a rate, you must keep the submissions and all supporting records for 3 \nyears from the date on which you were required to make the submissions.\n\n \n\n  b. If you are not required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computation as the basis for negotiation, you must \nkeep the proposal, plan, other computation, and supporting records for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year or \nother accounting period covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.\n\n \n\n  3. You must keep other financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records pertinent to \nthis award for a period of 3 years from the date you submit your final financial report under the award.\n\n \n\n  Section B. Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.\n\n \n\n  1. If any litigation, claim, or audit begins before the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this \narticle and the final action related to the litigation, claim, or audit is not taken before the end of that 3-year period, \nyou must retain all records related to this award that may be involved in the litigation, claim, or audit until all findings \ninvolving the records have been resolved and final action taken.\n\n \n\n  2. We may disallow costs and recover funds under this award based on an audit or other review of records you \nelected to retain beyond the retention period required by this article, even if the audit or review begins after the end \nof the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article. Thus, the \u201cretention period,\u201d as that term is used \nin OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344(a)(1), is extended as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b) to include the entire \nperiod during which we and our authorized representatives continue to have access to those records under \nparagraph F.2 of this article.\n\n \n\n  Section C. Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period. In accordance with \nSection F of FMS Article VII, there are no requirements under this award applicable to program income you earn \nafter the end of the period of performance and therefore no associated records retention requirements.\n\n \n\n  Section D. Records for joint or long-term use.\n\n \n\n\n\n  1. Joint use. To avoid duplicate recordkeeping for records that you and we both need to use on a continuous \nbasis, we may ask you to make special arrangements with us, by mutual agreement, to make records available for \njoint and continuous use.\n\n \n\n  2. Long-term use. If we determine that some records will be needed longer than the 3-year period specified in \nSection A of this article, we may request that you either:\n\n \n\n  a. Retain the records for a longer period of time; or\n\n \n\n  b. Transfer the records to our custody for long-term retention.\n\n \n\n  3. Retention requirements for transferred records. For any records transferred to our custody, you are not subject \nto the records retention requirements in Section A of this article.\n\n \n\n  Section E. Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.\n\n \n\n  1. You should, whenever practicable, collect, transmit, and store information related to this award in open and \nmachine readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper. However, if you request it, we will:\n\n \n\n  a. Provide award related-information to you on paper; and\n\n \n\n  b. Accept award related-information from you on paper. In that case, we will not require more than an original and \ntwo copies.\n\n \n\n  2. When your original records are in an electronic form that cannot be altered, you do not need to create and retain \npaper copies of those records.\n\n \n\n  3. When your original records are on paper, you may substitute electronic versions produced through duplication \nor using other forms of electronic media, provided that:\n\n \n\n  a. You conduct periodic quality control reviews of the records;\n\n \n\n  b. You provide reasonable safeguards against alteration of the records; and\n\n \n\n  c. The records remain readable.\n\n \n\n  Section F. Access to records.\n\n \n\n  1. Scope of Government access rights.\n\n \n\n  a. We as the awarding agency, the Federal Government Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States, and any of our authorized representatives have the right of access to any documents, papers, or \n\n\n\nother records you have that are pertinent to this award, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and \ntranscripts.\n\n \n\n  b. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to your personnel for the purposes of interview and \ndiscussion related to the records.\n\n \n\n  c. As described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.336(b), the access to records described in this section will include \naccess to the true name of a victim of a crime only under extraordinary and rare circumstances.\n\n \n\n  i. You are required to provide that access only in response to a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide \nconfidential investigation, or in response to a request duly authorized by the head of the DoD Component or his or \nher designee; and\n\n \n\n  ii. You must take appropriate steps to protect this sensitive information.\n\n \n\n  2. Duration of Government access rights. We have the access rights described in paragraph F.1 of this section as \nlong as you retain the records.\n\n \n\n  3. Public access.\n\n \n\n  a. You must comply with requirements to protect information that Federal statute, Executive order, or regulation \nrequires to be protected (e.g., personally identifiable or export controlled information), to include both information \ngenerated under this award and information provided to you and identified as being subject to protection. Other \nthan those limitations on dissemination of information, we place no restrictions on you that limit public access to \nyour records pertinent to this award.\n\n \n\n  b. We do not place any requirements on you to permit public access to your records separate from any Federal, \nState, local, or tribal statute that may require you to do so.\n\n \n\n  c. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records in your possession but records \nyou provide to us generally will be subject to FOIA, with the applicable exemptions.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix C to Part 1136\u2014Terms and Conditions for OAR Article III, \u201cRemedies and Termination\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in OAR Article III in accordance with \n\u00a7&thinsp;1136.305 of this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  OAR Article III. Remedies and Termination. (December 2014)</h3>\n\n \n\n  Section A. Remedies for noncompliance.\n\n \n\n  1. If you materially fail to comply with a term or condition of this award or an applicable Federal statute or \nregulation, we may amend this award to impose specific additional conditions as described in OMB guidance in 2 \n\n\n\nCFR 200.207. If we determine that the imposition of those additional conditions is insufficient to remedy the \nnoncompliance, we may take one or more of the following actions that we deem appropriate to the circumstances:\n\n \n\n  a. Temporarily withhold cash payments pending:\n\n \n\n  i. Your correction of the deficiency; or\n\n \n\n  ii. Our taking more severe enforcement action.\n\n \n\n  b. Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable cost-sharing or matching credit for) all or part of the \ncost of the activity or action not in compliance;\n\n \n\n  c. Suspend or terminate this award, in whole or in part (suspension of an award is a separate and distinct action \nfrom suspension of a person under 2 CFR parts 180 and 1125, as noted in paragraph A.3 of this article);\n\n \n\n  d. Withhold further awards to you for the project or program that is not in compliance;\n\n \n\n  e. Take any other action legally available to us under the circumstances.\n\n \n\n  2. You may raise an objection to our taking any remedy we take under paragraph A.1 of this section and will be \ngiven an opportunity to provide information and documentation challenging the action. The procedures are those \nspecified in OAR Article IV for claims and disputes.\n\n \n\n  3. Our use of any remedy under paragraph A.1 of this section, including suspension or termination of the award, \ndoes not preclude our referring the noncompliance to a suspension and debarment official and asking that official to \nconsider initiating a suspension or debarment action under 2 CFR part 1125, the DoD implementation of OMB \nguidance at 2 CFR part 180.\n\n \n\n  Section B. Termination.\n\n \n\n  1. This award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:\n\n \n\n  a. Unilaterally by the Government. We will provide a notice of termination if we unilaterally terminate this award in \nwhole or in part, which we may do for either of the following reasons:\n\n \n\n  i. Your material failure to comply with the award terms and conditions. If we terminate the award for that reason, \nwe will report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). In \naccordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, each Federal awarding official must review and consider the information in the \nOMB-designated integrity and performance system with regard to any proposal or offer before awarding a grant or \ncontract.\n\n \n\n  ii. The program office does not have funding for an upcoming increment if this award is incrementally funded. In \nthat case, the Government's financial obligation does not exceed the amount currently obligated under the award.\n\n \n\n\n\n  b. By mutual agreement. With your consent, we may terminate this award, in whole or in part, for any reason. In \nthat case, you and we must agree to:\n\n \n\n  i. The termination conditions, including the effective date; and\n\n \n\n  ii. In the case of a partial termination, the portion to be terminated.\n\n \n\n  c. Unilaterally by the recipient. You may unilaterally terminate this award, in whole or in part, by sending us written \nnotification that states:\n\n \n\n  i. The reasons for the termination;\n\n \n\n  ii. The effective date; and\n\n \n\n  iii. In the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. In that case, however, we may terminate the \naward in its entirety if we determine that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for \nwhich we made the award.\n\n \n\n  2. If this award is terminated in its entirety before the end of the performance period, you must complete the \ncloseout actions for which you are responsible under OAR Article VI. The due date for each action is to be \nmeasured relative to the date of termination.\n\n \n\n  3. If this award is only partially terminated before the end of the performance period, with a reduced or modified \nportion of the award continuing through the end of the performance period, then closeout actions will occur at the \nend of the performance period as specified in OAR Article VI.\n\n \n\n  4. You will continue to have all of the post-closeout responsibilities that OAR Article VII specifies for you if this \naward is wholly or partially terminated before the end of the performance period.\n\n \n\n  Section C. Effects of suspension or termination of the award on allowability of costs. If we suspend or terminate \nthis award prior to the end of the period of performance, costs resulting from obligations that you incurred:\n\n \n\n  1. Before the effective date of the suspension or termination are allowable if:\n\n \n\n  a. You properly incurred those obligations;\n\n \n\n  b. You did not incur the obligations in anticipation of the suspension or termination;\n\n \n\n  c. In the case of termination, the costs resulted from obligations that were noncancellable after the termination; \nand\n\n \n\n  d. The costs would have been allowable if we had not suspended or terminated the award and it had expired \nnormally at the end of the period of performance.\n\n \n\n\n\n  2. During the suspension or after the termination are not allowable unless we expressly authorize them, either in \nthe notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix D to Part 1136\u2014Terms and Conditions for OAR Article IV, \u201cClaims, Disputes, and Appeals\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in OAR Article IV in accordance with \n\u00a7&thinsp;1136.405 of this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  OAR Article IV.

appendices.\n\n \n\n  (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and \nconditions for grants and cooperative agreements.\n\n \n\n\n\n  (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the \narticle addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Government and \nrecipients.\n\n \n\n  (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the \ncorresponding subpart and the authorization in \u00a7&thinsp;1138.5, which permit a DoD Component to vary from the \nstandard wording in some situations.\n\n \n\n  (c) The following table shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A \nthrough L to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in subparts A through L, respectively, as \nsupplemented by the authorization in \u00a7&thinsp;1138.5):\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    &emsp;\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      In . . .\n\n     \n\n      You will find terms and conditions specifying recipients' rights and responsibilities related to . . .\n\n     \n\n      That would appear in an award within SUB Article . . .\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix A\n\n     \n\n      Distinguishing subawards and procurements\n\n     \n\n      I.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix B\n\n     \n\n      Pre-award and time of award responsibilities\n\n     \n\n      II.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Appendix C\n\n     \n\n      Informational content of subawards\n\n     \n\n      III.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix D\n\n     \n\n      Financial and program management requirements for subawards\n\n     \n\n      IV.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix E\n\n     \n\n      Property requirements for subawards\n\n     \n\n      V.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix F\n\n     \n\n      Procurement procedures to include in subawards\n\n     \n\n      VI.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix G\n\n     \n\n      Financial, programmatic, and property reporting requirements for subawards\n\n     \n\n      VII.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix H\n\n\n\n     \n\n      Other administrative requirements for subawards\n\n     \n\n      VIII.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix I\n\n     \n\n      National policy requirements for subawards\n\n     \n\n      IX.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix J\n\n     \n\n      Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration\n\n     \n\n      X.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix K\n\n     \n\n      Requirements concerning subrecipients' lower-tier subawards\n\n     \n\n      XI.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Appendix L\n\n     \n\n      Fixed-amount subawards\n\n     \n\n      XII.\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.5\n\n\n\n \n\n  Authority to omit or reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII.\n\n \n\n  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:\n\n \n\n  (a) Omit SUB Articles II through XII that are the subject of this part if the DoD Component does not allow recipients \nto make subawards under awards using those terms and conditions. The DoD Component also may amend SUB \nArticle I in that case, to state the prohibition on making subawards and limit the recipient's responsibility to ensuring \nthat any transaction it awards at the next tier is a procurement transaction.\n\n \n\n  (b) Reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII that do not apply to the DoD Component's awards using those \nterms and conditions. For example, the DoD Component may reserve paragraphs in SUB Articles IV through IX \nspecifying administrative requirements that flow down solely to subawards to States if it determines that there is no \npossibility of a subaward to a State under any of the awards using its general terms and conditions. Similarly, it may \nreserve SUB Article XII if it does not permit any fixed-amount subawards under its awards.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart a Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements Sub Article I</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.100\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article I.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article I specifies requirements for a recipient to determine whether each transaction it makes at the next tier \nbelow a DoD grant or cooperative agreement is a subaward or a procurement transaction. It thereby implements \nOMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.201(a) and 200.330.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.105\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article I.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must:\n\n \n\n  (1) Require the recipient to determine the nature of transactions it makes under its award; and\n\n \n\n  (2) Inform the recipient about the effect of that determination on the procedures for awarding the transaction and \nthe transaction's terms and conditions.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix A to this part provides for SUB Article I.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart B Pre Award and Time of Award Responsibilities Sub Article Ii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.200\n\n \n\n\n\n  Purpose of SUB Article II.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article II specifies requirements concerning subrecipients' unique entity identifiers and pre-award risk \nassessments. It also references requirements in REP Article IV to report on subawards and subrecipients' executive \ncompensation. It thereby partially implements OMB guidance in:\n\n \n\n  (a) 2 CFR parts 25 and 170;\n\n \n\n  (b) 2 CFR 200.207; 200.300(b), as it applies to subaward reporting; and 200.331(b); and\n\n \n\n  (c) Subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by DoD at 2 CFR part 1125.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.205\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article II.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require the recipient to:\n\n \n\n  (1) Obtain an entity's unique entity identifier before making a subaward to the entity;\n\n \n\n  (2) Notify potential subrecipients in advance about that requirement; and\n\n \n\n  (3) Conduct a pre-award risk assessment of an entity before making a subaward to the entity and adjust subaward \nterms and conditions if warranted by the results of the assessment.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix B to this part provides for SUB Article II.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart C Informational Content of Subawards Sub Article Iii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.300\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article III.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article III specifies information that recipients must include in subawards they make under DoD grants and \ncooperative agreements. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1).\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.305\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article III.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include certain \ninformation items in each subaward they make.\n\n\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix C to this part provides for SUB Article III.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart D Financial and Program Management Requirements for Subawards Sub Article Iv</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.400\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article IV.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article IV specifies the financial and program management requirements that recipients must include in \nsubawards they make under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby implements OMB guidance in the \nfollowing portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to subawards:\n\n \n\n  (a) Sections 200.209 and 200.302 through 200.309; and\n\n \n\n  (b) Subparts E and F.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.405\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article IV.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include pertinent \nrequirements concerning financial and program management in each subaward they make.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix D to this part provides for SUB Article IV.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart E Property Requirements for Subawards Sub Article V</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.500\n\n \n\n  Purposes of SUB Article V in relation to other articles.\n\n \n\n  (a) Purposes. SUB Article V specifies requirements concerning equipment, supplies, and real, intangible, and \nfederally owned property that recipients must include in subawards they make under DoD grants and cooperative \nagreements. It thereby:\n\n \n\n  (1) Specifies which of the requirements in PROP Articles I through VI of the award flow down to subawards; and\n\n \n\n  (2) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 through 200.316, as those sections apply to subawards.\n\n \n\n\n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix E to this part provides as Section A of SUB Article V to inform recipients about the relationship between \nrequirements for the recipient in PROP Articles I through VI and requirements for subawards in SUB Article V.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.505\n\n \n\n  Title to property under subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to title to \nproperty under subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the \ndefault wording appendix E to this part provides as Section B of SUB Article V to specify the requirements \nconcerning title to property that recipients must include in their subawards.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exception. If a DoD Component has the necessary statutory authority to do so and includes provisions in \nparagraph A.2 of PROP Article I to identify any property acquired under the award as exempt property, as \ndescribed in 2 CFR 1130.105, the DoD Component may at its option insert wording in paragraph B.1.b of SUB \nArticle V to allow recipients to pass through those provisions to subrecipients.\n\n \n\n  (i) It is critical, however, that the DoD Component ensures that the wording of paragraph B.1.b is consistent with \nthe statutory authority.\n\n \n\n  (ii) For example, if the statutory authority is 31 U.S.C. 6306\u2014as described in 2 CFR 1130.105(b)(2)(i)\u2014the \nwording of paragraph B.1.b of SUB Article V may permit a recipient to flow down the substance of the exempt \nproperty provision in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I only to a subrecipient that is a nonprofit institution of higher \neducation or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.510\n\n \n\n  Property management system requirements for subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. DoD Components' general terms and conditions must address the standards for property \nmanagement systems that apply to subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To specify the property management system standards that recipients must \ninclude in their subawards, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix E to this part provides as Section C of SUB Article V.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.515\n\n \n\n  Use and disposition of real property, equipment, supplies, and federally owned property under subawards.\n\n \n\n\n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirements concerning \nuse and disposition of real property, equipment, supplies, and federally owned property that recipients must include \nin subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix E to this part provides for Sections D through F of SUB Article V.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.520\n\n \n\n  Intangible property under subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the provisions concerning \nintangible property that recipients must include in subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To specify the intangible property provisions that recipients must \ninclude in their subawards, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix E to this part provides as Section G of SUB Article V.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may delete the reference to \u201cSection B of PROP \nArticle VI\u201d in the default wording appendix E to this part provides for paragraph G.2 of SUB Article V and provide \nalternative wording if:\n\n \n\n  (i) Those general terms and conditions will be used in awards for purposes other than research or education, as \ndescribed in 2 CFR 1130.610(c)(3); and\n\n \n\n  (ii) The DoD Component wants to specify that nonprofit and governmental recipients include either:\n\n \n\n  (A) No provisions concerning inventions in subawards to for-profit entities; or\n\n \n\n  (B) Provisions in subawards to for-profit entities that differ from those the DoD Component's general terms and \nconditions specify for nonprofit and governmental recipients.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart F Procurement Procedures to Include in Subawards Sub Article Vi</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.600\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article VI.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article VI of the general terms and conditions specifies procurement provisions recipients must include in \ntheir subaward terms and conditions. It thereby:\n\n \n\n  (a) Specifies which of the requirements in PROC Articles I through III of the award flow down to subawards; and\n\n \n\n\n\n  (b) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.326 and appendix II to 2 CFR part 200, as those \nportions of 2 CFR part 200 apply to subawards; and\n\n \n\n  (c) Partially implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(d), 200.213, and 200.517, as those sections of 2 CFR \npart 200 apply to subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.605\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article VI.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients' subawards \ninclude requirements for subrecipients' procurement procedures.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To specify the requirements for procurement procedures that a recipient must \ninclude in its subawards, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to \nthis part provides for SUB Article VI.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart G Financial Programmatic and Property Reporting Requirements for Subawards Sub Article Vii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.700\n\n \n\n  Purposes of SUB Article VII in relation to other articles.\n\n \n\n  (a) Purposes. SUB Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies provisions concerning reporting that \nrecipients must include in their subaward terms and conditions, as applicable. It thereby implements OMB guidance \nin the following sections of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to subawards:\n\n \n\n  (1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.327 through 200.329; and\n\n \n\n  (2) 2 CFR 200.315(c), as it relates to invention reporting; and\n\n \n\n  (3) 2 CFR 200.343(a), as it relates to financial and performance reporting.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix G to this part provides as Section A of SUB Article VII to inform recipients about the relationship between \nrequirements for the recipient in REP Articles I through III and requirements for subawards in SUB Article VII.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.705\n\n \n\n  Performance reporting requirements for subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify performance reporting \nrequirements for subawards.\n\n\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording \nappendix G to this part provides as Section B of SUB Article VII to specify the performance reporting requirements \nthat recipients must include in their subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.710\n\n \n\n  Financial reporting requirements for subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify financial reporting requirements \nfor subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. appendix G to this part provides default wording for Section C of SUB Article VII \nto specify the financial reporting requirements that recipients must include in their subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.715\n\n \n\n  Reporting on property under subawards.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirements for reporting \non property that recipients must include in their subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD \nComponent's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix G to this part provides as Section D of \nSUB Article VII.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart H Other Administrative Requirements for Subawards Sub Article Viii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.800\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article VIII.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article VIII of the general terms and conditions:\n\n \n\n  (a) Specifies provisions that a recipient must include in its subaward terms and conditions concerning submission \nand maintenance of subrecipient information; records retention and access; remedies and termination; disputes, \nhearings, and appeals; collection of amounts due; closeout; and post-closeout adjustments and continuing \nresponsibilities.\n\n \n\n  (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.333 through 200.345, as those sections \napply to subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.805\n\n\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article VIII.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the administrative requirements \nthat a recipient must include in its subaward terms and conditions in areas covered by OAR Articles I through VII of \nthe recipient's prime award.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a \nDoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the default wording appendix H to this part provides for \nSUB Article VIII.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add one or more sections to the default \nwording that appendix H to this part provides for SUB Article VIII if the DoD Component added requirements to \nOAR Article IV of its general terms and conditions, in accordance with paragraph 2 CFR 1136.405(b)(2), because a \nstatute or regulation requires recipients to provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other \nadministrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters. The \nadditional wording in SUB Article VIII would address the flow down to subrecipients of the added requirements in \nOAR Article IV.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart I National Policy Requirements for Subawards Sub Article Ix</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.900\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article IX.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article IX addresses national policy requirements that recipients must include in their subaward terms and \nconditions.

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements for recipients' \nmonitoring of subrecipients and related post-award administration of subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix J to this part provides for SUB Article X of its general terms and conditions.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart K Requirements Concerning Subrecipients' Lower Tier Subawards Sub Article Xi</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.1100\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article XI.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article XI specifies requirements that a recipient must include in any subaward under which it judges that the \nsubrecipient may make lower-tier subawards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a) through \n(c) and other portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to lower-tier subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.1105\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article XI.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements that recipients \nmust include in subawards to entities that may make lower-tier subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording \nappendix K to this part provides for SUB Article XI.\n\n <h2>\n\n  Subpart L Fixed Amount Subawards Sub Article Xii</h2>\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.1200\n\n\n\n \n\n  Purpose of SUB Article XII.\n\n \n\n  SUB Article XII specifies policy and procedures concerning recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards under DoD \ngrants and cooperative agreements. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.201(b) and 200.332 and \nother portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to fixed-amount subawards.\n\n \n\n  \u00a7&thinsp;1138.1205\n\n \n\n  Content of SUB Article XII.\n\n \n\n  (a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a \nfixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements \nthe recipient must include in those subawards.\n\n \n\n  (b) Award terms and conditions\u2014(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the \nwording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII.\n\n \n\n  (2) Exceptions.\n\n \n\n  (i) In addition to the authorities provided in \u00a7&thinsp;1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording \nappendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add \nwording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the \nComponent's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the \nprogram or programs that use its general terms and conditions.\n\n \n\n  (ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-\namount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix \nL provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, \nwell-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being \nreimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix A to Part 1138\u2014Terms and Conditions for SUB Article I, \u201cDistinguishing Subawards and \nProcurements\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in SUB Article I in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;1138.105 \nof this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  SUB Article I. Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements. (December 2014)</h3>\n\n \n\n  Section A. Required recipient determination. For each transaction into which you enter with another entity at the \nnext tier below this award, you must determine whether the transaction is a subaward or procurement.\n\n \n\n  Section B. Considerations in making the determination.\n\n\n\n \n\n  1. The primary purpose of the transaction between you and the other entity is the key factor you must use to \ndetermine whether the transaction is a subaward or a procurement.\n\n \n\n  a. The transaction is a subaward and the other entity therefore a subrecipient if the transaction's primary purpose \nis for you to transfer\u2014-for performance by the other entity\u2014-a portion of the substantive program for which we are \nproviding financial assistance to you through this award. You will continue to be accountable to us for performance \nof the project or program under the award, including portions performed by any subrecipients.\n\n \n\n  b. The transaction is a procurement and the other entity therefore your contractor if the transaction's primary \npurpose is for you to purchase goods or services that you need to perform the substantive program supported by \nthis award. The distinction from a subaward is the contractor is not performing a portion of the substantive program \nas a result of the transaction.\n\n \n\n  2. What you call the transaction is not a factor in distinguishing a subaward from a procurement. If the transaction \nmeets the criterion in paragraph B.1.a of this article, it is a subaward for purposes of the requirements of this award \neven if you call and consider the transaction a \u201ccontract.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Section C. Effect of the determination on the next-tier transaction.\n\n \n\n  1. Process for awarding the transaction. One important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier \ntransaction is a subaward or procurement is that there are different requirements governing the pre-award and time \nof award processes that you use to award the transaction.\n\n \n\n  a. SUB Article II of this award specifies pre-award and time of award responsibilities for subawards.\n\n \n\n  b. PROC Articles I and II of this award govern pre-award and time of award process for awarding procurement \ntransactions.\n\n \n\n  2. Transaction terms and conditions. A second important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier \ntransaction is a subaward or procurement is that the terms and conditions you include in a subaward differ from \nthose you include in a procurement transaction.\n\n \n\n  a. Section C of SUB Article II of this award addresses requirements you must include in subaward terms and \nconditions. Those requirements are generally either identical with or directly related to requirements in the general \nterms and conditions of this award. They include national policy requirements as well as administrative \nrequirements in areas such as financial and programmatic management, property administration, procurement, and \nreporting.\n\n \n\n  b. PROC Article III of this award lists requirements you must include in a procurement transaction when applicable \nto the procurement.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix B to Part 1138\u2014Terms and Conditions for SUB Article II, \u201cPre-Award and Time of Award \nResponsibilities\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n\n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in SUB Article II in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;1138.205 \nof this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  SUB Article II. Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities. (December 2014)</h3>\n\n \n\n  Section A. Requirements for unique entity identifiers.\n\n \n\n  1. Definition of \u201centity.\u201d For purposes of the unique entity identifier requirements in paragraphs A.2 and 3 of this \nsection, \u201centity\u201d has the meaning given in paragraph C.3 of appendix A to OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.\n\n \n\n  2. Pre-notification of potential subrecipients. You must notify potential subrecipients that no entity may receive a \nsubaward from you under this award unless it has provided its unique entity identifier to you.\n\n \n\n  3. Restriction on making subawards.\n\n \n\n  a. General. You may not make a subaward to an entity unless the entity has provided its unique entity identifier to \nyou.\n\n \n\n  b. Exception. You may make a subaward to an entity that has not provided its unique entity identifier to you in rare \ncases in which you requested and we approved an exemption from the requirement for the entity to provide a \nunique entity identifier, based on the criteria in OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.110(d).\n\n \n\n  Section B. Pre-award risk assessment.\n\n \n\n  1. Before making a subaward to an entity, you must perform a risk assessment of the prospective subrecipient, as \ndescribed in 2 CFR 200.331(b). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(c) provides examples of factors you may \nconsider in evaluating risk.\n\n \n\n  2. As part of the risk assessment under paragraph B.1 of this article, you must:\n\n \n\n  a. Verify that neither the prospective subrecipient nor its principals under the subaward are excluded or \ndisqualified from participating in the transaction, in accordance with requirements in Subpart C of OMB guidance in \n2 CFR part 180, as implemented by DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; and\n\n \n\n  b. If warranted by risks you identify, determine whether to impose award-specific terms and conditions in the \nsubaward to mitigate the risks.\n\n \n\n  i. These award-specific terms and conditions may be in addition to, or differ from, the terms and conditions that \nSUB Articles IV through IX of this award require you to include in subawards.\n\n \n\n  ii. They may include items such as those listed in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(b)(1) through (6).\n\n \n\n\n\n  iii. Your procedures for imposing and removing the additional or different requirements must comply with the \nprocedural guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(c) and (d).\n\n \n\n  Section C. Subaward content.\n\n \n\n  1. Cost-type subawards.\n\n \n\n  a. SUB Article III of this award specifies informational content that you must include in each cost-type subaward.\n\n \n\n  b. SUB Articles IV through VIII specify administrative requirements that you must include:\n\n \n\n  i. As applicable, in each cost-type subaward to:\n\n \n\n  A. A domestic U.S. entity (i.e., an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or\n\n \n\n  B. An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and\n\n \n\n  ii. To the maximum extent practicable in each cost-type subaward to either a foreign public entity or an \norganizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless \nof whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, \nyou may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.\n\n \n\n  c. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each \ncost-type subaward.\n\n \n\n  2. Fixed-amount type subawards. SUB Article XII of this award specifies informational content and administrative \nand national policy requirements that you must include in any fixed-amount subaward that you make.\n\n \n\n  3. Additional subaward terms and conditions. You may include other requirements in your subawards that you \nneed in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program (including \nportions performed by subrecipients) and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy \nrequirements.\n\n \n\n  Section D. Subaward and executive compensation reporting. You must report subaward obligating actions and \ninformation on subrecipients' executive compensation as required by REP Article IV of this award.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix C to Part 1138\u2014Terms and Conditions for SUB Article III, \u201cInformational Content of Subawards\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in SUB Article III in accordance with \n\u00a7&thinsp;1138.305 of this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  SUB Article III. Informational Content of Subawards. (December 2014)</h3>\n\n \n\n\n\n  Section A. Informational content in general. You must include in each subaward (and each subsequent \namendment to a subaward that alters the amount of the subaward) the information specified in OMB guidance in 2 \nCFR 200.331(a)(1), \u201cFederal Award Identification,\u201d with the clarifications provided in Sections B through G of this \narticle.\n\n \n\n  Section B. Federal award identification number and award date. The \u201cFederal Award Identification Number\u201d and \n\u201cFederal Award Date\u201d described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), respectively, are the award number and award \ndate for this award to you. You must provide the information in a way that makes it clear that the subaward is under \nthis DoD award.\n\n \n\n  Section C. Amount of Federal funds obligated.\n\n \n\n  1. The \u201cAmount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass-through entity to the subrecipient\u201d that is \ndescribed in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vi) is either:\n\n \n\n  a. The amount of your obligation to the subrecipient, if the terms and conditions of this award do not require you to \nprovide any cost sharing or matching for the project or program the award supports; or\n\n \n\n  b. The amount of the Federal share of your subaward obligation if this award does require cost sharing or \nmatching, which in that case is the product of:\n\n \n\n  i. The Federal share of total project costs under this DoD award to you, as a percentage of those total project \ncosts; and\n\n \n\n  ii. The total amount of project costs obligated for the subaward action.\n\n \n\n  2. Note that the total project costs of the award and subaward, as used in paragraphs C.1.b.i and ii of this section, \ninclude any cost sharing or matching that you or the subrecipient provides if you are counting it toward the cost \nsharing or matching required under this award.\n\n \n\n  Section D. Total amount obligated to the subrecipient. The \u201cTotal Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the \nSubrecipient by the pass-through entity including the current obligation,\u201d as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vii), is \nthe cumulative amount to date of the amounts described in Section C of this article.\n\n \n\n  Section E. Total Amount of the Federal Award. The \u201cTotal Amount of the Federal Award committed to the \nsubrecipient by the pass-through entity,\u201d as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(viii), is the total amount through the \nend of the subaward that you and the subrecipient mutually agreed upon, to include: funding obligated to date, any \nfuture anticipated funding increments, and any options you may exercise in the future.\n\n \n\n  Section F.

In that \nsame paragraph of 2 CFR part 200, the \u201cawarding official\u201d is the individual in your organization who made the \nsubaward.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Section G. Indirect cost rate. With respect to the requirement in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(xiii) for the subaward to \ninclude the \u201cIndirect cost rate for the Federal award:\u201d\n\n \n\n  1. The rate the subaward must include is the subrecipient's rate, whether it is a rate set by negotiation with a \nFederal Government agency or you, or is the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f).\n\n \n\n  2. You are required to include the indirect cost rate only if the subrecipient is willing to share that information with \nyou and assents that information about its rate is not proprietary. If a subrecipient is not willing to share information \nabout its indirect cost rate with you, consult the grants officer for this award to explore alternative ways to assess \nthe reasonableness of costs of the subaward.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Appendix D to Part 1138\u2014Terms and Conditions for SUB Article IV, \u201cFinancial and Program Management \nRequirements for Subawards\u201d</h3>\n\n \n\n  DoD Components must use the following standard wording in SUB Article IV in accordance with \n\u00a7&thinsp;1138.405 of this part:\n\n <h3>\n\n  SUB Article IV.

Unless the project or program scope is specific, with definite outcomes, and you are able to establish a \nreasonable estimate of the actual costs of accomplishing those outcomes.\n\n \n\n  c. If you will predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must \nprovide under the subaward.\n\n \n\n  d. If the subrecipient will acquire any real property or equipment under the subaward.\n\n \n\n  2. For fixed-amount subawards not prohibited by paragraph 1 of this section and except as provided in Section B \nof this article, you must obtain our prior approval before making a fixed-amount type of subaward.\n\n \n\n  a. If Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to obtain our prior approval before you make any subaward, and you \ndo not identify the subaward as a fixed-amount subaward when you obtain that approval, then you must \nsubsequently request separate approval before awarding it as a fixed-amount type of subaward.\n\n \n\n  b. If a subaward is identified as a fixed-amount type of subaward in the budget you submit for our approval, then \nour approval of the budget is the required prior approval.\n\n \n\n  Section B. Fixed-amount subawards that do not require prior approval. You are not required to obtain our prior \napproval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward if:\n\n \n\n  1. The subaward is to either:\n\n \n\n  a. A foreign public entity; or\n\n \n\n  b. An organizational unit of a foreign organization, if that unit does not have a place of business in the United \nStates, regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one.\n\n \n\n  2. You determine that the portion of the project or program under this award which the subrecipient will be carrying \nout under the subaward has one or more specific outcomes with the following characteristics:\n\n \n\n  a. You can define the outcomes well enough to specify them at the time you make the subaward. Note that:\n\n \n\n  i. Outcomes are distinct from inputs needed to achieve the outcomes, such as amounts or percentages of time \nthat subrecipient employees or other participants will spend on the project or program.\n\n \n\n  ii. The inherently unpredictable nature of basic or applied research makes it rarely, if ever, possible to define \nspecific research outcomes in advance, which makes fixed-amount subawards inappropriate for research. Note that \ntechnical performance reports serve to document research outcomes but are not themselves outcomes, \nnotwithstanding the definition of \u201cperformance goals\u201d in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.76.\n\n \n\n  b. The accomplishment of each outcome will be observable and verifiable by you when it occurs, so that you will \nnot need to rely solely on the subrecipient's assurance of that accomplishment.\n\n \n\n\n\n  c. The subrecipient associates its projected costs with outcomes in the proposal it submits to you, and you are \nconfident that the costs of accomplishment of the outcomes will equal or exceed the subaward amount. This \nrequires either that you have a high degree of confidence:\n\n \n\n  i. In your estimate of the costs associated with accomplishing the well-defined and observable outcomes, based \non the prospective subrecipient's proposal (and using the applicable cost principles in FMS Article III as a guide); or\n\n \n\n  ii. That those costs will be within a finite range, rather than a specific amount, so that you may provide an amount \nof funding under the subaward that does not exceed the lower end of the range, with the provision that the \nsubrecipient agrees to provide any balance above that amount that ultimately is needed to accomplish the \noutcomes. Your subaward then would include a term or condition to reflect the subrecipient's agreement to provide \nthat balance (which would be in an amount to be post-determined, when the outcomes are accomplished). Note \nthat this is distinct from a situation in which you predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or \nmatching that the subrecipient must provide under its subaward, a situation in which paragraph A.1.c of this article \nprohibits use of a fixed-amount subaward.\n\n \n\n  3. a. The subaward is based on a fixed rate per unit of outcome (or \u201cunit cost\u201d) and you have both the confidence:\n\n \n\n  i. That is described in paragraph B.2.c of this article in the estimated costs associated with each unit of outcome; \nand\n\n \n\n  ii. In the subrecipient's guarantee that it can accomplish at least the number of units of outcome on which your \ntotal subaward amount will be based (i.e., the product of the unit cost and the number of units of outcome the \nsubrecipient guarantees to accomplish).\n\n \n\n  b. Note, however, that not every fixed rate subaward is also a fixed-amount subaward. If you have confidence in \nthe unit cost but not also in the subrecipient's ability to guarantee the number of units of outcome that it will \naccomplish, then you should set a not-to-exceed award amount based on the number of units desired and reduce \nthe subaward amount at the end if the subrecipient accomplishes fewer than that number. Examples of activities for \nwhich it may be appropriate to award this type of fixed rate subaward that is not a fixed-amount subaward include:\n\n \n\n  i. A clinical trial for which the unit cost is the cost of treating each participant. The not-to-exceed amount would be \nbased on the number of participants the subrecipient planned to recruit and the final award on the number who \nactually participated, documentation for which would be subject to audit.\n\n \n\n  ii. Labor costs for performance of a portion of the project or program under this award by a firm that treats its \nindirect cost rate as proprietary information. The unit cost in that case may be \u201cloaded\u201d labor rates for the firm's \nemployees that include indirect costs. The final award amount would depend on the number of labor hours the \nfirm's employees expended under the subaward, documentation for which may be audited without exposing \nproprietary details associated with the actual costs.\n\n \n\n  Section C. Informational content of fixed-amount subawards. You must include in each fixed-amount subaward \nthe informational content, other than the indirect cost rate, that is described in SUB Article III of this award.\n\n \n\n  Section D. Terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements.\n\n \n\n\n\n  1. General. This section:\n\n \n\n  a. Specifies the minimum set of terms and conditions (in lieu of the more extensive set specified in SUB Articles IV \nthrough X for cost-type subawards) addressing administrative requirements that you must include in each fixed-\namount subaward:\n\n \n\n  i. To an entity other than a foreign organization, as applicable; and\n\n \n\n  ii. To the maximum extent practicable, to a foreign organization.\n\n \n\n  b. Does not preclude the inclusion of other requirements that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under \nthis award for performance of the project or program and compliance with applicable administrative and national \npolicy requirements.\n\n \n\n  2. Financial and program management requirements.\n\n \n\n  a. Financial management system standards. For a subaward to other than a for-profit entity, your subaward must \nrequire the subrecipient to include the information specified in paragraph B.1 of FMS Article I in its financial \nmanagement system, for the purposes of the non-federal audits required by paragraph 2.d of this section.\n\n \n\n  b. Payments. Your payments must be based on accomplishment of the outcomes and associated costs that you \nused to establish the award amount, rather than on subrecipient expenditures for project or program purposes. \nMilestone payments before the end of the subaward's period of performance may be appropriate if there are \noutcomes that the subrecipient will accomplish at different times during that period.\n\n \n\n  c. Revision of budget and program plans. If our prior approval was required under paragraph A.2 of this article for \nuse of a fixed-amount type of subaward, then you must:\n\n \n\n  i. Request our prior approval for any change in scope or objective of the subaward; and\n\n \n\n  ii. Therefore include a requirement in the subaward for the subrecipient to request that approval through you.\n\n \n\n  d. Non-federal audits. You must include the requirement for non-Federal audits described in Section F of SUB \nArticle IV. The audits are intended to focus on compliance with the performance requirements in the subaward \nterms and conditions and not to review actual costs as they would for a cost-type subaward.\n\n \n\n  3. Property requirements.\n\n \n\n  a. Federally owned property. If the subrecipient will be accountable for federally owned property, you must include \nthe property management system, use, and disposition requirements described in Sections C and F of SUB Article \nV that are applicable to federally owned property.\n\n \n\n\n\n  b. Intangible property. You must include the applicable intangible property requirements described in Section G of \nSUB Article V.\n\n \n\n  4. Reporting requirements. You must include requirements for reporting that you need in order to meet your \nresponsibilities under this award for reporting to us.\n\n \n\n  5. Other administrative requirements.\n\n \n\n  a. Integrity-related information. You must include the substance of the provision in Section C of OAR Article I in \nany subaward you make under this award. The provision must require the subrecipient's disclosure of any evidence \ndirectly to the Inspector General, DoD.\n\n \n\n  b. Records retention and access.\n\n \n\n  i. You must include the requirements for records retention and access in paragraph A.3 and Sections B and F of \nOAR Article II, as applicable, if the subaward is to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, \nlocal government, or Indian tribe. You may not impose any other records retention or access requirements on the \nsubrecipient.\n\n \n\n  ii. You must include the corresponding requirements of 32 CFR 34.42 if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.\n\n \n\n  c. Remedies and termination. You must include:\n\n \n\n  i. The requirements concerning remedies and termination that are described in paragraphs D.1 and 2 of SUB \nArticle VIII;\n\n \n\n  ii. Provisions addressing any hearing and appeal rights the subrecipient has, as described in Section E of SUB \nArticle VIII; and\n\n \n\n  iii. Terms and conditions addressing adjustment of the amount of the subaward if it is terminated before the \nsubrecipient accomplishes all of the specified outcomes.\n\n \n\n  d. Continuing responsibilities. You must include requirements concerning continuing responsibilities for audits and \nrecords retention and access that are described in paragraphs B.1 and 3 of OAR Article VII.\n\n \n\n  e. Collection of amounts due. You should consider including requirements concerning collection of amounts due, \nas described in Section F of SUB Article VIII.\n\n \n\n  Section E. National policy requirements for fixed-amount subawards. You must include in the terms and \nconditions of each fixed-amount subaward the national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award \nspecifies, as applicable.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Section F. Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration. You must carry out the subrecipient \nmonitoring and post-award administration actions specified in SUB Article X, as applicable.\n\n \n\n  Section G. Fixed-amount subawards at lower tiers.\n\n \n\n  1. Authority.\n\n \n\n  a. If Section B of this article authorizes you to use a fixed-amount type of subaward without our prior approval in \nsome situations, a cost-type subaward that you make may authorize the subrecipient to use fixed-amount \nsubawards at the next lower tier in those same situations without our prior approval.\n\n \n\n  b. If you wish to allow a subrecipient of a cost-type subaward to use fixed-amount subawards at the next tier in \nother situations (i.e., situations in which this article requires you to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-\namount type of subaward), your subaward terms and conditions must require the subrecipient to submit a request \nthrough you to obtain our prior approval for use of that type of subaward.\n\n \n\n  2. Subaward requirements. If your subrecipient is authorized to use lower-tier fixed-amount subawards, as \ndescribed in paragraphs 1.a and b of this section, your subaward's terms and conditions must:\n\n \n\n  a. Require the subrecipient, before it makes any lower-tier fixed-amount subaward, to:\n\n \n\n  i. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination \nthat SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.\n\n \n\n  ii. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this \naward requires you to make for your subawards.\n\n \n\n  b. Include the requirements specified in Sections A through F of this article.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Dated: October 19, 2016.\n\n  \n\n   Aaron Siegel,\n\n  \n\n   Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.\n\n \n\n [FR Doc. 2016-25701 Filed 11-4-16; 8:45 am]\n\n BILLING CODE 5001-06-P\n\n  \n\n\n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: \neditorial@plusmediasolutions.com \n"}
