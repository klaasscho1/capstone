The airlines involved \nare Mexicana and American Trans Air.\n\n     The last Midway service by Mexicana to Mexico City ended in 1959, said Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for \nthe airport. \n\n Mexicana has five flights a week from Midway to Guadalajara, three to the nearby city of Morelia and one to \nZacatecas in central Mexico. The airline also flies to Mexico from O'Hare Airport. Fernando Flores, Mexicana chief \nexecutive, said that Midway is much closer than O'Hare to the Chicago neighborhoods where many Mexican \nimmigrants live.\n\nAmerican Trans Air has a flight to the resort city of Cancun every day but Thursday, and to Guadalajara every day \nbut Wednesday. \n\nThe resumption of Midway's service to Mexico followed construction of a new area where passengers can be \nscreened by federal immigration, Customs and agriculture officials.
