{"title": "Student's sentence in holding pattern", "body": "\nIt could be months before Jessica Colotl, the Kennesaw State University student whose arrest spawned a \npassionate debate about illegal immigrants attending state colleges, completes her jail sentence, if at all, according \nto the Cobb County solicitor.\n\nColotl was sentenced Monday to three days in Cobb County's jail after her conviction for driving without a license. \nShe spent 45.5 hours in jail before she was tried, so the remaining 26.5 hours will not be served until the Georgia \nCourt of Appeals rules on her expected challenge.\n\n\"It's like the sentence hangs out there, in limbo,\" Cobb Solicitor Barry Morgan told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \n\"All of that's on hold until the case comes back from the Court of Appeals.\"\n\nMorgan said that decision could be three to four months off.\n\nColotl also was sentenced to 11 months and 27 days on probation, and fined $1,000. She could have received as \nmuch as 12 months in jail. The Cobb County solicitor had asked for 10 days.\n\nColotl was born in Mexico and her parents brought her to the U.S. as a child. Upon her arrest she was turned over \nto federal immigration officials.\n\nAfter 37 days in a detention center she was granted a yearlong deportation deferment to finish her studies.\n\nThe appeal in the traffic case is expected to based on the fact that she got a learner's permit following the citation.\n"}
