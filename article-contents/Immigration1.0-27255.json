{"title": "Florida: Agency Faulted In Detention of Mother", "body": "\nAdvocates for immigrants accused a private foster care agency of turning a Mexican mother of two toddlers, and \nher own parents, over to the local authorities to be deported. Lawyers working with the family said a private child \nwelfare group providing services to the Florida Department of Children and Families reported the woman, Karen \nArriaga, 19, to the local police, who have the authority to enforce immigration laws under a program known as \n287(g) that the White House has promised to review, and arranged to have her detained during a supervised visit \nwith her two young sons. Ms. Arriaga's parents were detained during another visit with the boys. A spokeswoman \nat the state agency said the police were contacted because of  accusations of neglect, not in an effort to have the \nfamily deported. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
