conditions of the visa (if any); and\n\n (ii)\n\n \n\n apply for entry permission; and\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n at the time the visa is granted, there is no reason to believe that the holder will be refused entry permission if the \nholder\u2019s travel is consistent with the conditions of the visa relating to travel; and\n\n (c)\n\n \n\n if the holder is granted entry permission, the holder has permission to stay in New Zealand in accordance with the \nconditions of the visa (if any).\n\n \n\n (2)\n\n \n\n A visa granted in an immigration control area indicates that the holder of the visa,\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n if granted entry permission, has permission to stay in New Zealand in accordance with the conditions of the visa (if \nany); and\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n\n\n has permission to travel to New Zealand subsequently and apply for entry permission in accordance with the \nconditions of the visa (if any).\n\n \n\n (3)\n\n \n\n A visa granted onshore indicates that the holder of

\n\n No person is entitled to a visa as of right.\n\n \n\n (2)\n\n \n\n In determining a visa application, the Minister or, subject to any special direction, an immigration officer, in his or \nher discretion,\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n may grant or refuse to grant a visa; and\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n regardless of the class and type of visa that was applied for, may grant a visa of any class and type;

granted; or\n\n (ii)\n\n \n\n from the date specified in the notice (being a date not earlier than the date of notification), in any other case.\n\n \n\n (5)\n\n \n\n To avoid doubt,\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n subsection (2) applies whether the resident visa was granted as an exception to residence instructions or \notherwise:\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n nothing in this section allows the Minister to impose

there are reasonable grounds to believe that biometric information collected from the \nperson would tend to confirm whether or not any matter in section 288(2) applies to him or her.\n\n \n\n\n\n (3)\n\n \n\n For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), it is sufficient if (but not essential that) an immigration officer includes a copy \nof a deportation liability notice or deportation order with

biometric information, or both to be collected \nfrom him or her following a requirement under section 288(1); and\n\n (iii)\n\n \n\n if special biometric information was required, there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the things \nreferred to in section 287 are necessary in order to meet the entry or transit requirements of any country to which \nor through which the respondent is to travel; and\n\n (iv)\n\n \n\n in all the circumstances, it is reasonable to make the order:\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n\n\n in the case of an application relating to a refusal of a requirement under section 288(2),\u2014\n\n (i)\n\n \n\n there is good cause to suspect that any matter in section 288(2) applies to the respondent; and\n\n (ii)\n\n \n\n there are reasonable grounds to believe that biometric information collected from the respondent would tend to \nconfirm or disprove that any matter in section 288(2) applies to the respondent; and\n\n (iii)\n\n \n\n the respondent has refused to allow biometric information to be collected from him or her following a requirement \nunder section 288(2); and\n\n (iv)\n\n \n\n in all the circumstances, it is reasonable to make the

given by the respondent for opposing the making of the order; and\n\n (b)\n\n\n\n \n\n in relation to an application under section 289(1), where special biometric information is sought, any evidence \nregarding the necessity of obtaining from the respondent any of the things referred to in section 287 that are \nrequired in order to meet the entry or transit requirements of any country to which or through which the person is to \ntravel; and\n\n (c)\n\n \n\n in relation to an application under section 289(2), any evidence regarding the importance, to the investigation of \nthe relevant matter, of obtaining biometric information from the respondent.\n\n \n\n (3)\n\n \n\n A person served with a compulsion order must allow the biometric information or special biometric information \nspecified in the order to be collected from him or her.\n\n \n\n Section 290: replaced, on 7 May 2015, by section 73 of the Immigration Amendment Act 2015 (2015 No 48).\n\n 290A Obtaining biometric

him or her in, a suitable place where the required biometric information can be \ncollected; and\n\n (c)\n\n \n\n collect, as soon as practicable, the required biometric information from the person, by force if necessary.\n\n \n\n (2)\n\n \n\n If force is used under subsection (1)(c), it must be reasonable and no more than is necessary to collect the \nrequired biometric information from the person.\n\n \n\n (3)\n\n \n\n The person must be released from detention as soon as the required biometric information has been collected, \nunless the person\u2019s continued detention is authorised

same person, does not prohibit\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n the making of an application under section 289 for a compulsion order in respect of a matter; or\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n a Judge from making a compulsion order in respect of a matter.\n\n \n\n (2)\n\n \n\n Notwithstanding anything in this section, where a further application for a compulsion order is made in respect of a \nmatter in relation to which a previous compulsion order application has been made, the Judge may refuse to make \nthe order sought if he or she is satisfied that the further application is vexatious or an abuse of the process of the \ncourt.\n\n Powers generally\n\n 292 Immigration officer may have assistance\n\n \n\n For the purpose of performing his or her functions under this Part, an immigration officer may be

officer may issue a search warrant to an immigration officer if the issuing officer is satisfied that there \nare reasonable grounds\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n to suspect that any relevant offence specified in the application has been committed, is being committed, or will be \ncommitted; and\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n to believe that the search will find evidential material in respect of the offence in or on the place or thing specified \nin the application.\n\n \n\n\n\n (4)\n\n \n\n In this section, relevant offence means an offence against\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n this Act or any regulations made

for arrest and detention to be arrested under section 313, or making an \napplication for a warrant of commitment under section 316, an immigration officer and the person liable for arrest \nand detention may agree that the person will do all or any of the following things:\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n reside at a specified place:\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n report to a specified place at specified periods or times

that, if the person fails to comply with any agreed requirement, the person may be detained \nunder section 312 or arrested and detained under section 313.\n\n \n\n (5)\n\n \n\n An immigration officer may at any time, in the officer\u2019s absolute discretion, decide to end any agreement made \nunder subsection (1).\n\n \n\n (6)\n\n \n\n A person may be detained under section 312 or arrested and detained under section 313\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n if an immigration officer determines that the person, without reasonable excuse,\u2014\n\n (i)\n\n \n\n has failed to reside at the specified place;

District Court Judge in accordance with subsection (3) of that section.\n\n \n\n (8)\n\n \n\n\n\n An application for release on conditions under subsection (6)(b) must be considered having regard to section 317, \n318, or 323, as appropriate.\n\n \n\n (9)\n\n \n\n If a member of a mass arrival group is dealt with under subsection (6),\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n he or she\u2014\n\n (i)\n\n \n\n is no longer to be treated as a member of a mass arrival group for the purposes of this Act; and\n\n (ii)\n\n \n\n must, from the time of the Judge\u2019s determination, be dealt with under this Act as any other individual would be; and\n\n (b)\n\n \n\n the Judge must consequentially amend the warrant of commitment relating to the mass arrival group to exclude the \nmember from the warrant.\n\n \n\n

the Judge must immediately \ntransfer the application to the High Court for consideration by a nominated Judge (as defined in section 252(2)).\n\n \n\n (4)\n\n \n\n If the chief executive considers that it will be necessary for a Judge to access classified information in order to \nmake a decision in relation to an application under section 316 or 324, the chief executive may make the \napplication directly to the High Court for consideration by a nominated Judge.\n\n \n\n (5)\n\n \n\n If this section applies, the person may continue to be detained\u2014\n\n (a)\n\n \n\n without
