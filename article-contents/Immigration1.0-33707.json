{"title": "Protest disrupts regents meeting", "body": "\nATHENS --- About a dozen students halted a state Board of Regents meeting for a few minutes Wednesday, \nprotesting a policy that bans illegal immigrants from Georgia's top colleges, plus the use of a coal-fired boiler on \nthe University of Georgia campus.\n\nThe ban, which went into place in fall 2011, prohibits illegal immigrants from attending colleges that had to turn \naway academically qualified students for the past two years. It applies to UGA, Georgia Tech, Georgia State, \nGeorgia Health Sciences and Georgia College & State universities.\n\nA few students also held signs demanding UGA shut down the coal-fired boiler on campus.\n\nThe college plans to replace it but has said it will take time. Students want administrators to commit to a deadline \nand work with experts and the UGA community to come up with a sustainable alternative, said senior Ian Karra, one \nof the protesters.\n\nSecurity forced the students to leave within minutes.\n\nUGA President Michael Adams told the board there's \"never a shortage of free speech\" at the college.\n\nBefore the protest, Adams was discussing how the university is expanding medical education and taking other \nsteps to meet state needs.\n\nThe regents typically meet in Atlanta, but twice a year the board meets at a state college. UGA hosted the two-day \nmeeting. The other meeting at a college took place in April at Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus.\n\nThe next regents meeting will take place on Nov. 13 in Atlanta. It will be the final meeting of the year unless \npressing business should require a meeting in December.\n"}
