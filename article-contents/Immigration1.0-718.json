{"title": "TARGET CUNY ILLEGALS", "body": "\nIllegal immigrants would be barred from attending the City University under legislation approved by the state Senate \nyesterday.\n\nThe bill, which passed 39 to 17, would also require college admissions officers at CUNY and the State University to \ninform the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service within 45 days if they find an applicant is an illegal \nimmigrant.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Frank Padavan (R-Queens), charged that New York's public colleges currently serve 4,300 \nundocumented immigrants at a cost of more than $ 30 million to taxpayers.\n\n\"In this time of budget cuts, it's ironic that we're providing a subsidized education to people who shouldn't be in this \ncountry,\" Padavan said.\n\nAbout 80% of these illegal immigrants attend CUNY, Padavan said, and most of them pay reduced tuition prices \nthat apply to residents.\n\nCUNY lawyers said that denying educational access to certain immigrants may be unconstitutional based on \nprevious Supreme Court rulings.\n\nNo sponsor for the bill has come forward in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, where it has little chance of passing.\n\n\"Having a lot of these [immigrant] students in our system is a great bargain,\" said Assemblyman Edward Sullivan \n(D-Manhattan), chairman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee. \"They are educated elsewhere for 12 \nyears. Then we educate them for a few years and get their productivity for the rest of their lives.\"\n"}
