{"title": "Bush talks up immigration deal in weekly radio address", "body": "\nPresident George W. Bush on Saturday praised senators of both parties for delivering a potential deal to overhaul \nU.S. immigration policy.\n\nThe compromise aims to grant legal status to millions of people now in the country unlawfully, stiffen border security \nand create a program for temporary workers. It also would reshape requirements for new immigrants and take \nmeasures to prevent illegal workers from getting jobs.\n\n\"I appreciate the effort of senators who came together to craft this important legislation,\" Bush said in his weekly \nradio address. \"This bill brings us closer to an immigration system that enforces our laws and upholds the great \nAmerican tradition of welcoming those who share our values and our love of freedom.\"\n\nA victory for Bush is far from assured.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Saturday she was not pleased with the immigration agreement.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after giving a commencement address at the University of San Francisco, Pelosi, D-Calif., \nsaid it would create more restrictive rules on visa eligibility for relatives.\n\nSpouses and minor children of legal residents and citizens could still get green cards, but other relatives would \nhave to qualify under a point system that rewards advanced skills and education.\n\n\"A point system for unification undermines our family values that we espouse in our country,\" said Pelosi.\n\nAn unlikely alliance of liberal and conservative lawmakers championed the proposal, which was announced \nThursday.\n\nThe president used his radio address to tout the deal and build momentum for it, without expressly lobbying \nlawmakers to vote for it. For Bush, approval of a comprehensive plan would be a signature second-term \nachievement.\n\nThe package faces opposition from both sides. Conservatives say it is too lenient on those who have broken the \nlaw; liberals warn it would be unworkable and unfair to migrant families.\n"}
