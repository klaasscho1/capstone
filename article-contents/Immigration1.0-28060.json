{"title": "Without Papers, No Full License; Md. Immigrants' Appointments Cut", "body": "\nThe Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration will cancel scheduled appointments for 8,000 immigrants applying \nfor driver's licenses and has stopped booking them in advance of a new law that will curtail driving privileges for \nillegal immigrants starting June 1.\n\nEvery driver in the state will be affected by the change by having to present a Social Security card or other proof \nthat they are in the country legally to get a license.\n\nAs news of the measure -- passed in the final hour of the General Assembly session Monday -- coursed through the \nimmigrant community, officials mobilized to change computer programs and launch a public information campaign. \nThe current system has allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants to drive but has made \nMaryland vulnerable to fraud by out-of-state motorists.\n\nIllegal immigrants who have licenses can renew them once for a driving permit before they are cut off July 1, \n2015, a date set in a compromise bill muscled through the House of Delegates and the more conservative Senate. \nThe permit will not provide access to federal buildings or commercial airplanes.\n\nGov. Martin O'Malley (D) is expected to sign the bill next month. By joining 46 states that require lawful presence of \ndrivers, Maryland will comply with the federal security law known as Real ID.\n\n\"Everyone applying for a license is affected,\" Motor Vehicle Administrator John Kuo said.\n\nThrough the Internet and a toll-free phone line, the agency has been booking 2,000 appointments a week for \ndrivers who provide foreign documents that lack a U.S. visa stamp. The slots are so coveted that the system has a \n60-day backlog. The 8,000 appointments for June filled last week. The MVA will send cancellation letters to those \napplicants, Kuo said.\n\nLearner's permits issued before June 1 will be honored when their term expires, as long as the driver passes the \nwritten and road tests, Kuo said. The driving permit for renewing motorists without lawful status will read \"not for \n\n\nfederal purposes\" on the front or back and might be issued in a different color than the current blue with a touch of \nyellow.\n\nUnder the measure, legal residents will have to show a Social Security card, W-2 form, pay stub or other document \nproving their identity \"or they can't obtain a product,\" Kuo said. He said, however, that the MVA will ask the attorney \ngeneral whether renewing motorists whose Social Security numbers are in the system can be exempted from \nproviding the documentation.\n\nImmigrants flooded radio stations and advocacy groups yesterday with anxious calls about the change. \"It's only \nconfusion,\" said Mario Quiroz-Servell\u00c3\u00b3n, spokesman for CASA of Maryland, the state's largest immigrant \nadvocacy group.\n\nThe phones at Wheaton's Radio Am\u00c3\u00a9rica 1540 AM were clogged all morning, said news director Samuel G. \nG\u00c3\u00a1lvez. Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez (D-Montgomery) and Prince George's County Council member William A. Campos \n(D-Hyattsville) went on the airwaves to explain the change and answer questions. Although many callers were \ndismayed by the measure and saw it as evidence of growing anti-Hispanic sentiment, others recognize that the \nsystem was being abused by out-of-state residents looking to obtain a license fraudulently, G\u00c3\u00a1lvez said.\n\nHis message to those who are undocumented and want licenses was simple: \"Hurry up. I told them to put a rocket \nunder their butts.\"\n\nArmando Rodriguez, a 21-year-old from Honduras who rides the bus from Wheaton to his job as a mechanic at a \ngas station on Piney Branch Road, said he planned to do everything possible to try get a license before the window \nclosed.\n\n\"The MVA requires a lot of paperwork, so I don't know if I'll have enough time,\" he said. \"I need to find someone \nwho can help me.\"\n\nWould he drive without a license if he couldn't get one legally?\n\n\"I don't want to do that,\" he said. \"It's scary driving without a license.\"\n\nBut immigrants trying to get a license fast will probably be out of luck. No further appointment slots will open \nbefore the law takes effect. \"We don't have the resources or overtime to bring extra people in before June,\" Kuo \nsaid.\n\nFor some other immigrant drivers, the 2015 expiration date seemed sufficiently remote, given that advocates are \nhoping that the Obama administration will overhaul immigration policy in a way that creates a path to legal status.\n\n\"We bought some time,\" said Del. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), who worked on the compromise plan but \nwanted a longer grace period for immigrant drivers.\n\nThe bill also includes steep penalties for the fraud that has beset the system as other states have shut their doors to \nundocumented drivers: up to three years in jail and a $2,500 fine. But many lawmakers who opposed allowing those \nwith licenses to keep them are concerned that even the limited license will continue to make Maryland a magnet \nfor fraud.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants predict that undocumented immigrants will continue to drive without insurance or \ntraining, making them a safety risk. In Annapolis, Williams Castillo said he will continue offering classes to the high \nschool students and adults who attend his mostly Latino driving school on Chinquapin Round Road.\n\n\"Everybody's worried. It's very bad news,\" Castillo, an immigrant from Peru, said yesterday. \"But I will still offer \nthem classes, because I want safety for everybody.\"\n\n\n\nOthers worry that the rush to obtain a license before June will lead to an increase in scams as dubious \n\"consultants\" offer to book MVA appointments in exchange for hundreds of dollars in fees, even if they're unable to \nsecure the slots through the MVA's online system.\n\n\"There's a whole business dedicated to that,\" said Clinton resident Antonio Alem\u00c3\u00a1n, who volunteers at his church \nto provide information to other Spanish-speaking immigrants. He spent yesterday watching the local Univsion \nstation on TV, preparing for a barrage of questions after Sunday Mass.\n\nWhat did he plan to say Sunday? \"That there aren't going to be any more driver's licenses for those who don't have \npapers.\"\n\nStaff research director Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.\n"}
