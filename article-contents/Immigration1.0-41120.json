{"title": "LEUKEMIA KILLED IMMIGRANT BOY, NEWSPAPER SAYS", "body": "\nA 12-year-old boy whose death has been cited by immigrant-rights advocates as the first casualty of California's \ncontroversial Proposition 187 was suffering from acute leukemia, a newspaper reported yesterday.\n\nJulio Cano's parents, who are illegal immigrants, said they delayed seeking medical treatment for the boy \nbecause they feared deportation after passage of the \"Save Our State\" ballot measure.\nHe had not been diagnosed with the disease before he died of heart failure Saturday.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said preliminary tests indicated that the boy was weakened because of the leukemia \nand may have been wracked with a bacterial infection, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nWhile it remained unclear whether he could have been saved by earlier medical intervention, Hispanic activists \nhave blamed his death on Proposition 187, which calls for cutting off education, welfare and nonemergency health \ncare to the state's 1.7 million illegal immigrants.\n\nBut proponents of the measure charged that the boy's case was being exploited for political purposes.\n\nCano, whose parents are undocumented immigrants from Mexico living in Orange County, fell ill early last week. \nHis father told the Times that he and his wife were afraid to go to a hospital and postponed seeking help until they \ncould raise money for a private doctor.\n"}
