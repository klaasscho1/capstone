{"title": "Washington: EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued", "body": "\n Washington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following house proceeding:\n\n  \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate moved \nforward with the President's nominee to head up the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Mulvaney. \nCongressman Mulvaney spent years representing the people of South Carolina and has been thoroughly engaged \non budget issues during his time in the House of Representatives. He has highlighted the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is on an unsustainable fiscal path if nothing changes in Washington, DC, and that it is reckless to keep \nrunning up the Nation's credit card with trillions in more debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the immorality \nof passing down to the next generation the obligation of actually paying that money back. So Congressman \nMulvaney is actually, I think, a very good choice for this critical role, and I look forward to voting on his confirmation \nsoon. Trade Mr. President, I want to weigh in briefly on the issue of trade. During the Presidential campaign and \nsince then, there has been a lot of talk about international trade. It has led to a healthy debate about lopsided trade \ndeals--whether bilateral trade deals or multinational trade deals actually are better--and how best to leverage trade \nto help American workers and consumers. In my State of Texas, there is no question trade delivers in two ways. \nOne, it helps Texas families stretch their paychecks by providing greater access to more affordable goods. That is a \ngood thing. And two, it helps our farmers, our ranchers, our small businesses, and other manufacturers access \nmore customers around the world. Texas continues to lead the Nation as the top exporting State, and it has done \nso for about a decade now. It is one reason our economy has done better than the national economy in recent \nyears. And it is estimated that Texas trade supports more than 1 million jobs currently. But it is important to \nunderstand that our economic partnership with Mexico has been a key part of that success, and that is thanks, in \npart, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, the trade deal between the United States, Mexico, \nand Canada. Our southern neighbor is our largest export market, with more than one-third of all Texas goods--\nincluding ag products and manufactured goods, to the tune of close to $92 billion a year--heading south of our \nborder because of NAFTA and trade. Well, this may not be universally true around the country, but suffice it to say \nthat in Texas, NAFTA has been a big success for our economy. And because Texas has been leading the Nation in \nterms of economic growth and job creation, I think it is fair to say that it has helped the Nation as a whole not \nrecede into a recession with the anemic growth rates that we have seen since 2008. It is not just that my State \nbenefits from the deal. The agriculture industry across the country benefits greatly. Mexico is one of the biggest \nbuyers of crops grown in the United States, like corn. In fact, Mexico is the third biggest export market for American \n\n\nagriculture. NAFTA is not just critical to my State, but for those far away from the southern border, as well, like Ohio \nand Michigan, which export a majority of their goods to NAFTA partners. I think it is important to acknowledge the \nfact that roughly 6 million jobs in the United States depend on bilateral trade with Mexico. But here is the truth: The \nworld looks a lot different today than it did 20 years ago when NAFTA was negotiated, and there is ample \nopportunity to work with our partners to craft a better deal for the United States. We can update it to be even more \nconstructive and an even bigger driver of the U.S. economy. Trade is essential to our economy, and I believe the \nadministration agrees with me on that. In my conversations with Mr. Ross, who will head up the Department of \nCommerce, and others--the trade negotiator and the like--they all tell me that this administration is pro-trade, \nalthough they are skeptical of large multinational trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We have also \nrecently heard the President himself talk about the importance of our relationships with countries like Canada and \nJapan. During the visits of the Prime Ministers of [[Page S1176]] each of those countries in the last week, with both \nheads of State, the administration continues to stress the importance of robust trading partnerships. And the \nPresident has made it clear that he supports those. I believe that good trade deals help everyone, so I want to be \nclear that the United States is not retreating from the global economy, as if we even could. With more than 95 \npercent of the world's consumers outside of our borders, our citizens rely too much on free trade and fair trade to \nturn inward and retreat. Texas certainly proves that trade deals can help everyone from manufacturers to farmers, \nto small businesses, all of whom find more markets for the goods they make or grow. That, in turn, creates more \njobs and provides greater access to more goods for consumers. And it is a good example for the broader U.S. \neconomy as well. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call \nthe roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so \nordered. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to \nbe the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Based on his appearance before the Senate Budget and \nHomeland Security Governmental Affairs Committees, he appears to be a smart and articulate individual, but after \nexamining his record and his testimony, I believe he lacks the fundamental judgment to serve in this important role. \nMr. Mulvaney's tenure as a Member of Congress has been marked by symbolic stands and stunts that have been \nmost successful in generating bipartisan opposition rather than support. Until now, it has mattered little whether his \nproposals have been motivated by firmly held principles or other motives. We have just been fortunate that few of \nMr. Mulvaney's ideas have been made into law. However, with an appointment to a position of real authority at \nOMB, Mr. Mulvaney will have great power to put his ideas into practice. For that reason, it is worth reflecting on the \npositions he has taken. At times of national fiscal and economic turmoil, Congressman Mulvaney could consistently \nbe found among those stoking the flames of pandemonium in order to advance a partisan or ideological point. \nIndeed, he was among those Republican Members of Congress who cheered efforts to force the country to default \non our financial obligations in 2011, dismissing the domestic and global alarm over Republican brinkmanship as \n``fear mongering'' and as promoting a ``fabricated crisis.'' In 2013, he voted to support the Republican shutdown of \nthe Federal Government, which ultimately cost American taxpayers $2 billion in back wages for Federal workers \nwho were locked out of their jobs. In addition to this and other fiscal waste, the 16-day shutdown hurt the economy. \nMoody's estimated that it ``cut real GDP by $20 billion, shaving half a percentage point off growth in the fourth \nquarter [of 2013].'' In 2015, Mr. Mulvaney was part of another Republican shutdown effort. This time it was to \nshutter the Department of Homeland Security to protest President Obama's immigration policy. Thankfully, House \nRepublicans relented before the shutdown took effect. Otherwise, the closure would have caused about 30,000 \nfurloughs and about 200,000 other people, including Coast Guard personnel, TSA, ICE, Border Patrol and Customs \nofficers, to report to work, most of them without the promise of a paycheck. When Americans have suffered natural \ndisasters, Mr. Mulvaney has shown himself among those who are the least sympathetic about providing Federal \nassistance, insisting, for example, that emergency aid for the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be offset. He has at \nleast been consistent in this regard, since he voted against similar aid to his home State of South Carolina. Of \ncourse, his opposition in that instance was mainly symbolic because it was a foregone conclusion that the bill would \npass. But this should give every American pause. Mr. Mulvaney's record of supporting brinkmanship and his \nresponses to written questions show that his first instinct will be to use any one- time emergency as an opportunity \nto force lasting budgetary cuts. I am also concerned about Mr. Mulvaney's intentions with regard to the elimination \nof the sequester-level budget caps. In 2013, with sequester cuts on the horizon, Mr. Mulvaney ruled out revenue \nincreases or scaling back the sequester. He said: ``We want to keep the sequester in place and take the cuts we \ncan get.'' As the nominee to OMB director, Mr. Mulvaney now believes, like President Trump, that the sequester \n\n\n\ncaps should be lifted for defense, but he has made no allowance for nondefense discretionary programs and \nagencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Mulvaney has thus far failed to grasp \nthat there is simply no way to secure support for sequester relief without addressing both the defense and \nnondefense sides of the ledger. Moreover, he has not recognized that it is repugnant to many to suggest that one \nside of the budget can be cannibalized to fund the other side. The best way to fund sequester relief is through the \nproven combination of additional revenue and reasonable cuts. It has worked before, and we should look to that \nsolution again. We should also reject efforts to use Overseas Contingency Operations accounts, or OCO funding, to \nfill the gap when it comes to defense spending. It is not a legitimate tool to fix the sequester. Despite my many \ndisagreements with Mr. Mulvaney, this is one point where we do appear to see roughly eye to eye in terms of using \nthe OCO for those overseas contingencies they were designed to fund. Where we disagree most vehemently is on \nthe matter of core programs that help Americans lift themselves up so they can participate fully in our economy and \nsociety. Although he has recently changed his position, Mr. Mulvaney, as a State legislator, voted for legislation that \nquestioned the constitutionality of Medicaid and Social Security, and today he still questions the constitutionality of \nFederal involvement in education. This is more than a philosophical stand. His position will color how the \nadministration invests in schools and students over the next 4 years. I am especially disturbed that Mr. Mulvaney is \nnot even willing to commit to protecting funding for the Pell Grant Program and to reducing college debt, a burden \nfaced by students and their families all across this country. I have also been disturbed by Mr. Mulvaney's cavalier \nposition about benefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare, by such measures as increasing the retirement age. \nLet's be clear. When you force a person to wait 2 or 3 more years to begin collecting the full benefits they have \nearned, it is a cut. If poor health or lack of job prospects forces a person to begin collecting benefits before reaching \nthe normal retirement age, he or she will see a significant reduction in monthly benefits. These cuts fall heaviest on \nthe most vulnerable--low-income workers and workers in the most physically demanding jobs, those who simply \ncannot continue to work for another few years. We can make changes to sustain these programs without the deep \ncuts to benefits that Mr. Mulvaney would promote. In this one area, I would hope the President could prevail over \nhis staff. Many times during the campaign, President Trump promised to protect Social Security and Medicare. In \nfact, last March he said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and \nto leave it as it is.'' It remains to be seen how sincere the President is on this issue. Last month, he was effectively \nrebuffed by 49 Republicans who voted successfully to kill Senator Sanders' amendment to create a point of order \nthat would prevent the Senate from breaking President Trump's promise that ``there will be no cuts to Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid.'' Unfortunately, the President said nothing about this vote, which should lead all \nAmericans to ask how committed he is to his promise. His choice of Mr. Mulvaney also leaves me concerned that \nhe is not sincere about this [[Page S1177]] promise, since Mr. Mulvaney seems clearly intent on making cuts to \nthese vital programs. Mr. Mulvaney has also proven himself unsympathetic to the challenges facing working men \nand women in this country. He has sponsored legislation to bar the Federal Government from requiring project labor \nagreements. He has voted to repeal Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and he has cosponsored \nlegislation to undermine the ability of workers to collectively bargain. Moreover, Mr. Mulvaney failed to pay more \nthan $15,000 in unemployment and FICA taxes for a household employee between 2000 and 2004, only making \ngood on that obligation during his nomination process. Even if this could be characterized as an oversight, it is \nworth noting that Mr. Mulvaney has previously proposed legislation to bar tax delinquents from serving in elected \noffice in South Carolina and to authorize supervisors of Federal employees to take punitive action against workers \nwho have failed to pay taxes. One wonders how Mr. Mulvaney would feel about the fitness of a Democratic \nnominee with a similar challenge. Finally, let me say a few words about Mr. Mulvaney's laissez-faire approach to \nregulation, particular the oversight of Wall Street. I believe strongly that the lack of effective regulation, the lack of \noversight, and the lack of appropriations for the financial regulatory agencies contributed heavily to the great \nrecession, which is why I worked so hard to support the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Mr. \nMulvaney, not surprisingly, takes a different view. As a member of the Financial Services Committee in the House, \nhe said: ``I don't like that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists.'' The CFPB is a consumer-focused \nagency that has brought nearly $12 billion in refunds and restitution to consumers for Wall Street's abuses. This \nincludes more than $120 million that have been returned to our military families through the efforts of the Bureau's \nOffice of Servicemember Affairs, which I worked with Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts to establish. Because \nof the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, working Americans have an advocate in the \nconsumer finance marketplace that is laser-focused on protecting them. Mr. Mulvaney would prefer to transform this \n\n\n\nagency into a paper tiger that is subject to partisan political pressure and influence from the various industries it is \nattempting to police. We should not allow him the chance to do that from a perch at OMB. The country has been \nfortunate that House Republican leadership, with good reason, in my view, did not reward Mr. Mulvaney with a \nposition of authority from which he could exercise real control. Unfortunately, the promotion that President Trump \nhas offered would give him great power-- power that will ultimately, I believe, be destructive in his hands. As a \nresult, I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island who has been such a champion for working people and economic progress in manufacturing and \neconomic fairness so that our country as a whole can advance together. I am proud to be a Senator who fights to \npreserve, protect, and strengthen the safety net for all Americans, as my colleague from Rhode Island does, and \nmany of us here do. So I come to the floor to speak on Congressman Mick Mulvaney, with reluctance and sadness, \nbecause he is out of the mainstream and, really, an adversary of programs that assure that safety net and basic \nfairness that is at the core of our great democracy and our economic system. I oppose his nomination to serve as \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, hardly the best known of agencies and not necessarily the most \nglamorous or glitzy but among the most important. His position is among the most consequential because he \nserves as an economic adviser, as well as an allocator of funding throughout the Federal Government and a leader \non important social programs. He has proved strongly antithetical to those programs that have made America great: \nMedicare, Social Security, and other efforts, including the Affordable Care Act, which are essential to our future. He \nhas broad responsibilities for our Nation's budget. He also has important oversight responsibilities about Federal \nrulemaking--those unglamorous, sometimes invisible regulations and rules that affect real lives and livelihoods \nthroughout this country. They establish rules of the road in industry. They establish access for people to Federal \nprograms. They provide an essential means of achieving fairness in our democracy--that important process that \nagencies use to enact safeguards, for example, that keep our air and water clean and our workplaces safe. \nCongressman Mulvaney's positions on these vital issues are out of step with American values, out of the \nmainstream of American popular opinion, and out of the area of acceptability in terms of basic public interest. Our \neconomic reality is characterized by one simple stark economic fact: Burdens are falling hardest on the people who \ncan least afford them. I am not talking about people at the lowest rungs of income or wealth but middle-class \nAmericans who work hard and who have seen their incomes stagnant over 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. Stagnating \nincomes and stagnating futures destroy the American dream. So the Federal Reserve, for example, has reported in \n2014 that average incomes have remained flat or fallen for all but the most affluent 10 percent of American families. \nThat is a staggering fact about our economic system and its ability to deliver for Americans generally. That is the \ncontext for this nomination. I consistently hear from my constituents in Connecticut that income has failed to keep \npace with overall economic recovery. Even as Wall Street has risen, Americans see nothing but stagnant income, \nsometimes falling economic prospects. Things have gotten better, but good jobs are still out of reach for far too \nmany. Retirement for increasing numbers of baby boomers makes it all the more vital that we protect and \nstrengthen our safety net. The safety net is not the sole answer to larger challenges that must be solved by robust \neconomic growth. That has to be our priority--economic growth in Connecticut and around the country. But \nincreased opportunity depends on growth for ourselves and for our children--my wife and my four children and our \nway of life. In fact, President Trump himself seemed to recognize this economic fact, one of the few areas where we \nagree, because he pledged during the campaign to keep our Nation's safety net firmly, irrevocably intact--not to \nmake any cuts to Social Security or Medicare. He pledged and promised. Now, who is his nominee to be head of \nthe OMB, that crucial agency with responsibility for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid? Mick Mulvaney has \nan affinity for draconian budget cuts and far-right positions that are completely out of step with this promise and \npledge. The President must have reversed himself or revoked his promise, because Congressman Mulvaney has \nspent his entire political career crusading against exactly these programs that keep millions of Americans out of \npoverty. Social Security is one of the great achievements of our American democracy. In fact, it is one of the \ngreatest achievements the world has known because it has allowed this Nation to promise its people that they can \navoid crushing poverty if they simply work hard and if they contribute to this program that is a form of insurance. It is \nnot a gift. It is not really an entitlement. It is an insurance program. It makes us a humane and decent nation. We \ncare for people who have worked hard all of their lives and need to be protected so they need not depend on their \nchildren or their grandchildren. Congressman Mulvaney has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' Tell that to \nthe Social Security recipients [[Page S1178]] in Connecticut. Tell that to the working people of Connecticut. He is \nout of step with working people and middle-class people who know that Social Security does not contribute to the \n\n\n\nFederal budget deficit, and it is not the Ponzi scheme that Congressman Mulvaney mischaracterizes it as being. It \nis fashionable on the far right to use that characterization, suggesting it will run out of money unless severe \nrestrictions are put in place. He has championed those kinds of restrictions--means testing, for example, and raising \nthe retirement age. Those proposals are a disservice to hard-working Americans who reach that retirement age \nhaving been promised that they would receive Social Security when they did or work hard to make Social Security \nwork for them, without a means test, without anybody asking them to fill out forms or disclose their incomes and \nestablish standards or tests that make them ineligible. It is true that there are changes to these programs that may \nbe necessary. In fact, I proposed a plan for enhancing Social Security, making it a stronger insurance program by \nraising the cap on the payment of taxes that are due and other kinds of reforms that will more properly allocate the \nburdens but not means-testing, not raising the retirement age, which are radical and draconian favorites of the far \nright. Lifting the payroll tax cap so the wealthiest Americans contribute their fair share, as I have proposed, will keep \nthis program solvent for decades into the future. The only reason to reject the commonsense changes I have \nproposed is a political aversion to raising taxes on anyone at any time, even the wealthiest individuals or the most \npowerful and profitable companies, which is the mantra of people who have climbed the ladder and want to raise it \nso that no one else has access to those top rungs. It makes no sense to me that we would ask great sacrifices of \nour senior citizens but do nothing about eliminating the loopholes that privilege some of the most affluent people \nand the largest and most profitable companies in the world. We should not and must not use the Social Security \ntrust fund as a means to pay down the debt or reduce the deficit or gamble with the hard-earned benefits 61 million \nAmericans rely on during their retirement. Those 61 million Americans, who come from all of the States and all over \nthe Nation, are represented in this Chamber, and they deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's far-right radical ideas \nthat would restrict their Social Security. He fails to recognize this reality and would prevent Social Security from \ncontinuing to flourish and provide the stability so essential to this great Nation--already the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world because of programs like Social Security and Medicare. Speaking of Medicare, Congressman \nMulvaney's proposal for Medicare also betrays the President's promise to leave Medicare intact. He has been \nvocal, absolutely frank about his support for tearing down Medicare, going as far as to say: ``We have to end \nMedicare as we know it.'' Do we really have to end Medicare as we know it, tear it down, destroy it? That is what \nMick Mulvaney says. That betrays President Trump's promise to keep Medicare intact. Mick Mulvaney has also \nsupported proposals to privatize this lifesaving healthcare program by turning it into a voucher system, which \nwould effectively gut its promise of guaranteed health benefits. A ``voucherized'' Medicare would be devastating for \nour Nation's seniors. Many of them are already on fixed incomes. This plan would allot them a fixed amount of \nfunds--fixed funds to purchase all of their health insurance, which would result in higher premiums and increased \nout-of-pocket costs. Connecticut seniors deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's efforts to restrict Medicare in such a \ndisruptive and destructive way. Congressman Mulvaney's actions and statements on Medicare point to a future \nbudget director who has no intention of keeping the President's promise to protect this crucial health program. This \ncountry counts on its next budget director to prioritize facts and responsibilities and the public interest above \npolitical games; to rely on real facts, not alternate facts. Our budget, our deficit, our national debt are, in fact, fact-\nbound and fact-based. The world relies on real facts when it looks at the American economy, and the people who \nwork in that economy, whether they are young or old, veterans or civilians, depend on real economic growth. Yet \nCongressman Mulvaney's reckless approach to fiscal issues has jeopardized this country's stability, causing real \ndanger for the sake of ideology. That approach in the Congress has led to uncertainty and unpredictability, which \nare the bane of small- and medium-size businesses, which are, in turn, the major job creators in our society and \neconomy. Congressman Mulvaney's extreme views already have negatively impacted the American economy. \nWhile in the House of Representatives, he led efforts to leverage the threat of a government shutdown as a tactic to \npush for specific demands, which included radical anti-choice policies, measures antithetical to women's healthcare \nand the right of privacy, including defunding Planned Parenthood. As one of the most senior economic advisers to \nthe President and the head of OMB, he would have immense responsibility to influence this administration and the \nPresident. His outright disregard for the harm caused by a government shutdown--a tactic that jolts and jeopardizes \nour economy and disrupts the lives of millions of Americans--should itself alone disqualify him from this critical role \nwithin the Federal Government. He also sought government shutdowns as well to block the implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act, which has helped so many people in Connecticut receive the coverage and care they need. I \ncould spend a lot of time talking about the benefits people in Connecticut have received from the Affordable Care \nAct. Its future is key to the financial future of this country, but Mick Mulvaney has consistently advanced \nmisconceptions and mistruths about the nature and functioning of this law. Again, we can agree to disagree on \n\n\n\npolicy, but misrepresenting the truth and relying on alternate facts is exactly what the budget director should not be \ndoing. He is the one whom we rely on for real facts about our economy and our budget. Even more worrying was \nCongressman Mulvaney's archaic approach to addressing the debt ceiling. In the face of all evidence, he flatly \nstated that he did not believe this country would default on its debt as a result of the failure to raise the debt ceiling. \nEconomics 101: The debt ceiling, if it is not extended--that means a default. Experts across the political spectrum \nagree that a breach of the debt ceiling, and consequently our Nation's full faith and credit, would be catastrophic. I \nam absolutely unable to vote for someone who fails to recognize that basic economic truth and takes this threat so \nlightly. Finally, Congressman Mulvaney has demonstrated a near reflexive hostility to Federal agencies and the \nimportant work they do. As with so many of the President's nominees, unfortunately, he seems to be hostile to the \nvery mission and purpose of the agency he is going to lead--whether it is the EPA or the Department of Labor or \nother agencies where nominees have taken stands that, in effect, say: Let's dismantle and destroy this agency. Yet \nthey are the ones who are supposed to be leading and inspiring its efforts. I believe that government could be more \nefficient and responsive. Waste ought to be eliminated. Fraud ought to be prosecuted. I am eager to work with my \ncolleagues on good-faith proposals to achieve these goals. Federal agencies remain vital to important public \npurposes that people cannot achieve on their own. They cannot clean our air and water on their own. They cannot \nensure public safety through policing on their own. They cannot make sure our national defense is strong on their \nown. A whole myriad of functions depend on a functional Federal Government. Commonsense rules that prohibit \nexcessive pollution or unsafe working conditions protect all of us. As the head of OMB, which includes offices that \noversee Federal funding, he has a responsibility to make sure that rules are enforced and that people are protected. \nYet he has opposed the existence of the Export-Import Bank, an [[Page S1179]] institution that is critically important \nto so many of our job creators, big and small businesses in Connecticut and around the country. He opposed \nemergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, despite the devastation caused by this terrible storm, which \nwas unleashed in Connecticut and nearby States. He has questioned the need for government-funded research, \ndespite the myriad advances in science and medicine that have come from government laboratories and research \ninstitutions. His record shows that he would be the wrong person for this job, harming our safety net and our fiscal \nstability. I oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the remainder of my postcloture \ndebate time to Senator Schumer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I \nyield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I yield my \npostcloture debate time to Senator Schumer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Mr. COONS. \nWith that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Nomination of Neil Gorsuch Mr. \nFLAKE. Mr. President, as I did last week and as I will continue to do until he is confirmed, I rise to support the \nnomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream \njurist. I look forward to helping make sure he receives an up-or-down vote here on the Senate floor. After meeting \nwith Judge Gorsuch and learning more about his judicial philosophy, I continue to be impressed by his humble \nrespect for the law and by his commitment to service. Before the Judiciary Committee begins our hearings, I want to \nhighlight aspects of his jurisprudence that qualify him to serve on our Nation's highest Court and make him an ideal \ncandidate to fill such a consequential position. Earlier this month I spoke about his fitness to fill Justice Scalia's \nseat, as well as his respect for the separation of powers. Today I would like to focus on his approach to religious \nfreedom. I have always supported religious freedom as a universal principle. It doesn't matter if we are defending \nour own First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion here at home or standing up for the religious \nfreedoms of people under repressive regimes abroad, our country has always valued the right of individuals to \npractice their faith as they please. Just as religious freedom is part of our national character, it also provides insight \ninto the character and judicial philosophy of a prospective justice. When I had the privilege of meeting with Judge \nGorsuch last week, I asked him about his thoughts on religious freedom. I was struck by his ability to plainly \narticulate his understanding of the law and the Constitution. He explained his religious liberty opinions by telling me \nthat he simply went ``where the law led him.'' His explanation was indicative of his fundamental approach to \ninterpreting the law. Judge Gorsuch doesn't make the law; he follows the law. He reads the Constitution as the \nFramers understood it. He interprets laws the way they were written. Lately, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have been vocal about the importance of respecting our independent judiciary. I couldn't agree more. They \nhave decried the perils of discriminating on the basis of religious belief. Well, they are in luck. The Supreme Court \nnominee before us would be a staunch defender of independent courts and religious freedom. All they have to do is \nhelp us confirm him. I don't blame them for wanting to do their homework on a Supreme Court nominee. They \nshould, as should we all. They will find that studying Judge Gorsuch's record will make for enjoyable reading. On \n\n\n\nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch has authored a number of judicial opinions respecting the \nfundamental principles of religious liberty. His most notable was a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case. In \nthis landmark legal case interpreting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Judge Gorsuch ruled that the Federal \nGovernment cannot force individuals to assist in conduct that violates their deeply held religious convictions. I note \nthat this law used to be noncontroversial. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was introduced by Senators Ted \nKennedy and then Congressman Chuck Schumer. It was passed almost unanimously in 1993 and signed into law \nby President Bill Clinton. In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``The [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] \ndoesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting \nunpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.'' \nReligious tolerance--that is what our country stands for, and that is what Judge Gorsuch stands for. Judge \nGorsuch's position was later vindicated by the Supreme Court. The Court agreed that it is the government's job to \nprotect an individual's ability to practice their religion, not to instruct them on how to practice their religion. In \nclosing, let me reiterate that I believe Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream jurist who will uphold the Constitution to \nensure justice for all, regardless of an individual's religious beliefs or which administration is in power. As someone \nwho embraces religious freedom, it is a privilege to support and confirm a judge like Neil Gorsuch, who respects \nthis central constitutional principle. As I have said before, and I will say again, Judge Gorsuch deserves fair \nconsideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. He should \nbe confirmed overwhelmingly, and I am confident he will be. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the \nroll. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of Andrew Puzder Ms. WARREN. Mr. \nPresident, on December 8, Donald Trump nominated Andrew Puzder to serve as Secretary of Labor. He was \nscheduled to come before the HELP Committee tomorrow for his confirmation hearing. There is some reporting \nsuggesting that he is having some second thoughts, and I sincerely hope that is true. The reasons Mr. Puzder is a \nterrible choice for this job are literally too numerous to cover fully, but I will at least give it a start. If you work for a \nliving, the Labor Secretary is very important to you. This person is responsible for protecting the interests of 150 \nmillion American workers. He will be the person responsible for enforcing the law that ensures that employers \nactually pay workers for every hour they work and setting the standards to prevent workplace injuries and even \ndeaths. Unfortunately, Mr. Puzder is not the kind of person the American people can trust to stand up for workers. \nSince 2000, Mr. Puzder has served as the CEO of the billion-dollar company CKE Restaurant Holdings. You may \nknow it better as the parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. These two fast-food chains are known for paying \nvery low wages to workers. Mr. Puzder has a long record of cheating workers out of overtime. He has paid out \nmillions of dollars to settle claims when he was caught cheating. We are not talking about isolated incidents. They \nreflect the kind of business Mr. Puzder built. Mr. Puzder is a frequent political pundit and commentator who has \nvocally opposed higher minimum wages. He has also strongly opposed new overtime protections that would give 4 \nmillion workers an estimated $1.5 billion raise in a single year. Mr. Puzder also delights in expressing personal \ndisdain for his workers. He bragged in his very first memo as CEO. He wrote that he wanted ``no more people \nbehind the counter unless they have their teeth.'' Ha, ha. He said he would like to replace his workers with robots \nbecause ``they are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an \nage, sex or discrimination case.'' The Senate has an obligation to hear from those who are best qualified to [[Page \nS1180]] tell America about Mr. Puzder's suitability to be Labor Secretary and to stand up for American workers--his \nown workers. That is why many of us asked the chairman of the HELP Committee to include Mr. Puzder's workers \nin his confirmation hearing. When the chairman refused to do so, we just went ahead and convened our own forum \nto allow those workers a chance to speak. Seventeen Senators attended. Those 17 Senators heard from Laura \nMcDonald, who worked as a general manager at Carl's Jr. in Tucson, AZ, for 20 years. For years, she was forced to \nwork extra hours without pay. Employees like Laura are the subject of a major lawsuit against Mr. Puzder's \ncompany, CKE, regarding unpaid overtime. Those 17 Senators heard from Lupe Guzman, who is a single mother \nwho has devoted the last 7 years of her life to Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas, NV. She has worked the graveyard shift for \nrock bottom wages. Seven years of loyalty, and Lupe is still paid so little that she is on food stamps to feed her kids. \nLupe sat in front of the U.S. Senate and wept openly about her terrible treatment at the hands of Mr. Puzder's \ncompany. The Senators also heard from Roberto Ramirez, who has worked in the fast food industry for over 20 \nyears, mostly at Carl's Jr. in Los Angeles, CA. He worked regularly off the clock at Carl's Jr., meaning they didn't \npay him. Roberto even had a full paycheck stolen by his manager. For every Laura, Lupe, and Roberto, we found \n\n\n\ndozens of workers who were afraid to speak out about the terrible conditions at CKE. We compiled some stories \nfrom folks brave enough to speak up into a 20- page report detailing firsthand accounts of the men and women who \nwork for Mr. Puzder. Those stories are horrifying, and I will read some of them later today. Mr. Puzder's company \nhas a truly atrocious record of treating his own workers terribly. Indeed, he has dripping disdain for people who work \nfor a living. This alone disqualifies him to be Secretary of Labor. But there is more. In recent weeks, it has come out \nthat Mr. Puzder employed an undocumented immigrant in his household for years, and he didn't pay taxes on that \nemployee. Yep, you heard that correctly. The Trump administration, which bellows about building a wall and pounds \nits chest about ripping millions of families apart with a deportation force, threatens millions of DREAM Act kids with \ndeportation, has no problem putting a guy in charge of the Labor Department who cheats on his taxes and employs \nundocumented workers. The hypocrisy of that is pretty stunning, even for the Trump administration. And then there \nis the controversy over alleged spousal abuse. Over 25 years ago, Mr. Puzder's first wife appeared on an episode \nof Oprah Winfrey in a show about spousal abuse. I have watched the episode in which she appeared, as I believe \nevery Senator should. I found it extraordinarily troubling. Alongside his company's poor record of treatment of \nfemale employees, his highly explicit and sexualized ads, and his snide comments about sex discrimination, there is \nample evidence that Mr. Puzder is a terrible choice to head the agency charged with ensuring that women and men \nare treated fairly in the workplace. I understand that no matter who President Trump picks to run the Labor \nDepartment, I am probably going to have a lot of issues with that person, but this is different. Andrew Puzder should \nnot be the Labor Secretary. And if you ask the Senators in this body--Republicans and Democrats--if you ask them \nbehind closed doors with the cameras turned off, you will have a hard time finding people who think this divisive \nnomination is good for the country. It has been suggested that Mr. Puzder is ``tired of the abuse'' that he has \nreceived during this confirmation process. Well, I think the workers at his companies are pretty tired of the abuse \nthey have received while being at the mercy of an employer who doesn't care about them at all and who goes out \nof his way to squeeze them out of every last dime. That is literally the opposite of what we need in a Labor \nSecretary. I was prepared to question him on these issues tomorrow, but I hope it is true that he will withdraw his \nnomination before then. Mr. President, I also rise today to express many concerns over the appointment of \nCongressman Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to urge my colleagues to \nseriously consider these issues before voting to confirm him. One of the best ways to understand what a nation \nstands for is to look at its budget. It is all right there. The budget tells who counts, it tells who gets a chance, and it \ntells who gets cast aside. The OMB Director prepares the President's budget. He safeguards the President's \npromises by turning them into real commitments backed by your tax dollars. During the campaign, President Trump \npromised over and over again that he would protect Medicare and Medicaid. He didn't imply it; he didn't drop hints \nabout it. No, he made the clearest, plainest possible promise. He said: ``I am not going to cut Medicare or \nMedicaid.'' But since the election, he has done a complete 180. He put up a transition team website that just \ndripped with code words for cuts, saying that he would modernize and maximize flexibility for these programs. \nGone were the unambiguous promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid. Then he started nominating people who \nhave made it their life's work to gut Medicare and Medicaid. His Secretary of Health and Human Services has \nproposed cutting more than $1 trillion from these programs, and now his nominee for OMB Director is someone \nwho wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid to the bone. Congressman Mulvaney has voted to increase the \nretirement age for Medicare. Hey, you have paid into that program with decades of hard work? Too bad, just keep \nwaiting. He also wants to privatize Medicare, and he wants to slash and burn his way through Medicaid--a program \nthat is a lifeline for millions of people--for parents of people in nursing homes, for people with disabilities, for \npremature babies. In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney was asked whether he would set aside his \nrightwing ideology to fulfill the President's campaign promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid. The \nCongressman could not have been clearer in his response: Forget all of that. Nope, not interested. Mulvaney is still \na true believer in Medicare and Medicaid cuts, and whenever he has the President's ear, he will continue to \nadvance his own radical ideas for burning down these indispensable programs. President Trump also promised that \nhe would not cut Social Security. He guaranteed it. Here is his quote--many times: ``We're going to save your \nSocial Security without making any cuts,'' he said. Here was his closer on that: ``Mark my words.'' OK. Nice words. \nBut he could have picked someone--anyone--to run his budget, and instead he picked Congressman Mulvaney--\none of Congress's most partisan crusaders against the Social Security program. He wants to raise the retirement \nage to 70. Heck, this is a person who calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and, boy, he is not messing around, \neither. During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Mulvaney doubled down on his promise to rob American \nworkers and retirees by gutting Social Security. When pressed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about \n\n\n\nwhether he would urge President Trump to reconsider his promise not to cut Social Security, hey, Mulvaney said \nthat he absolutely would. Is this just a mistake? Did President Trump just pick Congressman Mulvaney by accident? \nThe Congressman certainly doesn't seem to think so. At his hearing he said: ``I have to imagine that the President \nknew what he was getting when he asked me to fill that role.'' Yes, Mulvaney himself believes he is being brought in \nto push for cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Trump reverses his promise, a second person determined to cut \nMedicare and Medicaid makes it into a key government role, and who will pay the price? America's seniors, that is \nwho. Apparently, Congressman Mulvaney isn't satisfied with cutting benefits for [[Page S1181]] Americans who \nhave worked and paid into the program for their entire lives. When it comes to abandoning American workers and \nfamilies, for him, that is just the beginning. He has also called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ``a sick, \nsad joke.'' Maybe he should spend a little more time talking to his constituents and a little less time talking to bank \nlobbyists. The CFPB has helped thousands of people in every State--including dozens of people in Congressman \nMulvaney's own district--recover unauthorized fees on their credit cards and checking accounts. It has helped them \nto correct errors on their credit reports. These are students, seniors, servicemembers, and veterans, who may have \nspent months haggling with their bank or student loan servicer over a wrong charge, only to get quick and complete \nrelief after they went to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In total--the agency has only been up for about \n5\\1/2\\ years now--it has forced the largest banks across this country, many of those who have been out there \ncheating consumers, to return nearly $12 billion directly to the people they cheated. That is $12 billion that was \nstolen by big banks, by payday lenders, by debt collectors, and is now back in the pockets of the people who \nrightfully earned it. The only sick, sad joke is that Congressman Mulvaney thinks we should turn the big banks loose \nto prey on American families once again. Under Congressman Mulvaney's budget, Americans who have been \ncheated and scammed by huge financial institutions will just be cast aside. Families who work hard for every dollar, \nonly to have some ruthless corporation steal their savings right out from underneath them, will be cast aside. And \nthe millions of Americans who have worked for decades planning to collect Social Security or Medicare when they \nretire will be told to just wait four more years. They will be thrown straight to the curb. None of that--none of that--is \nwhat America stands for. That is just the stuff that directly contradicts the President's campaign promises. The stuff \nthat is totally in line with the President's campaign promises is genuinely scary too. On the campaign trail, Donald \nTrump stated that he ``may cut the Department of Education.'' Will Congressman Mulvaney stand up for students? \nUnlikely. Congressman Mulvaney's record shows that he is fine building a Federal budget that crushes students \nwho are trying to get a college education. Students already pay too much for student loans, and Congressman \nMulvaney's solution is to force students to pay more. He supports forcing more college students to borrow more \nmoney from private banks that charge sky-high interest rates without any of the basic protections Federal student \nloans have. He clearly wants to let private banks and Wall Street squeeze as much cash out of hard-working \nstudents as humanly possible to build their profits. In fact, Congressman Mulvaney wants to help these giant banks \nout even more by taking a sledgehammer to the Federal student loan program and making Federal loan terms \nlousy for students. That is why he repeatedly voted to eliminate subsidized student loans for low-income students \nand why he helped block legislation to allow borrowers to lower their monthly payments by refinancing their student \nloans to lower interest rates. Not only has he voted to increase the interest rates the government charges students, \nhe has also voted to cut Pell grants to poor college students. If Congressman Mulvaney had his way, millions more \nhard- working students would be shoved even deeper into debt at the start of their working lives just because they \ncouldn't afford the high cost of college. Under his budget, students will just be cast aside. In his confirmation \nhearing, Congressman Mulvaney also said he is ``in lockstep'' with Donald Trump's plans to grow military spending, \nbut he said he would pay for that increase in funding with deep cuts to domestic programs that working men and \nwomen around the country depend on--programs that could easily include Head Start, which provides opportunities \nfor low-income children; the disaster aid, which supports families in crisis after a hurricane or tornado; or resiliency \nprograms to protect America as worldwide climate changes. Listen to that again. The children who attend Head \nStart can stay home so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who get buried in a \n100-year snowstorm can stay buried so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who \nlive near coasts and rivers and streams can be washed away by rising oceans and other waterways so Donald \nTrump can divert money to military spending--and this nominee, Congressman Mulvaney, is in lockstep to make it \nhappen. Under President Trump's new one-in, two-out Executive order, it is Mr. Mulvaney who would have \ndiscretion to give each agency a regulatory budget and to approve any proposed regulations that increase that \nbudget. The order is supposedly designed to make life easier and to make government work better, but \nCongressman Mulvaney isn't interested in making government work better, and he is certainly not interested in \n\n\n\nmaking life easier. In fact, he has spent his entire political career working to cripple the agencies that protect \nAmerican families-- American workers, American consumers, and American small businesses. Nowhere is this \nclearer than in his attacks on the Federal agencies that protect consumers, that preserve our environment, and that \nhelp keep our country safe. He has worked to starve agencies of the resources they need to do their jobs, voting to \ncut funding to law enforcement, voting to gut the Social Security Program, and voting to completely defund the \norganization that provides critical legal services to low-income American children, families, seniors, and veterans. \nBut it is not enough for him to starve agencies to the breaking point. He has also supported radical bills to stop \nagencies from issuing regulations that keep our air clean, our food safe, and our economy from suffering another \ndevastating financial crisis. Congressman Mulvaney wants to require agencies to adopt a bill that imposes the least \ncosts on big businesses, even when those costs are about making sure companies don't cut corners by cheating, \npoisoning, and killing people. Look, if it is cheaper for a corporation to kill you than it is for the corporation to \nredesign the product or clean up their mess, Congressman Mulvaney stands with the corporation. I am sure he \nwould be willing to say something nice at your funeral about how your contribution helped give the corporation \nrecord profits. If all that wasn't bad enough, Congressman Mulvaney is ready to rock and roll on secret money in \npolitics. Washington is already awash in dark money, but that is not enough for Congressman Mulvaney. He has \nworked to open the doors even wider to secret spending in politics. Over and over, he has voted to shield the \nidentity of political donors, keep them secret. For example, he opposed a rule that required corporations applying \nfor government contracts to disclose their political contributions. Again, just think about that one for a minute. He \ndoesn't want corporations that bid for government contracts to be forced to tell when they give money to help \ntargeted government officials. We already have a problem with money in politics. Mulvaney just wants to make it \nworse. Congressman Mulvaney's record shows one thing. He will make sure our Federal Government works well \nfor giant corporations and billionaires who don't like to play by the rules, and he will cast aside the rest of the public \nto do that. That is definitely not what our Nation stands for. I understand Democrats and Republicans have different \npriorities when it comes to the Federal budget. I get that, but when one person wants to slash Social Security for \nAmerican retirees, to cut Medicare for senior citizens, to gut health benefits for low-income families, to drive up the \ncost of paying for college, and to gut programs that help families in crisis and low-income children, all in the name of \nmaking life even easier for giant corporations and billionaires--well, I think it is clear that his priorities do not include \nthe safety and security of millions of Americans. That is a priority that should be at the top of all of our [[Page \nS1182]] lists in the Senate, Republican and Democratic. I will stand with the Americans whom Congressman \nMulvaney will cast aside as Budget Director, and I will vote no on his nomination. Mick Mulvaney wants to slash \nbenefits under Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and countless other programs. These are just numbers to him, \nbut behind those numbers are real people. Real lives are at risk with every decision he will make as the Budget \nDirector. So what I want to do is take the time I have remaining and share the stories of just a few of the people who \nwould be affected. Lea from Plymouth wrote to me, worried that Congressman Mulvaney would cut Social Security \nfor her and for others in Massachusetts. Lea had an interesting suggestion. Here is what she wrote: I have just sent \noff an email message to Representative Mulvaney regarding his spearheading of the cutting of Social Security \nbenefits. I challenged him and many of his colleagues to do this: Live on an income like mine--of $1,219.80--for one \nmonth. Having received my first increase of $2.50 in several years, it was offset by a Medicare cost increase of \n$11.50. Do the math. I hope you and the other Democratic members of both houses fight like hell to raise our \nbenefits. We are definitely in for a bumpy ride for the next 4 years. As the saying goes . . . ``it ain't going to be \npretty!'' Thank you for listening. Thank you, Lea. Thank you for writing. I also heard from Janneke from \nWilliamstown, who is worried about several nominees working to cut Social Security. Here is what Janneke had to \nsay: It is terrifying to consider either of these nominees, Price or Mulvaney, being confirmed for the position to which \nthey have been nominated. They will work to undo, not to strengthen, social security. This is a profoundly disturbing \npossibility. I urge you to do everything you can to oppose their confirmation! Thank you, Janneke. I will. I will keep \nfighting for your hard-earned benefits. Janet from Florence also reached out to me. She shared the inspiring stories \nof her and her husband, and then she told me how worried she is that cuts to Social Security and Medicare could \nbe coming under Congressman Mulvaney's watch. Here is what she wrote: I am 60 years old and have always \nbeen employed--in higher education jobs where I worked hard and long for modest wages, frequently the case in \nwomen-dominated professions. My husband is a childcare worker who works with infants and toddlers. The work \nwe do is meaningful and makes a societal contribution. At 60 and 64, we have always lived like graduate students. \nWe shop at the Goodwill, cook from scratch, bring our lunch, and drive old cars--and bike and walk. We will each be \nworking until age 70, or longer, if our health permits. This is fine. We are fortunate to live as we do. But with market- \n\n\n\nbased retirement funds and with family members needing our support, we need Social Security, which is NOT \nBROKEN, to remain, and be strengthened. And we need access to health care, for ourselves, children, and \ngrandchildren. This is a plea from the fading middle class to oppose the Price and Mulvaney nominations. We--and \npeople far less fortunate than we are--need your stout support. Thank you, Janet. Thank you and your husband for \nall you do for your community. I promise I will do my best to protect your benefits. I have received hundreds of these \ntypes of letters--letters from constituents who are scared that cuts to Medicaid and Medicare could endanger their \nbasic ability to survive, letters from constituents who have seen how important these services are to thousands \nacross the State and millions across the country, constituents who aren't sure where to turn and whom to blame. \nThey just know they cannot afford to lose these benefits, like a woman from Somerville, who wrote to me about the \nwork she does as an intensive care coordinator. Here is what she had to say: I am an Intensive Care Coordinator \nthrough Riverside Community Care, a statewide human service agency that delivers crucial mental health services \nto at-risk youth. In my program, the Guidance Center Community Service Agency, we specifically provide Child \nBehavioral Health Initiatives (CBHI) services to youth in Cambridge, Somerville, Medford, Malden, Waltham, \nWoburn, Wilmington, and other northern towns. I am extremely nervous that the new presidential administration will \nattack Medicaid and put our programs in jeopardy. If you're not familiar with the CBHI wraparound model, I can \nbriefly explain why these services are so important. One: we serve youth in poverty. Two: our services are \ncommunity based, so we go to the homes of the families we're serving, so they don't need to rely on transportation. \nThree: we are a form of outpatient care that prevents youth who are suicidal/ homicidal from needing \nhospitalization. Or, if they are hospitalized, helping the family develop a plan for when they're discharged. Four: \nAlthough the child with mental health diagnosis is our identified client, the services benefit the whole family. We \nunderstand that taking care of children with special needs is taxing, so we identify resources and services for \nparents as well. Five: we work with state departments like Department of Children and Families, Department of \nHealth, and Department of Developmental Disabilities. Six: our model works. I myself rarely close a case without \nhaving had at least one goal (identified by the family) met and there are growing statistics about the benefit of \nhaving us in place. I hope you can bring this argument where it needs to go to ensure that we have a future here in \nMassachusetts. I want to say on this one: Thank you. Thank you for writing, and thank you for the work you do. I am \ndoing my best to bring this story. This is a story everybody in the Senate should listen to. It is a story about how we \nreach out to those who most need us and provide the kind of care they need. Thank you. Thank you for your work, \nand thank you for writing. I also received a letter from an occupational therapist from Massachusetts. She told me \nall about the important work she has been doing and how Medicaid has been crucial to that work. Here is what she \nhad to say: As a constituent and occupational therapy practitioner, I am writing to you to express my concerns \nabout a major restructuring of the Medicaid program. Medicaid is an essential safety net program for the most \nvulnerable in our society. In 2015, 39% of children received health insurance either through the Childrens Health \nInsurance Program or through Medicaid. More than 60 percent of nursing home residents are supported primarily \nthrough Medicaid. Additionally, Medicaid provides health care services and long-term services and supports to \nmore than 10 million people living with disabilities, and 1 in 5 Medicaid recipients receive behavioral health \nservices. Restructuring of the Medicaid program through per capita caps or block granting and significant cuts to \nthe Medicaid program would jeopardize the long-term health and independence of current Medicaid beneficiaries. \nThus I urge extreme care and caution when considering a major restructuring of the program or other significant \nchanges, waiver of mandatory services, or dramatic cuts. Thank you for all the work you do, and thank you for \nwriting and making this important point about who uses Medicaid and how critical it is to the basic support services \nthat we provide. Another constituent wrote to me about the amazing work that she does in the Boston area for those \nwith severe mental illness and how Medicaid and Medicare help these people. Here is what she had to say: I work \nwith people with severe Mental Illness in the greater Boston area. A majority of my patients receive their therapy \nand medication through Medicaid and Medicare. Even the thought of losing coverage heightens their anxiety. If \ncoverage is reduced or co-pays raised, they stand to lose not only therapy and group interventions but also the \nmedication which is essential to avoiding higher levels of care. Given the high rate of co-occurring physical and \nmental health issues, the general health of my patients will be severely compromised with any reduction in access \nto care. Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion live with a mental health or substance use \ncondition and people with marketplace insurance plans have fair and equal mental health coverage. With this \ncoverage, people have access to mental health services that support recovery. As a constituent, I would like you to \nkeep in mind that Medicaid or insurance marketplace plans are helping all of those who struggle with mental illness \nwho, with accessible supports, can lead healthier lives. Again, thank you for the work you do, and thank you for \n\n\n\nwriting. It is a powerfully important point. Congressman Mulvaney wants to slash these programs. That is why I will \nbe voting against his nomination. I also received more personal stories from people like Michael from Acton, who \ntold me about his son. Here is what he wrote: My particular concern is the attack on the ACA and Medicaid and \nMedicare. My biggest worry is my 27 year old son, Adam, who was born with microcephaly. He [[Page S1183]] is a \nvery loving person with a great smile, but functions roughly at the level of a 12 month old. He currently lives in a \ngroup residence and goes to a day habilitation program during the week. Both of these programs are funded in part \nby Medicaid. If Medicaid funds are cut, I worry that the day-hab program will not be able to continue or, at the \nleast, will operate at a much reduced level. This would seriously degrade the quality of Adam's life. I worry what will \nhappen at his already understaffed residence. As it is, the staff at Adam's residence and day- habilitation programs \nare paid very little wages to do very tough jobs. Because of this, there is already a constant problem of finding \nenough people to staff these. . . . jobs if they are paid less or have to do even more work because of lower staffing \nlevels[.] The prospect of what is coming scares me. What will my son's life be like? Thank you for writing, Michael. I \nappreciate it. I will be out there fighting for Adam. I hope we can get a lot of people in the Senate to do that as well. \nThank you. We also heard from Daniel Mumbauer, who is president of the High Point Treatment Center in \nMassachusetts. Daniel has experienced firsthand how Medicaid funds can change the lives of thousands of people \nin Massachusetts alone. This is what Daniel wrote: On behalf of High Point Treatment Center, I am writing to urge \nand request your support in protecting the Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion in the 115th \nCongress. High Point served over 30,000 individuals last year. We provide substance use disorder and mental \nhealth services to adolescents and adults. Recent health insurance data show that Americans with mental health \nand substance use disorders are the single largest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. \nNearly one in three who receives health insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion either has a mental \nillness, a substance abuse disorder, or both. By repealing the Medicaid expansion, this population of vulnerable \nAmericans would be left without access to lifesaving treatment, driving up costs in emergency department visits and \nhospital stays. I am also writing to urge your support for the protection of the Medicaid program from proposals to \nrestructure Medicaid as a block grant or capped program. These proposals would reduce federal investment in \nMedicaid and leave millions of Americans without access to needed mental health and addictions treatment in our \ncommunities. Please work with your colleagues to protect our nation's most vulnerable patient population and \npreserve their access to treatment. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you very much for writing, and thank you for the work \nyou do. Congressman Mulvaney wants to eviscerate health programs that would help Michael's son and the \nthousands who are treated at the High Point Treatment Center. That is exactly the opposite of what we should be \ndoing. I have also heard from many constituents worried about losing their Social Security benefits under the new \nadministration, like Kensington from Hatfield, who is terrified that his mother, who depends on Social Security, will \nlose her benefits. Here is what he wrote: Last night scared me for the first time. My mother is 69 and depends on \nSocial Security for her income and has severe COPD and relies on medicare and medicaid for prescriptions and \nmedical supplies to help her breath[e]. She was crying and is afraid of losing everything and that she will die. I know \nit's extreme thinking, but without her medicine and income it is unfortunately the truth. I didn't know what to say to \ncomfort her and that scared me! What can I say to ease her mind and let her know that she will be OK. Will she be \nOK? Thank you, Kensington, for your note. Your mother is right to be worried, and that is why I am fighting this \nnomination. I have so many more stories--many, many stories--that I could read, but I am running out of time here. I \nwant to say that Mick Mulvaney is dangerous to the American people, and he is dangerous to the Federal \nGovernment. He will slash programs right and left without worrying about the living, breathing people whom he is \nhurting in the process. That is why I will be voting against his nomination as Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget and why I urge my colleagues to do the same. Let's make sure that Mick Mulvaney never ends up as \nthe head of the Office of Management and Budget, never is in a position to put together a budget to cut Medicare \nand cut Medicaid. Let's make sure that we keep our government, our Medicare, our Medicaid, and our Affordable \nCare Act working for the American people. That is what I will keep fighting for. Mr. President, I yield. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, every day we \ncontinue to set new records for how long it takes for the new President to get his Cabinet in power--in office--and \nthe responsibility to carry out the things that the President said that he wanted to do when he was elected. In the \ngreat history of confirming people, from the Garfield administration in the 1880s until Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, the \nentire Cabinet in that whole period of time was confirmed on the first day. Now we are in the longest period in the \nhistory of the country since George Washington was President to try to get a Cabinet in place, not to mention all of \nthe other jobs that go along with confirming the Cabinet. It is a good thing and no wonder that a few years ago the \n\n\n\nSenate looked at the numbers of people we had taken responsibility to confirm and said: Now, which of those do we \nreally have to confirm and which of those would we only confirm if someone in the Senate believes we have to have \na hearing on that level of person and that agency at that time? We tried to streamline a process that we all know \nneeds to be streamlined, but with only a couple of exceptions, every nominee so far has been the most dangerous \nnominee of all time for whatever job it is. There must be fill-in-the-blank speeches back there somewhere that go \nfrom one to the next: This would be the worst person who could ever possibly hold this job. In the case of \nCongressman Mulvaney, it appears to be because he wants to try to do things that allow our entitlement programs \nto survive; he wants to do things that allow the deficit at some point to be eliminated. And no matter what point that \nis, that point would be too early for some of our friends on the other side. Interestingly, as we talk about the \nAffordable Care Act, which has turned out to be very unaffordable for almost any family on the individual market \nand many families who had insurance that worked for them before--the Affordable Care Act cut Medicare in the \nplan by $500 billion over 10 years. We hear speaker after speaker on the other side say: We would never do \nanything to cut Medicare. I argued vigorously against those cuts when they occurred. As we move forward, I think \nwe ought to be very thoughtful that we restore the cuts in areas where clearly it is not working the way people \nthought the Affordable Care Act would work. The person in charge of the numbers, the person in charge of the \nbalance sheet, the person who calculates the costs should be someone with the capacity to do that. The President \nhas decided, and the Senate, when finally allowed to vote, will determine that person is Mr. Mulvaney. Nomination \nof Scott Pruitt Mr. President, the other thing we hope to do this week is to get to the EPA Administrator. I have a \nhard time imagining that anybody had more future damage lined up for the economy than the past Administrator of \nthe EPA. Rules like the clean power rule--all these rules almost always have a good name. Clean power, who \nwouldn't be for that? I am certainly for clean power, but the clean power rule, in virtually every State in the country, \nwould have increased utility rates from the middle of the State of Pennsylvania to the western edge of at least \nWyoming, if not beyond that. Fifty percent of the power produced by coal-powered utility plants, most of which are \ncleaner than any utility plants that use coal have ever been or are anywhere in the world today, many of which are \nalmost new, many of which aren't paid for--and, of course, who pays for that utility plant, whether you use it or not? \nIt is the family who pays the utility bill. There is no mythical somebody else who will pay this bill. So if you shut down \na plant sooner than you should, somebody has to pay for that. You could write those same rules if your goal were to \neliminate coal. That is a different debate. It is a debate we could have at another time. If your goal were to eliminate \ncoal, you could write those same rules. If the rule simply said: When the utility plants you are using right now, which \nmeet all the current standards, which are, in many cases, the cleanest coal-fired plants [[Page S1184]] that have \never been built or are being used anywhere in the world today--when that plant is paid for, here is what you have to \ndo next. Then, when you get your utility bill, you are not paying for the plant you are not using and also paying for \nthe plant you are using. This would be as if there were a new standard--this is the EPA view of this--on automobile \nmileage, and that standard came out and said: Here is what automobiles have to look like, in terms of standards, on \nmiles per gallon, and, by the way, you have to have that car or that truck right now. If you have a truck or car that \nyou are already driving that doesn't meet that standard, you can't drive it any longer. Of course, you still have to pay \nfor it, but you can't drive it any longer. We have been doing mileage standards in this country that have made a \nsignificant difference for a long time, but we have never said: You have to stop driving the car you are driving, and \nyou have to buy a new car. And, of course, you have to pay for the car you are driving or the bank is unlikely to give \nyou the loan for a new car. But that is what the EPA said in the clean power rule. There is a commonsense way to \ndo things, and the next nominee we will be dealing with, Attorney General Pruitt, is a commonsense guy. He has \nhad great responsibility as attorney general, but he has been willing to challenge these rules that didn't make \nsense. On the clean power rule, by the way, Missouri is the fourth biggest user of coal-produced energy. \nProjections were that the average Missouri utility bill under that rule, if it had been allowed to go into effect--still in \nthe courts because the courts say that EPA really doesn't have the authority to do that; at least the lower courts \nhave all said that. If that had been allowed to go into effect, the average Missouri utility bill would have doubled in \n10 or 12 years. It is not hard for a family to figure out. Get your utility bill out, look at it, multiply it by two, and see \nwhat happens to the things you were doing before you had to pay, in effect, a second utility bill. It is time that these \nagencies had some common sense, whether they are agencies that are being evaluated by the Office of \nManagement and Budget or agencies that are being tasked by the Congress and the President to do certain \nthings. It is time they thought about families. It is time they thought about jobs. If the economy of the country is \nbetter next year, the country will be stronger 25 years from now. I think we spend a lot of time thinking about what \nAmerica should look like 25 years from now instead of what we can do so that families have better jobs next month \n\n\n\nand next year. It is time we got some common sense into trying to reach the goals we want to reach, rather than \ncoming up with goals and then reaching them in a way that clearly will not work. The waters of the United States--\nthat is not a bad title. Water is important. Waters of the United States is important. The EPA talked about the waters \nof the United States and decided to take a definition that the Federal Government has used for well over 150 years. \nBy the way, the EPA was given control of navigable waters in the Clean Water Act and decided that navigable \nwaters aren't just what for 150 years the Federal Government said they were--from 1846 until just a couple of years \nago, more than 150 years--which was something you could move a product on, which meant interstate commerce, \nwhich meant the Constitution gave that responsibility to the Federal government, but they said: That is actually any \nwater that could run into any water that eventually could run into navigable waters. That is what the Clean Water \nAct said when it said the EPA could regulate navigable waters. This is a Farm Bureau map that has been available \nfor a long time but that the EPA never did challenge during this debate. Only the red part of our State would be \ncovered by the EPA for anything involving water-- things like a building permit or things like whether you can mow \nthe right of way on the highway or things like whether farmers could use fertilizer in their field, even if it were 100 \nmiles away from any navigable water. All of those things under the rule could have been under the authority of the \nEPA. Let me mention again, only the part of the map that is red would have been covered by the EPA, the part is \nthat 99.7 percent of the map. We have a lot of caves in our State and a few sinkholes. I think those white dots, the \nthree-tenths of one percent, are some combination of caves and sinkholes where the water appears to run right \nback into the middle of the earth, instead of into any water. What a ridiculous rule. It is the kind of rule that the \nOffice of Management and Budget should challenge whenever they are asked to look at the cost-benefit analysis. It \nis the kind of rule that a reasonable Administrator at the EPA would never let be issued. In fact, I would say it is the \nkind of rule that this Congress eventually, hopefully, will take this responsibility back and say: We have to vote on \nthese rules. We have to take responsibility for things that cost families their extra income and cost people their jobs. \nAs we get along with the business of confirming Mick Mulvaney to the Office of Management and Budget--and then \nafter that and before we leave this week--Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the EPA, hopefully \nboth of them will use common sense as their guideline. Both of them will look at, What does this really mean to \nhard-working families? What does this mean to struggling families? What does this mean to single-mom families? \nWhat does this mean to young families who are trying to figure out how they can save for the future of their kids' \ncollege or even summer camp? A lot of things go away if you double the utility bill. A lot of things go away if it takes \na year to get a building permit. A lot of things go away if we don't have common sense in our government. I think \nthis nominee, Mick Mulvaney, and the next nominee, Scott Pruitt, both bring that common sense to the jobs they \nhave been asked to do and have agreed to do, if confirmed by the Senate. I see my friend from Massachusetts is \nhere. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. \nMr. President, I thank my friend from Missouri, and the Senate, for giving me this opportunity to speak. I rise to \nspeak in opposition to the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget. Congressman Mulvaney represents the latest of President Trump's broken promises to the American \npeople. In this case, it is President Trump's campaign promise to protect Social Security, and Congressman \nMulvaney is the man who will lead the charge. The Office of Management and Budget, OMB, as it is called, is like \nthat group of scientists in the movie ``Apollo 13'' who have to figure out how to bring the spacecraft home with only \na few items found in a couple of boxes. In the movie, they describe it as fitting a square peg in a round hole. In \ngovernment, we call it the Federal budget. The crucial role of OMB and the development of the Federal budget \nmeans that the Director often has the final word on the priorities of our Federal agencies. The Director must be \nsomeone who will approach the enormity of the Federal Government in a thoughtful and deliberative manner. They \nmust be able to consider how the budget will impact the everyday lives of all Americans. Representative \nMulvaney's support for reckless, across-the-board cuts demonstrates that he is not up to this challenge. Donald \nTrump campaigned on the promise that he would make no cuts to the Social Security safety net. That means no \ncuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Congressman Mulvaney's nomination shows that, despite what \ncandidate Trump may have said, President Trump intends to do just the opposite. This is not what millions of \npeople voted for. Mick Mulvaney's nomination has Americans across the country fearful for their futures, and they \nhave every right to be scared. Congressman Mulvaney represents an immediate threat to Social Security. He \nrepresents a threat to the 1.2 million seniors in Massachusetts who currently rely on Social Security. He represents \na threat to the millions more who expect the program to be [[Page S1185]] there when they retire in coming years. \nMick Mulvaney has attempted to declare Social Security unconstitutional and has referred to the program as a \nPonzi scheme. Well, Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme. Social Security is not a handout. Social Security is a \n\n\n\npromise we make to America's seniors after decades of hard work. It is the commitment we made to those who built \nthis Nation, fought in wars, and provided for their families. Seniors pay into the system throughout their working \nlives, and they expect it to be there for them when they retire. We need to keep that promise. Social Security is not \njust a line in the budget. It is a lifeline for millions of Americans. In Massachusetts, the program keeps 295,000 \npeople above the poverty line. Across the country, more than 15 million elderly Americans are able to live out their \nlives and not be driven into poverty because they have a Social Security check. That is what it does for 15 million \nAmericans. Seniors will have nowhere to turn if President Trump and Representative Mulvaney have their way and \nSocial Security ceases to exist. Congressman Mulvaney has repeatedly suggested raising the Social Security \nretirement age to 70 years old. Let me repeat that. Mick Mulvaney wants grandma and grandpa to wait until they \nare 70 years old--that is 4 years older than the current retirement age--before they can call upon the benefits they \ndeserve. Not only does Mick Mulvaney want to make it so Americans have to work longer, he wants them to receive \nless when they finally do retire. At his Budget Committee hearing, Mick Mulvaney said that he himself was willing to \nbe subject to these new rules, since they might require him to work a couple of extra months before retirement and \nrequire his children to work until they are 70. Nothing could be more out of touch with working-class, blue-collar \nworkers across our country. I have no doubt that Mick Mulvaney would be able to work a few extra years in his \ncurrent role as a Congressman or Director of OMB or a great job that he would get after those responsibilities, but \nwhat about millions of construction workers, carpenters, waitresses, gardeners, busdrivers, and others with \nphysically demanding jobs? My father, a milkman--how many years can you work being a milkman? You have to go \nuntil you are 70 to receive a Social Security benefit in this country in the future? That is the challenge we have. We \nask milkmen, we ask 69-year-old construction workers to lay cement in blistering summer heat because Social \nSecurity is no longer there when it is promised. Do we expect a 68-year-old window washer to climb the scaffolding \nevery day when they cannot afford to retire without their Social Security benefits? We should not balance the \nbudget on their backs. That is just plain wrong. Raising the Social Security retirement age is just one of many of \nPresident Trump's broken promises. He also wants to cut Medicare and the health care of millions of Americans. \nCongressman Mulvaney looks ready to do the President's bidding as well. Congressman Mulvaney has said we \nneed to end Medicare as we know it and supported House Speaker Paul Ryan's destructive ideas to turn Medicare \ninto a voucher program. Congressman Mulvaney went even further saying that those efforts did not go far enough. \nThose kinds of cuts to Medicare would be nothing short of a disaster for the 55 million Americans enrolled in the \nprogram, including the more than 1 million individuals in Massachusetts who rely on Medicare for their health care \nneeds. Seniors deserve an OMB Director who will protect their health care, not put it on the chopping block. We \nknow Congressman Mulvaney is deeply committed to these misguided ideas because we have seen how far he is \nwilling to go to support them. He was one of the few key cheerleaders of the Republican government shutdown in \n2013. He was willing to put millions of American families, businesses, and services at risk in order to defund the \nAffordable Care Act. That shutdown cost the United States more than $24 billion. At that time, Congressman \nMulvaney said it was good policy. He said it was all worth it in order to prove a point. That simply is irresponsible. \nThat kind of recklessness has no place in the Office of Management and Budget. Congressman Mulvaney also \ndoes not believe in raising the debt limit. Back in 2011, he put the economy at risk when Republicans held our debt \nlimit hostage. He put the full faith and credit of the United States in danger by his willingness to allow the Treasury \nto default. That would have wreaked havoc on the financial markets and could have destabilized our entire \neconomy, but Congressman Mulvaney dismissed these concerns and called the potential breach of the debt limit a \nfabricated crisis. Nothing could be more fiscally irresponsible and further from the truth. Congressman Mulvaney is \nnot the type of leadership Americans expect in their government, and he is not the type of leadership needed to \ndirect the Office of Management and Budget. Strong leadership is especially crucial at the Office of Management \nand Budget, where responsible oversight of the regulatory process is a requirement of the Director's job. The \nindividual in charge must be willing to make fair determinations based on facts and evidence. Congressman \nMulvaney's record gives me no confidence that he will meet this standard. Congressman Mulvaney also dismisses \naccepted science and rejects established facts. He has stated global warming is based on questionable science \nand has outright dismissed the threat that climate change imposes on the planet. OMB oversees agencies' use of \nthe social cost of carbon, the Federal metric that assigns a dollar value for future damages to each ton of carbon \ndioxide emitted into the atmosphere. We need an OMB Director who accepts the consequences of climate change \nbecause it will be the most vulnerable in our society who will pay the highest price if we ignore climate science and \nthe danger it poses, not only to our own country but to the rest of the planet. Our country faces serious challenges \nthat require the careful and nonpartisan allocation of resources. We need a Director of the Office of Management \n\n\n\nand Budget who will hear the concerns of all Americans, not promote dangerous fiscal ideologies. Congressman \nMulvaney has indicated that he will approach our budget with an ax, and it will be our seniors who will be first on \nthe chopping block. I do not believe he is qualified to lead the Office of Management and Budget. I do so \nremembering 1981 and 1982. Ronald Reagan arrived, and Ronald Reagan had a very simple plan for America. He \nwas going to do three things fundamentally; No. 1, massive tax cuts for the wealthiest and biggest corporations in \nAmerica; No. 2, simultaneously increasing defense spending massively; No. 3, to simultaneously pledge that he \nwas going to balance the budget while unleashing massive economic growth in our country. What he did then was \nto put together a team that had a remarkable ability to harness voluminous amounts of information to defend that \nknowingly erroneous premise. You cannot say you are heading toward balancing the budget if you are \nsimultaneously saying: I am going to give massive tax breaks to those who need them the least and massive \ndefense increases, which are going to further lead to Federal expenditures, because then you have to turn and you \nhave to cut programs. You have to cut Medicare. You have to cut Social Security. You have to cut the EPA. You \nhave to cut Head Start. You have to cut food stamps. You have to cut programs for the poorest. You have to cut \nall of those investments in science in the future. You have to cut and cut and cut. That really was not the goal \nbecause ultimately Ronald Reagan just retreated from the cuts because the pressure came from across America, \nbut he had accomplished his principal goal, which was the massive defense increases and the tax cuts for the \nwealthy because that was the real agenda all along. So there is a great book, ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the \nReagan Revolution Failed,'' by David Stockman. He was the head of OMB for Ronald Reagan back in the early \n1980s. He wrote a book in 1986 about his experiences with this failed economic philosophy. It is a blistering, \nscalding indictment of what they tried to do in 1981 [[Page S1186]] and 1982. He wrote this as a warning to the \nfuture, about why we should not try to repeat what Reagan tried to do in 1981 and 1982. What he talks about in the \nbook is this. The same kind of made-up numbers to put a Panglossian--rose-colored glasses--the most optimistic \nprojection on what would happen to our economy if we had these massive tax cuts and increases in defense \nspending, while pretending that we were going to do all of these other things, which actually never did occur. So he \nsaid, because the numbers did not add up, they had to engage in a lot of fiscal chicanery. What he did was he \nconstructed two little separate categories. No. 1, he called it the magic asterisk. The magic asterisk was this attempt \nto avoid ever specifically having to itemize all of the budget cuts that would cause a revolution in America because \nthey knew they could not put that list out. So they called it a magic asterisk--cuts to be named later, programs to be \ncut later. We all know the names of those programs--Medicare, Medicaid, education, Environmental Protection \nAgency, Head Start, all the way down the line--but we will just hide the ball on that. Secondly, he constructed \nanother idea, he said, which was also fraudulent, which was called ``rosy scenario.'' What they would do is, they \nwould put together a group of economists who would then, using completely bogus projections for the future, project \nmassive economic growth. That is what Donald Trump talks about now: Oh, we will see growth that you have never \nseen before in the history of mankind--rosy scenario. There is no economic data to back it up, but that is just how \nmuch Trump is trying to model himself after this attempt in 1981 and 1982 to sell the exact same bill of goods, \nwhich collapsed, by the way. They collapsed like a house of cards economically because it did not add up. You \ncannot have a magic asterisk for all of these cuts that are never going to happen because ultimately the Democrats \nare going to back down the Republicans. We are going to back them down on cutting Medicare. We are going to \nback them down on cutting education. We are going to back them down on cutting the budget for all of these \ngreat programs. We are going to have this battle. They already know it, but it is not going to stop them in terms of \nthe first two programs, the tax cuts and the defense increases. They are going to still try to ram them through. That \njust creates bigger and bigger and bigger deficits. The only way they can get away with it is if they can project \nmassive economic growth in our country, which is the ``rosy scenario.'' Then you have a bunch of economists who \nare kind of supply-siders who kind of look back at the 1980s and ask: Can't we go back to the Reagan era again \nand repeat that? You don't want to repeat it. The guy who put the program together said: Please don't do that again. \nPlease don't do that again. He said here: Ronald Reagan chose not to be a leader but a politician, and in doing so, \nshowed why passion and imperfection, not reason and doctrine, rule the world. ``His obstinacy,'' said David \nStockman, ``was destined to keep America's economy hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long, long time.'' \nMark Twain used to say that ``history doesn't repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme.'' So, yes, this isn't exactly like \nRonald Reagan in 1981 and 1982, but it rhymes with 1981 and 1982. It rhymes with it. They are trying to argue \neconomics like lawyers, right? Politicians, PR people. Sell the bill of goods. Donald Trump calls it ``truthful \nhyperbole,'' like when he is selling a piece of property. Well, the United States is not a piece of property. The \nAmerican economy is not a piece of property. It is the central organizing principle for all of the hopes and all of the \n\n\n\ndreams of every person who lives in our country. You cannot allow for knowingly false premises to be advanced, \nand that is what Congressman Mulvaney will represent in this entire process if he is confirmed as the new head of \nthe Office of Management and Budget. He represents someone who is going to reach back into time to this era \nwhich has already been shown to have completely failed and repeat the exact same experiment again. The \nAmerican people just can't run the risk because ultimately the economic catastrophe--the impact on ordinary \nfamilies--would be so great that ultimately we would look back and say that this Senate failed, that we did not \ndischarge our responsibilities to those families. So from my perspective, I stand out here knowing that once again \nwe are faced with this prospect of repeating David Stockman's book ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan \nRevolution Failed'' and knowing that when Donald Trump said: Oh, don't worry, I am going to take care of you, \nordinary Americans; you are going to get the biggest tax breaks--they are not. That is not his plan. Oh, don't worry. I \nam going to give you better healthcare. I am going to give you more coverage for your families. That is not going to \nhappen. That is not his plan. I am going to give you cleaner air and cleaner water. It is going to be the best. It is \ngoing to be the greatest. That is not going to happen. It is the triumph of politics. It is the triumph of the special \ninterests, of the oil and gas industry, of the defense establishment that wants bigger and more contracts, of the \nwealthiest who want big tax breaks. It is the triumph of politics--the politics of the most powerful, of the wealthiest, of \nthe most entrenched. That is what this Trump administration is already about, and they are going to continue to say: \nDon't worry. Your healthcare will be better. Your air will be cleaner. Your children will be safer. Social Security will \nbe protected. But then who gets named to run the Office of Management and Budget? Somebody who wants to \nraise the retirement age to 70; someone who wants to fundamentally change Medicare as we know it; somebody \nwho has an agenda that looks a lot like 1981 and 1982 in the Reagan years, very much like it. So is there anything \nnew here? No. Is this just a sales job, a con job? Yes. Because when you pull back the covers and you look at what \nis about to unfold, it is something that is going to be very destructive of our economy. It is going to further income \ninequality across our country. It is going to reduce opportunity for every child in our country. Rather than \ndemocratizing access to opportunity through healthcare and education, they are going to work systematically to \nundermine those opportunities, to reduce the chances that they can maximize their God-given abilities. That is why \nthis nomination is so important, because the OMB controls the Federal budget. That is all the hopes and all the \ndreams. That is where the money goes. Who gets it? What are the incentives? Right now, once again, Donald \nTrump is embracing Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics: the more money you give to the people who are \nalready rich, the more it will trickle down to ordinary folks. We don't hear him saying: Oh, don't worry, the \noverwhelming majority of these tax breaks are going to go to the blue-collar people in our country. You are not \ngoing to hear him say that. And when you look at all the proposals they have made, it always goes to the \ncorporations, it always goes to the upper 1 or 2 percentile. Those promises he made are just the same as David \nStockman's and Ronald Reagan's back in 1981 and 1982--identical almost down to the final detail--and are just as \nguaranteed to fail. We have Congressman Mulvaney who has been nominated. And give him credit--he is actually \nhonest about what he believes. He is actually very clear in his explanation of what the goals are going to be for our \ncountry if he is confirmed and can partner with Donald Trump to implement this agenda. We give him credit for his \nhonesty, but it is only honesty in saying that he is going to defend a set of economic assumptions that are \ncompletely and totally fallacious and have already been disproved in the marketplace--the political marketplace. So \nall I can say here is that it would be reckless of the Senate to deliver over to the American people once again \nsomeone whose intent is to try to take this formula which gathers voluminous amounts of information to defend \nknowingly erroneous premises. [[Page S1187]] You cannot have massive tax cuts and massive increases in \ndefense spending and balance the budget without killing all of these programs that almost every American family \nrelies on, beginning with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, education programs, all the way down. We \ncan't do it. So that is why we are fighting out here. We are fighting to make sure we don't repeat the same history \nwe have already lived through. By the time Reagan reached near the end of his career, guess what he did. He \nchanged and began to acclimate himself to reality. He began to accept, through a group of new advisers, the actual \nimpact his initial policies were having. And that is all we are trying to do right now. We are trying to start out where \nwe are going to be forced to wind up anyway. Why not do that since we have already learned the lesson? Why not \nhave those lessons of the past be implemented? But no. They are committed to a repetition syndrome, a \nreenactment of what has already occurred, rather than a reconciliation with history, learning from it and then trying \nto move forward in a way which is wise, protective of every American. I stand here to oppose Congressman \nMulvaney's nomination for the Office of Management and Budget. I do not believe it would be a good thing for our \ncountry, for our economy. This is just too dangerous a roll of the dice with our entire Nation. So I say to the Senate, \n\n\n\nplease vote to reject this nomination, and ask the President to nominate someone who does reflect the best \neconomic values that our country has. With that, I yield to the Senator from Washington State, Mrs. Murray. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Andrew Puzder Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before I \nbegin to speak about the nomination before us right now, I did want to comment on the breaking news regarding the \nnomination of Andrew Puzder. There is some good news today for workers and women and families in America. \nBack on the campaign trail, President Trump promised to put workers first, but from the start, it has been pretty \nclear that his nominee for Secretary of Labor, who has now withdrawn, was a clear signal that President Trump had \nno intention of keeping that promise, and instead he planned to rig his Cabinet with the staunchest allies for Wall \nStreet--big corporations and special interests--that he could find. So I am not surprised that when workers and \nfamilies heard about the pride Mr. Puzder takes in objectifying women, that he called his own workers ``the best of \nthe worst,'' and that his vision for our economy is one in which workers are squeezed so those at the top can boost \ntheir profits higher and higher, they said no. They spoke up loud and clear that they want a true champion for all \nworkers in the Labor Department. I just want to thank all the workers who bravely shared their stories in the last few \nmonths. It is clear today that your words are powerful, and I am going to keep bringing your voices here to the \nSenate, and we will keep fighting. With that, Mr. President, I wanted to be here today to speak about OMB Director \nNominee Mulvaney. I submitted comments on this nomination in the Budget Committee, and I want to bring them \nto the full Senate today. I am here today to urge my colleagues to oppose Congressman Mulvaney. Mr. President, \nwe all know that a budget is more than just numbers on a page; a budget represents our values and our priorities, \nthe kind of Nation we are now and the kind of Nation we want to be. Congressman Mulvaney is not shy about \nwhere he stands on this. When I sat down with him a couple of weeks ago, he made it very clear that he would use \nour budget to radically reshape our country in a way that I believe would be devastating to families, to seniors, to \nveterans, to the middle class, and to many others. Congressman Mulvaney has said he wants to make drastic, \nradical cuts to Federal investments, trillions of dollars across the board. His budget proposals would slash \nFederal funding for education, leaving students across the country with fewer opportunities to learn and to succeed. \nThey would cut investments in jobs and training, leaving our workers scrambling to keep up with the changing \neconomy. They would eliminate support for children and families who need a hand up to get back on their feet. \nThey would eliminate basic medical research that creates jobs and leads to lifesaving cures. They would continue \nthe work President Trump has done to destroy healthcare in America and create even more chaos and confusion. \nThey would lead to dramatic cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, betraying the commitments we have made to our \nseniors and so much more. He wants to do that while giving away even more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans \nand biggest corporations and has proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70, causing millions of \nAmericans to drop under the poverty line. In other words, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination is another perfect \nexample of how President Trump is breaking the promises he made on the campaign trail to stand with workers and \nseniors and the middle class. Just a few years ago, Congressman Mulvaney was at the fringes of the Republican \nParty. He is one of the most extreme members of the tea party wing of the party who supported the government \nshutdown when others were working to end it; who failed to show the proper concern about a potentially \ncatastrophic breach of the debt limit and remains cavalier even now, telling me he would advise the President \nagainst accepting a clean debt limit; who, by the way, isn't even willing to support the budget deal I reached with \nSpeaker Ryan. He is someone whom responsible members of his own Republican Party scorned just a few years \nago and whose budget ideas they rejected as damaging, unworkable, and political suicide. But now he is the \nperson whom Republicans are holding up as a budget leader. As we see this nomination, as we see Republicans \nuse the budget process to slam through a partisan plan to destroy our healthcare system, it is clearer than ever \nhow far the Republican Party has moved, even from the days of our bipartisan budget deal. Finally, I am extremely \ntroubled by Congressman Mulvaney's failure to pay taxes and comply with the law. I know I am not the only one \nwho has been here long enough to see Cabinet nominees withdraw over less egregious breaches than this. \nCongressman Mulvaney's motivations, explanations, and defenses have not been credible. It is hard to believe that \nevery single one of my Republican colleagues feels comfortable with someone with such a serious lapse of \njudgment in charge of the budget of this administration. I voted against Congressman Mulvaney in the Budget \nCommittee for those reasons and more, and I am here today to oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same. Certainly, we can do better than this. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think Senator Murray has said it very well, and I \nwant to pick up on what I think is really at stake with this nomination. In effect, if confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney \nwould be the numbers guy for the Trump team, the architect for the President's fiscal plan for the Nation's future. I \n\n\n\nwant to start by way of saying that, when you look at the President's promises that he made on the campaign trail to \nprotect Medicare and Social Security from draconian cuts, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination and his record \nwould be one of the biggest bait- and-switch schemes inflicted on America's seniors that I can imagine. I am going \nto start by taking a minute to read some of what the President said on the campaign trail. He said: Every \nRepublican wants to do a big number on Social Security. They want to do it on Medicare . . . and we can't do that. \nIt's not fair to the people. The President said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is, not \nincrease the age, but to leave it as-is.'' The President said: You can't get rid of Medicare. Medicare's a program that \nworks . . . people love Medicare and it's unfair to them. I'm going to fix it and make it better, but I'm not going to cut \nit. [[Page S1188]] So those are just some of the promises that President Trump made with respect to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. There are quotes like that from rallies and campaign events and debates over a period of \nsome months. I think it would be fair to say that, for a lot of seniors, when they heard that--when they heard these \npromises that these vital programs would be protected--that was a political litmus test for many American older \npeople. So I describe this contrast between the promises of President Trump and Candidate Trump and \nCongressman Mulvaney as a bait and switch, but I think the Senate needs to know a little bit more detail with \nrespect to specifics. In 2011 Congressman Mulvaney said: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' He added in \nanother interview: ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' He proposed raising the Social Security age to 70. He \ncalled the program a Ponzi scheme. While he was a State lawmaker, he even voted to declare Social Security \nunconstitutional. My sense is it will be a while before seniors get over the whiplash from the 180-degree turn the \nadministration has pulled on Medicare and Social Security cuts. Now, with respect to the days ahead, for me, a lot \nof this debate starts in my days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. The seniors that I worked with \nknew what those programs meant. It was their grandparents who faced old age without Social Security. Those \nseniors with whom I worked during those Gray Panther days remember what happened before we had the safety \nnet. Before there was Social Security and Medicare, you would have needy older people shunted off to poor farms \nand almshouses. Even if you had meager savings, you were on your own for income or you had to rely on family, \nand lots of family members were not exactly well off. If you came down with a serious illness, it really meant that \nyou would be living in poverty and squalor. Social Security and Medicare changed those unacceptable terms of the \nsocial contract between this country and older people--and changed it for all time. Those programs were about \nsaying that in America--for the older people who fought our wars, strengthened our communities day in and day out, \nmade America a better place because they were always pitching in to help and be constructive--Medicare and \nSocial Security meant that older people and seniors would not face a life of destitution. That is why I believe every \nMember of this body--and I heard Senator Murray talk about this--ought to find what Congressman Mulvaney has \nsaid against Medicare--his anti-Medicare and anti-Social Security agenda--so troubling. I want to be very specific \nabout the days ahead. Medicare, at its core, has always been a promise. It has been a promise of guaranteed \nbenefits. It is not a voucher. It is not a slip of paper. It is a promise of guaranteed benefits. We made the judgment--I \njust went briefly through some of the history--because no one would ever know how healthy they would be when \nthey reached age 65. We talked about it in the Budget Committee and in a number of meetings here in the Senate. \nI am definitely for updating the Medicare promise, updating the Medicare guarantee, and improving it, for example, \nto include chronic care services, cancer services, diabetes, services dealing with a whole host of chronic illnesses. \nThat is going to consume much of the Medicare budget. We can have more home care and we can use \ntelemedicine, and we can use nonphysician providers. Senator Murray knows that in our part of the country we \nreally have found a way to get people good quality care in an affordable way, but we are keeping the promise. We \nare keeping the promise of the Medicare guarantee. Congressman Mulvaney would break the promise of Medicare. \nIf confirmed, he would join his former House colleague who just became Health and Human Services Secretary, \nTom Price, who said in really very blunt terms over the years that he wanted to privatize the program. He wanted to \nprivatize and cut the program. He basically indicated with his legislation that he didn't really believe in Medicare, \nand he didn't believe in the guarantee of services that Medicare provided. If you look at Congressman Mulvaney's \nrecord, it certainly indicates he shares the views of our former House colleague who just became Health and \nHuman Services Secretary, Tom Price. With respect to Social Security, this year nearly 62 million Americans and \ntheir families count on receiving retirement, survivors, and disability benefits to stay afloat. This is a program that \nkeeps tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. It is unquestionably one of the most popular programs in American \nhistory. It has changed the fabric of the country for the better. Again, I think about the days when I worked with older \npeople. We had millions of older people who month in and month out would just walk an economic tightrope. They \nwould try to balance their food costs against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical costs. Social \n\n\n\nSecurity and Medicare came along to make sure those older people wouldn't be pushed off that economic tightrope. \nSo Social Security has changed the fabric of the country for the better without doubt, and yet Congressman \nMulvaney proposes to raise the Social Security age to 70, which would be a 20 percent cut to benefits. Let's picture \nwhat this means, particularly for the millions of older people who might not have had a job where they could work on \ntheir laptop, and they had a physical job. They worked hours and hours on their feet day in and day out. Ask the \nsingle mom who spent decades working multiple jobs that way to put food on the table and send her kids to school \nwhat it is going to mean to cut their benefits that way--or the loggers or the dock workers, the miners, and all of \nthose people who have worked hard and have been on their feet with physically grueling work. Ask them about \nraising the Social Security age this way. I think you are going to get a pretty good sense of how strongly Americans \noppose this kind of Mulvaney approach. So by way of summing up, I think it would be hard to find a more significant \ntask for the Congress at this time than protecting Social Security and Medicare, advocating for the two as great \nachievements in the history of American policymaking. They are right at the center of our safety net. Now you have \nto give Congressman Mulvaney credit for one thing. He has been blunt, he has been explicit, and he is not shy \nabout essentially his vision of hollowing these programs out and dismantling them. When asked about whether he \nwas going to stick to his proposal to cut the programs, he said: I have to imagine that the President knew what he \nwas getting when he asked me to fill this role. I would like to think it is why he hired me. That is why I say--and \nSenator Murray touched on this--what kind of a bait-and-switch game are we talking about here? You have the \nPresident--Candidate Trump--saying: Nothing doing; nobody is going to mess with Social Security and Medicare--\noff limits. I want older people in America to know they are going to be safe if they elect me. It was almost like a \nlitmus test for America's older people. Then Congressman Mulvaney comes along and he basically calls the bluff on \nthe whole thing. He describes the bait and switch in very blunt terms, where he says: ``I have to imagine the \nPresident knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role''--that the President knew what the Mulvaney \nrecord was all about, which was about ending Medicare as we know it. So I will just close by way of saying that I \nsee that a big part of my job, and what Oregonians sent me here to do, is to defend Medicare and Social Security \nfor generations of Americans to come. That is why I am a no on the Mulvaney nomination. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the nomination. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk \nwill call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, most Americans don't know who the Director of OMB is, \nbut I want to stand today and explain what an important position in our government it truly is. [[Page S1189]] The \nDirector of OMB is responsible for not only implementing and articulating the President's budget but also \nsafeguarding the regulatory process. I would say there is another part of the job because when you are Director of \nOMB and you are putting the budget out, you also have to understand the checks and balances of our government, \nincluding that there are two Houses in Congress and there are different opinions in Congress. Sometimes, in order \nto get a budget, the word ``compromise'' has to be utilized, which, by the way, was one of the favorite concepts of \nour Founding Fathers in our Constitution. That is why they embraced checks and balances, because they wanted to \nfoster compromises and consensus. That is why Representative Mulvaney is not the right person for this job. He is \nsomeone who has been a disrupter. There is a place for disrupters in government. I am not casting aside all \ndisrupters, but I don't think a disrupter belongs as the head of the OMB. Some people are going to talk a lot about \nhis career and quote him: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' Others will talk about how he has agreed with \nthe characterization of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme; that he has advocated raising the Social Security \neligibility age to 70, even for people who would be as old as 59 right now and maybe having worked in physical \nlabor all of their lives. Yes, he has advocated dramatic changes in dismantling Medicare and Social Security in \nmany ways. I would like to focus on the fact that he thinks it is OK to default on the debt, that he thinks a \ngovernment shutdown was good policy in terms of making a point, and that he has supported indiscriminate cuts to \nour defense budget that were a blunt instrument based on an ideology and not a thoughtful position based on our \nnational security. I listened to Mr. Mulvaney as he said to me in a one-on-one meeting how he would prioritize the \ndebts he would pay if he defaulted on the debt. Wouldn't that be a great addition to the chaos we are all feeling right \nnow; that the U.S. Government would be Turkey or Greece or another country that is having trouble meeting its \nobligations. We have been a beacon on the Hill not just for freedom and not just for liberty but a beacon on the Hill \nin terms of economic strength. The notion that we would not rise to our obligations--understanding, as \nCongressman Mulvaney does, that this is not a spending issue; this is a meeting-our-obligations issue. This is like \nbuying a pickup truck and halfway through the payments you decide you don't want to pay anymore. This isn't a \n\n\n\nmatter of deciding whether you are going to buy the pickup truck in the first place. That is the appropriations \nprocess. Raising the debt limit is merely deciding we are going to pay our obligations. So the fact that he believes \nbrinkmanship is a good thing in terms of shutting down the government, the fact that defaulting on our debt is an \noption for Congressman Mulvaney, the fact that if you look at those positions, you realize compromise is not part of \nhis vocabulary; that brinkmanship and rigid ideology is what he would bring to this process, that is the last thing we \nneed in Washington, DC, right now, brinkmanship and rigid ideology, especially when it comes to our budget and \nprioritizing our funds. So I cannot support Congressman Mulvaney. As the ranking member on the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, I hope I can urge my other colleagues to understand that there are \nmany people whom I could support for Director of OMB, but Congressman Mulvaney is not one of them. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nnomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \nUnder most circumstances, I always give the benefit of the doubt to the incoming President for obvious reasons; \nthat he is the choice of the American people. So it is with great reluctance that I come to the floor of the Senate to \nrise in opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney. President Trump has committed to ``end the \nDefense sequester and rebuild our military.'' Earlier this month, the President promised troops at CENTCOM \nheadquarters that his administration ``will make an historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United \nStates.'' I fully support the President's commitment. I fear that Congressman Mulvaney, as the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, does not. I believe we must rebuild our military while at the same time putting our \nNation on a sustainable, long-term fiscal path. We can and must do both. Unfortunately, Congressman Mulvaney \nhas spent his last 6 years in the House of Representatives pitting the national debt against our military. He offered \namendments in support of cutting our national defense funding year after year after year. As my colleagues and I \nsought repeatedly to find legislative solutions to reverse dangerous defense cuts and eliminate arbitrary defense \nspending caps, it was Congressman Mulvaney and his allies who repeatedly sought to torpedo these efforts. In \n2013, Congressman Mulvaney succeeded in passing an amendment to cut $3.5 billion from the Defense \nappropriations bill. His website featured an article touting the achievement, but when I asked him about that vote \nduring his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney said he didn't remember that amendment. I think anybody \nwho treats our national defense with the seriousness it deserves would remember a vote like that. President Trump \nhas said that defense cuts over the last several years have depleted our military. Our military leaders have testified \nthat these cuts have placed the ``lives of'' our military ``servicemembers at greater risk.'' That is an exact quote \nfrom our military leaders, but Congressman Mulvaney has said that in the greater scheme of things, sequestration \ncuts were not that big. He also said: ``The only thing worse than those military cuts would be no cuts at all.'' This is \nthe kind of statement that can only be made by a person detached from the reality of what these cuts have meant \nto military servicemembers. Tell that to the thousands of soldiers who were forced out of the Army because of these \ncuts. Tell that to the Marine pilots who fly fewer hours per month than their Russian and Chinese counterparts \nbecause of these cuts. Tell that to the Air Force maintainers, stealing parts from retired aircraft and museum pieces \nto keep their planes in the air because of sequestration. Tell that to the crew of the submarine USS Boise who can't \ndeploy because their boat is no longer qualified to dive and can't receive required upkeep because of chronic \nmaintenance backlogs. Tell that to the thousands of Navy sailors who have picked up the slack for an overworked \nNavy by going on extended deployments and spending more and more time away from their families, all because of \nthe defense cuts. Congressman Mulvaney's beliefs, as revealed by his poor record on defense spending, are \nfundamentally at odds with President Trump's commitment to rebuild our military. This record can't be ignored in \nlight of the significant authority exercised by the Director of the OMB over the Federal budget. Almost every one of \nmy colleagues in this body--all but one--voted for Jim Mattis to be Secretary of Defense because they knew he was \nthe right leader to help the Department of Defense confront growing threats to our national security. I share that \nsame confidence, but I also know he can't do it alone. Voting in favor of Congressman Mulvaney's nomination \nwould be asking Secretary Mattis to spend less time fighting our enemies overseas and more time fighting inside \nthe beltway budget battles with an OMB Director with a deep ideological commitment to cutting the resources \navailable to his Department. Congressman Mulvaney's record is equally troubling when it comes to foreign policy. \nApparently, Congressman Mulvaney shared President Obama's naive assumptions about Russia's threat to \nEastern security when he voted to require the withdrawal of two Army brigade combat teams from Europe in 2012. \nHe compounded the error in 2013 when he voted to withdraw the 2nd Cavalry Regiment from Europe. \nCongressman Mulvaney and others [[Page S1190]] supported these withdrawals in the name of saving money, but \nthe shortsighted decision to withdraw troops and capabilities from Europe ended up costing the taxpayers billions \n\n\n\nmore, not less. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, America's military presence in Europe was inadequate to \nthe scale and scope of Russia's threat to our interests and our allies. Addressing this problem has required billions \nof dollars in new investments to enhance our deterrent posture in Europe; in other words, American taxpayers, quite \nliterally, paid the price for the strategic mistake of withdrawing from Europe, supported by Congressman Mulvaney. \nIn 2011, Congressman Mulvaney voted for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan. I repeat \nthat. This is not a typographical error. In 2011, Congressman Mulvaney voted for the immediate withdrawal of all \nU.S. troops from Afghanistan. Congressman Mulvaney voting to abandon America's mission to prevent Afghanistan \nfrom becoming a safe haven for terrorists to attack our homeland as they did on September 11, is disturbing \nenough, but Congressman Mulvaney's testimony during his confirmation hearing that he did so at the urging of a \nsingle constituent, with no apparent regard for the national security consequences, leaves me with serious doubts \nabout his judgment on matters of national security. Beyond matters of defense and national security policy, I am \nalso concerned about Congressman Mulvaney's support for reckless budget strategies that led to a government \nshutdown. He made frequent attempts to diminish the impact of the shutdown by referring to it as a ``government \nslowdown,'' or the more Orwellian term, ``temporary lapse in appropriations.'' There are few people whose views \nand record are more representative of the dysfunction that has gripped Washington for the last several years than \nthat attitude. Over my 30 years in the Senate, I have shown great deference to Presidents of both parties in \nselecting members of their Cabinet, but I cannot on this nominee. My decision to oppose this nomination is not \nabout one person. It is not about one Cabinet position. This is not personal. This is not political. This is about \nprinciple. This is about my conviction as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that providing for the \ncommon defense is our highest constitutional duty and that rebuilding our military must be the No. 1 priority of the \nCongress and the White House. I will vote to oppose Congressman Mulvaney's nomination because it would be \nirresponsible to place the future of the defense budget in the hands of a person with such a record and judgment \non national security. This is the beginning, not the end, of the fight to rebuild our military. I will continue to stand on \nprinciple as this body considers a budget resolution for the coming fiscal year and Defense authorization bill and a \nDefense appropriations bill, and I will continue to stand on principle in fighting to bring a full repeal of the Budget \nControl Act's discretionary spending caps to the floor of the Senate. For 6 years now, Washington dysfunction has \nimposed very real consequences on the thousands of Americans serving in uniform and sacrificing on our behalf all \naround the Nation and the world. From Afghanistan to Iraq and Syria, to the heart of Europe, to the seas of Asia, \nour troops are doing everything we ask of them. It is time for those of us in this body to do all we can for them. So \nlong as I serve as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, it is my pledge to do just that. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Nomination of Neil Gorsuch Mr. HATCH. Mr. \nPresident, 2 weeks ago, President Trump nominated Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado to fill the \nvacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Judge Gorsuch, in my opinion, is the ideal \nchoice to fill this seat. He has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the bench demonstrating a keen \nunderstanding of the proper role of a judge. Given the increasingly contentious nature of the confirmation process, it \nis not surprising that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their special interest group allies are \nstretching to find anything objectionable about Judge Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous. Today, I wish to address \none of their latest, most outlandish claims: that Judge Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the \nexecutive branch. For example, last week in Politico, Senator Schumer, the distinguished Senator from New York, \ndeclared in an opinion piece: ``The most important factor in assessing a Supreme Court nominee . . . is whether or \nnot the potential justice will be an independent check on an executive who may act outside our nation's laws and \nthe Constitution.'' Senator Schumer doubled down on these comments in the New York Times. There, he argued \nthat it was impossible for him to discern Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence when they met in person. Why? \nBecause Judge Gorsuch refused to say how he would rule on specific issues or how he would review particular \ngovernment actions. These misleading narratives are an irrelevant, wasteful distraction from our consideration of \nJudge Gorsuch's sterling record and the merits of confirming him to the Supreme Court. Last month, I warned that \nthe left would use these diversion tactics in an attempt to discredit the President's nominee. Shortly before Judge \nGorsuch's nomination was announced, I predicted in an opinion piece in the Washington Post that advocates and \ninterest groups would want to know how the nominee would decide particular cases before those cases ever \nreached the Court to make sure the nominee is on the right team. I was right. Our Nation's Founders would have \nbeen embarrassed by such questions. Instead, the questions we ask should focus on whether the nominee will \ninterpret and apply the law faithfully and neutrally no matter what the issue is. After all, that is what our Constitution \ndemands. Our Founders are not the only ones who would be embarrassed. I have been in the Senate for the last \n\n\n\ndozen Supreme Court confirmations. Every nominee we have considered has rightly refused to answer such \nquestions. Consider, for example, Justice Ginsburg's response at her confirmation hearing. She said: A judge \nsworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics \nof the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process. Just last month in a speech in Arizona, \nJustice Sotomayor had an even stronger warning against asking and answering such questions. She said: What \nyou want is for us to tell you how as a judicial nominee we're going to rule on the important issues you find vexing. . \n. . Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will vote \nis the kind of person you don't want as a judge. So let's stop with this nonsense of trying to get Judge Gorsuch to \nprejudge issues that could come before the Court. I hope my colleagues appreciate the irony in asking a judge to \nsay how they would rule on particular issues in order to prove that the judge is judicially independent. I agree with \nJustice Sotomayor: A nominee who will tell you how she would vote is the kind of person you do not want as a \njudge. But if judicial independence really is the most important factor, as Senator Schumer suggests, then this \nconfirmation process should be the easiest one in the Senate's history. Over 11 years on the Tenth Circuit, Judge \nGorsuch has consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other writings that he deeply values the \nconstitutional separation of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government. Judge Gorsuch \nunderstands that the Constitution gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws, the President \nenforces those laws, and the courts interpret those laws and the Constitution. The branches may act only according \nto the powers the Constitution grants them, with the remaining powers and rights reserved to the States and \nultimately to the people. With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge Gorsuch has a strong record of \nreining in actions which violate the Constitution and the [[Page S1191]] law. Perhaps the best example is his \nopinion in the immigration case Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. There, the Attorney General attempted to apply a new \nagency rule retroactively prohibiting a noncitizen from receiving relief under Federal immigration law. Writing for \nthe Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch ruled that such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the law. In a \nseparate opinion, he noted that there is an elephant in the room: the so-called Chevron deference doctrine, which \nrequires courts to defer to Federal agency interpretations of the law we pass. He expressed constitutional concerns \nabout Chevron deference. Judge Gorsuch wrote: [T]he fact is Chevron . . . permit[s] executive bureaucracies to \nswallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems \nmore than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come to face \nthe behemoth. Judge Gorsch then proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper separation of powers \nunder our Constitution. As he stated, the Founders included a strong separation of powers in the Constitution \nbecause ``[a] government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of invading the liberties of \nthe people.'' As my colleagues know, I am no fan of Chevron deference. Last Congress, I introduced the Separation \nof Powers Restoration Act to get rid of it. As I noted when I introduced the legislation, regulators have taken \nadvantage of the courts' deference under Chevron to shoehorn the law for their own political agenda, expanding \ntheir authority well beyond congressional intent. But the Constitution's separation of powers makes clear that it is \nthe responsibility of the courts, not the bureaucracy, to interpret the law. So I am pleased Judge Gorsuch \nunderstands that the Constitution requires Federal judges to serve as an independent check on how Federal \nagencies interpret the laws we enact. Separation of powers is not just about ensuring that the executive branch \nperforms its proper role of executing the law; separation of powers is also about making sure Federal judges \nunderstand their proper role under the Constitution. As Chief Justice Marshall famously explained in Marbury v. \nMadison, judges have a constitutional duty to say what the law is. Simply put, judges must be faithful interpreters of \nour laws and the Constitution. Under our constitutional separation of powers, it is not the role of Federal judges to \nmake or change laws by imposing their own policy preferences. It is not their role to look beyond the law to consider \ntheir personal views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose winners and losers based on subjective beliefs \nthat favor one group over another. In my 40 years in the Senate, I have reviewed the record of hundreds of \nnominees for the Federal bench. I don't think I have ever reviewed the record of a nominee who better understands \nhis proper role under the Constitution than Judge Gorsuch. Consider, for example, Judge Gorsuch's touching \ntribute to Justice Scalia that was published last year in the Case Western Reserve Law Review. In that speech, \nJudge Gorsuch eloquently explained how judges should not be in the business of ruling in ways that reflect their \nown political views or policy preferences. Judges, after all, are not elected legislators. Instead, judges should \ninterpret the law as written. They must start with the text of the statute and then utilize the traditional tools of \nstatutory interpretations to discern the meaning of any particular law. Judge Gorsuch understands, to borrow from \nAlexander Hamilton, that the judiciary should be the least dangerous branch. These aren't just words; Judge \n\n\n\nGorsuch's judicial record confirms that he lives this judicial philosophy of restraint and humility. In an essay I \npublished last week on SCOTUSblog, I reviewed a number of judicial opinions by Judge Gorsuch that demonstrate \nhis commitment to the separation of powers and the proper role of a judge in our Federal system. I will not go \nthrough all of those cases here, but I ask unanimous consent that the essay be printed in the Record. There being \nno objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From SCOTUSblog] Worried About \nthe Separation of Powers? Then Confirm Judge Gorsuch (By Senator Orrin Hatch) Last week, President Donald \nTrump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge \nGorsuch is an ideal choice to fill this seat: He has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the bench \ndemonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role of a judge. Given the increasingly contentious nature of the \nconfirmation process, it is no surprise that many Democrats are stretching to find anything objectionable about \nJudge Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous. In the current political environment, they have focused much of their \ncriticism on one particularly strained argument: their claim that Justice Gorsuch would not serve as an independent \ncheck on the executive branch. Fortunately, we do not have to speculate about how Justice Gorsuch would decide \nthese kinds of cases. Judge Gorsuch has consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other writings that \nhe deeply values the constitutional separation of powers between the three branches of the federal government. \nJudge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws, the \nPresident enforces those laws, and the courts interpret those laws and the Constitution. The branches may act only \naccording to the powers the Constitution grants them, with the remaining powers and rights reserved to the states \nand, ultimately, to the people. With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge Gorsuch has a strong \nrecord of reining in unlawful overreach. For instance, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, the Attorney General had \nattempted to apply a new agency rule retroactively to prohibit a noncitizen from receiving relief under federal \nimmigration law. Writing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch concluded that such \naction exceeded the executive's power to enforce the law. In a separate opinion, he went one step further and \nexpressed concerns about how judge-made doctrines that require judicial deference to federal agency actions--\nnamely, Chevron deference and its progeny--''permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core \njudicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square \nwith the Constitution of the framers' design.'' Judge Gorsuch then proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of \nthe proper separation of powers between the three branches, concluding that ``[i]t was to avoid dangers like these, \ndangers the founders had studied and seen realized in their own time, that they pursued the separation of powers. \nA government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of invading the liberties of the people.'' \nNor is Judge Gorsuch a supporter of federal judges who go beyond their constitutional role in interpreting the law. \nAs Judge Gorsuch has eloquently explained, ``judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is using \nthe traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own \npolitical views, always with an eye on the outcome, and engaged perhaps in some Benthamite calculation of \npleasures and pains along the way.'' It is not judges' role to make or change laws by imposing their own policy \npreferences instead of what Congress actually passed. It is not their role to look beyond the text of the law to \nconsider their personal views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose winners and losers based on subjective \nbeliefs that favor one group over another. Judge Gorsuch's opinions reinforce his judicial philosophy of restraint and \nhumility and his proper understanding--to borrow from Alexander Hamilton--that the judiciary should be the ``least \ndangerous'' branch. Consider, for example, United States v. Games-Perez. There, the 10th Circuit upheld a \nconviction for possession of a firearm by a felon. The criminal defendant argued that he was unaware that he was a \nconvicted felon, but the court rejected this argument as foreclosed by the court's prior precedent. Judge Gorsuch \npenned a separate opinion. He agreed that the court was bound by its own precedent, but he wrote separately to \nurge the court to reconsider its precedent in light of the plain text of the statute that requires the government to \nprove the defendant knew he was a convicted felon. As Judge Gorsuch explained, ``we might be better off applying \nthe law Congress wrote than the one [the court] hypothesized. It is a perfectly clear law as it is written, plain in its \nterms, straightforward in its application.'' He continued: ``Of course, if Congress wishes to revise the plain terms of \n[the statute], it is free to do so anytime. But there is simply no right or reason for this court to be in that business.'' \nSometimes a judge is asked to consider the proper separation of powers between all three branches. For instance, \nin Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, the 10th Circuit considered whether certain regulations issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act violated the \nplaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In particular, the plaintiffs argued that the regulations' \nhealth [[Page S1192]] insurance mandate for employers violated RFRA's statutory protections on religious freedom \n\n\n\nby forcing employers to provide health insurance coverage for abortion- inducing drugs and devices. Judge \nGorsuch's opinion explained why the owners of one of the plaintiff companies were entitled to relief under RFRA. \nAs an initial matter, he noted that the owners' ``religious convictions are contestable'' and that ``[s]ome may even \nfind [their] beliefs offensive,'' but that RFRA ``does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious \nbeliefs.'' Judge Gorsuch then turned to the statutory interpretation question at issue and noted that the case was a \n``tale of two statutes.'' Wrote Judge Gorsuch: ``The ACA compels the [plaintiffs] to act. RFRA says they need not. \nWe are asked to decide which legislative direction controls.'' To decide which statute controlled, he did not defer to \nthe executive branch's position on the matter. Nor did he seek to impose his own policy preferences. To the \ncontrary, he noted that ``[t]he tiebreaker is found not in our own opinions about good policy but in the laws \nCongress enacted.'' Because ``Congress structured RFRA to override other legal mandates, including its own \nstatutes, if and when they encroach on religious liberty,'' and ``because the government identifies no explicit \nexclusion in the ACA to its dictates,'' Judge Gorsuch concluded, RFRA's directive prevailed. Even a casual review \nof Judge Gorsuch's opinions should eliminate any concerns my Senate colleagues may have concerning his \ncommitment to the Constitution's separation of powers. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive \nbranch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing those laws as written. Indeed, his opinions and other \nwritings cogently make the case for this approach to separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the \nfederal bench and reminds me much of the case Justice Scalia made during his time on the Court. Judge Gorsuch, \nmoreover, has been a model of respect for the proper judicial role, a judicial philosophy under which ``judges seek \nto interpret texts as reasonable affected parties might have done rather than rewrite texts to suit their own policy \npreferences.'' To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender of the separation of powers and the rule \nof law does not mean his rulings will match his policy preferences, much less mine. In fact, in his tribute speech to \nJustice Scalia last year, Judge Gorsuch embraced Justice Scalia's philosophy of judicial restraint: ``If you're going \nto be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the \nconclusions you reach.'' That is precisely why Judge Gorsuch is the right choice for the Supreme Court. Mr. \nHATCH. To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender of the separation of powers does not mean \nhis rulings will match his policy preferences. As Justice Scalia wisely remarked, good and faithful judges will not \nalways like the conclusions they reach in interpreting the law. And it certainly does not mean that his rulings will \nmatch my policy preferences or those of my colleagues. As I have repeatedly stated on this floor over decades, that \nis not the proper inquiry when we assess the qualifications of a nominee to the Federal bench. Federal judges must \nbe judges, not super-legislators. The bottom line is, even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should \neliminate any concerns my colleagues may have concerning Judge Gorsuch's commitment to the Constitution's \nseparation of powers. Any review would lead to that conclusion. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted \nexecutive branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing those laws. Judge Gorsuch's opinions and \nother writings make the compelling case for separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the current \nFederal bench. If my colleagues are truly concerned about the proper separation of powers between the three \nbranches of government, there is a simple solution: Confirm Judge Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the United \nStates Supreme Court. Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare Mr. President, I want to once again discuss the \nongoing effort to repeal and replace the so-called Affordable Care Act. This is one of our most vexing issues of the \nday. Of course, this isn't the first time I have come to the floor to discuss ObamaCare, and I am fairly certain it won't \nbe the last. I was here just last week, in fact, talking about the general unanimity among Republicans on these \nissues, despite the seemingly eternal focus on the supposed divisions among our ranks. While some are still \nadvancing that narrative, Republicans are, overall, still united in our desire to repeal and replace ObamaCare. As I \nsaid last week, I don't know if there is a single Republican in Congress who supports keeping the healthcare status \nquo in place. All of us want to right what went wrong with the poorly named Affordable Care Act and provide \npatients and consumers with more healthcare choices that address healthcare costs. Most differences of opinion \nthat do exist on these matters are more about timing than anything else. As I have said before, I support moving \nquickly to repeal ObamaCare and include as many replacement policies as possible under the rules of the \nreconciliation process. More specifically, I support repealing ObamaCare's harmful taxes, and I will explain why. Put \nsimply, the tax provisions in ObamaCare were poorly conceived and recklessly enacted, and they are harmful to our \neconomy. Those taxes came in a number of forms, including the employer mandate and the individual mandate, \nboth of which are enforced through the Tax Code. In addition, there is the health insurance tax, the Cadillac tax, \nalong with new taxes on healthcare savings and pharmaceuticals. ObamaCare also included a payroll tax hike for \nsome high-income earners as well as additional taxes on investing. And, of course, we cannot forget the medical \n\n\n\ndevice tax, which, in just the first 3 years that ObamaCare was implemented, resulted in more than 30,000 lost jobs \nin that important industry. All told, the tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act represented a trillion-dollar hit on \nthe U.S. economy in the first 10 years, and the burdens of the vast majority of these taxes are ultimately borne by \npatients and consumers in the form of higher costs, larger tax bills, and reduced value in existing health plans and \nsavings accounts. I know some of my colleagues like to plead ignorance on the notion that taxes on a particular \nindustry tend to be passed along to that industry's consumers, but it is a fact that can't be ignored. Taxes on health \ninsurance plans increase premiums for patients. Taxes on drug companies make drugs more expensive. Taxes on \nmedical device sales increase the costs of those devices. It is not a complicated concept; it is the natural byproduct \nof tax provisions negotiated with stakeholders behind closed doors under threat of increased government intrusion \nand market regulation. These taxes weren't drafted solely to pay the cost of ObamaCare; they were also part of a \nstrategy to get the law through Congress, dividing the business community and pitting industries against one \nanother to prevent widespread opposition. As I said, at the end of the day, it is patients and consumers--individuals \nand families--who pay most of the freight on these types of tax policies. Don't take my word for it. Let's look at one \nmajor example. Congress's nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, indicated that, by and large, \nthe tax on health insurance premiums would be passed along to health insurance policyholders. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the JCT to Senator Grassley, dated October 28, \n2009. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Congress of the \nUnited States, Joint Committee on Taxation, Washington, DC, October 28, 2009. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, \nRanking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Ranking Member Grassley: You \nrequested that we provide you with an analysis of the incidence of the insurance industry fee provision of S. 1796, \nthe ``America's Healthy Future Act,'' our estimate of the effect on the after-tax price of purchased health insurance, \nand a distributional analysis of the provision. insurance industry fee Sec. 6010 of S. 1796 would impose an annual \nfee on any covered entity engaged in the business of providing health insurance with respect to United States \nhealth risks. Under the provision, employers who self-insure their employees' health risks and governmental entities \nare not covered entities. The fee applies for calendar years beginning after 2009. The aggregate annual fee for all \ncovered entities is $6.7 billion. Under the provision, the aggregate fee is apportioned among the covered entities \nbased on a ratio designed to reflect theft relative market share of U.S. health business. For each covered entity, the \nfee for a calendar year is an amount that bears the same [[Page S1193]] ratio to $6.7 billion as (1) the covered \nentity's net premiums written during the preceding calendar year with respect to health insurance for any United \nStates health risk, bears to (2) the aggregate net premiums written of all covered entities during such preceding \ncalendar year with respect to such health insurance. incidence of insurance excise taxes The proposed fee is \nsimilar to an excise tax based on the sales price of health insurance contracts. The effective excise tax rate varies \nfrom year to year depending upon the aggregate value of health insurance sold. The economic incidence of an \nexcise tax imposed on sale of health insurance contracts (that is, who actually bears the cost of the tax) may differ \nfrom the statutory incidence of the tax (that is, the person on whom the tax is levied). Taxes may be borne by any of \nthe following: consumers in the form of higher prices; owners of firms in the form of lower profits; employees in the \nform of lower wages; or other suppliers to firms in the form of lower payments. This makes generalizations about \nthe incidence of taxes difficult to make. Nonetheless, two principles have general validity. First, economic incidence \ndoes not depend on whom the tax is levied. Whether the statutory incidence of the tax is on the consumer, the \nemployer, or the insurer, the economic incidence is the same regardless of who writes the check to the government. \nSecond, taxes are shifted from those who are more sensitive to price changes (economists describe these \nindividuals and entities as having more ``elastic'' supply and demand) to those who are less sensitive to price \nchanges (those with more ``inelastic'' supply and demand). In the case of competitive markets, an excise tax \ngenerally is borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher prices in the long term. An excise tax increases the \ncost of producing an additional unit, or incremental cost, of the taxed good by the amount of the tax. In a \ncompetitive market, market forces cause the after-tax price of a good to equal the additional cost of producing and \nselling another unit of the good. Competition drives the price down to equal the incremental cost of the provision of \nthe good or service, including the return to incremental invested capital. If supply is perfectly responsive to price \nchanges, any price above incremental cost would induce new firms to enter and increase production until prices \nwere bid back down to incremental cost. Similarly, any price below incremental cost would induce firms to exit or \nreduce production (because they would now be losing money selling the taxed good). The reduction in supply \nallows prices to increase back up to incremental cost. This response may be observed even if some of the \nparticipants in the competitive market do not seek to maximize profits as their primary objective. Tax-exempt and \n\n\n\nnonprofit producers may also pass on the tax as they also face the increased incremental cost, which they will need \nto recover. If they cannot, for example, raise additional funds from donors, effectively passing the tax on to them, \ntheir alternative is to pass on the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. While consumers are thought to \nbear the burden of excise taxes in competitive markets, some may question the degree of competition in health \ninsurance markets. Recent surveys have noted that many markets are characterized by the presence of only a few \nfirms. Additionally, there may exist barriers to entry in the health insurance market, including multiple State \nregulatory requirements, the cost of establishing health provider networks, health provider network effects (i.e., the \nvalue of a health provider network to consumers rises with the size of the network), and efficiencies in risk shifting \nand risk distribution for large firms. However, the absence of many competitors does not by itself imply that there is \nno competitive pressure on prices. The threat of potential entrants may provide competitive price pressure on the \nexisting firms. Furthermore, the option to self-insure may provide a source of potential competition for full, \npurchased insurance, at least for larger firms. If the insurance industry is not perfectly competitive in a particular \nmarket, the question remains as to what extent an insurance excise tax would be borne by consumers or producers \nin that market. Theoretical analysis has shown that, depending upon market conditions, the price could increase by: \n(1) more than the amount of the tax; (2) exactly the amount of the tax; or (3) less than the amount of the tax. \nVarious empirical studies have examined the effect of excise taxes on prices in less than perfectly competitive \nmarkets. Studies of the tobacco industry suggest that manufacturers pass on more than the full amount of the tax, \nwhile studies of less than perfectly competitive retail gasoline markets in rural areas suggest that producers pass on \nnearly all of the tax. Even in the rural retail gasoline markets in which gas stations may be the sole provider of \ngasoline for many miles and firms exhibit some pricing power, nearly 95 percent of the excise tax is still passed on \nto consumers. While uncertainty exists, we assume that a very large portion of the excise tax on purchased \ninsurance will be borne by consumers in most markets, including in some markets with a high level of concentration \namong market participants covered by the proposed excise tax. In the context of general health care reform \nlegislation, this assumption is further supported by the presence of an excise tax on individuals without minimum \nessential benefits coverage, which is likely to make demand for insurance somewhat less sensitive to changes in \nprice, as consumers will have to buy insurance or face a penalty. While consumers (or employers) may respond by \nchanging their insurance coverage from more expensive coverage to less expensive plans to offset any potential \nprice increase, this behavior too is properly characterized as the consumers bearing the burden of the excise tax by \naccepting lower quality (for example, a more restricted physician network) for the same price rather than paying a \nhigher price for the quality of insurance that they would prefer if there were no tax. To the extent that firms can \navoid the tax by switching from full insurance to self- insurance, this may suggest that insurers are unable to pass \non the full cost of the excise tax on purchased insurance. Increased self-insurance from firms avoiding the excise \ntax may increase the cost of this health benefit to employees as firms that previously chose full insurance, \npresumably because it cost less in the absence of the excise tax than self-insurance, switch to higher cost self-\ninsurance. Additionally, to the extent that insurers maintain some pricing power in the administrative services that \nthey provide self-insurers, the self-insurance market may bear some of the burden of the excise tax as well. effect \nof the fee on the cost of purchased health insurance The aggregate value of the proposed fee is the same for each \nyear. The current law baseline for health insurance premiums projects rising health insurance premiums annually \nthrough the budget period. Consequently the magnitude of the proposed fee declines annually relative to the sale \nof health insurance. Given the incidence analysis discussed above, while there is imcertainty, we expect a very \nlarge portion of proposed insurance industry fee to be borne by purchasers of insurance in the form of higher \npremiums. Our estimate is that the premiums for purchased health insurance policies, including the tax liability, \nwould be between 1.0 and 1.5 percent greater than they otherwise would be as a consequence of the industry fee \nfor calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012. distributional analysis of the insurance industry fee Regardless of the \ndetermination of the economic incidence of the proposed insurance industry fee of S. 1796, at the present time the \nstaff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is not able to distribute the effects across individuals on our individual tax \nmodel. The proposed insurance industry fee would apply only to the revenues from underwritten policies sold to \nthird parties. It would not apply to the value of health benefits received by individuals through their employers who \nself-insure the health risks of their employees. Our individual tax model is based upon a sample of approximately \n180,000 actual tax returns. To distribute proposed tax changes related to economic activity that is not already \nreflected on the individual tax return we impute values or statistically match supplemental information such as data \ngathered by the Census Bureau, to the individual tax returns of our model. For our quantitative analysis of \nemployer-provided health benefits we have made such imputations of data relating to employees' employer-\n\n\n\nprovided health care benefits to the individual model. These imputations are based on the data collected as part the \nMedical Expenditure Panel Survey (``MEPS''), a survey undertaken by the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality of the Department of Health and Human Services, However, the imputations we have made to the individual \ntax model at this time relate only to the value of employer expenditures for the health care of their employees. \nThese imputations do not generally distinguish between the employers' purchased insurance coverage and benefits \nfor which the employer self- insures. Consequently, we are unable to distribute either the economic incidence or the \nrevenues generated from the proposed fee of S. 1796, which applies only to purchased health insurance, I hope \nthis information is helpful to you. Please contact me if we can be of further assistance, Sincerely, Thomas A. \nBarthold. Mr. HATCH. While we are setting the record straight on ObamaCare, my colleagues on the other side \nhave repeated a particular false claim that needs correction. My Democrat friends are fond of characterizing the \nrepeal of ObamaCare as a tax cut for high-income earners and a tax increase for low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers. That claim is simply false. According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Affordable Care Act \nimposed significant and widespread tax increases on taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year, despite \nPresident Obama's repeated promises that the law would not do so. In fact, in 2017, a single provision--the \nreduction in the deductibility of catastrophic losses-- is projected to raise taxes on 13.8 million taxpaying families \nand individuals, mostly from the middle class. That is more than the number of taxpayers who receive exchange \ncredits and other premium subsidies under [[Page S1194]] current law. That is just one example. There are others. \nFortunately, we have been able to forestall the impact of a number of the ObamaCare tax provisions. We have \nfought and negotiated long and hard to do so, but virtually all of those taxes are still looming on the ObamaCare \nhorizon. Most of us on the Republican side have been fighting these taxes more or less since the day ObamaCare \nwas signed into law. We have highlighted their harmful impact on the economy and decried the crony capitalism \nthat was behind the effort to draft and enact them. Given this long history, at least in my view, it is essential that we \nrepeal all of these taxes, along with the rest of ObamaCare. It is difficult to imagine how Republicans, who are now \nin the majority in large part due to the promises we made to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, can now \nsift through ObamaCare's taxes and decide which ones are the least objectionable so that we can use them to pay \nfor our own healthcare reforms. ObamaCare isn't problematic simply because healthcare costs are not going up; it \nwas fundamentally flawed at the outset. The way the law was drafted was, and still is, a problem. The way the law \nwas negotiated--with stakeholders being played against each other--was, and still is, a problem. Of course, the way \nthe law was paid for was, and still is, a problem. The ObamaCare taxes are a big part of this equation. In my view--\nand, I think, the view of the vast majority of my Republican colleagues--they have to go. As I said, there really are \nnot widespread disagreements among Republicans on these issues. Overall, we broadly agree on the fundamental \nissues surrounding ObamaCare, and, as I noted last week, it is not all that problematic to have some differences of \nopinion on the initial stage, so long as we can overcome those differences in the end. I think we can do that. More \nimportantly, I think we will. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from \nIllinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the U.S. Senate is the nomination of Mick Mulvaney, a \nCongressman who is seeking to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. If you were to ask the \npeople of America about the Cabinet positions filled by the President, the one they probably would miss is the \nOffice of Management and Budget. It turns out to be one of the more important positions, but it is not as well known \nhistorically as Treasury Secretary, Secretary of State, and Attorney General. It is an important job. It is one of the \nmost consequential jobs because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for preparing \nthe President's budget, setting the priorities of the Federal budget, and overseeing the performance of Federal \nagencies. It is a big and challenging job. Many other nominees for positions in the Cabinet are well known and have \nbeen debated on the floor of the Senate. Today I come to say a few words about the record of this Congressman, \nMick Mulvaney, who is seeking this directorship of the Office of Management and Budget. It is a very interesting \nrecord. It is not unusual for Members of the House and the Senate to have unusual positions on issues. I guess \neach one of us has something we believe intensely that other people question. When it comes to Congressman \nMulvaney, there is a long litany of positions he has taken that are far out of the mainstream of either political party. \nYet President Donald Trump decided this is the man, this is the person he wanted to head up his budgeting effort. \nThis is the person he wants to set the priorities for spending in the United States of America during his Presidency. \nIf you look at the record of Mick Mulvaney, you will find that he has had an eagerness to dictate large and draconian \ncuts across the Federal Government in some of our most important and most cherished programs. Let me tell you \nabout a few that highlight his record in Congress. Each one of these that I will speak to, if advanced by the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget, would have far-reaching consequences on families and individuals \n\n\n\nacross the United States, not only in the operation of government but also in the effectiveness of our Federal \nworkforce. To start with--and this, I think, is the right place to start-- Congressman Mulvaney, who seeks the \nposition of Director of the Office Management and Budget, has repeatedly led efforts to shut down the Federal \nGovernment. When Mr. Mulvaney and the Republicans succeeded in shutting down the government for 16 days in \n2013, it cost the American economy $20 billion. Do you remember that? Rush Limbaugh got on his radio show and \nsaid: If they shut down the government, no one will even notice. Guess what, Mr. Limbaugh. They noticed. All \nacross America, working families paid the price for that foolish political act of shutting down the government. The \nreal cost of the government shutdown is not just measured in dollars. The real cost is in hardships unnecessarily \ncreated, hardships for Federal employees who didn't receive their checks on a timely basis, hardships for people \nstruggling to survive in America, who relied on programs like food stamps. We call them SNAP benefits now. They \nhad their food in jeopardy and endangered because Congressman Mulvaney and his friends thought that a display \nof political power--shutting down the government--was the right recipe for America. These government shutdowns \ndelayed 2 million Federal workers from receiving their checks, real people with real families to feed. Congressman \nMulvaney doesn't seem to care about these real-world consequences of a shutdown. Instead, he called the \nshutdown of the Federal Government ``good policy.'' Those are his words: ``good policy.'' Then, when we finally \nreached an agreement to reopen the government, he was one of the few Members of the House to vote against the \ncompromise in reopening the government. In recent years, he has repeated his calls. He is willing to shut down the \ngovernment of the United States of America to defund Planned Parenthood. This man wants to craft our national \nbudget, and he would shut down the government over one provision in that budget? That is what he said. Time \nand again, he has taken extreme positions on the Federal budget. We have a standing tradition in the House and \nthe Senate. Since not one of us can predict when the next natural disaster is going to occur, we try to help one \nanother. I have voted for funds during the course of my congressional career for disasters in probably every State in \nthe union. Do you know why? Because I knew the day would come--and it did, several times during my tenure in \nthe House and Senate--when there would be a natural disaster in my State, and we needed a helping hand, \nemergency disaster assistance. That is a tradition which has been around Congress--I can go back almost \ncenturies to see it in past history. Listen to what Congressman Mulvaney did. He tried to block emergency disaster \nassistance to States that desperately needed the help of the Federal Government in their recovery efforts. He \noffered a poison pill amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief package that would have required across-the-board \ncuts in military spending--military spending--to pay for disaster relief from Hurricane Sandy. Then he went further \nand said: Not just military spending, I want cuts in entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid. Let's cut the \nhealthcare assistance for Americans to pay for that disaster. That is his idea of social justice. Despite President \nTrump's campaign promises to rebuild the Nation's crumbling infrastructure, Congressman Mick Mulvaney has \ntaken an extraordinary and extreme view. He wants to eliminate Federal funding for transportation projects. He \ncosponsored a bill that would slash the Federal gas tax. That is how we pay for repairing Federal roads and mass \ntransit across America. He isn't interested in fixing the highway trust fund solvency problems. His solution is to \nbankrupt it. This is the man who wants to write the budget for America? His extreme ideology would threaten \nbillions of dollars that my State receives in Federal transportation funds. We put money into the Federal highway \ntrust fund, [[Page S1195]] too, every time we buy a gallon of gas in Illinois. He would cut back on the resources \ncoming back to my State and others to repair the very roads we drive on. He has consistently supported across-the-\nboard cuts for the Department of Defense, regardless of those affected. Just a few minutes ago, Senator John \nMcCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, came to the floor to announce that because of Congressman Mulvaney's \npositions on cuts in the military, he--Senator McCain--would oppose the appointment of Mulvaney as head of OMB. \nSenator McCain said that it is a rare day when he comes out against a Presidential nominee of his own party. But \nhe thinks Mulvaney's record is worrisome, and I couldn't agree more. The positions that Congressman Mulvaney \nhas taken are reckless and would jeopardize the economic security of working families and put our Nation and \neconomy at risk. Possibly one of the most troubling positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken is the fact that \nhe is opposed to the Federal Government spending funds for medical research. Last year when Congress was \ndeliberating how to combat the Zika virus, Representative Mulvaney wrote this on his Facebook page: ``Do we \nreally need government-funded research at all?'' Let's think about that for a moment. Do we really need \ngovernment- funded medical research in the United States? Do we need the National Institutes of Health, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Veterans' Administration investing in trying to find new cures for diseases? \nGovernment-funded research in the Department of Defense has produced fascinating insights into the biology of \nbreast cancer that have greatly impacted the treatment of that disease and saved lives in America. Look at the \n\n\n\nrevolutionary Department of Defense-funded work that led to the development of the innovative drug Herceptin. \nGovernment-funded research, which Congressman Mulvaney does not believe we should do, at the National \nInstitutes of Health has accomplished the following. It has cut the U.S. cancer death rate by 11 percent in women \nand 19 percent in men. And Congressman Mulvaney says: Do we really need to do that? Is that important? I would \nguess that his family, like every family in America, has a story to tell about cancer--what it has meant, the \ndevastation it has created, the deaths that have resulted. But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it. He just doesn't \nunderstand anything as basic as investing in medical research to save lives. HIV/ AIDS is no longer a death \nsentence in America. I saw Magic Johnson just a few weeks ago at a farewell party for President Obama. I \nremembered the day in the House of Representatives when I was told that he had AIDS. We assumed he would die \nin just a short period of time. But that was over 25 years ago. He has survived because of research that was done \nat the National Institutes of Health, and he is not alone. There are thousands just like him. When I was a kid, polio \nwas something every mother and father were frightened of. What in the world was happening? How could your child \nbe infected with polio and end up being crippled for life? Our Republican leader here, Mitch McConnell, went \nthrough that in his childhood and has talked about that episode in his life and how devastating it was. He has had a \nfull life since then, but he has overcome the problems of that disease. I remember as a kid in grade school, when \nthey announced that our government research had come up with a vaccine that would protect kids from polio. That, \nto me, was a breakthrough, and one that I welcomed and our family welcomed. Congressman Mulvaney questions \nwhether or not medical research should continue, even in the light of the achievements in eradicating polio and \nsmall pox and other diseases in our country. These advances didn't just magically happen because of the miracle of \nthe marketplace. They occurred because of sustained taxpayer investment in Federal medical research. I will tell \nyou this. If he wants to make a referendum in the Senate or the House on medical research a part of his budget \ndebate, I welcome the challenge. I believe that Members of both political parties would stand up for medical \nresearch, despite Congressman Mulvaney's extreme positions. So when someone asks if we really need \ngovernment-funded medical research, the answer on behalf of cancer patients who are beating the disease, on \nbehalf of HIV/AIDS patients who are living longer and normal lives, on behalf of all those families hoping and \npraying that some Federal researcher will come up with a breakthrough for Alzheimer's, for autism, or Parkinson's \nor diabetes--the answer, Congressman Mulvaney, is unequivocally, yes. America needs to invest in medical \nresearch. And the fact that you would question it really raises the question of your judgment. Let me tell you another \nthing that he is for, which I think is the single most irresponsible budgetary position he has taken. He has been an \nopponent of raising the country's debt ceiling. What is the debt ceiling? That is America's mortgage. That is the \namount of debt we incur as a nation. It is a mortgage that is incurred for things that we have already spent money \non. So when we come and vote for $600 billion for the Department of Defense and the intelligence agencies and we \ndon't have enough money coming in taxes to pay for it, we have to extend America's mortgage to cover it. \nCongressman Mulvaney says that is the wrong thing to do--extending the debt ceiling of this country. While running \nfor Congress, Congressman Mulvaney, who now wants to manage our Nation's budget, pledged he would never \never vote to raise the country's debt ceiling. He voted against it four different times. In 2011, when we were just \nabout to breach the debt limit and default on our national debt for the first time in the history of our country, \nMulvaney was a leading voice in support of default. He called it a ``fabricated crisis,'' and accused both parties of \n``fear mongering.'' I am not sure what is more disturbing--Mr. Mulvaney's willingness to default on our country's \nobligations, the full faith and credit of the United States, or his lack of appreciation for the devastating economic \nconsequences which would follow. I can tell you what is at risk with that kind of reckless attitude toward our Nation's \ndebt. What is at risk are the savings and investments and retirement accounts of ordinary Americans across the \nNation. Mr. Mulvaney may be willing to gamble the full faith and credit of the United States; I am not. Forcing the \nFederal Government to default on the Nation's debt would harm the economy and affect the government's ability to \nmake payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, military personnel, veterans, Federal employees, \ndefense contractors, State governments, and to the bondholders of the United States, here and overseas. We \nwould lose our credibility if Mr. Mulvaney had his way and allowed us to default on our national debt. We should not \never consider confirming an OMB Director who has repeatedly risked the economic security of our Nation to score \npolitical, rhetorical points. Throughout his campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare and Social \nSecurity and make decisions that would ``benefit American workers and American families.'' That is a quote. \nHowever, instead of making good on the promise, President Trump has chosen a man to head the Office of \nManagement and Budget who has led calls for devastating cuts to Federal programs that millions of Americans \nrely on every day. Mr. Mulvaney has said he wants to ``end Medicare as we know it,'' and he has called Social \n\n\n\nSecurity a ``Ponzi scheme.'' He has called for raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70, from the 67 that it \ncurrently is. Well, 3 more years at work may not mean much to a Member of Congress, because we sit down a lot in \nthese comfortable chairs and people bring us things when we need them. But 3 more years of working before you \nqualify for Social Security means something to a waitress, whose hips and ankles and knees have been bothering \nher for years, but she has no choice but to get up every morning, go to work, carry those trays, and try to bring \nenough money home to help a family. It means something to someone who works in a coal mine--I guarantee you \nthat--3 more years at work, exposing yourself to the lung diseases and other things [[Page S1196]] that might come \nwith the job. It means something to a truckdriver, spending days and nights on the road. It means something to \npeople who have to move freight around. It is the kind of thing that means a lot to ordinary working people. It clearly \ndoesn't mean anything to Congressman Mulvaney. Three more years working, as far as he is concerned, is an \nacceptable alternative. He wants to privatize Medicare and turn Medicare back into the loving arms of private health \ninsurance companies, and let's see what seniors end up experiencing. Almost 60 million Americans now rely on \nMedicare. In Congressman Mulvaney's point of view, the guarantee of Medicare would end. This is the man \nPresident Trump has chosen to head the budget for the United States of America. Mulvaney has called repeatedly \nfor cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, including a ``cut, cap, and balance'' budget, which would cut \neach of these programs by 25 percent. When you say the word Medicaid, people have an image in their mind: Oh, \nthat is health insurance for poor people. And that is generally correct, although it also covers disabled Americans. \nBut do you know who the major recipients of Medicaid are in America? The largest single group of people receiving \nhelp from Medicaid are children--children in poor, low-income families who get medical care through Medicaid. \nThe biggest expenditure for Medicaid is not children though. The biggest expenditure is for the elderly Americans \nwho are living largely at institutional settings, in these care homes, nursing homes. Medicaid keeps them in that \nplace with adequate medical care. So now comes Congressman Mulvaney and says: Let's just cut those by 25 \npercent. There is one good way to reduce Federal spending. Really? So that means fewer immunizations for \nchildren. What does it mean for your mother or your grandmother in the nursing home when it is announced that we \ndon't have enough money to cover the cost to keep her here in a good, safe, positive environment? For \nCongressman Mulvaney, it is just numbers on paper. For real families across America, it is the reality of life. Much \nlike our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price, Representative Mulvaney wants to \ndramatically undermine the Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors. Let's look at what Medicare has meant to \nour country since it was created in 1965. Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health \ncare coverage. Nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. Today, 98 percent of seniors have health care, and less than 10 \npercent live below the poverty line. Has Medicare work? You bet it has. It has provided health insurance for seniors, \nand it has given people dignity and independence in their senior years--something that everyone should value. And, \nincidentally, the life expectancy of Americans has grown by 5 years since we created Medicare. It is working. \nMedicare helps seniors, helps their families, and it helps America. But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it. This \nman has been chosen by President Trump to write the budget of America. Why is Congressman Mulvaney so hell-\nbent on ending a program like Medicare that 98 percent of our Nation's seniors depend on? Well, I can tell you, if \nhis comments on Medicare scare you, on Medicaid he is even worse. This program, combined with the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, ensures health coverage for 70 million Americans. One out of every five nationwide \ndepend on Medicaid. It helps low- income families, pregnant women, children, and those with disabilities. Currently, \nif you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed to get health coverage. Congressman Mulvaney thinks he has a \nbetter idea. He wants to change that. Congressman Mulvaney wants to significantly cut the Federal funding for \nMedicaid and leave States to fend for themselves when it comes to caring for these 70 million Americans. Faced \nwith less Federal funding, States would be forced to find ways to cut spending and save money. They might start \nMedicaid waiting lists or impose work requirements or slash benefits. At the end of the day, the result would be \ncatastrophic. I just spent the last weekend in Southern Illinois. We had a roundtable down there to talk about the \nimpact of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. These hospital administrators from smalltown hospitals came in to \ntell me that losing Medicaid reimbursement could force them to dramatically cut their workforce and maybe even \nface closure. Here is Congressman Mulvaney suggesting: Let's just do that across America. I wonder where he \nlives. I wonder if there are any small towns or rural areas near him. I wonder if he values those hospitals the way \nthe people living in communities that I represent value them. These are not only lifelines for people who desperately \nneed timely, professional medical care, but they are the source of the best jobs in the community. Congressman \nMulvaney could care less: Let's just keep cutting on Medicaid and see what happens. What will happen will be \ndevastating. Mr. Mulvaney isn't content with just throwing seniors off Medicare and low-income families off \n\n\n\nMedicaid. He wants to punish women by taking away their healthcare providers and inserting his own decisions \ninto their medical decisions. Mr. Mulvaney has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, \nwhich provide women and men with important cancer screenings, family planning, STD testing, and other important \nhealth care services. The laws of the United States of America provide that not one penny can be given to Planned \nParenthood for abortion services--not one penny under the law. Most people, if asked what percentage of the \nPlanned Parenthood budget is actually spent on abortion services would get it wrong. The actual number is 3 \npercent. Ninety-seven percent of what Planned Parenthood does, in terms of family planning, cancer screening, \nSTD screening, has no relation directly to abortion services, and that is compensated, but abortion services are not \nunder the law. Congressman Mulvaney could care less. He would close down the sources of family planning in \nsmall towns and communities around America. The concerns I have laid out today are just a few that I have about \nthis nomination. The millions of hard-working Americans who believed President Trump's campaign promises, and \nas a champion for the most vulnerable, deserve far better than Congressman Mulvaney. There are real problems \nfacing this Nation. Far too many people are struggling, and there is a lot of work to do. We cannot afford to risk our \neconomic recovery, the retirement plans and savings of working Americans, the health of our children, the kind of \ncare we want for our mothers and grandmothers--we cannot afford to risk them by appointing OMB Director Mick \nMulvaney. I have no choice but to oppose Mick Mulvaney's nomination for Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget. Mr. President, Mick Mulvaney is a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, which has made repeal of \nthe Affordable Care Act--without a replacement--one of their main causes. This is not about good policy or the real \nconsequences for people around the country. This is about ideology. Mr. Mulvaney wants to rip health insurance \naway from nearly 30 million people and deny people the important consumer protections they have come to depend \nupon. He would once again allow insurers to impose pre-existing condition exclusions and discriminate based on \ngender and cut off coverage when someone gets sick and needs it most. His answer to fixing our health care \nsystem is ``free-market competition'' and ``crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. Those might make good talking points, \nbut they will not stabilize our insurance market and help people in need. The Illinois Hospital Association estimates \nthat Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in the loss of up to 95,000 jobs in Illinois--in \nhospitals, doctor's offices, construction, real estate, and beyond. Over the last month, I have been going around my \nState, meeting with hospitals and providers, talking to them about what repeal would mean. They are worried. You \nsee, Illinois hospitals and health systems generate nearly $90 billion in the State and local economies each year, \nand 1 in 10 jobs in Illinois is in [[Page S1197]] health care. Hospitals are vitally important to our State's economy \nand vitally important to patients in need. Don't just take my word for it, Franklin Hospital CEO, Jim Johnson told me: \nIn our community, at the time that the hospital in West Frankfort closed, we [Franklin Hospital in Benton] managed \nto stay open . . . they're just eaten up that they don't have a hospital anymore. It's incredible what the loss of a \nhospital can do to a small community. And I'm down there talking to those guys every day because naturally I like \nthem to use our hospital . . . but those conversations, it has just torn this community apart. In Illinois and nationwide, \nrural hospitals would be particularly hurt by Mr. Mulvaney and Republicans' prescription for chaos. In Illinois, 62 of \nour 102 counties are rural. We have 51 Critical Access Hospitals, which are the hubs of their communities. Rural \nhospitals typically are more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, and have tighter operating margins. So what has the \nACA meant for them? In States that expanded Medicaid, like Illinois, rural hospitals have seen greater financial \nstability thanks to the decrease in uncompensated care--or charity care--costs. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, \nthe uninsured rate in rural communities has dropped by nearly 40 percent. This is not only great for those \nindividuals obtaining insurance, it is also great for the rural hospitals who are now getting paid for the health \nservices they provide. Community Health & Emergency Services CEO Fred Bernstein told me: You can look at \nCairo as the ghost of the future. Because there is not much left that we have to lose . . . We've lost the only grocery \nstore, and the only drug store in Cairo. If this Affordable Care Act thing isn't resolved and if we go to block grant in \nthe Medicaid program, there's not going to be any resolution to those problems down there. We are not going to be \nable to stay open. At least 72-74 percent of my patients depend upon Medicaid . . . Without the expansions of \nMedicaid that we've already seen, and without some of the subsidies that those who can get some insurance will \nget to keep that insurance, there's not going to be the ability to afford any care for most of the people we serve. \nSince 2009, the number of rural hospitals in Illinois operating in the red has decreased by 46 percent. Put another \nway, 16 rural hospitals in Illinois are now on much more solid financial footing thanks to the ACA. I yield the floor. \nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Tax Reform Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, our Tax Code is \na mess. No one voted for it, no one wants it, and no one likes it. I have said many times we should eliminate all of \nthe special interest loopholes in the code and use that money to cut taxes for everyone, including American \n\n\n\nbusinesses. We want to encourage them to invest, grow, and create more jobs right here in America. I know my \ncolleagues are working on a tax bill, and I want to stress how much I support their efforts. I will, of course, withhold \njudgment on any proposal until I see the final text, but I also want to say today, I have reservations about one idea \nthat is being considered. It is called a border adjustment tax. It sounds like something from Orwell's Newspeak. \nHere is how it would work. We would cut taxes for corporations. To make up for the lost revenue, we would tax \nbusinesses whenever they bought something from another country. For instance, every time Ford bought an auto \npart from Canada, it would pay a 20-percent tax or every time your local grocery store bought bananas from \nGuatemala, it would pay a 20-percent tax. Whatever money businesses made from selling their products in other \ncountries would be exempt. In other words, what all this would amount to is a 20-percent tax on imports. The \nproponents of this tax contend it would stop businesses from leaving our country because right now some are \nmoving overseas to avoid paying our corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the modern industrial world. Under \nthis proposal, it would not matter where you put your headquarters, you would be taxed according to what you \nbought, not where you put down your stake. The hope is, this arrangement would mean more headquarters, more \nfactories and the jobs that come with them staying right here in America, which of course is a desirable goal, no \ndoubt, but I am not at all convinced this is the best way to do it. Consider this. It is estimated that this one change \nalone would produce something like $100 billion a year in additional tax revenue. That is a lot of money, and \nsomeone has to pay for it. I will tell you exactly who is going to pay: working Americans who have been struggling \nfor decades. A tax on imports is a tax on things working folks buy every single day. I am not talking about caviar \nand champagne. I am talking about T-shirts, jeans, shoes, baby clothes, toys, and groceries. I have heard from \nthousands of Arkansans who are already struggling just to get by. Why would we make the stuff they get at Walmart \nmore expensive? Its defenders say the tax will not increase the cost of imports. What will happen, they say, is our \nexports will be cheaper because we no longer tax them so then more people overseas will buy our exports from us, \nwhich means the dollar itself will increase in value. That means imports will not be expensive because you will be \nable to buy them with a stronger dollar. So even with the tax added on, you will still come out right where you were \nbefore. This logic reminds me of Orwell again: Some ideas are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them. \nThis is a theory wrapped in speculation inside a guess. Nobody knows for sure what will happen. No one can know \nfor sure because currency markets fluctuate daily based on millions of decisions and events. Just because an \neconomist slaps an equation on a blackboard does not make it real so I am more than a little concerned these \npredictions will not pan out. As the old joke goes, after all, economists have predicted nine of the last five \nrecessions. But if that happens, it will not be economists and intellectuals and politicians in Washington and New \nYork left holding the bag; working Americans will get stiffed again. Finally, I want to say a word about jobs. One of \nthe biggest reasons for fixing the Tax Code is that it would help create more jobs, but if we increase the cost of \ngoods, people obviously can't buy as much, which will hurt retail sales and retail jobs too. Retail companies are the \nlargest private sector employers in almost every State. Are we really going to impose a huge tax on the livelihood of \nso many Americans and say: Oh, don't worry. It will all work out in the end. We have to take a hard look at this \nproposal right now. Therefore, while I support fundamental tax reform and commit to reserve judgment on any final \nbill until I read it, today I want to put on the record my serious concerns about a border adjustment tax. Many other \nSenators share those concerns. We most certainly will not keep our powder dry and see working American's \nrailroaded with a precooked deal that raises their taxes and increases the price of the stuff they buy every single \nday. It is February 15. By law, the President is required to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of this \nmonth. That was over a week ago. Now, being a new administration, we expect him to be a few weeks late as has \ntypically happened in recent times. The difference this year, though, is that President Trump still does not have a \nbudget director. We are 4 weeks into his Presidency, and we are only just now getting around to confirming his \nnominee. For those of you keeping score at home, that is the longest delay in recent history. Every one of the last \nsix Presidents had their budget director confirmed by a week's time--as in 7 days. In other words, what we are \nseeing is a deliberate act of obstruction. Here is the real problem. We have serious work to do. It is that much more \ndifficult for the President to do his job when all he has is a headless horseman bureaucracy. Senate Democrats \nmight consider this payback. They might consider it their chance to audition for the 2020 Presidential primary, but \nthe American people are the ones paying the price for this obstruction. I want to say again, this is not a game. This \nis not a protest. This is our job. This is what the American people sent us to do. It is time we got down to business. \nIn that spirit, I want to say a few words in support of the President's [[Page S1198]] nominee for the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney. I don't have to cite or recite Mick's biography for many of you. \nHe has been representing the good people of South Carolina's Fifth District in the House of Representatives for \n\n\n\nmore than 6 years now. Before that, he led an impressive career as what he called a serial entrepreneur, starting \nfour different businesses. I hear some of them may have even succeeded. He has worked in fields as varied as law, \nreal estate, homebuilding, and restaurants. He is highly educated and very accomplished. I would like to point out, \nhe is a friend of mine, a trusted confidant, someone whose advice and counsel I have often sought. I can say with \nconfidence, he will serve President Trump and the American people with dedication and distinction. I believe Mick \nwill bring a needed voice to the President's Cabinet, a voice for fiscal responsibility after so many years of \nirresponsible sky-is-the-limit spending. All that experience in the real economy gives him something more than a \nlengthy resume. He knows from personal experience what it takes to create jobs and create opportunities out of \nalmost nothing. He knows the self-discipline it takes, the hard work, the perseverance. He knows what Americans \nhave to go through every day just to earn an honest dollar. That is why he has been so protective of every taxpayer \ndollar ever put in his care. That is the kind of man we need as our next OMB Director. It is only when Washington \nappreciates what goes into making all of those taxpayer dollars that it will show the taxpayers the respect they \ndeserve. I want to express my strong support for the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget, my \nfriend, Mick Mulvaney. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. \nSHAHEEN. Mr. President, unfortunately I don't share the enthusiasm of my colleague from Arkansas for Mick \nMulvaney to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, I have great concerns about \nthis nominee's views on a whole range of issues. Because those views are far outside the mainstream of this \ncountry, I intend to vote against his confirmation. First and foremost, I am concerned about Mick Mulvaney's \nrepeated votes against raising the debt ceiling and his reckless willingness to shut down the government in order to \nadvance his extreme views. It is Representative Mulvaney's longstanding position that failure to raise the debt \nceiling would not precipitate a crisis. He said: ``I have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative \nconsequences.'' Well, let me articulate the consequences in very simple terms. If we refuse to raise the debt ceiling, \nwe would default on the national debt, destroy the credit worthiness of the U.S. Government, and trigger a global \nfinancial crisis. As the Governor of New Hampshire, I worked very hard with our State treasurer and with the \nlegislature, through some very challenging fiscal times, to maintain New Hampshire's State bond rating. We did that \nbecause we knew that lowering the State's bond rating would mean an increase in costs for businesses trying to \nborrow money, for the government trying to borrow money, for taxpayers because they would have to pay those \nincreased costs, and it would have a ripple effect across the economy that would have a real impact on the people \nof New Hampshire. Representative Mulvaney does not seem to appreciate what would happen if the Federal \nGovernment defaulted on our debt. He has argued that the Treasury Secretary could avoid such a crisis by \nprioritizing interest payments; in other words, paying foreign holders of U.S. debt but not Social Security \nbeneficiaries or the men and women of our Armed Forces, but there is no legal authority to do this. It is impractical, \nand recent Treasury Secretaries have denounced the idea. We got a foretaste of the consequences of default in \n2011, when Representative Mulvaney and others blocked legislation to raise the debt ceiling, a crisis that took \nnearly 3 months to resolve. That manufactured crisis shook financial markets, caused a spike in interest rates on \nU.S. securities, and it lead Standard and Poor's to take away America's AAA credit rating, and it cost $18.9 billion. \nWho does Mick Mulvaney think paid those $18.9 billion? It was the people of this country. Representative Mulvaney \nhas repeatedly threatened to shut down the Federal Government. He helped lead the charge in shutting down the \ngovernment in October of 2013 in a failed and misguided attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In 2015, he \nthreatened to shut down the government again in order to defund Planned Parenthood. Both of those programs are \ncritically important to the people of New Hampshire. Nearly 1 out of 10 Granite Staters have health insurance \nthanks to the Affordable Care Act. Planned Parenthood provides accessible, affordable healthcare to women all \nacross the State of New Hampshire, women who, in most cases, could not get their healthcare any other way. As \nSenator Durbin pointed out earlier, 97 percent of the services provided by Planned Parenthood are services that \nhave nothing to do with abortion; they have to do with access to mammograms, to cancer screenings, to STD \ntesting, the whole range of healthcare services that women need. Unfortunately, the 16-day shutdown in 2013 \ncreated havoc across the economy, leading to the loss of an estimated 120,000 jobs. Millions of small businesses \nfaced significant disruptions, many employees were laid off, and some businesses could not make payroll. But \nRepresentative Mulvaney is unrepentant. He insists that the shutdown was worth it. Well, tell that to some of the \nbusinesses in New Hampshire that took a huge hit. His brand of government by temper tantrum is reckless, it is \nirresponsible, and it should not be rewarded with a nomination to be the chief budget officer for the country. \nRepresentative Mulvaney's disdain for true fiscal conservatism and his unbalanced budget priorities should also \ngive us pause. He supports budgets that would provide massive tax cuts for corporations, for those at the top, and \n\n\n\nhe would pair those with deep budget cuts for the middle class and the most vulnerable people in our society, \nincluding seniors and people with disabilities. Representative Mulvaney advocates for radical cuts to Social \nSecurity and to Medicare and Medicaid. He has promised to end Medicare as we know it, privatizing it and \nconverting it to a voucher program that shifts costs to seniors. He advocates raising the retirement age to 70 for \nSocial Security and 67 for Medicare. Imagine telling construction workers and others who perform heavy labor that \nthey have to work until age 70 before they can retire with the security of a Social Security check. He also advocates \nshifting costs to States by block-granting Medicaid. Essentially what block grants do is give the money to States \nand allow them to administer those dollars. As a former Governor, I think States can administer those dollars, but \nwhen you want to cut as much as $1 trillion from healthcare services, which is what Mick Mulvaney wants to do, \nthen you can administer them as well as possible, but you are still not going to be able to make up to the seniors \nand to disabled Americans and others in nursing homes for the cuts that are going to come when you block-grant \nthose dollars to States. Unfortunately, that is not the end of his extreme budget ideas. He advocates taking a meat-\nax to the whole range of programs that bolster the middle class, everything from cancer research, to Pell grants, to \nhealthcare. Representative Mulvaney has even questioned the appropriateness of Federal funding for scientific \nresearch. In a Facebook post questioning the scientific consensus linking the Zika virus to microcephaly, he wrote: \n``What might be the best question: Do we really need government funded research at all?'' Think about that. \nSenator Durbin was very eloquent in talking about the difference that research has made in ending polio and \naddressing so many other diseases, such as HIV, that have affected Americans and people across the world. Well, \nthe President's choice--Mick Mulvaney--to draft his annual budget, to be the head of his budget office, openly \ndoubts that the government should be involved in addressing public [[Page S1199]] health threats, such as Zika. So \nhow deeply does he plan to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control, for the National Institutes of Health, for \nour National Laboratories, and for federally funded extramural research? We don't know the answer to that, but we \ncan assume from his statements that it is going to be significant. Federally funded R&D is critical not only to \naddressing threats to public health but also to developing new technologies that enhance our national security and \nprotect the environment. These technologies are essential to growing our economy and maintaining America's \nglobal leadership in technology and biomedical sciences. In New Hampshire, the most dynamic sector of our \neconomy is high-tech manufacturing and innovation. For our economy to grow, we need to stay ahead of global \ncompetition. But that doesn't happen on its own; it requires sustained investment in basic research--often research \nthat the private sector considers too risky to do on its own. As ranking member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, I have seen this vividly demonstrated by the very successful Small Business Innovation Research \nProgram, or SBIR. SBIR works by harnessing the creativity and ingenuity of America's small businesses to meet \nthe R&D missions of our Federal agencies, while also supporting the growth of small, high-tech companies that \ncreate good jobs in local communities across this country. One recent study found that every dollar awarded by the \nAir Force to SBIR firms generated $12 in economic growth. That growth happens because small businesses \ndevelop technologies and then commercialize those technologies, creating good jobs in each of our States. Many of \nthese technologies are developed for our Armed Forces to better protect the homeland. A great example of that, \nwhich I have seen firsthand, is a company based in Hanover, NH, called Creare. Creare is working with the Navy to \ndevelop an innovative clothes dryer that dramatically reduces the risk of fires on submarines, and that is just one \nexample of why the SBIR Program is the envy of the world. I want to quote Dr. Charles Wessner, who led the \nNational Academy of Sciences study of the SBIR Program. In describing that program, he said: ``The rest of the \nworld thinks this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.'' Well, make no mistake, this successful program is in \nserious jeopardy if Representative Mulvaney puts Federal R&D investments on the chopping block. It is truly \nshocking that the President has nominated a budget director who questions the value of Federal funding for R&D. \nWe need to invest in science. We need to invest in our small businesses, which create two out of every three jobs in \nthis economy. The OMB Director is one of the most senior economic advisers to the President of the United States, \nwith enormous influence on policy matters. Representative Mulvaney has been a zealous advocate for radical cuts \nto Social Security, to Medicaid, to the whole range of programs that support the middle class in this country. In \naddition, his willful failure to pay required Federal taxes has raised serious concerns about his integrity, which we all \nknow is essential for every Cabinet officer. After careful study of his record, I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to come together to reject this nominee. Putting Mick Mulvaney in charge of OMB is not just letting the fox \nguard the hen house; it is giving him a gun to kill the chickens, a pot to boil those chickens in, and a knife to \neviscerate them when they are done. Let's give President Trump the opportunity to put forward a qualified \ncandidate with mainstream views to protect the middle class and to honor this Nation's financial obligations. Mr. \n\n\n\nPresident, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Wisconsin. Mr. JOHNSON. \nMr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney and ask my colleagues to vote \nto confirm him as the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It may not surprise folks that I have a \nmarkedly different viewpoint than the Senator from New Hampshire. Congressman Mulvaney wants to save Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent, stop the mortgaging of our children's future, the \nbankrupting of America. One thing on which I do agree with the good Senator from New Hampshire is that we need \nto concentrate on economic growth. It is the primary component of the solution. But this Nation faces many, many \nchallenges. From the standpoint of foreign policy, take a look at what is happening around the world, the turmoil in \nso much of the world. We are in a generational struggle against Islamic terror, against ISIS, al-Qaida. Iran--that \nnuclear agreement was horrible. It modified the behavior for the worse. We have just witnessed North Korea test-\nfire another missile. Combined with their nuclear capability at some point in time--probably not in the too distant \nfuture--they will threaten America. China has been emboldened. Russia has become more aggressive. Why? \nBecause in so many instances, these nations perceive America as weaker than we once were, lacking the strength \nand resolve to provide the leadership, project our values around the world. With all these threats that America \nfaces, at the same time our military is being hollowed out. We won't have the resources militarily to fight back if they \nstrike first. Domestically, we also face many perils, many challenges. ObamaCare didn't work. The Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act did not protect the patients. It is not affordable. In my State, Wisconsin, \npremiums on the individual market have doubled and tripled. A young mother working a part-time job so she could \nstay home with her children had to quit that job to take full-time work to pay her $8,000 per year increase in \npremiums. Wages have stagnated for years. Our infrastructure is old and in many cases, crumbling. Our borders \nare porous. We are not winning the War on Drugs because of porous borders in many respects. Unfortunately, the \nWar on Poverty has also not been won. In many cases, it has created perverse incentives that have trapped \ngenerations in a cycle of poverty and dependency and despair. It has resulted in the national debt rapidly \napproaching $20 trillion. Again, that is that mortgaging our children's future that Congressman Mulvaney wants to \nprevent. As the chart nearby shows, we are on a completely unsustainable path that Congressman Mulvaney also \nunderstands must be stopped. If you take a look at this chart, according to the Congressional Budget Office, over \nthe next 30 years, our projected deficit will total $103 trillion. That would be put on top of that $20 trillion in debt. It \nwill be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, $28 trillion in the second decade, $66 trillion in the third decade. That is \ncompletely unsustainable. By the way, the components of that $103 trillion deficit--$14 trillion in Social Security. In \nother words, Social Security will pay out $14 trillion more in benefits than it takes in from the payroll tax over the \nnext 30 years; Medicare, $34 trillion. The remainder of that $103 trillion is interest on the debt. If we want to avoid \npaying creditors more than $50 trillion in interest on our debt over the next 30 years, we need to address Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Congressman Mulvaney wants to do that. He wants to save Social Security and Medicare--\nnot demagogue it; save it. As the Senator from New Hampshire was pointing out, we need economic growth. That \nis the No. 1 component of the solution. I don't care what problem I just mentioned above, economic growth is the \nprimary component of the solution. What is hampering our economy from growing? The fact is, since the Great \nDepression, our economy has averaged 3.2 percent annual real growth. Since the great recession, we have only \nbeen growing about 2 percent. I would argue that there are a number factors causing that tepid growth: \noverregulation, an uncompetitive tax system. We are not fully utilizing our energy resources. The Presiding Officer \ncertainly understands that from his State. We are not utilizing our abundant energy resources. And of course there \nis this: our unsustained fiscal path, our $20 trillion in debt. I oftentimes make the analogy between our national debt \nand a family in debt over their head. It is just a nation-state; it is just many, many, many [[Page S1200]] orders of \nmagnitude larger. But the fact is, if you are a family in debt over your head, how can you grow your personal \neconomy? All your disposable income is spent on the basics and servicing the debt. The same thing is true of a \nnation-state. Again, our enemies perceive that weakness caused by our indebtedness. So when you take a look at \nthe role of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, what we need to do to grow our economy comes \nunder his jurisdiction basically. He has to address this deficit. He has to put forward a budget that is sustainable. \nMick Mulvaney is dedicated to doing that. Then, of course, the other thing the Office of Management and Budget is \nreally designed to combat is overregulation. They are all about taking a look at cost-benefit and making sure the \nregulations that are implemented by this Federal Government are reasonable from a cost- benefit relationship. That \nhas not been the case recently. Just a couple of examples of how economic growth really is going to help solve this \nproblem. If you go from 2 to 3 percent annual growth, that is $14 trillion in added economic benefit in just over a \ndecade. If you go from 2 to 4 percent, that is $29 trillion. And even with the meager economic growth we have had \n\n\n\nsince 2009, revenue to the Federal Government has increased by more than $1.1 trillion per year with meager \neconomic growth. Just think of what would happen if we could reduce the regulatory burden, have a competitive tax \nsystem, and put our Federal Government on a sustainable fiscal path. Revenue would be flowing to the Federal \nGovernment, we could stop hollowing out our military, and we could start addressing these threats. As to the \nregulatory burden, when we held hearings on this in my committee, the numbers showed that regulatory burden at \n$2 trillion per year. Just put that into perspective because I know we are getting immune to these massive numbers: \n$2 trillion is larger than all but 10 economies in the entire world. That is a self-imposed, self-inflicted wound on our \neconomy. If you take that $2 trillion and divide it by the number of households in America, it is $14,800 per \nhousehold. No American writes a check to the Federal Government to pay their share of the regulatory burden; \ninstead, they realize that burden in reduced opportunities. Why are wages stagnated? That is a good part of it--\nincreased prices, and of course, again, those lower wages. It is a massive problem. One Wisconsin paper \nmanufacturer I was talking to--and by the way, I can't tell you who because he fears retaliation by the government, \nwhich is a different subject--did a cost calculation of just four recently issued regulations and came up with a total \ncost of $12,000 per year per employee. There you go. That is money that could have been available for increasing \nwages or for investing in business to create better opportunities and better paying jobs. The regulatory burden is \nmassive. I had the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come into my office during the last 2 years \nwith the primary complaint--the primary ask--being to reduce that regulatory burden. Last year, she came in armed \nwith a study commissioned by research universities that said that 42 percent of researcher time on Federal grants \nwas spent complying with Federal regulations. Think of the opportunity cost of that overregulation. Those Federal \ngrants are meant to pay for studies and doing research on curing diseases, not filling out Federal paperwork. So \nagain, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will take a look at those regulations, particularly now \nunder this President, who has issued an Executive order to make sure that for every one regulation issued by a new \nagency, they have to remove two. That is a very good start. I would have gone with one-in, ten-out, but I will settle \nfor one-in, two-out. I will certainly be supportive of an Office of Management and Budget that understands the \nincredible burden of overregulation on our economy. During our committee markup--I heard earlier the Senator from \nArkansas, who knows Congressman Mulvaney, served with him in the House, and understands how dedicated and \nserious Congressman Mulvaney is to stopping this mortgage of our children's future. Senator Lankford also had the \nopportunity to serve 4 years in the House with Representative Mulvaney. This is what Senator Lankford had to say \nabout his friend and colleague at the nomination hearing: You were a serious student. You looked hard at difficult \nissues. You understood that there were difficult decisions that needed to be made and made proposals to do that. \nIn testimony before our committee, Congressman Mulvaney told my committee: When President-elect Trump \nannounced my nomination, he noted that our nation was nearly $20 trillion in debt and stated that I have the skills \nand convictions to responsibly manage our nation's finances. I believe that is why he nominated me for this \nposition. He went on to state: For the first time in America's history, the next generation could be less prosperous \nthan the generation that preceded it. That is a very sad possibility. We need to prevent that. He went on to say: To \nme and to the people in this room, that is simply unacceptable. We CAN turn this economy, and this country around \n. . . but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible ones tomorrow. Congressman Mulvaney went \non: I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I \nalso know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a \nhealthy economy. Again, he fully understands the connection between our unsustainable fiscal path, our deficit, our \ndebt, and economic growth. He said we ``must include changing our government's long-term fiscal path--which is \nunsustainable.'' Finally, he said: I recognize that good public service--whether in a state legislature, Congress, or \nOMB--takes both courage and wisdom. The courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen. I have learned that I do not \nhave a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the cogent arguments of others--matter. I will be loyal to the facts and \nto the American people whom I serve. My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach to get our \nfinancial house in order. This is exactly the type of person--Congressman Mick Mulvaney-- somebody who is \ndedicated to solving these problems, who has the courage and the wisdom to stop mortgaging our children's future, \nto put America's budget on a sustainable fiscal path, to grow our economy, to make sure that future generations \ninherit a stronger, more prosperous America. I am proud to support and I urge all my colleagues to support and vote \nfor the confirmation of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. \nThank you, Mr. President. I rise this evening to speak on the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. I am going to start by talking in a minute about some of the \n\n\n\ncritical roles that the Office of Management and Budget plays. Before I do that, I want to go back for a moment to \nsome of the comments of my friend who just preceded me on the floor. Going back 8 years ago, I remember that in \nthe last 6 months of 2008, we lost 2.5 million jobs in this country--2.5 million jobs in 6 months. In the first 6 months \nof 2009, we lost 2.5 million more new jobs. That is 5 million jobs in 12 months. Since the beginning of 2010, we \nhave added 16 million jobs in this country. The unemployment rate in this country jumped as high as 10 percent by \nthe end of 2009, and by the beginning of this year the unemployment rate was cut in half. During the first fiscal year \nof this last administration, the Obama-Biden administration, the deficit, the budget they inherited for that fiscal year \nballooned to $1.4 trillion. I am an old State treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and now Senator. That's a lot of \nmoney. We have had in terms of GDP probably higher deficits than that during World War II, but that is a lot of \nmoney. During the last administration, the debt, deficit as we knew it, dropped by about two-thirds, maybe a little \nmore than two-thirds. Do we have a balanced budget coming into this year? No. Is it better than $1.4 trillion? It sure \nis. [[Page S1201]] The unemployment rate was cut by half, the annual deficit has been cut by two-thirds, and \ninstead of losing 5 million jobs as we did in 2008 and 2009, we added 16 million jobs. Could we do better than that? \nWe have. Have we ever had a longer running economic expansion in the history of our country than the last 7 \nyears? I am told we have not. Can we do better? Yes. Hopefully, in our spending plans and in the regulatory work \nthat we do, we will adopt policies that provide the kind of environment that leads to job creation and job \npreservation. That is what we do. We don't create jobs here. As my friend who is presiding knows, we help create a \nnurturing environment for job creation. One of the things we need for that is commonsense regulation. If you look at \nthe role of the OMB Director, one of those listed on this chart, No. 2, is regulatory process. The regulatory process \nis the way regulations are created in this Congress, and as the Presiding Officer and others know, it is dictated by \nlegislation called the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Presiding Officer were an agency that was considering \npromulgating a rule or regulation, the agency would basically say to the rest of the world: We are thinking of \npromulgating a regulation on subject x. It is really a heads-up that they are thinking about doing this. It doesn't \nmean they are going to, but they are thinking about it, so those who might be affected by that regulation, regulation \nx, would have a chance to say: Hmm, something might be coming our way, and we have an interest in it--or we \ndon't. This gives them a chance to go to the agency and say: We hear you are interested in promulgating a \nregulation on this particular subject. Let's talk about it. That is why the agency gives a heads-up, so that those who \nmight be affected by it have the opportunity to talk to the agency, come to their elected officials, and share their \nopinions. The agency can accept the comments they get or reject them. The Members of Congress can accept or \nreject them. We can actually arrange for our constituents who might have an interest in a proposed or possible \nregulation to arrange for meetings to make sure the agency that is thinking about promulgating a new rule or \ndifferent rule or regulation has an opportunity to meet with those who would be affected positively or negatively. The \nagency, armed with that information--the input they receive from filing a notice of rulemaking--if they decide to go \nforward, they will eventually propose a draft rule. This is not a final rule or regulation, but a draft. They promulgate \nthat draft regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act, and those who are interested in or affected positively \nor negatively by the draft regulation again have the opportunity to go back and talk to the folks who promulgated \nthat rule or regulation, stating what it is they like or don't like, proposing changes. They look us up--the \nRepresentatives, Senators--and say: Here are our concerns. We think this should be strengthened or weakened or \ntaken out or added. There is a period of time--a comment period--for the draft regulations. Sometimes those who \ncan be affected by the regulations will come to us and say: We don't think we have enough time to fully understand \nwhat the effects of this draft regulation would be, and we would like to have more time to comment. Then what we \ndo as elected officials is reach out to the agency and say: We don't have enough time. We are hearing from too \nmany of our constituents that there is not enough time. How about another week or month or some reasonable \nperiod of time? Sometimes we get what we ask for, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we get half of what we \nask for, but that is the way it works. At the end of the day, the agency may decide that they have enough of a bad \nresponse--bad vibrations from those who would be affected, as opposed to picking up good vibrations--and the \nagency may pull the reg entirely and say: We will do this another time but not now. But they might go ahead and \nchange the drafting to prepare to offer the final regulation. When the agency is ready to report out the drafted \nregulation, that is not the end of it because that is where OMB comes into play. There is an agency within OMB \ncalled OIRA, which refers to an oversight role that the OMB plays. Essentially, as we used to say in the Navy, if a \nmessage or something were sent from one level of command to another to another, we actually say we ``chopped'' \nit through different levels of command. My colleague who has better experience in the military, as I recall, may have \nhad a similar kind of experience. But the draft regulation that is promulgated has to be chopped through OMB. It \n\n\n\nhas to be chopped through OMB. They have the final say, and they can kick it back to the agency or not. Changes \nmay or may not be made, but eventually the final reg is published in the Federal Register. There is a period of time \nthat runs, and eventually if folks really don't like it enough they can basically file a suit and go to court to try to block \nthe regulation. We see that happen from time to time. Faced with a suit, the agency might want to pull it back and \nmake some further modifications. We can join in those amicus briefs or not. If all else fails, Harry Reid, who used to \nbe the majority leader, a Democrat, wrote a law a number of years ago, the Congressional Review Act, which \nallows the Congress, years from now, to take another look and see if it is something--it is not that old, it had regs \ncome out in the last couple of months--and ask: Is this a good idea or not? And if the majority of the House and \nSenate, with the consent of the President, say: No, we don't think this regulation is a good idea, it can basically be \ntaken off the field and put on the shelf. That is the way the process works. Some people don't think that is a very \ngood process. I think it is pretty good. I hope that if Mick Mulvaney is confirmed to this job, this regulatory process is \none that will be put to good use. One of the things Cass Sunstein did, at the direction of President Obama, was \nbegin a look-back policy, saying we are going to look not just forward for new regulations, we are going to look back \nat the old ones we have and see which ones have maybe outlived their utilization and should be eliminated or \nmodified. I have stopped counting how much money has been saved during the look-back process over the last \nseveral years, but it is in the billions of dollars--maybe even in the tens of billions of dollars by now. I hope the next \nOMB Director will continue it. We have been joined here by my colleague from Michigan. I would just ask him if he \nis pressed for time. I will go maybe about another 10 minutes, and then it is all yours. Another big job of the OMB \nDirector, not surprisingly, is to help the President prepare in submitting a budget. I want to take just a minute and \nmaybe use another chart to talk about how we spend our money. As my colleagues know, the spending is a pie \nchart kind of like this, and it is divided into maybe four major areas. One of those is--some people call it mandatory \nspending. I call it entitlement spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, maybe veterans' benefits. It is \nspending the people are entitled to by virtue of being a certain age, being disabled, maybe having served in our \nNation's military, maybe being disabled in the course of military service, maybe they earned a GI bill. Those are the \nkinds of things that are being considered as entitlements or mandatory spending. As a percentage of the budget, if \nwe look at the green colors here, it adds up to a little more than half the budget. Another maybe 5 to 10 percent of \nthe budget is this sort of beige color or gray--this area right here. It is about 5 to 10 percent of the budget. It is debt \nservice, principal interest on our Nation's debt. Fortunately, our interest rates are low. If they ever go up, ``Katy, bar \nthe door.'' Then the principal on the debt service will go up a whole lot. We have been blessed with low interest \nrates. It will not be that way forever. So entitlement spending, a little over 50 percent; debt service, principal interest \non the debt, 5, 10 percent. The rest is called discretionary spending. It is defense spending so it is about 40 percent \ndiscretionary spending. That is the spending that is done by our Appropriations Committee, about a dozen \nAppropriations subcommittees, including Agriculture, [[Page S1202]] Armed Services, Housing, Transportation, you \nname it. Over half of the amount of spending that is called discretionary spending, right here in the blue, more than \nhalf of that is defense spending and less than half of that is called nondefense discretionary spending. As it turns \nout, we could eliminate, I am told, every bit of our nondefense discretionary spending, and we would still have a \nbudget deficit. That would be everything from agriculture to the environment, to transportation, law enforcement, \nprisons, you name it; the whole kit and caboodle, everything other than defense. I don't think we want to get rid of \nall that. We might want to find more efficient ways to spend that money. God knows we can find more efficient ways \nin spending defense money. One of the ways we can do that is to take a page from something that happened today \nin the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our governmental affairs hat on, we \nhad the leader of the Government Accountability Office with us. We also had a couple of inspectors general, and we \nhad the head of the Census Bureau. They came to talk with us and present to us something called the GAO--\nGovernment Accountability Office--high-risk list. What is a high-risk list? It is a list of programs that are in danger of \nwasting a lot of money. It could include roughly $400 billion a year in revenues that we are leaving on the table; \nowed but not collecting. It could be $300 billion a year in major weapons systems cost overruns. It could be $110 \nbillion, $115 billion a year on something called improper payments, moneys that are paid wrongly, mistakenly--not \nfraud but just mistaken payments--and it can include a lot of other things. It could be properties that the Federal \nGovernment needs to get rid of, and we have done good work on that. Senator Portman and I worked on that, as \ndid Senator Coburn when he was here, and we worked a lot on property reforms. With the help of Senator Johnson \nlast Congress, I think we made pretty good progress. There are a lot of ways we waste money. What we do in the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, with our governmental affairs hat on, is we use the \nGAO high-risk list as a to-do list to be able to save money. If you have GAO, in concert with the Office of \n\n\n\nManagement and Budget, working together with the inspectors general in every major Federal agency, working \nwith the oversight committees in the Senate, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our \ncounterpart oversight committee in the House--if we all are working together, going in the same direction, we can \nactually figure out how to save a lot of money in defense spending and nondefense. With all the overpayments that \noccur in Medicare and Medicaid--it is almost $100 billion just between those two--we could actually make some \nreal progress. Our budget deficit is still too large. Not that many years ago, when Bill Clinton was President, the last \n4 years of that administration, we had 4 years of balanced budgets. We had not had a balanced budget since \n1968. Over the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we had four balanced budgets in a row. How did we do it? \nOne, we had a good economy, as you all recall. There were more jobs created in those 8 years than any 8 years in \nthe history of the country. I was Governor then, and there were more jobs created in those 8 years in Delaware than \nany year in the history of our State. I like to say I didn't create one of them, but we tried to create a nurturing \nenvironment for job creation and job preservation. One of those ways--one of the elements that is important--is \ncertainty and predictability. It has been mentioned earlier today that the concern that a number of people have with \nCongressman Mulvaney as OMB Director is he allegedly has said government shutdowns are not that concerning. I \ndon't know his exact words. One of the things we were reminded of today by GAO is, businesses need \npredictability, they need certainty, but the other thing they need--what the Federal Government needs and its \nemployees need are some predictability and certainty as well. Stop-and-go government is painful to businesses, but \nit is especially painful and wasteful for the Federal Government. Continuing resolutions, government shutdowns--\nour Federal employees spend a lot of time just preparing for shutdowns. That is wasteful, it is demoralizing, and we \ncan't do that. I think that is--I will stop there. I see the majority leader is here, and I want to be respectful to him. \nThere are other concerns I have that I will submit, but I hope my colleagues will keep these thoughts and these \nconcerns in mind when we consider the nomination of Mr. Mulvaney to head up OMB. I would say to my friend the \nmajority leader, I appreciate the time we had together in your office earlier this week. I would just ask him to \nconsider one more time, if we had the opportunity for a judge in Oklahoma to make a decision tomorrow on the \naccess to the emails we discussed, I think we could all vote with a clear conscience a week from Monday on the \nnomination of the Administrator for the EPA. I would encourage the majority leader to do that. Thank you very \nmuch. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from \nDelaware for his suggestion and giving me a moment here--I am not sure whether he is finished--but to just ask \nunanimous consent on a matter. Order of Procedure Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader \nremarks on Thursday, February 16, there be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the confirmation vote on \nExecutive Calendar No. 16, Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, followed by up \nto 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No. 15, the nomination of \nScott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and if cloture is invoked, time be counted \nas if invoked at 7 a.m. that day. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. \nMr. McCONNELL. So for the information of all Senators, under the regular order, the Senate is scheduled to vote \non the Pruitt nomination on Friday afternoon. All Members should plan to stay here Friday to complete \nconsideration of the Pruitt nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. \nPETERS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Representative Mulvaney to be the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget because I have deep concerns about his record. I believe his far-right views are \nout of the mainstream and wrong for our Nation and wrong for the people of Michigan. In part, my vote against his \nnomination is due to his long-held public belief that we should balance the Federal budget on the backs of seniors \nand retirees who have worked their entire lives. Representative Mulvaney's policies would mean raising the \nretirement age, making deep cuts in Medicare, and driving up costs for seniors who already struggle to afford the \ncare they need. These are policy proposals that Mr. Mulvaney would bring to the highest levels of government, if \nconfirmed, and I fundamentally disagree with his approach to budget policy. While I disagreed with a number of \nRepresentative Mulvaney's positions when we served together in the U.S. House of Representatives, I entered his \nconfirmation hearing with an open mind. I thought that in preparing for a role with broad jurisdiction over the Federal \nGovernment, he might have developed more nuanced views on some of these difficult issues. However, after \nspeaking with Representative Mulvaney during our recent hearing and reviewing his responses to my colleagues, it \nis clear he will bring the same extreme views to the administration that he brought to the Congress. On Social \nSecurity, which is absolutely critical to seniors and families across the State of Michigan, Representative Mulvaney \nhas repeatedly called for congressional action to raise the retirement age and reduce benefits. He has publicly \ncalled Social Security [[Page S1203]] a ``Ponzi scheme.'' When I asked Representative Mulvaney about his views \n\n\n\nduring this hearing, he confirmed to me that raising the retirement age is a central piece of what he calls Social \nSecurity reform. I could not disagree more. Michigan workers have worked their entire lives and have contributed \nout of their paycheck to the Social Security trust fund. I simply cannot vote for someone who takes pride in telling \nthese Michiganders--construction workers, nurses, autoworkers--that they need to spend another 5 years on their \nfeet after a lifetime of hard work. Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme, and labeling it as such shows callous \nindifference to Michigan families. Social Security is one of the most successful programs in our Nation's history. \nConfirming Congressman Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget is a direct threat to the financial \nsecurity of millions of seniors and retirees. If you believe Mr. Mulvaney's proposals on Social Security are \nwrongheaded, just wait until you hear his views on Medicare. He has vowed to ``end Medicare as we know it.'' He \nhas said the plans of House Speaker Paul Ryan, which called for drastic cuts to Medicare, didn't go far enough. \nDuring the first term of President Reagan, a saying entered into the public discourse as the newly elected President \nwas staffing up his administration: ``Personnel is policy.'' While President Trump said on the campaign trail that he \nopposes changes to Social Security and Medicare, personnel is policy. While the title of the job, ``Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget,'' might conjure up images of a bureaucratic backwater for many Americans, \nmake no mistake, we are currently debating who will hold one of the most powerful positions in this new \nadministration--and personnel is policy. Let's be clear. Congressman Mulvaney's nomination presents a direct \nthreat to Medicare and to Social Security. While his positions on these critical programs are enough to warrant my \n``no'' vote, let's examine how we might address other aspects of the Federal budget. We don't need to work at the \nOffice of Management and Budget or be an accountant to know that President Trump's budget priorities simply do \nnot add up. The Federal debt and deficit are serious issues, but we haven't seen one serious proposal from this \nadministration on how we reach fiscal sustainability. It is the job of the OMB Director to help bring some sense to \nthese proposals. What are the proposals? They include $10 trillion in tax cuts; $40 billion on a border wall--with \nsome kind of IOU from Mexico; drastically increasing defense spending; $1 trillion on infrastructure; and a campaign \npromise to never, ever touch Social Security and Medicare. It simply doesn't add up. Either President Trump is \nplanning to grow our debt and deficit to dangerous levels or he is going to ask his advisers which of his many \ncampaign promises he should break. Given Representative Mulvaney's belief that deficits can be solved by cutting \nbenefits for seniors and slashing investments in basic science and research, he is not the person I want in the \nposition of OMB Director. This role is also not just about expenditures and revenue. As a senior member of the \nPresident's economic team, you need a steady hand to help lead the government of the world's largest economy. \nGiven the disarray that we are now seeing in the White House, I am convinced now more than ever that \nRepresentative Mulvaney is not that steady hand to help lead fiscal policy in this Nation. In 2013, Representative \nMulvaney supported and helped lead the effort for a government shutdown. Let me repeat: He helped lead the \neffort to shut down the U.S. Government. More specifically, he helped lead the effort to shut down the government \nbecause the Senate would not agree to defund Planned Parenthood. In his confirmation hearing, he had a chance \nto explain this position. Our ranking member, Senator McCaskill, asked him flat out: Do you still believe that the \n2013 government shutdown was good policy? His response: Yes, ma'am. It was polite, but wrong. Polite isn't \nenough. We simply cannot have these views in the highest levels of government. This spring, on April 28, funding \nfor the Federal government expires. Critical programs, from childcare to scientific research, will halt unless there is \nan agreement in place. It is hard to have confidence that this administration will come to a reasonable agreement \nwhen their nominee for the highest budget position believes it is ``good policy'' to shut down the Federal \nGovernment. This will not be the first, or last, potential budgetary crisis the OMB Director could face. Sometime this \nsummer, the U.S. Congress will need to address the debt ceiling in order to meet our previously agreed-to financial \nobligations. If we do not come to an agreement, the effects on the global economy will be devastating. We risk \npermanently downgrading our credit rating and setting off a worldwide financial crisis. Representative Mulvaney on \nmany occasions has doubted the need to raise the debt ceiling. He has doubted that the U.S. Government should \nmeet our financial obligations. This makes me doubt his very basic qualifications to serve as the Director of OMB. \nThis is far beyond partisan politics. This is the fiscal health of our Nation that will be at stake--truly, the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government. If Congressman Mulvaney, as the highest ranking budget official in the Nation, is \nnot going to advocate on behalf of this commitment, who will? I am also worried that Congressman Mulvaney \nsimply lacks the ability to see how fiscal and financial decisions impact working people. He looks past them and \ndoesn't give them a second thought. During his confirmation hearing, I offered Mr. Mulvaney the chance to explain \nwhy he did not pay payroll taxes for the nanny who took care of his children. To be frank, I was shocked by his \nresponse. To him, there was a ``differentiation,'' in his mind, between the employee who was spending 40 hours a \n\n\n\nweek helping to raise his triplets and the employees who spent 40 hours a week in his law firm. To him, the white \ncollar workers in his law firm were employees, and his nanny was not. I am shocked that Mr. Mulvaney did not \nrealize that childcare is work, and it is some of the hardest, most important work there is. Whether a nanny, \nbabysitter, or childcare provider, this employee mattered, and he looked past her and didn't give her a second \nthought--until he was nominated to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I don't believe my \ncolleagues should give him the opportunity to advance his extreme positions on Medicare and Social Security and \nlook past hard-working Michiganders. I will oppose Representative Mulvaney's nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. The \nEconomy Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the opportunity our country has to move this \ncountry forward. I appreciate the comments by my good friend from Michigan. I appreciate all the comments in this \nhallowed ground called the U.S. Senate. But I have to say that while I agree on some points, I disagree on others. \nThe one I am really troubled by tonight is the fact the other side is creating the ultimate shutdown in government \nright now. We had an election. Our democracy has worked. We have a new person in the White House. We have a \nnew direction for our country. Yet this person in the White House cannot even get his team approved in the U.S. \nSenate. After some 27 days, I think President Obama had 26 of his Cabinet and other appointees already \nconfirmed. At this point, President Trump has only 13 of his nominees. Quite frankly, had we not turned the Senate \non 24/7 over the last few weeks, it would be until June or July of this year before we could get the full slate of just \nthe 15 Cabinet officers confirmed. That is no way to run the Federal Government and, indeed, shows the hypocrisy \nof the other side. They complain about shut down this and shut down that. What is happening right now in the U.S. \nSenate is that the [[Page S1204]] other side is shutting down this administration from getting on with the people's \nbusiness of what they elected him to do. Today, after 8 years of failed fiscal policies that have produced the \nweakest recovery in 70 years, the lowest GDP growth on a per capita basis in our history, a devastating time that \nleft 4 million women in poverty after the last 8 years and left many people struggling to get from payday to payday--\nafter those 8 years, tonight I am actually very encouraged to finally be debating pro-growth tax ideas that can \nactually grow the economy and put people back to work. We now have an enormous moment of opportunity to \nchange the direction of our country and unleash a new era of economic growth and prosperity for every American. \nPresident Trump has repeatedly said that job one is growing the economy. Personally, having worked in most parts \nof the world in my career, I see this so differently from Washington. My perspective is that of someone who has a \nglobal business perspective, not unlike that of our President. I know the way forward is not complicated. We \nabsolutely can grow this economy. There are three things this administration is already talking about to grow the \neconomy: One, they have said we need to deal with this archaic, outdated, and noncompetitive tax structure that we \nhave; second, we need to push back on these arcane regulations that have sucked the very life out of our economy; \nthird, we need to unleash the God-given energy potential that we have in our country today. The bottom line is we \nhave to create a more level playing field generated by trade negotiations to allow us to compete on a level playing \nfield with the rest of the world. The first two pieces of these changes are the changes to the Tax Code and rolling \nback the regulatory regime. Several ideas from both President Trump and Congress have surfaced in recent days \nto improve our Tax Code: No. 1, lowering individual rates and cleaning up some of the deductions to simplify the \nindividual code; No. 2, lowering the corporate tax rate to become more competitive with the rest of the world and \ncleaning up corporate welfare deductions that confuse the competition among players here at home and create \nwinners and losers inadvertently; and, No. 3, dealing with the archaic repatriation tax. We are the last country in the \nworld that has this tax, and it penalizes our companies for competing abroad. These three components of changing \nthe Tax Code will make us more competitive with the rest of the world, stimulate economic investment, and spawn a \nnew era of economic innovation in America. These changes would help millions of Americans who have been \ncrushed by this stagnant economy for much too long. I am encouraged that today there are so many of my \ncolleagues in Congress interested in generating new pro-growth ideas. It is a new day in Washington. I have long \nbeen an advocate of simplifying the way we fund our Federal Government. In my opinion, the best way to do that is \nideally with a new system, like the fair tax, for example, which would move us to a totally new tax system and \ncompletely eliminate the personal, corporate, and payroll taxes we suffer through to date. I think all of these ideas \nneed to be considered, and none should be taken off the table arbitrarily. Having said that, one idea bears much \nscrutiny at this point in time, and that is the so-called border adjustment tax now being discussed in Congress. It \nwould hammer consumers, shut down economic growth, and ultimately grow the size of government. In the last 16 \nyears, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the Federal Government has grown from $2.4 trillion in \nconstant dollars to $3.8 trillion last year--some 60 percent growth in just two Presidencies, one Republican and one \n\n\n\nDemocrat. Tax schemes similar to the border adjustment tax in Europe grew the size of those governments in \nEurope by more than 60 percent. That is the last thing we need to be talking about right now, after we just \nexperienced a similar type of growth in our government over the last 16 years. Growing government with a new \nlayer of complexity on top of our existing income tax system is the last thing we need to be doing at this point in \ntime, when we should be talking about, How do we downsize the Federal Government, make our system more \ncompetitive with the rest of the world, create jobs, and create the atmosphere for capital formation and innovation \nagain? Historically, lawmakers have crammed numerous proposals into single, massive, overreaching bills. It is \nthe Washington way. Those bills have often hurt the very people that they claim to champion. When bad ideas get \nmixed with good ideas, the bad ideas oftentimes become law. That is exactly what could happen here if changes to \nthe individual code, the corporate rate, the repatriation tax, and this border adjustment tax are combined into one \nsweeping bill. This is exactly what Washington has historically done, and the results have been devastating. Each \nof these proposals could be considered independently and evaluated on their own merits. There is no reason we \ncan't do that. That is not possible today because many people here believe we are locked into the Washington \nscoring equation instead of looking at the real economic long term value of any of these ideas. Many other \ncountries, such as the United Kingdom, have faced these opportunities, made decisions, and acted accordingly \nwithout combining other extraneous ideas, and the results speak for themselves. Today, the United States is in the \nleast competitive position it has been, I believe, in the last 100 years. In the last 70 years, America has enjoyed the \ngreatest economic miracle in the history of mankind. It was developed on the back of innovation, capital formation, \nand the rule of law, combined with the best workforce in the history of the world. Those are four things that America \npossesses uniquely, and which many other countries are working hard to emulate. For too long, the strength of our \neconomy has been held down by politicians in Washington and the unintended consequences that occur when they \ntry to interfere with the free enterprise system. It is time to trust that free enterprise system to get this economy \ngoing again, and change the rules to create a more competitive environment here at home that will allow us to \ncompete overseas on a level playing field. It is time to simplify our individual Tax Code, reduce our corporate tax \nrates, eliminate conflicting business tax deductions, and eliminate the repatriation tax so we can once again \nbecome competitive with the rest of the world. In recent decades, many other countries have made these changes, \nand we are losing our competitive edge. Today, I am encouraged to see both Congress and the White House \nworking together on policies that will potentially grow our economy and bring relief to businesses and families who \nhave been crushed by improper fiscal policies that are driven by political attempts to manage our economy. Now is \nexactly the time to get these changes right. We have an opportunity to change our Tax Code to a more competitive \nstructure that doesn't pick winners and losers, that doesn't penalize people for successes, and that allows us to \ncompete with the rest of the world on a level playing field. I like our chances if we can accomplish that, but let's not \nconfuse the issue with what may seem acceptable in Washington but is devastating back home to men and women \nwho are trying to create jobs in their local economies. We need to free up capital. We need to make sure the rule of \nlaw supports the Constitution for every American. The American people deserve Congress treating these issues \nindividually and independently to generate a simplified approach to funding our government and growing our \neconomy. I hear the other side whine about not hearing any proposals coming out of the White House. Donald \nTrump has been talking about what he would do with the economy for the past 2 years. There is no mystery. He \nwants to grow the economy. Job one, he said, is growing the economy. That doesn't mean for the rich. That means \nfor the working men and women of America. I believe they have a plan. It includes adjusting our tax system, \npushing back on unnecessary regulations that are sucking the very life out of our economy and, finally, once and for \nall, [[Page S1205]] unleashing this great energy potential that we have. We already see moves today on some of \nthe regulatory fronts, where we see the new Secretary of HHS issuing a new rule today. We see the new leaders \nthat have been confirmed already taking action in this administration. I, for one, am anxious to move forward with \nthis debate. I applaud our compatriots in the House for bringing up these ideas. I look forward to an open and active \nconversation, but now is the time for the other side to begin confirming these nominees so that we can get this \neconomy growing. I know you also are aware that our military is in devastating shape now after 8 years of \ndisinvestment and 15 years of war. There is enough blame to go around here. This is not about the blame game. \nThis is about getting this economic situation right where we can fund our military so we can defend our country. I \nam very concerned that the other side is putting politics in the way of solving some of these problems that we have \nthat are so devastating to men and women who are disenfranchised in our economy and our men and women in \nuniform around the world who are put in danger every day because we are not funding our military the way we \nshould. The time for rhetoric has passed. We are already past the tipping point of the most serious, I believe, \n\n\n\nphysical crisis in our history. This debt crisis is very real. We don't need to grow the economy just to grow the \neconomy. We have to grow the economy because it is one of several steps that are absolutely mandatory to solving \nthis debt crisis, and we will not and cannot solve our national security crisis unless and until we solve this debt \ncrisis. I am optimistic tonight because we are beginning to talk about these very issues. I yield my time. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to \nMona Painter Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, in the past month, I have come to the floor to recognize Alaskans who \nhave generously devoted their time and talents to our State and made it a better place for all of us to live in. It is a \ngreat place to live. There is a mystique surrounding my great State--a well-earned mystique. People travel to Alaska \nfrom all over the world to discover a part of themselves that craves high peaks, beautiful mountains, streams, and \nswaths of wilderness. The real wonders of Alaska are our people--kind and generous people, many of whom have \netched warm homes and welcoming communities out of wilderness. One of those people who has helped make my \nState truly extraordinary is Mona Painter, our Alaskan of the Week. Mona, who will be 80 years old soon, first \nvisited Alaska when she was just 11 in 1949. She flew, by herself, with others in a tiny four- engine passenger plane \nto visit relatives. In the 1950s, she moved to Alaska for good and eventually settled in Cooper Landing. Cooper \nLanding has about 350 year-round residents, but that number swells in the summer. It has some of the best fishing \nand rafting anywhere in the world--an astonishingly beautiful place. It has people like Mona, a devoted wife, \ngrandmother, great- grandmother, and someone, who according to one fellow resident, is ``the glue that binds the \ncommunity of Cooper Landing together.'' She has done so much for this community--volunteering countless hours \nover the decades to ensure community cohesion in the schools, churches, and various clubs, including the Cooper \nLanding Community Hall, which serves as the community's unofficial city council. Since living in Cooper Landing, \nMona received an art degree, has taken anthropology classes, and even took a taxidermy class--once practicing \nher skills on a moose left on the side of the highway. One of Mona's passions throughout the years has been to \nkeep history alive in Cooper Landing. To that end, she started the Cooper Landing Historical Society and Museum, \nwith which she is still very involved. For years she has devoted her time and energy to collecting bits of history \nabout Cooper Landing and sharing that history with her neighbors, with residents, and with all Alaskans. She is also \nthe founding member of the Kenai Communities Association and helped to spearhead the effort to create a national \nheritage area in that part of our State. One of her friends said about her: ``The whole essence of her life has been \nto make this community a better place to live and to restore the history of the community.'' People like Mona make \nmy State great, and I want to thank Mona for all she has done for Alaska, and thanks for being our Alaskan of the \nWeek. Tribute to DeLynn Henry Mr. President, I want to talk about another Alaskan. She is a great Alaskan, an \nhonorary Alaskan, but to all those who know her, a real Alaskan. So many people in my State know her. So many \npeople in my State love her. I am talking about DeLynn Henry. When I got elected in 2014, I was looking for \nimportant members of my office to staff my office. As we all know on the Senate floor, the scheduler is probably the \nmost important position. I asked around, and the unanimous response was to hire DeLynn Henry. That is what \neverybody told me. In Alaska, in DC, hire DeLynn Henry. She is a legend. She will make everybody feel at home. \nDeLynn had been the scheduler for former Senator Ted Stevens, a titan of the Senate since 1989. For the past two \ndecades, she has met thousands of Alaskans. She has done the vitally important work of making sure that when \nAlaskans come to DC--to our embassy here, the Alaskan embassy--they feel welcome, they get to meet with their \nSenator. To many of us, including my wife Julie, DeLynn is like family. Her job, which she takes very seriously, is \nsomething she has done extraordinarily well--for me and for Senator Stevens--for decades. She is personal and \nkind. She does everything she can do to make sure that Alaskans feel welcome, part of our family, and feel at \nhome. She has also raised two fine sons, Blake and Graham, and will soon be a doting grandmother. DeLynn has \naccepted a job as the scheduling coordinator for our new Secretary of Transportation. I am sad and happy for that. \nShe will be leaving my office. She will be leaving a big hole in my office. We, and so many Alaskans, will miss her \ndearly, but we know she will be serving Secretary Chao's office with the same warmth and welcoming attitude she \nhas served Alaskans for nearly 25 years. Thank you, DeLynn, for your years of service to Alaskans. You will \nalways, always have a home with us. Mr. President, I rise in support of Congressman Mulvaney's confirmation to be \nOMB Director for many of the reasons that a number of my colleagues have come to the floor and mentioned. The \nPresiding Officer just talked about some of those reasons. My colleague and friend from Wisconsin did a few \nminutes ago, also. Those are two issues that don't get talked about enough here and, certainly, weren't talked about \nenough in the last 8 years; that is, economic growth and the overregulation of our economy. Again, it wasn't talked \n\n\n\nabout a lot, but we had a lost decade of economic growth. The end of the Bush years and the entire Obama years \nnever hit 3 percent GDP growth in 1 year--never. That is the first President in the history of the country not to do \nthat. For thousands, millions of Americans the American dream was starting to disappear because nobody focused \non the issue of growth. I think in November the American people voted and said: We are not going to give up on the \nAmerican dream. We want growth. We want opportunity. Why did we have that lost decade of growth where the \neconomy grew at an anemic 1.5-percent GDP growth each quarter? I think this chart shows a lot of the reasons \nright here--the explosion of Federal regulations that have literally choked opportunity and economic growth in our \ncountry. Year after year--Democrat or Republican--this is [[Page S1206]] what we see. This regulatory overreach \nimpacts all kinds of Americans, mostly small businesses. This is a big reason why this economy has been stuck in \nfirst gear. When I had my discussions with Congressman Mulvaney, we focused on this issue of growth, and we \nfocused on this issue of overregulation. We haven't had an OMB Director in years who is focused like a laser on \ngrowth, like a laser on making sure we don't overburden our economy the way the Federal Government has done \nfor decades. That is exactly what we need right now. We need growth. We need opportunity for Americans. We \nneed the Federal Government to be a partner in opportunity, not an obstacle, as it is in so many States. For these \nreasons and because I believe the next OMB Director is going to be focused on these issues--opportunity for \nAmericans and growth for our economy, which sorely needs it--I plan on voting for the confirmation of Congressman \nMulvaney, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The \nSenator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I rise in \nstrong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, or OMB. Like many of President Trump's other nominees, my opposition to \nCongressman Mulvaney has less to do with his extreme rightwing economic views than it has to do with the \nhypocrisy and the dishonesty of President Trump. The simple truth is that Congressman Mulvaney's record, in \nmany respects, is the exact opposite of the rhetoric that then-Candidate Trump used in order to get votes from \nsenior citizens and working families. Now, if Candidate Trump had run his campaign by saying: I am going to cut \nyour Social Security benefits if elected President, well, you know what, Congressman Mulvaney would have been \nthe exact person that he should bring forth as OMB Director. If President Trump had said: I am going to privatize \nyour Medicare; vote for me because I am going to privatize your Medicare--if that is what he had campaigned on, \nthen Congressman Mulvaney would have been exactly the right choice for OMB Director. If Candidate Trump had \nsaid: I want to devastate Medicare, I want to make it harder for poor people to get the healthcare they need, and I \nwant to threaten the nursing home care of millions of senior citizens--if that is what Candidate Trump had said, Mick \nMulvaney would have been exactly the right and appropriate leader for the job. But those are not the words, that is \nnot the rhetoric, and those are not the ideas that Candidate Trump raised during his Presidential race. In fact, \nCandidate Trump said exactly the opposite on May 7, 2015. We are all familiar with Mr. Trump's tweets. Here is a \ntweet that he made on May 7, 2015: I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts \nto Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. So you have Candidate Trump making it very \nclear that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. On August 10, 2015, Trump said: [I \nwill] save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. [We] have to do it. . . . People have been paying in \nfor years, and now many of these candidates want to cut it. On November 3, 2015, Mr. Trump said: I will save \nSocial Security. I'll save medicare. . . . People love Medicare. . . . I'm not going to cut it. On March 10, 2016, Mr. \nTrump said: I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is . . . it's my \nabsolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is. It is my absolute \nintention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is. It can't be much clearer \nthan that. On May 21, 2015, Mr. Trump tweeted: I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know where \nto get the money from. Nobody else does. On January 24, 2015, Mr. Trump said: I'm not a cutter. I will probably be \nthe only Republican that doesn't want to cut Social Security. Those are pretty strong statements. What he just told \nyou, in no uncertain terms, can't be clearer than that. He doesn't want to cut Social Security. He doesn't want to cut \nMedicare and doesn't want to cut Medicaid. And you know what, millions of people actually believed what he said. \nThey actually thought that Candidate Trump was telling the truth. But now that the election is over, President Trump \nhas nominated a budget director, Mr. Mulvaney, who would cut Social Security, would cut Medicare, would cut \nMedicaid, and would threaten the entire security of millions of Americans. We just heard the exact quotes coming \nfrom candidate Donald Trump. Let's now hear the exact quotes coming from Congressman Mick Mulvaney about \nhis views on these very same issues. On May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on FOX Business News: We \nhave to end Medicare as we know it. On April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: Medicare as it exists today is \n\n\n\nfinished. On August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: You have to raise the retirement age, lower a pay-out, \nchange the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave [Social Security] the way it is. On May 17, 2011, \nCongressman Mulvaney said: ``I honestly don't think we went far enough with the Ryan plan'' because it did not cut \nSocial Security and Medicare ``rapidly enough.'' Just 2 years ago, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the \nbudget proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan, opting \ninstead to vote in favor of an even more extreme budget by the Republican Study Committee. The budget that \nCongressman Mulvaney supported would have cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the Price-Ryan budget. It \nwould have cut Social Security by $184 billion more, and it would have cut Medicaid by $255 billion more than the \nbudget proposed by Chairman Price and House Speaker Ryan. In fact, Congressman Mulvaney made it clear \nduring his confirmation hearing in the Budget Committee that he would advise President Trump to break his \npromises not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. During that hearing, Senator Corker called President \nTrump's campaign promises ``totally unrealistic'' and said that they ``make no sense whatsoever.'' When Senator \nCorker asked Congressman Mulvaney if he would advise the President not to follow through on the campaign \npromises he made to seniors, this is what Congressman Mulvaney said: I have to imagine that the President knew \nwhat he was getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to think it is why he hired me. Whoa, what we \nhave been discussing is precisely why so many people have contempt for what goes on here in Congress and what \ngoes on in Washington, in general. What is going on here is that a candidate for President of the United States says \none thing in order to get votes, but the day after he is elected, his tune dramatically changes, and he nominates a \nnumber of people to his Cabinet and to high-level positions within his administration who intend to do exactly the \nopposite of what he campaigned on. Once again, Congressman Mulvaney--and I believe he is exactly right--said: I \nhave to imagine that the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to think it \nis why he hired me. So the President hires somebody who has been one of the most vigorous proponents of \ncutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and of cutting Medicaid after he ran his entire campaign telling the \nAmerican people he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut Medicaid. Outside of Capitol Hill, where \nreal people live, it turns out, not surprisingly, that the overwhelming majority of Americans--be they Democrats, \nRepublicans, or Independents--are opposed to cutting Social Security. In fact, according to an October 2016 \nsurvey by Public Policy Polling, 72 percent of the American people, including 51 percent of Republicans, ``support \nincreasing, not cutting, Social Security benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the system.'' \n[[Page S1207]] As it happens, that is exactly the heart and soul of the legislation that I will soon be offering. \nLegislation that I will be offering will expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. It will do so by asking the top 2 \npercent to pay more in taxes, which, it turns out, is not only the right thing to do, but it is precisely what the \nAmerican people want us to do. Various other polls have reached similar results. The people of our country--once \nyou get outside the Congress and outside of the Republican caucus, in particular--the American people know that \nwhen millions of seniors, disabled veterans, and people with disabilities are trying to get by on $13, $14, $15,000 a \nyear, you do not cut their benefits, while at the same time give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top \n1 percent. That is not what the American people want. In my view, we don't need a budget director like \nCongressman Mulvaney, who believes that Social Security is a ``Ponzi scheme.'' We don't need a budget director \nwho once voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Education unconstitutional. He \nwas in, I believe, the South Carolina State Legislature, State Senate. He actually voted on a vote--which got very \nfew votes--in the South Carolina State Senate. He voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.S. \nDepartment of Education unconstitutional. This is the person whom President Trump has nominated to become the \nhead of OMB. So if you believe Social Security is unconstitutional, if you believe it is a good idea to cut benefits for \npeople who will be living on $13,000 or $14,000 a year, I guess Mr. Mulvaney is your choice. If that is whom my \nRepublican colleagues want to vote for, that is their business, but my job and the job of everybody is to make it \nclear to the American people that the Republicans are far more interested in cutting Social Security and in giving \nhuge tax breaks to billionaires than they are in taking care of the needs of the American people. We need a budget \ndirector who understands that we have a retirement crisis in America today. Today, more than half of older \nAmericans have no retirement savings. That is just an extraordinary reality. Over half of older workers in this \ncountry have zero in the bank. Think about what they are feeling when they hear people like Congressman \nMulvaney saying: Hey, you got nothing now. You are going to try to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social \nSecurity, and we are going to cut those benefits. Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement \nsavings. More than one-third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for all of their income. One out of five \nsenior citizens is trying to make ends meet on income of less than $13,000 a year. I will tell you, I hope people are \n\n\n\nable to sleep well, people who think it is appropriate to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut benefits for people \nwho are trying to get by on Social Security checks of $13,000 a year. In my view, we don't need a budget director \nwho believes that ``we have to end Medicare as we know it,'' nor do we need a budget director who has said that \n``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' Let's remember for a moment what things were like before Medicare was \nsigned into law back in 1965. At that point, about half of all seniors were uninsured and millions more were \nunderinsured. Today, thanks to Medicare, about 45 million seniors have health insurance, and the senior poverty \nrate has plummeted. Seniors are living healthier, longer lives. Thank you, Medicare. In my view, we do not need a \nbudget director who supports cutting Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, threatening not only the healthcare of low-\nincome people but also the nursing home care of millions of vulnerable senior citizens and persons with disabilities. \nThere are millions of not just low-income families but middle-class families who today are getting help with the \nnursing home payments for their parents through Medicaid. If you make devastating cuts in Medicaid, you are not \nonly going to take away health insurance from low-income Americans, you are going to put enormous economic \nstress on middle-class families who will now have to pay the full tab for the nursing home care of their parents. \nFinally, there is another issue; that is, Mr. Mulvaney's taxes. After Congressman Mulvaney was nominated to \nbecome the next OMB Director, it was revealed that he failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny he employed \nfrom the year 2000 through 2004. Here is what Congressman Mulvaney wrote in response to a question I asked \nhim on January 11: I have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and \nFederal and State unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through 2004. Upon discovery \nof that shortfall, I paid the Federal taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and unemployment was \n$15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are not yet \ndetermined. This is a very serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator Tom Daschle withdrew his \nnomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services after it was discovered that he failed to pay taxes for one of \nhis domestic workers. On this issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Minority Leader Schumer, who said: When other \nprevious Cabinet nominees failed to pay their fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees to \nwithdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same \nshould be true for Republican nominees. Mr. President, here is the irony: Over and over again, Congressman \nMulvaney has sponsored and cosponsored legislation designed to prohibit people from serving in the government if \nthey fail to pay their taxes. In 2015, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that stated: ``Any \nindividual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an \nemployee'' of the Federal Government. Congressman Mulvaney cosponsored three bills when he was in the South \nCarolina State Senate that would have prohibited tax cheats from serving in the South Carolina State government. \nIn other words, it looks like there is one set of rules for Congressman Mulvaney and another set of rules for \neveryone else. In light of this information and in light of Congressman Mulvaney's extreme rightwing record of \nattacking the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote no \non this nomination. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I wish to oppose the confirmation of \nCongressman Mick Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I respect Mr. Mulvaney's public \nservice representing the people of South Carolina, who elected him to serve in the State legislature and in \nCongress. However, the question before us today is whether the Senate should confirm him to one of the most \nimportant economic positions in our government--a position that has major ramifications for global financial markets, \nthe United States and New Mexico economies, and the jobs, health care, and retirement security of every \nAmerican. Unfortunately, Representative Mulvaney's record shows a shocking willingness to put at risk the security \nof the public debt of the Nation and endanger essential Federal programs that New Mexicans depend upon. I want \nto underscore a few of Representative Mulvaney's previous statements made as a Member of Congress. First, he \nhas supported playing chicken with the debt ceiling over partisan political issues, an action that would jeopardize \nthe U.S. Government's ability to repay the public debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, Federal officials have said \nthat the revenue coming into the government would not be enough to cover its obligations-- potentially disrupting \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, military payments, student loan payments, and many other \ngovernment services. Despite these clear dangers, Representative Mulvaney voted no on raising the debt ceiling \nevery time it came up for a vote in 2011, 2012, and 2013. He claimed that risking disruption to Social Security and \nveterans benefits was ``a fabricated crisis.'' He went so far as to question the majority leader, claiming that, if the \nSenate chose to raise the debt ceiling, the majority leader ``should just quit and go home.'' I, for one, will be here to \ndefend the full faith and credit of the United [[Page S1208]] States' public debt and protect essential government \nservices that our sick, our elderly, and our veterans depend upon. Putting someone with such strongly held and \n\n\n\nreckless views into power at the OMB is an endorsement of policies that could cause another global financial crisis-\n-devastating millions of American families. I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for this reason \nalone. Second, Representative Mulvaney is a founding member of the group of extreme House Republicans who \nforced the government to shut down in October 2013 over their blind opposition to the Affordable Care Act. In New \nMexico, the impacts of the shutdown were felt immediately as our civilian employees were sent home from military \ninstallations, national parks and forests were closed to tourists, and countless other services were halted. The \nshutdown lasted over two weeks, and Representative Mulvaney and other members of his extreme wing of the \nHouse could have ended the shutdown at any time. Representative Mulvaney claims that he opposes wasteful \ngovernment spending, but an analysis by Standard and Poor's found that the October 2013 government shutdown \ncost $24 billion--$24 billion with nothing to show for it. Even Representative Mulvaney admitted that his shutdown \nhurt people. On October 16, 2013, he told CNN, ``Were people hurt by this? Sure.'' He admitted that, if you were \none of the millions of people who relied on the shuttered services, his shutdown hurt you, but Representative \nMulvaney showed little remorse. I stand by what I said at the time. Insisting on blind cuts or a government \nshutdown to prove a point isn't leadership. Third and finally, Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating \nenormous cuts to Medicare, and he is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred voucher concept for Medicare. He \nalso has long been hostile to Social Security and voted in the South Carolina State Senate to declare Social \nSecurity, along with Medicaid and the Department of Education, unconstitutional. Workers earn their Social \nSecurity benefits through a lifetime of paying into the Social Security system. And it is unfair to delay or cut the \nbenefits they have paid into. Raising the retirement age to 70, as Representative Mulvaney has advocated, would \ncut benefits by nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. Raising the retirement age would be hardest for those New \nMexicans who work in jobs that require heavy manual labor, which becomes harder to do as we age. With all the \nchallenges people have saving for retirement, especially as New Mexico continues to struggle to recover, the last \nthing we should do is raise the Social Security retirement age. In conclusion, Representative Mulvaney has \ndemonstrated that he has no reservations about using a government shutdown or the public debt as bargaining \nchips. He has stated that he will push to eliminate Social Security for people under 70. He will slash Federal \nconsumer protections and cut support for small businesses, labor rights, financial oversight, community health, and \nenvironmental protection. I have heard from many people and groups--a broad coalition of consumer, small \nbusiness, labor, good government, financial protection, community, health, environmental, civil rights, and public \ninterest organizations--who oppose the nomination. I stand with them. I strongly oppose Representative Mulvaney's \nnomination to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget and urge my colleagues to do so as well. Mr. \nSANDERS. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. \nPresident, here we are on another evening, debating another Cabinet nominee, addressing the question that \nHamilton put before us, which is whether an individual is of fit character to serve in a particular post. This effort, this \nadvice and consent responsibility held by the Senate, is one that was anticipated by our Founders to be used rarely \nbecause the very existence of this power, they felt, would ensure that a President would nominate people who are \nappropriately suited to the post they would hold. So I do find it troubling the number of times I have come to the \nfloor in these last few weeks to speak about a nominee and consider whether they are fit and to find that perhaps \nthe individual is lacking. Tonight we are considering the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to head the \nOffice of Management and Budget. This is a powerful organization, and it is a very important position. It plays a \ncritical role in the oversight and management of our Federal budget. It plays a critical role in determining what gets \nfunded and what doesn't get funded. So with that in mind, it is important that we have a robust debate about this \nposition and about this nominee. To break that down a little bit, the Office of Management and Budget puts \ntogether the budget for the President. In doing so, they take the vision our President has articulated, and they build \nit into a roadmap to accomplish that vision because where you spend money affects what actually happens as we \npursue programs here in the United States of America. It is the Director of the OMB who works to make sure the \nvarious pieces of the Federal Government are working together like gears that mesh cleanly together and do not \nconflict. It is the Director of the OMB who helps to determine the cost of proposed legislation, which can advance or \ndoom any particular proposal. It is the position of the OMB Director to review the impact of proposed regulations, \nand that can also have a significant impact. I come to this conversation with a number of concerns, and the first is \nthe position of the nominee on Social Security. For 82 years, Social Security has provided for the American people, \nand it has helped our Nation prosper. On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, in 1938, Franklin \n\n\n\nRoosevelt pointed out: ``Men and women too old and infirm to work either depended on those who had but little to \nshare, or spent their remaining years within the walls of a poorhouse.'' That is not the vision we have today. Thanks \nto Social Security, our seniors have a basic income to see them through their golden years. They can live out their \nlives in relative comfort and security, rather than, as Franklin Roosevelt put it, ``within the walls of a poorhouse.'' In \n2016, roughly 61 million Americans received over $900 billion in Social Security benefits. That is a huge injection \ninto our economy, and it is spent almost immediately on fundamental goods. Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans older \nthan 65 receive Social Security benefits, and for one-quarter of our Social Security beneficiaries, including both \nthose who are single and those who are married, Social Security accounts for virtually their entire income. That \nwould be many millions--more than 15 million Americans who would definitely be struggling in the most difficult \nfashion financially if Social Security didn't exist. Retired workers and their dependents account for about 71 percent \nof the benefits paid. Funds also go to disabled workers. Disabled workers and their dependents account for about \n16 percent of the benefits. Survivors of deceased workers account for another 13 percent or roughly one-eighth of \nthe benefits paid. Simply put, Social Security assists our retired workers, our disabled workers, and the survivors of \nour deceased workers. It is one of the best ideas America has ever put forward, but Congressman Mulvaney \ndoesn't agree. He sees Social Security as a Ponzi scheme. Let me explain what a Ponzi scheme is. A Ponzi \nscheme is something where the incoming amount raised immediately pays for the benefits of somebody who paid in \nmoney previously. We actually have a Social Security trust fund, which is the difference between Mick Mulvaney's \ndescription of Social Security and what we actually have. If we made no changes, no changes at all to increase the \nlifetime of the trust fund, it would continue to be able to pay 100 percent of the benefits through 2034 and roughly \nthree- [[Page S1209]] quarters of all benefits currently promised ever after. That is if we make no changes. If we \nmake small changes, our Social Security trust fund is solvent for decades and decades into the future. Certainly, I \nthink we should aspire to that vision of a trust fund that has a 75-year horizon, a full solvency. The issue that \nCongressman Mulvaney raises, the idea he raises for changing how we adjust Social Security, however, isn't one of \nincreasing the amount of wages that are subject to Social Security tax; it is not one of putting premiums on the \nincome earned through nonwages, which is primarily income raised by wealthier Americans. Instead, it is to say to \nfolks: Just retire later. When you are a white-collar worker and you work in an office that is nicely air-conditioned \nand you have had full healthcare benefits throughout your entire life, maybe when you get into your sixties, you say, \n``Well, maybe I could keep working a little longer,'' but the reality for a huge percentage of Americans who work \ndifficult jobs, who work jobs where their bodies wear out, they don't have the choice of simply saying: I will retire in \nanother 5 years, because they literally have developed so many issues and challenges that it is impossible to do \nthe same kind of work they did in their twenties and their thirties in their sixties. So that strategy of moving the \ngoalpost on American workers, many of whom are decades already into the work they are doing, doesn't fulfill the \npromise and the vision of the Social Security Program. While Social Security is a great idea, moving the retirement \nage to age 70--which Mick Mulvaney advocates for, from his view as someone who comes from a job that perhaps \nisn't as arduous as many jobs in America--is a bad idea. This vision continues on into Medicare. Like Social \nSecurity, Medicare is also a generational promise, a lifeline for countless Americans since President Johnson \nsigned it into law now more than five decades ago. Over 55 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health and \ntheir financial security. Roughly, 46 million are older Americans, 9 million are younger Americans with disabilities or \ncertain illnesses. While this program has worked incredibly well, our nominee wants to ``end Medicare as we know \nit.'' Those are ominous words for the 55 million Americans relying on Medicare. He also believes we have to raise \nthe retirement age. He told Bloomberg News in 2011: ``You have to raise the retirement age, lower a payout, \nchange the reimbursement system.'' The problem with raising the retirement age is the same problem we have with \nSocial Security. For American workers working hard in many types of jobs, their bodies are worn out. I used to have \nfolks come to my townhalls and say: Senator, I am just trying to stay alive until I get to age 65, and they would tell \nme how they had multiple diseases and they were choosing between which disease to treat or how they had a \nsingle significant problem, but they were deciding to skip their pills every other day or cut their pills in half or \nperhaps go a week without their pills at all or how they were choosing not to go to the doctor when they developed \na difficulty because they were afraid they wouldn't be able to afford the payment. That is not a healthcare system, \nbut Mick Mulvaney wants to say to those folks: Oh, you reached age 65, too bad. I am providing this healthcare \nprogram another 5 years into the future. That is simply wrong, but more than wrong, it is also in direct contradiction \nto the promises made by President Trump during his campaign. The contrast is incredibly stark between the \nPresident's promise to Americans that unlike so many of the folks in his party, he would not be the one to promote \ntearing down Medicare and Social Security. He would not be the one to promote advancing the retirement age so \n\n\n\npeople who are struggling have to struggle for another 5 years. So it is a poor fit between this individual and the \noffice and the promises made to the American people. Another concern I have is in regard to Congressman \nMulvaney's advocacy for shutting down the economy. He seems very comfortable playing Russian roulette with our \neconomy. He and a group of other House Members brought our government to a screeching halt in 2013 because \nthey wanted to defund the Affordable Care Act. What is the Affordable Care Act? The Affordable Care Act has \nenabled 20 million Americans to gain access to healthcare that they didn't have previously. In my home State of \nOregon, the Affordable Care Act has enabled about one-half million people to gain access to healthcare, both \nthrough expansion of Medicaid, known as the Oregon Health Plan, and also through the healthcare exchange and \nmarketplace where you can compare one policy to another, shop for the policy that best fits your family, and those \nof modest means get credit to help pay for those policies so they can actually afford them. It is an affordable care \nplan that provides for a healthcare set of benefits--benefits such as the ability to keep your children on your policy \nthrough age 26, benefits such as not having an annual limit or a lifetime limit on your policy so that when you do get \nseriously ill, you don't run out of healthcare partway into treating your disease. It is the Affordable Care Act that \nends gender discrimination in the insurance marketplaces. It is the Affordable Care Act that says if you have a \npreexisting condition, you can still get insurance. I was at a fundraising walk for a woman who had a family member \nwith multiple sclerosis. It was a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. She said: Senator, this year is so different from last \nyear. That was the year before the Affordable Care Act was implemented. I asked: How so? She said: A year ago, if \nyour loved one was diagnosed with MS and they had insurance, you knew there was a good chance that your \ninsurance was going to run out at the end of the year or they would hit a lifetime limit, and they wouldn't be able to \npay for the care they needed. She said: If you didn't have insurance, you now have a preexisting condition that \nwould prevent you from ever getting insurance. She went on to say that the difference between last year and this \nyear, because of the Affordable Care Act, is that now members in the MS community--those who had the disease \nand their family members who were supporting them all out at this fundraising walk--now knew their loved one \nwould have the peace of mind that they would get the care they needed. This is what a healthcare system is all \nabout, peace of mind, but Mick Mulvaney wanted to tear away that peace of mind. He proceeded to support a 16-\nday government shutdown that cost our country $24 billion--and to what purpose? To rip peace of mind away from \n20 million Americans. Back in 2015, he threatened to do it all again. The damage he had done--the $24 billion he \nhad stolen from the American Treasury in the context of damaging the government with that shutdown--he was \nready to do it all again in order to make sure Planned Parenthood never gets a dime from the government. To be \nclear, not a single dime from the government goes to Planned Parenthood for abortions. In fact, the organization \nthat has done more to decrease abortions than any other in our country is Planned Parenthood. The government \nfunds go for different purposes. They go to Planned Parenthood to do cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, \nprostate cancer screenings, and a whole host of fundamental basic healthcare. They are the healthcare provider for \n2.5 million American women. Just as he was ready to recklessly shut down the government to rip healthcare away \nfrom 20 million Americans in 2013, he was ready to defund these essential healthcare clinics serving 2.5 million \nAmericans in 2015. That is a sign of someone who has lost their policy foundations and is acting in an irresponsible \nand unacceptable manner. Let's talk a little bit about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was in \nresponse to a big problem in America, which was that we had no one looking out to shut down predatory financial \npractices. It was the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve had their conversation on \nmonetary policy up in the penthouse--the top level, if you will. That is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \npaid attention to. [[Page S1210]] They took the responsibility for consumer protection and put them down in the \nbasement, and they locked the door and threw away the key. Folks kept coming to the Federal Reserve saying: \nHey, there is a major concern here. We have these predatory mortgages that have these teaser rates, and they are \ngoing to destroy the families who get those mortgages. They are going to destroy their dream of homeownership \nand turn it into a nightmare. People went to the Federal Reserve and said: By the way, we now have these wire \nloans, where there is no documentation of income and people are being sold these loans that they have no hope of \nrepaying. In addition, we have another predatory practice called steering payments, which are kickbacks to \noriginators. So they are getting kickbacks to steer people into subprime loans with high interest rates rather than \nprime loans that they qualify for. What happened? The Federal Reserve ignored all of that. That is the foundation \nfor the collapse of our economy in 2008. So along comes Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren, as an advocate, not \nyet a Senator, comes to this body and said: We need an agency whose mission is to look out and stop predatory \nfinancial practices, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we got it done. What does Mick Mulvaney say \nabout this effort to stop predatory financial practices? He says it is a ``sick, sad joke.'' So I asked him about this in \n\n\n\ncommittee. I said: Really? This is an agency that finally is watching out for working families so they are not prey to \npredatory, fraudulent practices. And he said: Yes, ``a sick, sad joke.'' I said: You know, they have returned funds to \n27 million Americans. What other agency has fought for Americans in that fashion--returned funds to them from \nfolks who were operating in a predatory fashion, to 27 million Americans. I didn't change his view by raising that. I \nsaid: You know, this agency, to those 27 million people, has returned $12 billion. There was $12 billion returned to \npeople who were cheated; isn't that a good thing? But I didn't persuade him. He said: You know, I don't like the way \nthis agency is set up. I want it to be a commission rather than an individual who heads it, and I want the funds to be \nappropriated annually by Congress. I can tell you exactly why he wants those provisions, because that is the way \nCongress, at the behest of Wall Street, can step on the airhose that supplies the oxygen to CFPB. They can stop \nthe CFPB from functioning as a guardian, as a watchdog for consumers in America by simply defunding it. We have \na President who ran on the principle of taking on Wall Street, but Mick Mulvaney doesn't want to take on Wall \nStreet. He wants to do their bidding, to be able to shut down this agency that is finally fighting for financial fairness \nfor working families. Wait. We have a President who said he is going to fight for working families. Mick Mulvaney \nshould be backing the CFPB. He should be expanding the CFPB. He should be championing the CFPB, but, no, he \nwants to tear it down. That is deeply disturbing. I see my colleague, the Senator from Hawaii, who is prepared to \nmake remarks. I am going to wrap up my remarks. There are more concerns that I have about the policy \nperspectives and how out of sync this nominee is with the promises the President made to fight for working \nAmericans, the promises he made to take on Wall Street, the promises he made to protect Social Security, the \npromises he made to strengthen Medicare, not to tear it down. So for all these reasons, I find Mick Mulvaney is not \nthe right person to fill this post, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against confirming him in this capacity. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. Orders for Thursday, February 16, 2017 Mr. GARDNER. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., \nThursday, February 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and \nmorning business be closed; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session, as \nunder the previous order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Order of Procedure Mr. \nGARDNER. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the remarks of Senators Schatz, Whitehouse, and Hirono, the Senate resume morning business and then \nstand adjourned under the previous order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to vote on Congressman Mick Mulvaney \nto lead the Office of Management and Budget. This nomination may seem like it doesn't deserve a lot of attention \nbecause we don't hear much outside of Washington about the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. It is \nkind of a wonky, obscure office, with fewer than 500 staff members. At a time when there are so many looming \nquestions about this Republic, about this administration, it is easy to overlook the Congressman's nomination, but it \nactually matters very much, particularly at this moment, and that is because the person who controls the budget, \nthe person who has the final say on fiscal and financial priorities for the administration has immense power. This \nposition controls the President's budget, and that means that this person can give the green light to programs and \npolicies across the Federal Government or stop them in their tracks. And because he has a long track record as a \nlegislator, Congressman Mulvaney has already shown what kind of decisionmaker he will be if he is in charge of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, OMB. I will be blunt. His record and his ideas are worrisome. It should concern \nevery Senator who is worried about some of the biggest issues facing Americans, from Social Security, to public \nhealth, to the basic, uninterrupted operations of the government itself. So this vote is a moment of truth. It will \ndetermine where we really stand on the issues that shape both individual lives and our country's future. Let me \nhighlight just four issues to show why this person is the wrong person to run OMB. The first is Social Security. More \nthan 80 years ago, President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. In doing so, he created a national \nplan to provide economic security for American workers. Since then, Social Security has proven to be the most \nsuccessful anti-poverty program in our history. Each year, it lifts more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million \nchildren, out of poverty. It is hard to imagine a world without Social Security, but I want everybody to understand \nthat pre-Social Security, we had tens of millions of Americans--more than we do now--who would be in poverty \nupon retirement. So this program has actually reduced poverty among the elderly more than any other program \ncould possibly have accomplished. Nowhere is Social Security more important than in Hawaii. More than 200,000 \npeople receive Social Security benefits. For more than one in four Hawaii seniors, Social Security is their only \nsource of income. And the money just isn't enough; it is about $14,000 a year. Just to give folks an understanding \n\n\n\nof Hawaii, we are considered the second or third most expensive housing market in the United States. We are after \nNew York and sometimes in second place or third place, depending on where San Francisco is, but we are one of \nthe most expensive places to live in the United States. For one in four Social Security recipients, that is all they get--\n$1,200 a month. Usually that will cover your apartment. That will not cover your electricity, it won't cover your \nutilities, it won't cover your food or clothing, and it won't cover your healthcare. Today, most working households \nhave little or no retirement assets at all, and many rely entirely on Social Security. This is partly because employer-\nprovided pensions are becoming a thing of the past. So Social Security is more important than ever. It has become \na pillar of our retirement system [[Page S1211]] that continues to work well. It is a universal guaranteed source of \nincome that workers earn and depend on when they retire, but it is just not enough. I will just add that it is only in \nWashington, DC, where entertaining the idea of cutting Social Security is considered moderate or mainstream or \nconservative, even, or adult. I mean, there is this sense that the way we ought to fix the challenges we have fiscally \nas a country is to take it out of the hides of people who get $1,200 a month to live. Instead of strengthening the \nprogram, Mr. Mulvaney's ideas are very radical. He has said he wants to systematically alter Social Security by \nraising the retirement age to 70 years old. He wants to raise the retirement age to 70 years old. This is not an \nobscure person being appointed to an obscure post; this is a Member of Congress being appointed to be the head \nof the Office of Management and Budget. We are going to vote on him tomorrow, and everybody who says they \nare for Social Security is about to vote for a person who wants to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 \nyears old. He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. When he worked in the South Carolina State Senate, he \nvoted to declare Social Security unconstitutional. Again, he voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional, and I \npredict he will get all of the Republican votes. And all of these folks who say they wanted to protect your Social \nSecurity, after they put Tom Price at the head of HHS, they are about to put someone who is dedicated to \nundermining the most successful anti-poverty program in American history. When asked in his confirmation \nhearing--because, look, you are a Member of Congress; you represent a certain constituency; you have certain \nviews. Some people are able to sort of pivot from their role as a legislator, as a politician, and into a role as an \nappointee, a Secretary, a nominee. So when he was asked in this confirmation hearing if he would recommend that \nthe President break a campaign promise to leave Social Security alone, the Congressman said that he would \nrecommend that the President make cuts to the program. So this isn't something he has recanted; this is \nsomething he stands by--up until and including through his confirmation and his service at OMB. But why make \ncuts to the most successful anti-poverty program in American history? Why would we make cuts to a program that \nis financed by its own revenue stream and by law does not add $1 to the deficit? Why would we cut benefits now \njust because we may have to cut them in 20 years? If we are going to change Social Security, let's do it in a way \nthat expands benefits for generations to come. Let's lift the cap on taxable earnings. Let's remove the wage cap that \nunfairly shelters the highest earning Americans from paying into the Social Security trust fund that the majority of \nhard-working Americans do. Here is how it works. The cap is roughly $120,000. So you pay Social Security--almost \neverybody pays Social Security tax, up to $120,000 in income. That is mostly everybody, right. But if you make \n$120,000, all of that is taxed up to $120,000. If you make $70,000, it is taxed up to $70,000. If you make $120 \nmillion in income, your first $120,000 is taxed for Social Security purposes; everything else is taxed at zero for \nSocial Security purposes. My view is that every dollar of income should be taxed for Social Security purposes, and \nthat does two things: First, we are going to be in a position to increase benefits--not massively, but every little bit \ncounts. Second, we will be able to increase the solvency of the Social Security trust fund to the year 2049. Most \nevery family has a Social Security story, whether it is a grandmother who relies on the program's benefits to pay for \ngroceries, a father who suffered a debilitating injury after decades of hard work and receives much needed Social \nSecurity disability benefits, or a widowed mother who relies on Social Security survivors benefits to bring up her \nchildren. In my own home, we have three generations living together--my wife Linda and me; our kids, Tyler and \nMia; and Linda's parents, George and Ping Kwok. George Kwok lived the American dream. He ran a chop suey \nhouse, a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu, Kwok's Chop Suey, and worked hard all his life to give opportunities to his \nkids, until his eyes gave out. Like 200,000 seniors across Hawaii, he now relies on Social Security--SSDI--Social \nSecurity disability. I tell you about my family not because we are unique but because we are not, because we are \nlike so many families in Hawaii and across the country. And with the number of retirees growing, we need to do \neverything we can to strengthen this program, not to weaken it. After a lifetime of hard work, seniors deserve to \nretire with the dignity and the benefits they have earned. This is a promise from the Federal Government. The \ncurrent generation of Americans must keep our promises to seniors, but given his record, I am convinced that \nCongressman Mulvaney will try to do the opposite. The second issue I am concerned about is the basic operations \n\n\n\nof government. Whether you are a member of the military, a visitor to a national park, or a worker looking to retire in \nthe near future, we all need for the government to fulfill its basic obligations. But Congressman Mulvaney voted to \ndefault on the U.S. debt several times, and he did it in the face of warnings from the U.S. Treasury that this would \nbe unprecedented and catastrophic for our economy and that it could drive the world deep into another recession \njust as we were finally recovering from the last one. Think about how markets would react if the U.S. Government \ndeclared that it would not make good on its financial obligations. The stock markets would go crazy, and not in a \ngood way. That would be terrible for the millions of people who invest their savings in the market for their \nretirement. The Congressman has also voted several times to shut down the Federal Government, all in the name \nof getting his way. I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous his approach to government is. It is one thing as a \nMember of the House Freedom Caucus, as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives--there are 435; you \ncan take positions--but it doesn't have quite the direct impact that the Office of Management and Budget does. He \nhas put party and partisan views over some of the most fundamental and basic principles of our government. To \nclose the government, to stop paying our bills, to make people across the planet question the full faith and credit of \nthe United States is beyond comprehension. It should take a real crisis to pull Congress away from the negotiating \ntable and all the challenges in front of us. But it actually wasn't a crisis that led the Congressman to vote to close \nour government; it was Planned Parenthood and the ACA. While we may disagree about the best approach on \nhealthcare and even on reproductive choice and women's health, those disagreements should never get in the way \nof the U.S. Government going about its business. Yet Congressman Mulvaney's actions went against that basic \nprinciple. With respect to our Democratic institutions, the procedural violence that was done to the U.S. Congress is \nhard to overstate in this case. The idea that a faction of a party would demand concessions--and I think we \nremember this--would demand concessions in exchange for satisfying their infliction of pain on the United States is \nunbelievable. And why? Because we are all Americans here. We all want to do right by our country. So the idea that \none party would be willing to inflict terrible pain on the country, or else, was so beyond the pale that there is no rule \nagainst it, there is no law against it. And do you know why there is no rule and no law against it? It is because \nnobody contemplated that a major political party would behave in such a way. The assumption has always been \nthat elected leaders would find a better way to stand up for their strongly held beliefs than by threatening to bring \nthe American economy to its knees. Up until the shutdown led by the Congressman, that had been a safe \nassumption. In 2011, Congress's delay in raising the debt limit forced the Department of Treasury to take what they \ncall extraordinary measures to ensure that our government could pay its bills. [[Page S1212]] GAO estimates that \nthis raised Treasury's borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. That is $1.3 billion in added \ngovernment costs just for coming close to defaulting. The Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the full cost of that \ncrisis to the Federal Government alone--not to the private sector economy, just the Federal Government-- was \naround $20 billion over the maturity of that debt. There is nothing conservative about defaulting on what we owe. It \ncripples free markets. It is Russian roulette playing, with a bullet in every chamber. There is nothing conservative \nabout that. When the government closed in 2013, we paid Federal workers to stay home. I want everybody to \nunderstand what we ended up doing. Listen, it wasn't their fault. These government employees are not the ones \nwho screwed up; it was the Congress that screwed up. We paid dedicated Federal workers who want to do their \njobs, not to do their jobs. We forced them to stay home and paid them anyway. I defy you to find a conservative \noutside of the Halls of Congress who finds that to be a conservative proposition. It is one thing to shut down the \ngovernment for a couple of weeks and accrue the savings. I think that is inhumane, I think that is bananas, but at \nleast you would save the money. These folks ended up paying all the money out and just forcing government \nworkers to not do their jobs. This is not the left or right; this is upside down. We prevented Federal workers from \ndoing their important work, like assisting small businesses and combating terrorism. Ultimately, the 2013 shutdown \nwas a bad move for our economy and for our budget. It cost us money instead of saving us money. In just the first \nweek, it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic output, and it cost about $160 million a day on the private \nsector side. Worst of all, the Congressman has not seen the error of this. There were a lot of Members of Congress \non both sides of the aisle who--in the heat of the battle, you sort of think the other side is going to back off and \nlisten. We all learn lessons. We all make mistakes. There are a lot of Republicans who went through that shutdown \nand said: We never want to do that to the country again. But Congressman Mulvaney has not seen the error of his \nways. He still believes the government shutdown was a good idea, and he said so at the confirmation hearing. \nSenator McCaskill asked if he still thought the shutdown was the right way to go about things, and he answered \nyes. He answered yes. This kind of budget brinkmanship is not good for our government, to say the least, but it is \ncertainly a bad fit for the person running the OMB. The third issue I want to talk about is the Congressman's \n\n\n\nrejection of the role of public health and science. If we look at some of the biggest issues our country faces, it is \nclear that we need an OMB Director who understands the value of science, research, and public health. But the \nCongressman has said that climate change is based on ``questionable science'' and ``baseless claims.'' He has \nasked if we need government-funded research at all. These are not the views we should see from the person who \ndirects the budget of the executive branch. In September of last year, Congressman Mulvaney posted a statement \nabout Zika on Facebook. He said: I have received all sorts of email and Facebook comments this week on Zika. \nSome people want me to pass a ``clean'' bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending reductions \nelsewhere.) Other folks want us to fund more research if we can find a way to pay for it. No one has written me yet, \nthough, to ask what might be the best question: Do we really need government research at all? Do we really need \ngovernment funded research at all? In his statement, he goes on to ask questions that many have asked about \nwhat we are seeing in Brazil, as opposed to other countries affected by Zika. But that is exactly why you do the \nresearch. It is not for a Member of Congress to referee how much money should go to CDC and play amateur \nscientist. We have expert agencies. The CDC did an extraordinary job, not just on Zika but on Ebola. They have \ndone extraordinary work over the decades in keeping people safe. If he is saying there are some scientific \nmysteries remaining around Zika, that is absolutely true. That is why we need to give the CDC and the National \nInstitutes of Health money to try to figure this out. Those questions are the very reasons we need government-\nfunded research, not an excuse to get rid of it. I want to be clear as to why this matters so much. I am not trying to \ncatch him saying something that is a little off. There is a foundational, bipartisan consensus around public health \nresearch, and the person who has been nominated to run the Federal budget doesn't appear to believe in that \nresearch. This isn't just out of the political mainstream. People will die if he implements his point of view. Look at \nsome of the diseases where government-funded research has had a significant impact on saving lives: Ebola, \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, polio, to name a few. We have made the advances we see today because the government \nstepped in and invested in the research, and that has to continue. Right around the time we debated funding for \nZika, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in Atlanta to learn more about their efforts to \ncombat Zika, dengue, and other diseases. I left Atlanta feeling totally confident that the CDC will help our country \nwith challenges like Zika. Millions of Americans are counting on the government to maintain that confidence. But \nthat can happen only if CDC has the strongest funding possible so they can continue to do their good work. Taking \nmoney away from the Prevention and Public Health Fund would strip the CDC and other important agencies of the \nfunds they need to protect our country from within and from without. That is what happened in Congress. The \nlegislative branch did not fully step up to the plate and do its job in addressing Zika. Because of that, we forced the \nObama administration to pull money from the CDC to address Ebola or from States to address other public health \nrisks. Doing so disrupted public health infrastructure planning across the world that we still need to make sure that \nEbola never ravages communities again. Regardless of your side of the aisle, we can all agree this is the one thing \nthat government has to do; that is, to keep us physically safe. Investing in CDC and other agencies that protect our \ncitizens from diseases shouldn't depend on your philosophy of government. Unless you believe in, literally, no \ngovernment, this is money well spent. This is the kind of thing the government does. We cannot walk away from our \ncountry's legacy of funding good research that saves lives, but that is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney \nsuggests we do. He has also made deeply disturbing comments about the science behind climate change. There \ncan be no doubt that climate change is real, that it is caused by humans, and that we have a responsibility to take \naction. We ignore the science that shows us this at our own risk, and it is a risk our country cannot take. The fourth \nand final issue I want to touch upon is healthcare-- specifically, Medicare and Medicaid. I am a little worried that \npeople feel reassured because of the rhetoric they heard last year from the President. He did reassure his voters \nthat he was going to save Medicare and Medicaid and protect it from cuts. He promised several times that he \nwouldn't make any cuts whatsoever to Medicare and Medicaid. But when a Senator reminded Congressman \nMulvaney about this during his confirmation hearing, he did not say he would support the administration's promises \nto the American people. He said that he would advise the President to break that promise. He said that he would \nadvise President Trump to break his campaign promise and change Medicare and Medicaid. Why are we voting for \nthis person? He said that he would advise the President to break the promise and change Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security. He wants to cut Medicaid--a program that millions of people rely upon. More than 50 years ago, \nwhen Medicaid was created, Congress made a really smart decision and designed the program so that if and when \nhealthcare costs rise or the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would be there for the American people, no \nmatter what. Now the counselor to the President says that as part of the ACA replacement plan, Medicaid will be \nconverted to block grants. [[Page S1213]] I worry a little bit about the phrasing ``block grants'' because that doesn't \n\n\n\nsound that bad. I used to work in the not-for-profit sector. I like grants, and I used to pursue Community \nDevelopment Block Grants, Community Services Block Grants. I like grants; I like Medicaid. I am not sure whether \n``block'' means anything positively or negatively, but I want everybody to understand what block-granting Medicaid \nmeans: It means cutting Medicaid. That is exactly what it means. It is a euphemism. People in this administration \nand people nominated to be part of this administration share that view, and they have a long history to back it up. \nThe term ``block grants'' is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but it is a way to describe something so that you don't \nknow what it is. They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say they are cutting Medicaid. That is \nwhat they are doing; they are going to cut Medicaid, and these cuts will hurt millions of people. They will hurt \nworking families. Everybody understands Medicaid is there for the economically indigent, in the case of an \nemergency. But the thing that people also don't realize--and that is a really important aspect of that program-- but it \nis also really important for nursing home care. That is not just an issue for people who are down on their luck \nfinancially or while they are young or while they are parents. When people get older, it is really difficult to afford \nnursing home care. For most people who are not extraordinarily wealthy, Medicaid is the way to handle nursing \nhome care. It is reimbursable. I know that nursing home care in Hawaii costs $8,000, $9,000 a month. I don't know \nanybody who can run through $8,000, $9,000 a month for very long. I know a couple of people, but most people I \nknow can't do that without Medicaid. Certainly, Medicaid is an issue that affects the very poor, but it also affects \nthe rest of us. It affects people who aren't just lying on a pile of cash to take care of their grandmother or their \nmother or their father or their spouse when they are in their golden years. These cuts will hurt women who need \nMedicaid for maternal health services, as well as seniors and people with disabilities. These people have nowhere \nelse to turn. Medicaid is their only option. Some people point to expanded local control as a reason to move \nforward with block grants. That is just nonsense. They are basically going to flatten out or cut the amount a State \ngets, and then they can sit there and divide up an increasingly smaller pie. I am not sure if that is even a \neuphemism. That is just nonsense. That will not help any State to meet their needs. That is why Republican \nGovernors--anybody with responsibility for actually governing, delivering services to their constituents--don't want to \ncut Medicaid. They don't want to reduce Medicaid expansion under ACA, and they certainly don't want a block \ngrant because they know what that will mean. Even if you are a fiscal conservative, if you are in charge of a State, \nyou understand exactly what is going to happen to your constituents if Medicaid is cut. This is another instance of \na party that promised not to touch Medicaid. But here we are, debating a nominee to lead the OMB who wants to \nmake cuts to this program. This is a deal breaker for me and for many others, and it will be a disaster for millions of \nAmericans. That is why today we have to stand up for seniors, for women, for children and fight any cuts to \nMedicaid. That starts with voting no on this nomination. I have heard about Congressman Mulvaney from hundreds \nof people from the State of Hawaii. I want to share a few of the messages that I have received from people in \nHawaii. Here is what one man from Oahu wrote: As a researching scientist, I recognize the very significant damage \nthese appointees will have on US health and competitiveness in the world. A break in research funding, or \npolitically-directed and censored research, impacts long term research. A brief hiatus can result in many years set-\nback of programs and resulting societal benefits. A woman from Volcano Village on the Big Island sent me this \nmessage: [This administration's] agenda lies in [the] nominees for the department of Health and Human Services \nand the Office of Management and Budget who have spent their congressional careers trying to destroy [Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid]. Another woman wrote me with this: [The] nominees for HHS and OMB are \nwalking disasters for the department they'd lead. Both have spent their congressional careers trying to destroy \n[Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid]. Oh, yes, and the ACA/Obamacare, which has proven to be resoundingly \npopular. We are hearing from so many people on these issues because they understand how this works. They \nunderstand that personnel is policy. You don't get to say you are for protecting Social Security, and then vote for \nsomeone who wants to eliminate Social Security as we know it. You don't get to say you are for protecting Medicare \nand Medicaid, and then vote for someone who has dedicated their career to eliminating or at least seriously \nundermining this program. If you want to increase the Social Security retirement age, then this is your nominee. If \nyou aren't opposed to seeing our country go through a series of precipices with the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment-- from the huge drops in the market to the closing of our National Parks--then this is your nominee. If \nyou think Federal investments in public health, disease control, and prevention should be eliminated, then this is \nyour nominee. If you want to see cuts to Medicare and Medicaid by 25 percent or more, then vote yes. But if, like \nme, you know that this is not the right approach to governing, that this is not how we should go about caring for our \npeople and preparing for the future, then you need to vote no. At the end of the day, the leader of the Office of \nManagement and Budget will need to understand how to build a budget for our country and make sure U.S. \n\n\n\nGovernment agencies have the resources they need to pursue the mission. This person will need to understand \nwhy diplomacy matters, why Medicare and Medicaid matter, why job training and education programs matter, and \nwhy financial and fiscal stability matters. Ultimately, he needs to know that government matters and that it can make \na difference in people's lives. It determines how bright tomorrow can be for our kids and grandkids and how safe of \na world we can create for them. Congressman Mulvaney does not have that record or a confirmation hearing record \nthat can convince any of us that he understands the potential we all have--the obligation we have--to make the right \ninvestments that reflect who we are and the future that we want as a country. That is why I will be voting no on this \nconfirmation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll. The \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. \nPresident, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, is probably the most powerful Federal \njob that most Americans have never heard of. If you were to ask five out of five regular people whether they have \neven heard of the Office of Management and Budget, or its importance, I would say that probably five of them \nwould say: I have never heard of it; what do they do? The Director of OMB has broad discretion to develop Federal \nregulations and to set spending priorities across the government-- spending priorities across the government. I think \nwe should make sure that this person actually cares about service to the people of America. For example, if the \nDefense Department needs more resources for our troops, OMB has to sign off. If the Environmental Protection \nAgency wants to protect our communities from air and water pollution, OMB has to sign off. If the President wants \nto cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid under the guise of ``saving money,'' the OMB Director is \nresponsible for implementing the policy. Given the tremendous power invested in this position, the next OMB \nDirector should, at a minimum, believe in the [[Page S1214]] central government functions he or she will be tasked \nto carry out. That is why I strongly oppose the nomination of Congressman Mike Mulvaney to serve as the next \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. Congressman Mulvaney came to Washington at the very right \nfringe of the tea party wave in 2010. Since then, he has consistently pursued policies that would be disastrous for \nour economy, for the most vulnerable members of our society, and for America's seniors--our kupuna. \nCongressman Mulvaney has been one of the strongest proponents for privatizing and voucherizing Medicare and \ndismantling Medicaid during his time in Congress. In 2011, while explaining his support for the draconian, really \nterrible Republican budget that would have destroyed the social safety net and gutted funding for nearly every \ndomestic program--nearly every domestic program and you can imagine the thousands and thousands of domestic \nprograms people across the country are relying upon--Congressman Mulvaney said: Two nights ago, there was a \ngroup of Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to dramatically overhaul Medicare and Medicaid \nand lightning did not strike us. If that is not a sign that maybe things can be different around here, I don't know what \nis. So I'm hoping that--I hope we have that exact debate over the course of the next year. Let me be clear. \nCongressman Mulvaney was gloating over a bill that would be devastating to millions of seniors and Americans on \nMedicaid and Medicare. If confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would not just be one extremist in the House of \nRepresentatives; he would be the person--the one person--responsible for developing, rolling out, and implementing \nthe President's budget and his priorities. With this power, he would be in a position to fulfill his heart's desire--all of \nthe things he worked on as a member of the tea party and a Member of the House of Representatives. He could \ndestroy programs like Medicare and Social Security, which more than 200,000 seniors in Hawaii and tens of \nmillions across the United States depend on every single day. There are things we can do to fight back. Last month, \nI fought alongside my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Joe Donnelly, to prevent Congressman Mulvaney \nand the Trump administration from using budget gimmicks to privatize Medicare and cut funding from Medicaid. \nWhile our amendment was defeated in a very close vote, I was encouraged that two of our Republican colleagues--\nSenator Dean Heller of Nevada and Senator Susan Collins of Maine--voted in favor of my amendment. This vote \ndemonstrated that there is bipartisan opposition to balancing the budget on the backs of our seniors. This is exactly \nwhat Congressman Mulvaney wants to do. He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are \nillegal, but he calls Social Security--a program that millions and millions of people throughout our country rely upon--\na Ponzi scheme and supports raising the eligibility for it to 70 years old. When he was in the South Carolina \nlegislature, he even supported a bill that said that Social Security was unconstitutional. I would say even the most \nconservative person would not deem Social Security to be unconstitutional, but that is the kind of position that \nCongressman Mulvaney takes. His positions on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are enough to disqualify \nhim from serving as OMB Director. We do not need an ideological flamethrower like Congressman Mulvaney at the \n\n\n\nhelm of OMB. Sadly, there is more. Congressman Mulvaney is a debt limit denier. To demonstrate the point, I wish \nto read his response to a question he received from the Budget Committee: I do believe that defaulting on \nAmerica's debts would have grave worldwide economic consequences. I do not believe that breaching the debt \nceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to that result. Not only is this statement wrong, but it contradicts itself. I \nwas in the House in 2011 when Congressman Mulvaney and his colleagues played political games with the debt \nlimit. I can tell you that the stock market did not agree with his assessment that there wouldn't be an immediate \nnegative impact. Here is what happened over the course of a week. The stock market lost $1 trillion in value--$1 \ntrillion in value. Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit for the first time in our country's history. The \nGovernment Accountability Office later found that the standoff increased our borrowing costs by $1.3 billion, which \nCongressman Mulvaney and his Republican allies were all too happy to pass along to the American taxpayers to \npay. Congressman Mulvaney's record clearly demonstrates why he is unfit to serve as the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. He wants to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and other vulnerable \ncommunities. He believes in governing from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis. It isn't even clear if he supports the mission \nof the department he has been nominated to lead. Congressman Mulvaney joins a list of nominees--many of them \nconfirmed at this point, sadly--ranging from an Education Secretary who does not believe in public education to a \nSecretary of Health and Human Services who wants to basically dismantle Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity not far behind. I ask my colleagues, when does this long list of nominees come to a stop? I say, at the very \nleast, someone with the power of the Director of OMB is where we should be drawing the line, unless we want one \nwho thinks that defaulting on our national debt is not a problem, unless we think that hurting millions and millions of \nseniors on Social Security and Medicare is not a problem. I feel as though Congressman Mulvaney perhaps has not \nencountered enough people in his time in public service who have come to him to share their stories of the \ndevastation that would come into their lives if these safety net programs were not there for them. I feel as though \nmaybe if they have come to talk to him, he hasn't listened very well. I encourage my colleagues to hold the line at \nthis point and to oppose this nomination. Congressman Mulvaney is not the person for OMB. I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk \nproceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. \nPresident, we are considering the nomination of Congressman Mulvaney to become the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. In the context of the review of this nomination, there has been a lot of talk about \nCongressman Mulvaney being a ``straight shooter.'' I do appreciate his courtesy meeting with me and his \nparticipation in our Budget Committee confirmation hearing last month, but I have to say that his 6-year record in \nthe House of Representatives makes it completely impossible for me to vote for him as our Nation's chief budget \nofficer. He may be a straight shooter, but he shoots straight at the wrong targets. One of them is the credit of the \nUnited States of America. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Mulvaney repeatedly put our economy in \njeopardy by voting to let the Federal Government default on its obligations. He had an opportunity after his \nnomination, when he came before the Budget Committee, to pivot to a more mainstream and responsible position, \nbut he refused. In an answer to a prehearing question he said: I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would \nhave great worldwide consequences. I do not believe that breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably \nlead to that result. Well, if you breach the debt ceiling, and if you honor the debt ceiling law, that means that our \ngovernment would not have the money to pay all of its bills. Something has to be defaulted on or the debt ceiling is \na complete chimera. Mr. Mulvaney's completely unsupported faith that a default on some of our Nation's obligations \nmight not have grave consequences ignores basic economics, and it ignores the guidance [[Page S1215]] of liberal \nand conservative economists and experts alike, including Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Benjamin Bernanke, Hank Paulson, \nJanet Yellen, Jack Lew, and many, many others. In fact, many of my Republican colleagues in this room were \ngravely concerned about what happened if we blew through the debt ceiling, and that we perhaps had made a bet \nwe would be unable to pay. To put it simply, lenders tend to charge more for riskier loans, and a borrower that won't \npay all of its bills on time is riskier than one that does. Tom Donahue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not \nsomeone that I ordinarily cite favorably here in the Senate. He is an inveterate enemy on doing anything on climate \nchange. He and I disagree on a great number of issues, but even Tom Donahue noted that a small increase in \ntreasury rates, which would happen as the result of a default, ``would translate into hundreds of thousands of jobs \nlost every year.'' A member of the self-styled ``shutdown caucus,'' Mr. Mulvaney chooses to ignore the fact that his \nfiscal brinkmanship has already cost the American people. Playing around with the debt ceiling and shutting down \nthe government are not free exercises. According to the Wall Street firm Standard and Poor's, the 16-day \n\n\n\ngovernment shutdown that the Congressman helped orchestrate in 2013 cost the American economy $24 billion. \nThat is shooting straight at our economy just to prove a political point. That is not the kind of straight shooter that we \nneed. Of course, that doesn't even mention the unnecessary stress that the shutdown caused for millions of \ngovernment contractors who weren't sure they would be paid. There is pain and there is damage from the reckless \ndecisions that Congressman Mulvaney seems to make so easily. Congressman Mulvaney's blind faith is not limited \nto economics. He disregards science too. In response to questions I asked him at the hearing, he said he is not \nconvinced by the evidence presented that climate change is at least partly driven by human activity. Well, he ought \nto take a little look at what is going on at his home State university, the University of South Carolina, which has the \nSchool of the Earth, Ocean, and Environment. It actually teaches climate change. The University of South Carolina \ndoesn't just believe climate change; it teaches it. It has a faculty who are involved in teaching the students about \nwhat is happening in our atmosphere and in our oceans as a result of climate change. This is not all that \ncomplicated stuff. We have known since President Lincoln was riding around Washington in his top hat that \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere would catch heat in the atmosphere and would warm the Earth. That was a \nscientist named Tyndall. This is not news; this is 150 years old. It is simple, elemental chemistry, what happens \nwhen you ramp up the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and how that works in the oceans. The CO2 gets absorbed \nby the oceans. The oceans, as a result of absorbing CO2, become more acidic. What we are seeing now is the \nacidification of the ocean in the experience of humankind--indeed, in probably like 100 times the experience of \nhumankind. You have to go back 50 years to find a similar rate of acidification of the ocean. Well, Mr. Mulvaney \nrepresents South Carolina. South Carolina is a coastal State. It is an ocean State. The University of South Carolina \nstudies its oceans. They know ocean acidification is happening. When the Congressman says that he is not \nconvinced by the evidence presented, something other than being a straight shooter is going on. According to \nNASA, for instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--which, by the way, right now is driving a \nrover around on the surface of the planet Mars. So can we perhaps stipulate that the scientists at NASA know what \nthey are talking about? No other country in the world, no other society in human history has had the capacity to \nlaunch from Earth a rover, fly it through space to Mars, land it safely on that other planet, and drive it around. We \ncan do that. NASA scientists did that. So when NASA scientists say that ``multiple studies published in peer-\nreviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree climate-\nwarming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activity''--so essentially all the experts \nagree. His home State university, the University of South Carolina, teaches this. They don't just listen to it, they \nteach it. They understand what is going on. But Mulvaney says he is not convinced. What is it going to take to \nconvince him? How can you be a straight shooter when you ignore this kind of certainty in science, particularly \nwhen around this building you see the circling menace of the fossil fuel industry always with its guns out, always \ntrying to shoot down anybody who will disagree with them, always trying to pretend that climate change isn't real, \nalways trying to defend a $700 billion-a-year subsidy that they get at the expense of the rest of America? And \nbecause, thanks to Citizens United, they have the capacity to spend enormous, unlimited amounts of money in \npolitics, they can spend a great deal to protect that $700 billion in subsidies, and they do. So we do nothing about \nclimate change here. You can't get a Republican to talk seriously about climate change here. The oceans are \nchanging off of their States, and they won't talk about climate change here. Their universities are saying that climate \nchange is real. Their universities are teaching that climate change is real. And they won't say one thing about \nclimate change here. And this so-called straight shooter is going to go along with that racket rather than listen to his \nhome State universities and to the scientists at NASA, who have put the rover on Mars? Give me a break. While \nthis man claims to be a deficit hawk, I asked him if he was ready to take on the hundreds of billions of dollars that \ngo out the back door of our economy in tax breaks, in wasteful tax loopholes, in tax benefits for special interests, \nand he wouldn't give me a straight answer to the question. From his record in the House, it appears pretty clear that \nMr. Mulvaney would rather balance the budget by going after seniors, by going after Social Security, by going after \nMedicare, by going after the families who have children on Medicaid because their children have lifetime disabilities \nthat require Medicaid support. Those are the targets. That is who this so-called straight shooter wants to shoot at. \nBut as for, say, the tax benefit that lets billionaires depreciate their private jets faster than the airline can, oh, no, \ncan't touch that. As for the tax loophole that lets carried interest Wall Street billionaires pay lower tax rates than \ntheir doormen, than their janitors, oh, no, can't possibly touch that. As for the subsidies we give through the Tax \nCode to the fossil fuel industry every year when they are the most lucrative corporations in the history of the planet, \noh, no, we can't possibly do that. Let's go after the old folks. That is not being a straight shooter; that is shooting at \nthe wrong people. Someone who is a straight shooter when it happens to agree with the politics that they like but is \n\n\n\na flatout denier when it doesn't, that is not my idea of a straight shooter. Congressman Mulvaney is possessed by \nconservative ideology that I strongly believe is going to prevent him ever from working across party lines on the \nbudget, on health care, or on other major issues that he will have to face at OMB. His counsel is likely to pull \nPresident Trump further out to the extremes, which already divide this country. And by the way, to all of those \nvoters who voted for President Trump because he said that he was different from all the other Republican \ncandidates; that he was different from the other 15 candidates because he wasn't going to hurt Social Security and \nhe wasn't going to hurt Medicare; that he was different from all the others because he was going to protect Social \nSecurity and he was going to protect Medicare-- folks, I think you were sold a bill of goods because when you look \nat Congressman Price and when you look at Congressman Mulvaney and when you look at their records, you see \nthe records of people who have targeted Social Security and targeted Medicare for years. They may be straight \nshooters, but they have Social Security and Medicare in the crosshairs. Those are not the right targets for us to be \nshooting [[Page S1216]] at in a tax system that is riddled with special interest loopholes and in a country that is so \ndivided and where the poor and the elderly are struggling compared to the people who are at the very top, who \nhave basically gathered all of the economic benefit of our growth since the great recession. So, for all of those \nreasons, I will be completely unable to support this person's confirmation. I am sorry because I would like to have \nseen the President make the slightest gesture in the direction of bipartisanship, the slightest gesture in the direction \nof compromise, the slightest gesture in the direction of reasonableness, but out of this White House, on the civilian \nCabinet, we have seen nothing like that. It is a Cabinet that is completely controlled by rightwing ideology and \nappalling special interests. Usually, the special interests are the most dangerous and worst special interests that the \nagency has to regulate. Instead of accepting that as the agency's responsibility, he has brought that special interest \nin, brought the fox into the henhouse. If there was ever a fox in the OMB henhouse to take our Social Security folks \nand our Medicare folks and hurt them, it is this Congressman. I cannot accept his nomination. I will vote against it. I \nyield the floor.\n\n \n\n  \n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: \neditorial@plusmediasolutions.com \n"}
