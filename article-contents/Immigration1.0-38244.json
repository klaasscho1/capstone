{"title": "Mexican-American runs deportation INS official says it's part of the job", "body": "\nTemple, Ga. - Tony Campos was busy Friday, making sure his 59 charges were fed and well-cared for in the small \ncommunity center where they were being held.\n\nIf some of the faces peering back at Mr. Campos looked vaguely familiar, it's because under different \ncircumstances they could have been neighbors.\n\nMr. Campos, assistant director of detention and deportation for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \noffice in Atlanta, was born in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1951. His family migrated to Laredo, Texas, 10 years later, and \nMr. Campos became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1972.\n\nAfter a two-year tour of duty with the Marine Corps and civilian law enforcement jobs with the Department of \nDefense and the General Services Administration, Mr. Campos joined the INS in August 1979 and worked in \nMichigan, Arizona and California.\n\nMr. Campos worked in Atlanta from 1985 to 1987 with the Mariel Cuban program at the federal penitentiary. He \nreturned to Atlanta 13 months ago after a four-year stint in Washington, where he supervised the repatriation of \nillegal Cuban immigrants who came to the United States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.\n\n\"The system works,\" Mr. Campos said Friday, pointing to his rise in the INS.\n\nAsked how he felt about capturing and repatriating fellow Latinos, Mr. Campos said it's all part of the job.\n\n\"There is no personal feeling,\" he said. \"I took an oath, and I do my job as I'm required to do it.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: Two Latin Americans await processing by INS officials in the Temple, Ga., roundup. / DAVID TULIS / \nSpecial Photo: Tony Campos\n"}
