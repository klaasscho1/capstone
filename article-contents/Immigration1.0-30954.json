{"title": "Elderly Berkeley man recovers scam money", "body": "\nAn 80-year-old Berkeley man who was scammed out of $53,000 by Canadian con artists got $15,000 of it back \nafter he contacted authorities.\n\nThe man, who Berkeley police and federal investigators in the U.S. and Canada are not naming, first sent a check \nfor $38,000. Then the con artists demanded he send another $15,000. He sent the second check, but then decided \nto contact police who intercepted the check in the mail.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\nFinding the check in the mail was aided by Berkeley police and U.S. and Canadian federal agents working on a \njoint operation to combat telemarketing fraud, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lori \nHaley.\n\nInvolved in the joint operation were the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Postal Inspection \nService, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security and Investigation Services.\n\nA statement from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said a man from Quebec called the Berkeley \nman and told him he won seventh prize in a sweepstakes, but first he needed to send money to pay the taxes on \nthe prize, which the victim promptly did.\n\nThe statement said con artists often pose on the telephone as sweepstakes or lottery officials, relatives, lawyers, \ngovernment representatives, police officers and accountants.\n\nAnyone suspecting such a crime can call 888-495-8501 or visit the web at www.phonebusters.com .\n\nDoug Oakley covers Berkeley.
