{"title": "Nothing to Fear in Immigration Legislation", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nTens of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered this country by destroying fraudulent travel documents, \nclaiming asylum and never showing up for hearings. The anti terrorism law, effective Nov. 1, will end this practice by \nrequiring an expedited review of asylum claims at the port of entry.\n\nThis procedure is a common-sense balance between securing our borders and protecting asylum seekers. For \nAnthony Lewis (column, Sept. 23), no such balance is necessary. But he should consider that many illegal \nimmigrants arriving at airports receive false documents from organized crime syndicates.\n\nExpedited removal of illegal immigrants protects legitimate refugees. The immigration bill now nearing completion \nin Congress would modify the new expedited review provision. Applicants must establish only a significant \npossibility that they will be eligible for asylum. Initial interviews will be conducted by full-time asylum officers or \npeople with identical training. Immigration judges, who will review denied claims, are independent from the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. The only people with anything to fear from this legislation are those who \nmight wish to abuse our immigration loopholes.\n\nThe bill does not eliminate judicial review of I.N.S. practices. Any individual immigrant may still sue the agency and \nobtain specific relief, but broad class-action suits, brought mostly on behalf of illegal immigrants, will be curtailed. \nImmigration lawyers have used such suits to accomplish what they cannot accomplish through legislation or \nregulations.\n\nWe hear an awful lot about \"anti-immigrant hysteria.\" Perhaps it is time for critics to confess to \"anti-immigration \nreform hysteria.\"\n\n \n\n(Rep.) LAMAR SMITH\n\nWashington, Sept. 23, 1996\n\n \n\nChairman, Subcommittee\n\non Immigration and Claims\n"}
