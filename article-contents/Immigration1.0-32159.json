{"title": "HIV-AIDS Care in Md. Criticized; Study Points to Shortage Of Bilingual Employees", "body": "\nPublic health clinics have such a shortage of Spanish-speaking case managers that janitors or other untrained \nworkers sometimes are called on to translate sensitive information about HIV-AIDS to clients, according to a study \nreleased yesterday by CASA of Maryland, a Silver Spring-based immigrant advocacy group. \n\n In focus groups of Latino residents and surveys of service providers in Prince George's and Montgomery counties, \nthe study also found that most pamphlets and educational material on the disease are available only in English and \nthat clients often fear the actions of immigration authorities and stigma in their community for seeking services. \n\n Carmen A. Valenzuela-Dall, a doctor and researcher who authored the study, said governments need to do more \nto provide basic health services and need to hire culturally diverse and bilingual staffs. \n\n Gaining access to health care is \"such an adventure in this country for the undocumented immigrants and the \npeople who don't speak English,\" Valenzuela-Dall said. Without bilingual health workers and materials, \"how can \nwe pretend to provide services?\" \n\n She compared the situation to putting up billboards telling illiterate people to write their governments for help. \n\n The CASA report, funded by the Washington AIDS Partnership, a philanthropic group, was released in \ncommemoration of World AIDS Day. \n\n At yesterday's news conference, Maryland and Montgomery health officials said that they have worked to provide \nbetter outreach to foreign language speakers but acknowledged that much more needs to be done. \n\n Naomi Tomoyasu, acting director of the state's AIDS Administration, said the agency is planning to buy one or two \nmobile health units to roam immigrant-heavy communities in Prince George's and Montgomery to reach more \nresidents. \n\n However, she said, lack of funding may curtail initiatives. The agency receives about $50 million a year, most of it \nfrom the federal government, to distribute to public health providers statewide, but budget cuts are expected next \nyear as Congress slashes spending on social services. \n\n\n Tomoyasu said the number of Latinos infected with HIV was probably \"woefully underrepresented and \nundercounted.\" \n\n Since HIV data collection began in 1994, about 2,200 new infections a year have been reported in Maryland. The \nstate had 28,226 cases as of June 2004, about 23 percent of them in Prince George's and Montgomery counties. \nThe numbers do not reflect the ethnicity of the cases. \n\n Nationwide, Latinos account for 18.3 percent of the people living with HIV-AIDS, according to the federal Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention. \n\n Richard M. Helfrich, Montgomery's deputy health director, said that even as the county improves services for \nLatinos in Spanish, workers speaking other languages are needed. A quarter of the clients at the county's health \nclinic on Dennis Avenue in Silver Spring are French-speaking African immigrants, the same percentage as the \nLatino clients, he said. \n\n Montgomery County Council President Tom Perez (D-Silver Spring) said county leaders have to do more to invest \nin culturally inclusive services. Otherwise, \"that's not only bad public health policy, but that's against the law,\" he \nsaid. Federal law mandates that publicly funded agencies make services accessible to all eligible people, including \nthose with limited English skills. \n\n \"Access to health care is not a privilege. It's a right,\" Perez said. \n"}
