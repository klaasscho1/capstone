{"title": "PLAN TO LET SKILLED WORKERS ENTER / CONGRESS IS STUDYING A COMPROMISE. IT WOULD LET MORE FOREIGN WORKERS WITH COMPUTER SKILLS INTO THE COUNTRY.", "body": "\nA congressional compromise announced yesterday would allow more foreign computer programmers, engineers \nand other skilled workers to work in the United States.\n\nIf passed by the House and Senate, the proposed changes to immigration law would increase the maximum \nnumber of visas granted yearly to skilled workers from 65,000 to 115,000 over the next three years.\n\nFrom Microsoft's Bill Gates on down, the information-technology industry has lobbied intensely for the increase in \nso-called H-1B visas, saying the industry suffers from shortages of qualified employees.\n\nUnder the proposal, companies that depend on temporary foreign help must attest that they have recruited \nAmerican workers and have not laid off an American employee to hire a foreign worker. Businesses also must \nattest that they will not funnel skilled immigrants to other firms that use them to replace laid-off workers.\n\nCompanies violating these provisions could be fined and barred from participating in the program for one year.\n\nThe high-tech industry had criticized the provisions as cumbersome, but the Clinton administration threatened to \nveto the measure if it did not include protections for U.S. workers.\n\nSupporters of the revised plan hope to have it passed by the House and Senate before Congress goes on its \nAugust recess.\n"}
