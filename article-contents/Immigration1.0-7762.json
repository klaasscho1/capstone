{"title": "ADVOCATES DRAFTING PLAN FOR IMMIGRATION SOLUTIONS", "body": "\nImmigration advocates began drafting a proposal, to be presented to Congress in upcoming months, to help the \nlongstanding problem of illegal immigration.\n\nAbout two dozen people met Saturday at the Rancho Santiago Community College District offices to work on long-\nterm measures that would ease the illegal migration of Mexicans into the United States.\n\n\"The problem is old, but the moment has come now, especially in this electoral period in the United States and \nMexico, to seek permanent solutions,\" said Romero Flores Caballero of the National Institute ofPopulation and \nStatistics in Mexico City.\n\nThe plan includes granting residency to millions of undocumented Mexicans, allowing Mexican migrant laborers \neasier access into the United States and pushing for better working conditions for immigrants.\n\nThe International Coalition of Mexicans Abroad was created several months ago by prominent Mexicans in the \nUnited States and Mexico to advocate for those who migrate to the country from Mexico.\n\nCoalition members will use the suggestions to draft a proposal to be presented to the House Judiciary Committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over immigration laws, in July.\n"}
