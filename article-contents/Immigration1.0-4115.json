{"title": "3 MEN ARRESTED IN DEAF MEXICAN SMUGGLING CASE", "body": "\nFederal authorities Thursday charged three men with running an operation based in Southern California through \nwhich possibly hundreds of deaf Mexicans were smuggled across the border, kept briefly in a Los Angeles house, \nthen taken to New York City, where they were held in virtual slavery and forced to peddle trinkets. Zachary Carter, \nthe U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, announced the arrests of Andreas Pfeiffer and Lalo Paoletti, whom he identified as \nleaders of the Los Angeles smuggling ring, and Paoletti's son, Carlos, a midlevel manager.\nAuthorities described them as associates of the extended Paoletti family, a Mexico City-based clan whose members \nhave beencharged with holding 62 deaf illegal immigrants in two safe houses in Queens.\n\nAt the same time, officials announced the arrest in Chicago of Pedro Santamaria on related charges of smuggling \nimmigrants. He is alleged to have supervised the trinket-selling activities of a group of illegal Mexican immigrants \nthere before transporting them to New York to work in the Queens operation, which investigators now believe was \nclosely linked to the Chicago group. The arrests bring to 16 the number of people charged in the case, and Carter \nsaid that additional charges were expected.\n\nNotes\n\nNational News in Brief\n"}
