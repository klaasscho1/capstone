{"title": "YOKO DRIVER TO HIGHTAIL IT", "body": "\nTHE CHAUFFEUR who allegedly tried to blackmail Yoko Ono out of $2 million volunteered yesterday to leave the \ncountry as soon as immigration officials release him from custody.\n\nA federal immigration judge granted the request by Koral Karsan, 50, telling immigration officials to make \narrangements for him to go straight from jail to a plane bound for his native Turkey. Karsan will leave in about a \nmonth. Until then, he must remain in jail, authorities said.\n\n\"He is anxious to go home,\" Karsan's lawyer, Jonathan Avirom, told the judge during the Manhattan hearing.\n\nFederal attorney Victor Yee of the Department of Homeland Security initially objected to Karsan's request, saying, \n\"Given the nature of the crime, we believe him to be a danger.\"\n\nBut Yee later withdrew his objection after learning Karsan would not linger in the U.S. after his release. He has \nbeen held since his arrest in December.\n\nKarsan pleaded guilty last month to grand larceny charges stemming from his attempt to extort John Lennon's \nwidow by threatening to release embarrassing photos and secret recordings of her phone calls.\n"}
