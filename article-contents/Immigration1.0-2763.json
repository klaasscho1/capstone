{"title": "FOREIGN-BORN FEAR WELFARE REFORMS", "body": "\nOne by one, four immigrant women came into the Caribbean Women's Health Association office in Far Rockaway, \nQueens, and asked for documents they had entrusted to CWHA's staff birth certificates, Social Security cards, \npassports, green cards.\n\nThe women, all of whom were pregnant, had planned to use the documents to apply for Medicaid since, under \ncurrent welfare regulations, they were entitled to government aid.\n\n\"But with all the changes being made under the welfare reform law, and each state doing something different, it's \nhard to know what to say right now,\" said Adrienne Mercer, who is in charge of CWHA's maternal and children's \nprogram.\n\nAs a result, the women who came into the association's offices that day weren't taking any chances, even though \nNew York State is likely to continue to make Medicaid available for permanent residents.\n\n\"Immigrants fear they will be hounded, tracked, detained and deported. It's open season on them,\" said Marco \nMason, assistant executive director of CWHA. \"They want to become invisible.\n\n\"Even in our program for moms, they are not coming back. They are refusing services. They are documented, but \nhiding more than ever.\"\n\nYvonne Graham, the executive director of CWHA, said the agency has been swamped with calls from nervous \nimmigrants and new citizens, concerned that when welfare rform lw changes go into effect in January, they'll be \nadversely affected.\n\n\"The citizens who haven't assimilated into the mainstream because they don't know the language or culture well, \nwant to know how to access services that are available . . . before the new laws go into effect,\" Graham said.\n\nFounded in 1982, CWHA assists men and women from all boroughs at six community centers in Brooklyn and \nQueens. They offer an array of health care services, as well as help with immigration and citizenship. About 80% of \nthe agency's clientele are immigrants, from as many as 120 countries worldwide. The largest number comes from \nthe Caribbean.\n\nMason said the agency has a reputation of \"fighting to the death\" to protect clients and will continue to do so \nthrough advocacy, the immigrant service center and a health clinic. CWHA also conducts research, citizenship and \nvoter registration drives.\n\nMason said CWHA would join with other groups to address the debacle that the new welfare laws will create. \n\"We're going to be devastated,\" he predicted.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the agency will continue with its plans to build a primary-care facility in Brooklyn and serve, among \nothers, mothers and children.\n\nCWHA caseworkers visit homes to check that landlords are maintaining them, that smoke detectors have been \ninstalled, and to look for peeling paint and signs of lead poisoning. They make sure children visit their doctors \nregularly and that the mothers learn to advocate for themselves in housing and employment issues.\n\n\"Through CWHA, I got free legal advice. They told me my rights in court. I got an order of protection and food \nstamps,\" said one young mother who asked that her name not be used because she is involved in a custody \ndispute with her child's father.\n\nCarla Selby and Wendy Edwards, both of Trinidad, said CWHA was instrumental in helping them get health \nservices during their pregnancies, and infant formula afterward.\n\nSome clients, who asked not to be identified, said they are worried sick because they don't know what they will do \nwhen government assistance is cut off.\n\nOne woman, who said she could not return to her native country because the economy there was lagging and she \ncould not find a job, summarized:\n\n\"It's bad all over. [There] used to be a time everyone could come to the United States and work together to make \none great nation. Now, it seems, nobody wants us anymore.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nMARK BONIFACIO HELPING HANDS at Caribbean Women's Health Association (from l.): Nelly Morales, Lorie \nVon S.
