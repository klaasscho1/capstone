{"title": "The World;As Soviet Borders Open, the West Braces for an Economic Exodus", "body": "\nTHE withering of the Soviet empire and the economic strains that accompany it may produce the largest migration \nsince World War II, demographers say, and that will present Western governments that have long pressed \nMoscow to open its frontiers with the uncomfortable problem of what to do about a flood of would-be immigrants.\n\nMost are in search of work, food, a better life, sometimes safety. They include Soviet Jews heading for Israel, \nGermany and the United States, Armenians going to France, German-speaking Poles and Hungarians entering \nunified Germany, Albanians scrambling into Greece.\n\nThe exodus has been manageable so far, but barely. From a maximum of 100,000 a year in the 1970's and middle \n1980's, immigration from the Warsaw Pact countries to the West jumped to 1.3 million in 1989, the last year for \nwhich figures are available, and it was probably higher in 1990.\n\nBut now Western countries fear an even larger exodus as the Soviet Union starts lifting travel restrictions just \nwhen economic hardship and ethnic tensions are on the rise.\n\n \n\nSpecters of Famine and War <>\n\nLast month Vladimir Scherbakov, chairman of the Soviet state Committee on Labor and Social Services, told West \nEuropean governments that 1.5 million to 2 million Soviet citizens are likely to move west in search of work in the \nnext few years. This is well below the more extreme estimates of 25 million to 30 million immigrants that some \nexperts in the United Nations High Commission for Refugees have warned could head west if famine combines \nwith civil war.\n\nThose who believe the migration from the East can be absorbed say most of those leaving come from finite ethnic \ngroups -- the roughly 2 million Germans in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the 2 million or so Soviet Jews, \nthe million Armenians living outside Armenia, an estimated 3 million displaced Hungarians and some 3 million \ngypsies. The great mass of the Soviet people, according to this theory, have no tradition of migration and remain \nattached to the soil.  But some 25 million ethnic Russians already live in other Soviet republics -- including 9 million \n\n\nin predominantly Moslem Central Asia and Azerbaijan, where they are often considered unwelcome foreigners -- \nand they might decide to flee.\n\nOther experts warn of a steady stream of Easterners taking advantage of their new freedom to travel and study \nabroad, overstaying their visas and joining the underground economy.\n\nBimal Ghosh, an expert with the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration, warns that the switch to a \nmarket economy could put 14 million people out of work in Eastern Europe and 30 million to 40 million people in \nthe Soviet Union by 1994.\n\nThe prospect of rising migration creates a dilemma for Western European governments and for the United States, \nCanada and Australia, the countries that have absorbed most recent migrations. With the cold war over, immigrants \nare unlikely to qualify for political asylum as refugees facing \"well-founded fear of persecution.\" But it is equally \ndifficult for Western governments to keep them out after telling the Soviet bloc for decades to open its frontiers.\n\nMore Western countries, however, are closing the door to potential migrants from the East, requiring visas, return \ntickets and a minimum amount of cash. And Austria, a traditional haven for refugees in cold war days, has sent \n4,000 soldiers to seal its borders.\n\nMany argue the real answer is for the West to do more to help the east make a success of capitalism quickly so its \npeople stay home.\n"}
