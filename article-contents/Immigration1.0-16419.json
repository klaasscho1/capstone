{"title": "Immigrant Workers And Bernard Kerik", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n The situation involving Bernard B. Kerik is one more reminder of President Bush's decision-making process. First, \ngo with a gut feeling; second, delegate the details to subordinates who will unquestioningly put the decision into \neffect; third, disown any fallout resulting from the decision. \n\n Remember when the president said he had looked into the soul of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, and \nhad found a friend? Of course, such decisions pale when compared with the inspired decision to invade Iraq.\n\nRobert D. Chagnon\n\nMartinsburg, W.
