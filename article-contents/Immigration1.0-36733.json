{"title": "NBC Correspondent Applies for Amnesty", "body": "\nAn NBC News correspondent, James Makawa, joined thousands of other illegal aliens Tuesday in picking up \napplications under the new Federal amnesty program.\n\nMr. Makawa, 27 years old, said he came to the United States in 1977 on a student visa to escape the war in his \nnative Rhodesia, which is now called Zimbabwe.\nAfter the visa expired that year, he stayed, telling no one of his illegal status.\n\n''It's been like living in a pressure cooker from day to day,'' he said. ''You never knew whether the immigration van \nwould show up. It's something you just kept to yourself. It's a living hell.''\n\nMr. Makawa settled in Westville, Ind., and majored in journalism at the University of Evansville in Indiana. After \ngraduation he worked for television stations in Evansville; Abilene, Texas; Mobile, Ala., and New Orleans before \njoining the NBC bureau in Chicago in March 1986.\n\nMr. Makawa's story was revealed by Tom Brokaw, the anchorman on ''NBC Nightly News'' Tuesday.\n\n''Much to our surprise, James today was on line applying for amnesty,'' Mr. Brokaw said. ''None of us knew he has \nbeen an illegal alien since his student visa ran out.''\n"}
