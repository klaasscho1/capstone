L. 113-128), comprehensive legislation that reforms and modernizes the public workforce system. It \nreaffirms the role of the public workforce system, and brings together and enhances several key employment, \neducation, and training programs. WIOA provides resources, services, and leadership tools for the workforce \nsystem to help individuals find good jobs and stay employed and improves employer prospects for success in the \nglobal marketplace. It ensures that the workforce system operates as a comprehensive, integrated and streamlined \nsystem to provide pathways to prosperity for those it serves and continuously improves the quality and performance \nof its services. The Department of Labor is publishing this NPRM to implement those provisions of WIOA that affect \nthe core programs under titles I and III, and the Job Corps and national programs authorized under title I which will \nadministered by the Department. In addition to this NPRM, the Departments of Education (ED) and Labor (DOL) are \njointly publishing an NPRM to implement those provisions of WIOA that affect all of the WIOA core programs (titles \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:OIRA_submission@omb.eop.gov\n\n\nI-IV) and which will have to be jointly overseen and administered by both Departments. Readers should note that \nthere are a number of cross-references to the Joint NPRM published by ED and DOL, with particular focus on those \nprovisions in the Joint NPRM that have to do with performance reporting among all the core programs. Finally, this \nNPRM has been structured so that the proposed Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts will align with the Joint \nNPRM CFR parts in once all of the proposed rules of have been finalized. WIOA seeks to deliver a broad array of \nintegrated services to individuals seeking jobs and skills training, as well as employers seeking skilled workers by \nimproving the workforce system, more closely aligning it with regional economies and strengthening the network of \nabout 2,500 one-stop centers. Customers must have access to a seamless system of high-quality services through \ncoordination of programs, services and governance structures. The Act builds closer ties among key workforce \npartners--business leaders, workforce boards, labor unions, community colleges, non-profit organizations, youth-\nserving organizations, and State and local officials--in striving for a more job-driven approach to training and skills \ndevelopment. WIOA will help job seekers and workers access employment, education, training, and support \nservices to succeed in the labor market and match employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the \nglobal economy. The purposes of WIOA described in the Act include:  Increasing access to and opportunities for \nthe employment, \n\neducation, training, and support services that individuals need, \n\nparticularly those with barriers to employment.\n\n     Supporting the alignment of workforce investment, \n\neducation, and economic development systems, in support of a \n\ncomprehensive, accessible, and high-quality workforce development \n\nsystem.\n\n     Improving the quality and labor market relevance of \n\nworkforce investment, education, and economic development efforts.\n\n     Promoting improvement in the structure and delivery of \n\nservices.\n\n     Increasing the prosperity of workers and employers.\n\n     Providing workforce development activities that increase \n\nemployment, retention, and earnings of participants and that increase \n\npost-secondary credential attainment and as a result, improve the \n\nquality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, increase economic \n\nself-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of employers, and enhance \n\nproductivity, and competitiveness of the nation.\n\n    WIOA is complemented by the groundwork laid by the Administration-\n\nwide review of employment, education, and training programs to ensure \n\nFederal agencies do everything possible to prepare ready-to-work-\n\nAmericans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. The review identified seven \n\npriorities for these Federal programs:\n\n     Work up-front with employers to determine local or \n\nregional hiring needs and design training programs that are responsive \n\nto those needs;\n\n     Offer work-based learning opportunities with employers--\n\nincluding on-the-job training, internships, and pre-apprenticeships and \n\nregistered apprenticeships--as training paths to employment;\n\n\n\n     Make better use of data to drive accountability, inform \n\nwhat programs are offered and what is taught, and offer user-friendly \n\ninformation for job seekers to choose what programs and pathways work \n\nfor them and are likely to result in a job;\n\n     Measure and evaluate employment and earnings outcomes;\n\n     Promote a seamless progression from one educational \n\nstepping stone to another, and across work-based training and \n\neducation, so individuals' efforts result in progress;\n\n     Break down barriers to accessing job-driven training and \n\nhiring for any American who is willing to work, including access to \n\nsupportive services and relevant guidance; and\n\n     Create regional collaborations among American Job Centers, \n\neducation institutions, labor, and nonprofits.\n\n    As WIOA implementation progresses, success in accomplishing the \n\npurposes of WIOA at the State, local, and regional levels, will be \n\nassessed by whether:\n\n     One-stop centers are recognized as a valuable community \n\nresource and are known for high quality, comprehensive services for \n\ncustomers.\n\n     The core programs and one-stop partners provide seamless, \n\nintegrated customer service.\n\n     Program performance, labor market and related data drive \n\npolicy and strategic decisions and inform customer choice.\n\n     Youth programs reconnect out-of-school youth (OSY) to \n\neducation and jobs.\n\n     Job seekers access quality career services either online \n\nor in a one-stop career center through a ``common front door'' that \n\nconnects them to the right services.\n\n     One-stop centers facilitate access to high quality, \n\ninnovative education and training.\n\n     Services to businesses are robust and effective, meeting \n\nbusinesses' workforce needs across the business lifecycle.\n\nII.

Background\n\nA. Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Principles\n\n    On July 22, 2014, President Obama signed the WIOA, the first \n\nlegislative reform of the public workforce system in more than 15 \n\nyears, which passed Congress by a wide bipartisan majority. WIOA \n\nsupersedes the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) and amends the \n\nAdult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), the Wagner-Peyser Act, \n\nand the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. WIOA presents an extraordinary \n\nopportunity for the workforce system to accelerate its transformational \n\nefforts and demonstrate its ability to improve job and career options \n\nfor our citizens through an integrated, job-driven public workforce \n\n\n\nsystem that links diverse talent to our nation's businesses. It \n\nsupports the development of strong, vibrant regional economies where \n\nbusinesses thrive and people want to live and work.\n\n    WIOA reaffirms the role of the customer-focused one-stop delivery \n\nsystem, a cornerstone of the public workforce investment system, and \n\nenhances and increases coordination among several key employment, \n\neducation, and training programs. Most provisions in WIOA take effect \n\non July 1, 2015, the first full program year (PY) after enactment, \n\nalthough the new State plans and performance accountability system take \n\neffect July 1, 2016. Title IV, however, took effect upon enactment.\n\n    WIOA presents an extraordinary opportunity for the workforce system \n\nto accelerate its transformational efforts and demonstrate its ability \n\nto improve job and career options for our citizens through an \n\nintegrated, job-driven public workforce system that links diverse \n\ntalent to our nation's businesses. It supports the development of \n\nstrong, vibrant regional economies where businesses thrive and people \n\nwant to live and work.\n\n    WIOA is designed to help job seekers access employment, education, \n\ntraining, and support services to succeed in the labor market and to \n\nmatch employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the \n\nglobal economy. WIOA has six main purposes: (1) Increasing access to \n\nand opportunities for the employment, education, training, and support \n\nservices for individuals, particularly those with barriers to \n\nemployment; (2) supporting the alignment of workforce investment, \n\neducation, and economic development systems in support of a \n\ncomprehensive, accessible, and high-quality workforce development \n\nsystem; (3) improving the quality and labor market relevance of \n\nworkforce investment, education, and economic development efforts; (4) \n\npromoting improvement in the structure and delivery of services; (5) \n\nincreasing the prosperity of workers and employers; and (6) providing \n\nworkforce development activities that increase\n\n[[Page 20693]]\n\nemployment, retention, and earnings of participants and that increase \n\npost-secondary credential attainment and as a result, improve the \n\nquality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, increase economic \n\nself-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of employers, and enhance \n\nproductivity and competitiveness of the nation.\n\n    Beyond achieving the requirements of the new law, WIOA offers an \n\nopportunity to continue to modernize the workforce system, and achieve \n\nkey hallmarks of a customer centered workforce system, where the needs \n\n\n\nof business and workers drive workforce solutions, where one-stop \n\ncareer centers and partners provide excellent customer service to job \n\nseekers and businesses, where the workforce system pursues continuous \n\nimprovement through evaluation and data-driven policy, and where the \n\nworkforce system supports strong regional economies.\n\n    Regulations and guidance implementing titles I and III are issued \n\nby DOL, with the exception of joint regulations that will be issued by \n\nDOL and ED on the provisions in title I relating to unified and \n\ncombined planning, performance, and the one-stop delivery system. \n\nRegulations and guidance on implementing titles II and IV will be \n\nissued by ED.\n\n    WIOA retains much of the structure of WIA, but with critical \n\nchanges to advance greater coordination and alignment. Under title I-A, \n\neach State will be required to develop a single, unified strategic plan \n\nthat is applicable to four core workforce development programs. The \n\ncore programs consist of (1) the adult, dislocated worker, and youth \n\nformula programs administered by the Department under title I of WIOA; \n\n(2) the Adult Education and Family Literacy program administered by ED \n\nunder title II of WIOA; (3) the Wagner-Peyser Act employment services \n\n(ES) program administered by the Department, as amended by title III of \n\nWIOA; and (4) the vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs under title I \n\nof the Rehabilitation Act administered by ED, as amended by title IV of \n\nWIOA. In addition to core programs, WIOA provides States the \n\nopportunity to include other key one-stop partner programs such as the \n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Unemployment \n\nInsurance (UI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and \n\nPerkins Career Technical Education in a Combined State Plan. The law \n\nalso includes a common performance accountability system applicable to \n\nall of the core programs.\n\n    The remainder of WIOA title I authorizes the adult, dislocated \n\nworker, and youth formula programs; the State and local workforce \n\ndevelopment (formerly investment) boards; the designation of regions \n\nand local areas; local plans; the one-stop system; national programs, \n\nincluding Job Corps, YouthBuild, Indian and Native American programs, \n\nand Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) programs; technical \n\nassistance and evaluations; and general administrative provisions \n\ncurrently authorized under title I of WIA. Title II retains and amends \n\nthe Adult Education and Family Literacy Program currently authorized \n\nunder title II of WIA. Title III contains amendments to the Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act relating to the ES and Workforce and Labor Market \n\nInformation System (WLMIS), and requires the Secretary to establish a \n\nWorkforce Information Advisory Council (WIAC). Title IV contains \n\n\n\namendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which were also included \n\nunder title IV of WIA; it also requires the Secretary of Labor to \n\nestablish an Advisory Committee on Increasing Competitive Integrated \n\nEmployment for Individuals with Disabilities. Finally, title V contains \n\ngeneral provisions similar to the provisions applicable under title V \n\nof WIA as well as the effective dates and transition provisions.\n\n    Since the enactment of WIOA, the Department has used a variety of \n\nmeans to coordinate with other Federal agencies that have roles and \n\nresponsibilities under the Act. The Department works closely with staff \n\nat ED and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on all \n\nshared policy and implementation matters. Key areas of collaboration \n\ninclude the Unified State Plan, performance reporting, one-stop service \n\ndelivery, and services to disconnected youth and to individuals with \n\ndisabilities. WIOA created an opportunity to enhance coordination and \n\ncollaboration across other Federal programs through the Combined State \n\nPlan and the Department meets with the other Federal agencies regarding \n\nthose plans.\n\n    Before publishing the NPRM, the Department solicited broad input \n\nthrough a variety of mechanisms including:\n\n     Issued Training and Employment Notice (TEN) No. 05-14 to \n\nnotify the public workforce system that WIOA was enacted, accompanied \n\nby a statutory implementation timeline, a fact sheet that identified \n\nkey reforms to the public workforce system, and a list of frequently \n\nasked questions.\n\n     Issued TEN No. 06-14 to announce a series of webinars to \n\nengage WIOA stakeholders in implementation of WIOA.\n\n     Issued TEN No. 12-14 to provide guidance to States and \n\nother recipients of funds under title I of WIA on the use and reporting \n\nof PY 2014 funds for planning and implementation activities associated \n\nwith the transition to WIOA.\n\n     Established a WIOA Resource Page (www.doleta.gov/WIOA) to \n\nprovide updated information related to WIOA implementation to the \n\npublic workforce system and stakeholders;\n\n     Established a dedicated email address for the public \n\nworkforce system and stakeholders to ask questions and offer ideas \n\nrelated to WIOA (DOL.WIOA@dol.gov);\n\n     Conducted, in conjunction with ED and HHS outreach calls, \n\nwebinars, and stakeholder and in-person town halls in each ETA region. \n\nThe Department and its Federal partners hosted 10 town halls across the \n\ncountry, reaching over 2,000 system leaders and staff representing core \n\nprograms and one-stop partners, employers, and performance staff. This \n\nhttp://www.doleta.gov/WIOA\nmailto:DOL.WIOA@dol.gov\n\n\nincluded a town hall with Indian and Native American leaders and \n\nmembership organizations serving Indians and Native Americans, \n\nHawaiians, and Alaskan Natives as well as a formal consultation with \n\nmembers of the Native American Employment and Training Advisory Council \n\nto the Secretary of Labor.\n\n     Conducted readiness assessments to implement WIOA in all \n\nStates and 70 local workforce areas to inform technical assistance.\n\nB. Major Changes From Current Workforce Investment Act of 1998\n\n    This section contains a summary of the major changes from the \n\ncurrent WIA. As indicated above, WIOA retains much of the structure of \n\nWIA.\n\n    Major changes in WIOA are:\n\n     Aligns Federal investments to support job seekers and \n\nemployers. The Act provides for States to prepare a single Unified \n\nState Plan that identifies a 4-year strategy for achieving the \n\nstrategic vision and goals of the State for preparing an educated and \n\nskilled workforce and for meeting the skilled workforce needs of \n\nemployers. States govern the core programs as one system assessing \n\nstrategic needs and aligning them with service strategies to ensure the \n\nworkforce system meets employment and skill needs of all workers and \n\nemployers.\n\n     Streamlines the governing bodies that establish State, \n\nregional and local workforce investment priorities. WIOA makes State \n\nand Local Workforce\n\n[[Page 20694]]\n\nDevelopment Boards more agile and well positioned to meet local and \n\nregional employers' workforce needs by reducing the size of the boards \n\nand assigning them additional responsibilities to assist in the \n\nachievement of the State and local strategic workforce vision and \n\ngoals. The State Workforce Development Boards (State Boards) continue \n\nto have a majority of business representation and a business chair that \n\nwork for all workers and jobseekers, including low-skilled adults, \n\nyouth, and individuals with disabilities, while they foster innovation, \n\nand ensure streamlined operations and service delivery excellence.\n\n     Creates a common performance accountability system and \n\ninformation for job seekers and the public. WIOA ensures that Federal \n\ninvestments in employment, education, and training programs are \n\nevidence-based and data-driven, and accountable to participants and the \n\n\n\npublic. It establishes a performance accountability system that applies \n\nacross the core programs, by generally applying six primary indicators \n\nof performance: entry into unsubsidized employment at two points in \n\ntime, median earnings, attainment of post-secondary credentials, \n\nmeasurable skill gains, and effectiveness in serving employers.\n\n     Fosters regional collaboration to meet the needs of \n\nregional economies. WIOA promotes alignment of workforce development \n\nprograms with regional economic development strategies to meet the \n\nneeds of local and regional employers.\n\n     Enhances access to high quality services through the \n\nnetwork of one-stop system. WIOA helps jobseekers and employers acquire \n\nthe services they need in centers and online, clarifies the roles and \n\nresponsibilities of the one-stop partner programs, adds the TANF \n\nprogram as a required one-stop partner unless the Governor objects, \n\nrequires competitive selection of one-stop operators, and requires the \n\nuse by the one-stop system of a common one-stop delivery identifier or \n\nbrand that is to be developed by the Secretary of Labor.\n\n     Improves services to individuals with disabilities. WIOA \n\nstresses physical and programmatic accessibility, including the use of \n\naccessible technology to increase individuals with disabilities' access \n\nto high quality workforce services.\n\n     Makes key investments for disconnected youth. WIOA \n\nemphasizes services to disconnected youth to prepare them for \n\nsuccessful employment by requiring that a minimum of 75 percent of \n\nyouth formula program funds be used to help OSY, in contrast to the 30 \n\npercent required under WIA. WIOA increases OSYs' access to WIOA \n\nservices, including pre-apprenticeship opportunities that result in \n\nregistered apprenticeship. It adds a requirement that at least 20 \n\npercent of formula funds at the local level be used on work-based \n\ntraining activities such as summer jobs, on-the-job training (OJT), and \n\napprenticeship.\n\n     Helps Employers Find Workers with the Necessary Skills. \n\nWIOA contributes to economic growth and business expansion by ensuring \n\nthe workforce system is job-driven--matching employers with skilled \n\nindividuals. WIOA requires Local Boards to promote the use of industry \n\nand sector partnerships that include key stakeholders in an industry \n\ncluster or sector that work with public entities to identify and \n\naddress the workforce needs of multiple employers.\n\n    Additionally, successful implementation of many of the approaches \n\n\n\ncalled for within WIOA, such as career pathways and sector strategies, \n\nrequire robust relationships across programs and with businesses, \n\neconomic development, education and training institutions, including \n\ncommunity colleges and career and technical education, local entities, \n\nand supportive services agencies.\n\nC. Rule Format\n\n    The NPRM format reflects the Department's commitment to writing \n\nregulations that are reader-friendly. The Department has attempted to \n\nmake this NPRM clear and easy to understand. To this end, the \n\nregulatory text is presented in a ``question and answer'' format and \n\norganized consistent with the Act. While the Department has provided \n\ncross-references to the statute(s), the Department also has included \n\nthe Act's provisions in the answers for completeness.\n\n    While the Department has anticipated many issues that may arise and \n\nprovided appropriate directions, there are many other areas where the \n\nDepartment continues to weigh options. Thus, the Department raises \n\nquestions throughout the preamble where the Department seeks additional \n\ninformation or where the Department is weighing options and seek \n\ncomments.\n\nD. Legal Basis\n\n    On July 22, 2014, the President signed the Workforce Innovation \n\nOpportunity Act (WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128) into law. WIOA repeals WIA (29 \n\nU.S.C. 2801 et seq.). As a result, the WIA regulations no longer \n\nreflect current law. Section 503(f) of WIOA requires that the \n\nDepartment issue an NPRM and then a final rule that implements the \n\nchanges WIOA makes to the public workforce system in regulations. \n\nTherefore, DOL seeks to develop and issue a NPRM that proposes to \n\nimplement WIOA. The Department of Labor will issue regulations \n\nregarding the Section 188 Nondiscrimination provisions through separate \n\nrulemaking.\n\nIV. Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposal\n\nA. Part 603--Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program Disclosure \n\nof Confidential Unemployment Compensation Information Under WIOA Sec. \n\n116\n\nRelationship Between 20 CFR Part 603 and WIOA\n\n    The Department is amending its regulations at 20 CFR part 603 to \n\nhelp States comply with the WIOA. WIOA requires that States use \n\n``quarterly wage records'' in assessing the performance of certain \n\nFederally-funded employment and training programs.\n\n\n\n    States must make available performance reports for local areas and \n\nfor eligible training providers (ETPs) under title I of the WIOA. WIOA \n\nalso requires that States cooperate in evaluations, by the Departments \n\nof Labor and Education, of State programs overseen by those Federal \n\nagencies.\n\n    To help States comply with these requirements, the Department has \n\ndetermined that it would be useful to more clearly and specifically, \n\ndescribe in unemployment compensation (UC) confidentiality regulations, \n\nthe standards for disclosure between the State UC, workforce, and \n\neducation systems. This proposal amends current regulations to clarify, \n\nin a limited fashion, those State government officials with whom the \n\nState may share certain confidential information in order to carry out \n\nrequirements under the law. The regulations enumerate certain \n\nadditional public officials who may access confidential State wage \n\nrecords that are the basis for the State's performance reporting. \n\nEnsuring such access to these State records would allow State agencies \n\nto better manage the information for the purpose of making Federally-\n\nrequired reports on certain program outcomes, and to cooperate more \n\neffectively and be more informative with respect to Federal program \n\nevaluations.\n\n    WIOA section (sec.) 116(i)(2) and proposed regulation Sec.  677.175 \n\n(a) require State workforce, training, and education programs to use \n\nquarterly wage records to measure the progress of\n\n[[Page 20695]]\n\nthe State on State and local performance accountability measures. Under \n\nWIA, the Department interpreted the reference to ``quarterly wage \n\nrecords'' in sec. 136(f)(2) to require States to use the confidential \n\nUC information in the employer-provided wage reports collected under \n\nsec. 1137 of the Social Security Act (SSA), 42 U.S.C. 1320b-7. (See 20 \n\nCFR 677.175.) These are the reports that the State UC agency obtains \n\nfrom employers for determining UC tax liability, monetary eligibility, \n\nor for cross-matching against State UC agencies' files to determine if \n\nimproper payments have been made. The Department adheres to this \n\ninterpretation in implementing WIOA sec. 116(i)(2).\n\n    The ``wage information'' defined in Sec.  603.2(k)--which the \n\nregulations allow State agencies to disclose under limited \n\ncircumstances--includes the three data categories or elements (wages, \n\nSSN(s), employer information) that States must use as their data source \n\nfor State and local performance reporting under WIOA. The proposed WIOA \n\n\n\nimplementing regulation at 20 CFR 677.175 (b) defines ``quarterly wage \n\nrecord information'' to include three data elements or categories of \n\ndata elements: (1) A program participant's SSN(s); (2) information \n\nabout the wages program participants earn after exiting from the \n\nprogram; and (3) the name, address, State and (when known) the Federal \n\nEmployer Identification Number (FEIN) of the employer paying those \n\nwages. The disclosure of such wage record data is governed by UC part \n\n603 regulations, which establish requirements for maintaining the \n\nconfidentiality of UC information along with standards for mandatory \n\nand permissive disclosure of such information.\n\n    Part 603 permits State agencies to disclose confidential UC \n\ninformation--including ``wage information''--to ``public officials'' \n\n(defined at Sec.  603.2(d)) under limited circumstances (defined under \n\nSec.  603.5), and authorizes such ``public officials,'' in turn, to use \n\nthe information to develop Federally-required performance reports.\n\n    As explained in greater detail below, the Department proposes \n\nchanges to Sec.  603.2 (definition of ``public official'') and Sec.  \n\n603.5 (governing disclosures to public officials), to help States \n\ncomply with WIOA's performance requirements, including the performance \n\nreports of the States, local areas, and ETPs. In addition, the \n\nDepartment proposes to amend Sec.  603.6 to add a provision requiring \n\ndisclosure to implement the new statutory requirement on State \n\ncooperation with certain DOL and ED evaluations. These changes would \n\nfacilitate States' obligations to report on performance through the use \n\nof quarterly wage records, and to cooperate in DOL and ED evaluations.\n\n    The amendments the Department is proposing to part 603 relate only \n\nto State agency disclosures necessary to comply with certain provisions \n\nof WIOA. The Department is not proposing to redefine or expand the \n\nconfidential State information--the confidential wage records or wage \n\ninformation--that is currently the basis for State performance \n\nreporting, and is not proposing to reduce in any way the significant \n\nprivacy protections and confidentiality requirements that currently \n\ngovern that information. The Department is not proposing to change any \n\nrequirements relating to the permissible or mandatory disclosure of \n\nconfidential UC information for any other purpose, or addressing any \n\ngeneral UC issues. We note, in particular, that nothing in these \n\nproposed regulations exempts disclosures made under these regulations \n\nfrom the safeguards and security requirements in Sec.  603.9, the \n\nrequirements in Sec.  603.10 governing agreements, or the requirements \n\nfor payment of costs under Sec.  603.8(a).\n\n    The Department invites comments on our proposed additions to part \n\n603, but will not consider or address comments on part 603 or other UC \n\n\n\nmatters that are outside the scope of this NPRM.\n\nSection 603.2(d)(2)-(5)\n\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  603.2(d)(2)-(5) expand the definition of who \n\nand what entities are considered ``public officials'' for purposes of \n\ncomplying with WIOA's requirements. Currently, Sec.  603.2(d) defines \n\n``public official'' as ``an official, agency, or public entity'' in the \n\nexecutive branch of government with ``responsibility for administering \n\nor enforcing a law,'' or ``an elected official in the Federal, State or \n\nlocal government.'' Proposed Sec.  603.5(e) allows disclosure to public \n\nofficials who need the information to carry out their official duties. \n\nThis exception allows State agencies that collect ``wage information'' \n\n(including the data required for performance reporting under WIOA sec. \n\n677.175) to provide that information to the State agencies responsible \n\nfor administering and reporting on the WIOA core programs and mandatory \n\none-stop partner programs. For example, State UC agencies, which are \n\ngoverned by part 603, may disclose confidential UC information to the \n\nState adult basic education agency for purposes of performing their \n\nofficial duties, as used in Sec.  603.5(e).\n\n    The proposed amendments to Sec.  603.2(d) would clearly enumerate \n\nthat ``public official'' includes officials from public post-secondary \n\neducational organizations, State performance accountability and \n\ncustomer information agencies, the chief elected officials (CEOs) of \n\nlocal Workforce Development Areas (as that term is used in WIOA sec. \n\n106), and a public State educational authority, agency, or institution. \n\nProposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2) would permit disclosure to public post-\n\nsecondary educational institutions, regardless of how those \n\ninstitutions are structured or organized under State law. The \n\nregulation, as proposed, specifically mentions three categories of \n\ninstitutions. Proposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2)(i) would permit disclosure to \n\npublic post-secondary educational institutions that are part of a \n\nState's executive branch, i.e., derive their authority either directly \n\nfrom the Governor or from an entity (State Board, commission, etc.) \n\nsomewhere in that line of authority. Proposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2)(ii) \n\nwould permit disclosure to public post-secondary educational \n\ninstitutions that are independent of the State's executive branch, \n\nwhich means those institutions whose directors derive their authority \n\neither directly from an elected official in the State other than the \n\nGovernor or from an entity (again, a State Board, commission, or other \n\nentity) in that line of authority. Proposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2)(ii) \n\ncovers any public post-secondary educational institution established \n\nand governed under State law, for example, a State Board of Regents. \n\nProposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2)(iii) would allow disclosure specifically to \n\nState technical colleges and community colleges. (Those institutions \n\n\n\nmay also be covered under (i) or (ii))\n\n    Proposed Sec.  603.2(d)(5) permits disclosure to a public State \n\neducational authority, agency or institution'' as the terms are used in \n\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to clarify that \n\nthe Department considers the heads of public institutions that derive \n\ntheir authority from a State educational authority or agency to be \n\n``public officials'' for purposes of part 603.\n\n    The Department proposes these changes to help States comply with \n\nWIOA's requirement to use wage records to measure performance (WIOA \n\nsec. 116(i)(2)) and to facilitate the performance reporting required \n\nfor ETPs under secs. 116(d) and 122 of WIOA. WIOA mandates the use of \n\nwage records to measure State and local performance. As long as the \n\nrecipients of the data adhere to all of the requirements in 20 CFR part \n\n603, this proposed section\n\n[[Page 20696]]\n\nwould permit States to make these disclosures to comply with WIOA \n\nrequirements for Federal, State, or local government reporting on \n\nprogram outcomes and for other specified purposes.\n\n    Non-public educational institutions, including non-profit or for-\n\nprofit educational institutions or other ETPs which are not subject to \n\nthe authority of the executive branch or another State elected official \n\nwould not be permitted to obtain confidential UC information, including \n\nwage information, under this authority because they are not public \n\nentities. Any disclosures of confidential UC information to those \n\nentities for purposes of complying with WIOA would have to be \n\nauthorized under the provisions of Sec.  603.5 other than Sec.  \n\n603.5(e). However, it is permissible and encouraged to develop \n\nprocesses or systems, such as the Wage Record Interchange System, to \n\nenable a State agency or State educational authority (including a State \n\nEducation Agency) that collects wage records to match program \n\nparticipant data with wage records, and to provide aggregate \n\nparticipant outcome data to non-governmental educational entities, \n\nincluding ETPs under title I of WIOA.\n\nSection 603.5(e)\n\n    Proposed Sec.  603.5(e), as amended, would assist State workforce \n\nand State education programs in complying with WIOA, and in particular \n\nwith WIOA's sec. 116 performance accountability responsibilities, by \n\nexplicitly stating that confidential UC information may be disclosed to \n\na ``public official'' as defined in Sec.  603.2(d)(2) for limited, \n\nspecified WIOA purposes.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  603.5(e), as amended, in conjunction with the \n\nrevised definition of ``public official'' under 603.2(d)(2), would \n\n\n\nenable State UC agencies to disclose confidential UC information to \n\nState and local agencies and other public officials authorized to carry \n\nout their responsibilities under WIOA for performance accountability, \n\nincluding audits and evaluations of the programs and other required \n\nreporting of outcomes, as described in proposed Sec.  603.2(d)(2). To \n\nenable States to comply with WIOA, State UI agencies, or other State \n\nagencies responsible for collection of wage record information, must \n\ncollaborate with the entities under WIOA that are required to use wage \n\nrecord data for performance to make the data available pursuant to part \n\n603.\n\n    The Department notes that the proposed amendment to Sec.  603.5(e) \n\nwould permit disclosure to a public official for purposes of \n\nperformance accountability of the entities on the State's eligible \n\ntraining provider list (ETPL). In addition, disclosure of confidential \n\nUC information for other programs' performance accountability purposes \n\n(e.g., TANF or SNAP) may be accomplished under existing Sec.  603.5, as \n\nthese entities are public officials and are performing their public \n\nduty, as defined in this section.\n\n    A new clause (iii) under proposed Sec.  603.5(e) would permit \n\ndisclosures ``as otherwise required for education or workforce training \n\nprogram performance accountability and reporting under Federal or State \n\nlaw.'' The Department intends that this provision apply only in the \n\nlimited instance where a Federal or State law requires performance \n\nreporting for which data covered by part 603 is needed in a way that is \n\nnot covered by the other WIOA-specific provisions. In those instances, \n\nthis provision would permit a State agency to disclose confidential UC \n\ninformation to a ``public official'' seeking the information to comply \n\nwith that statute.\n\nSection 603.6(8)\n\n    Proposed Sec.  603.6(8) makes the disclosure of confidential UC \n\ninformation for certain Federal evaluations mandatory when the \n\ndisclosure would not interfere with the efficient administration of \n\nState UC law. The Department proposes this change to Sec.  603.6 to \n\nimplement the requirement, under WIOA sec. 116(e)(4), that States \n\ncooperate, ``to the extent practicable,'' in the conduct of evaluations \n\nby either the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education. WIOA \n\nsec. 116(e)(4) defines cooperation to include ``the provision of data \n\n(in accordance with appropriate privacy protections established by the \n\nSecretary of Labor)''; this includes 20 CFR part 603 and any other \n\nprivacy protections the Secretary may establish. The proposed new \n\nregulation at Sec.  603.6(8) would implement these requirements for \n\npurposes of providing confidential UC information regulated by part \n\n603. The new regulation would require disclosure of confidential UC \n\n\n\ninformation to Federal officials, or their agents or contractors, \n\nrequesting such information in the course of an evaluation covered by \n\nWIOA Sec.  116(e)(4) and 116(e)(1), to the extent that such disclosure \n\nis ``practicable.''\n\n    In these cases, the Department interprets ``to the extent \n\npracticable'' to mean that the disclosure would not interfere with the \n\nefficient administration of State UC law. This standard is consistent \n\nwith the standard the regulation applies to disclosures under Sec.  \n\n603.5, in situations where the disclosure is permitted but a State must \n\ndetermine, first, that the disclosure would not interfere with the \n\nefficient administration of State UC law. In effect, the proposed \n\nprovision would require that State UC agencies make disclosures to \n\nFederal education and labor agencies carrying out evaluations when it \n\nwould not interfere with the efficient administration of the State UC \n\nlaw. The Department anticipates this cooperation and related \n\ndisclosures would include responding to surveys and allowing site \n\nvisits, as well as disclosure of confidential UC information needed for \n\nthe evaluation.\n\nB. Part 675--Introduction to the Regulations for the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Systems Under Title I of the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act\n\n    Proposed part 675 discusses the purpose of title I of the WIOA, \n\nexplains the format of the regulations governing title I, and provides \n\nadditional definitions which are not found and defined in the Act.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  675.100 describes the purposes of title I of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  675.200 outlines the structure of the proposed WIOA \n\nregulations.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  675.300 provides a list of proposed definitions that \n\nare applicable across the WIOA regulations.\n\n    In addition to the definitions in the WIOA regulations and at secs. \n\n3, 142, 166(b), 167(i), 170(a), 171(b), 203, 302, and 404 of WIOA, \n\nproposed Sec.  675.300 provides additional definitions that apply to \n\nthe programs and activities authorized and funded under title I of \n\nWIOA.\n\n    Included in this list of definitions, the Department proposes to \n\nadopt the following relevant definitions from the Office of Management \n\nand Budget's (OMB) ``Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost \n\nPrinciples and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards'' found at 2 CFR \n\npart 200: Contract, Contractor, Cooperative Agreement, Federal Award, \n\nFederal Financial Assistance, Grant Agreement, Non-Federal Entity, \n\nObligations, Pass-Through Entity, Recipient, Subaward, Subrecipient, \n\nUnliquidated Obligations, and Unobligated Balance. All other \n\n\n\ndefinitions at 2 CFR part 200 apply to these regulations where \n\nrelevant, but have not been included in this section.\n\n    Contract: The proposed definition for ``contract'' incorporates the \n\ndefinition established by OMB at 2 CFR 200.22. Specifically, the \n\nproposed term ``contract'' refers to the legal document that a non-\n\nFederal entity uses to purchase property or services used to carry out \n\nits duties under a grant authorized under WIOA. If the\n\n[[Page 20697]]\n\nDepartment determines that a particular transaction entered into by the \n\nentity is a Federal award or subaward it will not be considered a \n\ncontract.\n\n    Contractor: The proposed definition of ``contractor'' incorporates \n\nthe definition contained in OMB's Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.23. The \n\nUniform Guidance has replaced the term ``vendor'' with the term \n\n``contractor.'' As used in these regulations, the term ``contractor'' \n\nincludes entities that the Act refers to as ``vendors.'' Additionally, \n\nit is important to note that contractors are not subrecipients. \n\nAdditional guidance on distinguishing between a contractor and a \n\nsubrecipient can be found at 2 CFR 200.330.\n\n    Cooperative Agreement: The proposed definition of ``cooperative \n\nagreement'' incorporates the definition contained in the Uniform \n\nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.24.\n\n    Department or DOL: This proposed term refers to the United States \n\nDOL, its agencies, and organizational units.\n\n    Employment and Training Activity: As used in these regulations, the \n\nproposed term ``employment and training activity'' refers to any \n\nworkforce investment activities carried out for an adult or dislocated \n\nworker under sec. 134 of WIOA and 20 CFR part 678.\n\n    Equal Opportunity (EO) Data: This proposed term refers to the data \n\nrequired by the Department's regulations at 29 CFR part 37 implementing \n\nsec. 188 of WIOA.\n\n    ETA: This proposed term refers to the ETA, an agency of DOL, or its \n\nsuccessor organization.\n\n    Federal Award: This proposed definition incorporates the definition \n\nin the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.38.\n\n    Federal Financial Assistance: The proposed definition of ``Federal \n\nfinancial assistance'' incorporates the definition contained in the \n\nUniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.40.\n\n    Grant or Grant Agreement: The proposed definition of ``grant \n\nagreement'' incorporates the definition contained in the Uniform \n\nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.51. Because both WIOA and these regulations use \n\n``grant'' and ``grant agreement'' interchangabily, the inclusion of \n\n\n\nboth terms here clarifies that the terms are synonymous.\n\n    Grantee: The proposed definition of ``grantee'' refers to a \n\nrecipient of funds under a grant or grant agreement. Grantees are also \n\nreferred to as recipients in these regulations.\n\n    Individual with a Disability: This proposed definition adopts the \n\ndefinition from sec. 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as \n\namended, and is further defined at 29 CFR 37.4.\n\n    Labor Federation: This proposed definition remains unchanged from \n\nthe definition used in the regulations under WIA at 20 CFR 660.300.\n\n    Literacy: The proposed definition for ``literacy'' as used in these \n\nregulations is a measure of an individual's ability to participate and \n\nsuccessfully function both in the workplace and in society.\n\n    Local Board: This proposed definition clarifies that the term \n\n``Local Board'' as used in these regulations refers to the Local \n\nWorkforce Development Boards established under sec. 107 of WIOA.\n\n    Non-Federal Entity: The proposed definition of ``non-Federal \n\nentity'' incorporates the definition contained in the Department's \n\nExceptions to the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 2900.2.\n\n    Obligations: The definition of ``obligations'' incorporates the \n\ndefinition contained in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.71.\n\n    Outlying Area: The proposed term ``outlying area'' refers to those \n\nTerritories of the United States which are not within the definition of \n\n``State,'' including the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the \n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and, in certain \n\ncircumstances, the Republic of Palau.\n\n    Pass-through entity: The proposed definition of pass-through entity \n\nincorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.74.\n\n    Recipient: The proposed definition of ``recipient,'' which is \n\ndifferent than the current definition of recipient under WIA at 20 CFR \n\n660.300, incorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \n\n200.86.\n\n    Register: The proposed definition of ``register'' means the point \n\nat which an individual seeks more than minimal assistance from staff in \n\ntaking the next step towards self-sufficient employment. This is also \n\nwhen information that is used in performance information begins to be \n\ncollected. At a minimum, individuals must provide identifying \n\ninformation to be registered.\n\n    Secretary: This proposed term refers to the Secretary of the U.S. \n\nDOL, or their officially delegated designees.\n\n    Secretaries: This proposed term refers to the Secretaries of the \n\nU.S. DOL and the U.S. ED, or their officially designated designees.\n\n    Self-Certification: The proposed term ``self-certification'' refers \n\n\n\nto the certification made by an individual that they are eligible to \n\nreceive services under title I of WIOA.\n\n    State: The proposed term ``State'' refers to each of the several \n\nStates of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the \n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n    State Board: This proposed definition clarifies that the term \n\n``State Board'' as used in these regulations refers to the State Boards \n\nestablished under sec. 101 of WIOA\n\n    Subgrant or Subaward: This proposed term incorporates the \n\ndefinition of ``subaward'' in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.92. \n\nThis term replaces the term ``subgrant'' found in WIA at 20 CFR \n\n660.300. Because both WIOA and these regulations use ``subgrant'' and \n\n``subaward'' interchangeably, the inclusion of both terms here \n\nclarifies that the terms are synonymous.\n\n    Subrecipient: The proposed definition of ``subrecipient'' \n\nincorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.93. \n\nThis term is synonymous with the term ``subgrantee.''\n\n    Unliquidated Obligations: The proposed definition of ``unliquidated \n\nobligations'' incorporates the definition contained in the Uniform \n\nGuidance at 2 CFR 200.97.\n\n    Unobligated Balance: The proposed definition of ``unobligated \n\nbalance'' incorporates the definition in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \n\n200.98.\n\n    Wagner-Peyser Act: As used in these regulations, the proposed term \n\n``Wagner-Peyser Act'' refers to the Wagner-Peyser Act passed on June 6, \n\n1933, and codified at 29 U.S.C. 49, et seq.\n\n    WIA Regulations: The proposed term ``WIA Regulations'' as used in \n\nthis regulation or subsequently by the Department refers to the \n\nregulations 20 CFR parts 660-672. This definition is necessary because, \n\nas described in the introduction to these regulations, the Department \n\nhas chosen to retain the WIA regulations at parts 660-672 of title 20 \n\nof the CFR.\n\n    WIOA Regulations: This proposed term, as used in this regulation or \n\ngenerally by the Department means those regulations in 20 CFR parts 675 \n\nthrough 687, the Wagner-Peyser Act regulations in 20 CFR part 652, \n\nsubpart C, and the regulations implementing WIOA sec. 188 in 29 CFR \n\npart 37.\n\n    Workforce Investment Activities: The proposed term ``workforce \n\ninvestment activities'' is a general term that describes the broad \n\narray of activities and services provided to eligible adults, \n\ndislocated workers, and youth under secs. 129 and 134 of title I of \n\nWIOA.\n\n    Youth Workforce Investment Activity: The proposed term ``youth \n\n\n\nworkforce investment activity'' refers to those activities carried out \n\nfor eligible youth that fall within the broad definition of ``workforce \n\ninvestment activity.''\n\n[[Page 20698]]\n\nC.

Sec.  679.100(a)-(e) explain the purpose of the State \n\nBoard. The State Board represents a wide variety of individuals, \n\nbusinesses, and organizations throughout the State. WIOA is designed to \n\nhelp job seekers and workers access employment, education, training, \n\nand support services needed to succeed in the labor market, and match \n\nemployers with the skilled workers needed to compete in the global \n\neconomy. Further, the Department envisions a State Board that takes \n\nleadership to ensure that the one-stop system in each State is customer \n\ndriven. The State Board can help lead this effort by aligning Federal \n\ninvestments in job training, integrating service delivery across \n\nprograms, and ensuring that the workforce system is job-driven and \n\nmatches employers with skilled individuals.\n\n    The Department envisions that the State Board will serve as a \n\nconvener of State, regional, and local workforce system partners to \n\nenhance the capacity and performance of the workforce development \n\nsystem; align and improve employment, training, and education programs, \n\nand through these efforts, promote economic growth.\n\n    The State Board must be a strategic convener that promotes \n\npartnerships and engages key stakeholders. This role can only be \n\naccomplished if each State Board member is an active participant in the \n\nbusiness of the board. State Board members must establish a platform in \n\nwhich all members actively participate and collaborate closely with the \n\nrequired partners of the workforce development system, including public \n\nand private organizations. This engagement is crucial in the State \n\nBoard's role to help integrate and align a more effective job-driven \n\nworkforce investment system that invests in the connection between \n\neducation and career preparation.\n\nSection 679.100 What is the vision and purpose of the State Board?\n\n    A key goal of Federally-funded training programs is to get more \n\n\n\nAmericans ready to work with marketable skills and support businesses \n\nto find workers with the skills that are needed. The role of the State \n\nBoard in achieving this goal includes engaging employers, education \n\nproviders, economic development, and other stakeholders to help the \n\nworkforce development system achieve the purpose of WIOA and the \n\nState's strategic and operational vision and goals outlined in the \n\nState Plan. The Department encourages the State Board to develop a \n\ncomprehensive and high-quality workforce development system by working \n\nwith its workforce, education, business, and other partners to improve \n\nand align employment, training, and education programs under WIOA.\n\n    The Department encourages the State to take a broad and strategic \n\nview when considering representatives of the State Board, and also in \n\nestablishing processes which it will use to include necessary \n\nperspectives in carrying out State Board functions. For example, \n\nalignment of required one-stop partner investments is essential to \n\nachieving strategic and programmatic alignment at the State, regional, \n\nand local level. Further, States are encouraged to examine factors like \n\nthe natural bounds of regional economies, commuting patterns, and how \n\neconomic sectors impact the State, which may benefit from inputs either \n\nfrom formal members of the board, or through other engagement. Further, \n\na broad geographic representation as well as a reflection of diversity \n\nof populations within the State is critical.\n\nSection 679.110 What is the State Workforce Development Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110 describes the membership requirements of the \n\nState Board. WIOA sec. 101(b) uses the terms ``representative'' and \n\n``representatives'' in several places. In this section the Department \n\ninterprets ``representatives'' to mean two or more individuals and \n\n``representative'' as one individual.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(a) explains that States must establish State \n\nBoards in accordance to the requirements of WIOA sec. 101 and these \n\nregulations. This proposed section retains the same requirements found \n\nat 20 CFR 661.200(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b) generally requires, in accordance with \n\nsec. 101(b)(2) of WIOA, that the State Board membership represent the \n\ndiverse geographic areas of the State. Employers' and workers' \n\nchallenges and needs differ among the urban, rural, and suburban areas \n\nof the States due to demographics, labor market information and \n\nconditions, and business and worker needs and access to the workforce \n\ndevelopment system. Accordingly, the Department strongly encourages \n\nthat each category of membership on the Board--the members of the State \n\nlegislature, business representative, workforce and labor \n\n\n\nrepresentatives, and State and local officials--represent the diverse \n\ngeographic areas of the State to ensure that the workforce development \n\nsystem meets the education, employment, and skill needs of workers, \n\njobseekers, and businesses, no matter their location in the State.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(1) and (2) implement secs. 101(1)(A) and \n\n(B) of WIOA by requiring that the board include the Governor of the \n\nState and one member of each chamber of the State legislature.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C), implementing sec. \n\n101(b)(1)(C)(i) of WIOA, require the majority of State Board \n\nrepresentatives to be from businesses or organizations in the State. \n\nThese representatives must either be the owner or chief executive of \n\nthe business or be an executive with optimum policy-making or hiring \n\nauthority as defined in proposed Sec.  679.120. These representatives \n\nmust also come from businesses or organizations that represent \n\nbusinesses which provide employment and training opportunities that \n\ninclude high-quality, work-relevant training, and development \n\nopportunities in in-demand industry sectors or occupations. Work-\n\nrelevant and development opportunities may include customized training, \n\nregistered apprenticeship, or OJT. Finally, the Governor must appoint \n\nthese members based on nominations from business organizations and \n\ntrade associations in the State. The Department envisions that these \n\nmembers will be individuals that will be able to drive the board to \n\nalign the workforce investment, education, and economic development \n\nsystems in support of a comprehensive, accessible, and high-quality \n\nworkforce development system.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(3)(i)(D) requires, at a minimum, that one \n\nmember of the State Board represent small business as defined by the \n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. Small businesses are a critical \n\ncomponent of and major contributor to the strength of local economies \n\nand present new employment opportunities. The Department proposes to \n\nrequire a small business representative because the presence of at \n\nleast one small business representative on the State Board will allow \n\nthe board as a whole to more readily receive the unique perspectives, \n\nexperiences, and needs of small businesses.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) require that not \n\nless than 20\n\n[[Page 20699]]\n\npercent of the members of the State Board be representatives of the \n\nworkforce. Such representatives must include representatives from labor \n\norganizations and registered apprenticeship programs within the State, \n\n\n\nin accordance with sec. 101(b)(1)(ii). This provision maintains WIA's \n\nemphasis and requirement that State Board representatives include \n\nmembers of the workforce and labor organizations. The Department \n\nanticipates that the inclusion of workforce and labor representatives \n\nwill foster cooperation between labor and management, strengthening the \n\noperation and effectiveness of the State workforce development system. \n\nThis proposed section also encourages representation from CBOs that \n\nhave demonstrated experience and expertise, as defined in proposed \n\nSec.  679.120, in addressing the employment, training, or education \n\nneeds of individuals with barriers to employment across the State \n\nincluding organizations that serve veterans or that provide or support \n\ncompetitive, integrated employment for individuals with disabilities, \n\nand organizations that have demonstrated experience and expertise in \n\naddressing the employment, training, or education needs of eligible \n\nyouth, including organizations that serve OSY.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(3)(iii)(A)(1) and (2), implementing WIOA \n\nsec. 101(b)(1)(iii)(I), require the Governor to appoint to the State \n\nBoard representatives of government that include the lead State \n\nofficials with primary responsibility for each of the core programs and \n\ntwo or more CEOs that represent both cities and counties, where \n\nappropriate. The inclusion of State officials with primary \n\nresponsibility for each of the core programs and CEOs on the State \n\nBoard is important so that they can support and improve the service \n\ndelivery of each core program through their experience in workforce \n\ninvestment activities and positions as public leaders. This provision \n\nalso requires that where the State official with primary responsibility \n\nfor a core program represents more than one core program, that official \n\nmust ensure adequate representation on the State Board of the needs of \n\nall the core programs under their jurisdiction. Additionally, the CEOs \n\nmust be able to represent their geographic area such as their \n\nsurrounding cities and counties in the area.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(b)(3)(iii)(B), in accordance with WIOA sec. \n\n101(b)(1)(C)(iii)(II), allows the Governor to designate other \n\nrepresentatives and officials to the Board, including but not limited \n\nto, representatives and officials such as State agency officials from \n\nagencies that are responsible for one-stop partners, State agency \n\nofficials responsible for economic development or juvenile justice \n\nprograms, individuals who represent an Indian tribe or tribal \n\norganizations, and State agency officials responsible for education \n\nprograms.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(c), implementing sec. 101(c) of WIOA, \n\nrequires the Governor to select a chairperson for the State Board from \n\n\n\nthe business representatives on the board. This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.200(g).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(d) requires the Governor to establish by-\n\nlaws that help improve operations of the State Board. Proposed Sec.  \n\n679.110(d)(1) through (7) require that at a minimum the by-laws address \n\nthe nomination process used by the Governor to select the State Board \n\nchair and members, term limitations and how the term appointments will \n\nbe staggered to ensure only a portion of memberships expire in a given \n\nyear, the process to notify the Governor of a board member vacancy to \n\nensure a prompt nominee, the proxy and alternative designee process \n\nthat will be used when a board member is unable to attend a meeting and \n\nassigns a designee, brokers relationships with stakeholders, and any \n\nother conditions governing appointment or membership on the State Board \n\nas deemed appropriate by the Governor. In addition to these required \n\nelements, the Governor must include any additional requirements in the \n\nboard's by-laws that he or she believes is necessary to ensure the \n\norderly administration and functioning of the board. An effective State \n\nBoard establishes clear roles, responsibilities, procedures, and \n\nexpectations through its by-laws, and that these requirements will help \n\nState Boards to be more agile and proactive in reacting to board \n\nturnover, increase board participation when board members are not able \n\nto physically attend board meetings, improve board functionality, and \n\nhelp ensure that the public is informed about the operation of the \n\nboard.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(e) requires, as a general condition of State \n\nBoard membership, that members who represent the non-business \n\norganizations, agencies, or other entities described in proposed Sec.  \n\n679.110(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) have optimum policy-making authority. \n\nBecause WIOA sec. 101(d) adds State Board functions, such as \n\nidentifying and disseminating information on best practices and \n\ndeveloping and reviewing statewide policies affecting the coordinated \n\nprovision of services through the State's one-stop delivery system, all \n\nmembers, not just those representing the business community, should \n\nhave optimum policy-making authority to accomplish the purposes of WIOA \n\nand conduct the State Board required functions.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(f) implements the multiple-entity \n\nrepresentation limitations for State Board members at WIOA sec. \n\n101(b)(3). Robust representation in each of the categories is essential \n\nto ensure that the State Board benefits from the diversity and \n\nexperience of board members.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(f)(1) explains that a State Board member may \n\n\n\nnot represent more than one of the three membership categories: \n\nBusiness representatives, workforce representatives, or government \n\nrepresentatives. For example, one member could not serve as a business \n\nrepresentative and a joint labor-management apprenticeship program even \n\nif the member would otherwise satisfy the criteria for both categories.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(f)(2) explains that a State Board member may \n\nnot serve as a representative of more than one subcategory under \n\n(b)(3)(ii). Under this provision, a single board member could not serve \n\nas a representative of an organized labor organization and an \n\napprenticeship program (or the optional subcategories) even if the \n\nmember would otherwise satisfy the criteria for either category.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(f)(3) prohibits a government representative \n\nfrom serving as a representative of more than one subcategory under \n\n(b)(3)(iii). However, where a single government agency is responsible \n\nfor multiple required programs, the head of the agency may represent \n\neach of the required programs. In some instances, it would be \n\nappropriate and beneficial for one representative to represent multiple \n\nprograms on the State Board. For example, the head of a State Workforce \n\nAgency might represent both the WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser \n\nprograms. This arrangement could serve to improve integration of these \n\ntwo programs and/or help the State Board better achieve the colocation \n\nrequirements at WIOA sec. 123(c)(3). In other instances, such an \n\narrangement would be less beneficial. For example, where vocational \n\nrehabilitation services fall under the State Workforce Agency, \n\nappointing a single representative to satisfy the membership \n\nrequirements of WIOA title I, Wagner-Peyser, and vocational \n\nrehabilitation services may limit the voice and influence of a core \n\nprogram partner. The Department encourages Governors to use discretion\n\n[[Page 20700]]\n\nwhen appointing board members to represent multiple subcategories under \n\n(b)(3)(iii).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.110(g) requires that all required board members \n\nhave voting privileges and allows the option for the Governor to convey \n\nvoting privileges to non-required members. All required board members \n\nmust have a voice in the State Board's decisions to ensure that the \n\ninterests of all members of the community represented by the required \n\nmembers are taken into account by the board. Requiring voting rights \n\nallows the required board members to have an effect on the State \n\nBoard's key decisions and initiatives and enables the required board \n\nmembers to effectively represent the individuals and organizations of \n\ntheir communities. This proposed section also permits the Governor to \n\n\n\ngrant voting privileges to the non-required members of the board, and \n\nthe Department encourages the Governor to do so if doing so, in their \n\nopinion, would further the mission and goals of the board.\n\nSection 679.120 What is meant by the terms ``optimum-policy-making \n\nauthority'' and ``demonstrated experience and expertise''?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.120(a) defines the term ``optimum policy-making \n\nauthority'' as an individual who can reasonably be expected to speak \n\naffirmatively on behalf of the entity he or she represents and to \n\ncommit that entity to a chosen course of action. This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.203(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.120(b) defines the term ``demonstrated \n\nexperience and expertise'' as an individual who has documented \n\nleadership in developing or implementing workforce development, human \n\nresources, training and development, or a core program function. WIOA \n\nsec. 101(d) adds new State Board functions, such as the development of \n\nstrategies for aligning technology and data systems across one-stop \n\npartner programs to enhance service delivery and improve efficiencies \n\nin reporting on performance accountability measures. This provision \n\nwill ensure that the State Board will include members that will assist \n\nthe board in fulfilling these functions. The Department seeks public \n\ncomment on how to further define ``demonstrated experience and \n\nexpertise'' and examples of the types of qualifications that would meet \n\nsuch a definition.\n\nSection 679.130 What are the functions of the State Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130 implements sec. 101(d) of WIOA and describes \n\nthe role and functions of the State Board. Proposed Sec.  679.130(a), \n\n(d) through (e), and (g) through (k) reiterate the relevant statutory \n\nrequirements at secs. 101(d)(1), (4)-(5), and (7)-(11). These functions \n\nare the primary functions of the State Board.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130 is consistent with WIOA's statutory \n\nrequirement that the State Board must assist the Governor in the \n\ndevelopment, implementation, and modification of the 4-year State Plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(b) is consistent with WIOA sec. 101(d)(2) \n\nand reiterates the statutory requirements. The proposed regulation \n\nstates the review of statewide policies, programs, and recommendations \n\non actions that must be taken by the State to align workforce \n\ndevelopment programs to support a comprehensive and streamlined \n\nworkforce development system. Such review of policies, programs, and \n\nrecommendations must include a review and provision of comments on the \n\nState plans, if any, for programs and activities of one-stop partners \n\nthat are not core programs.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(c)(1) through (7) are consistent with WIOA \n\n\n\nsecs. 101(d)(3)(A) through (G) and reiterate WIOA's requirements that \n\nthe State Board assist the Governor in development and continuous \n\nimprovement of the State's workforce development system, including \n\nremoving barriers to aligning programs and activities, developing \n\ncareer pathways to support individuals to retain and enter employment, \n\ndeveloping customer outreach strategies, identifying regions and \n\ndesignating local workforce areas, developing and continuously \n\nimproving the one-stop system, and developing strategies to train and \n\ninform staff.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(d) and (e) reiterate statutory language \n\nrequiring State Boards to assist in the development of State \n\nperformance and accountability measures and to identify and disseminate \n\nbest practices.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(f)(1) through (3) are consistent with WIOA \n\nsecs. 101(d)(6)(A) through (C) to assist in the development and review \n\nof statewide policies on coordinated service provisions, which includes \n\ncriteria for Local Boards to assess one-stop centers, allocation of \n\none-stop center infrastructure funds, and the roles and contributions \n\nof one-stop partners within the one-stop delivery system. In addition, \n\nit is important for the State Board to consult with CEOs and Local \n\nBoards when establishing objective criteria and procedures for Local \n\nBoards to use when certifying one-stop centers. Where Local Boards \n\nserve as the one-stop operator, the State Board must use such criteria \n\nto assess and certify the one-stop center to avoid inherent conflicts \n\nof interest in a Local Board assessing itself.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(g) through (k) reiterate statutory language \n\nrequiring State Boards to assist in the development of strategies for \n\ntechnological improvements to improve access and quality of service, \n\nalign technology and data systems across one-stop partner programs to \n\nimprove service delivery and effectiveness in reporting on performance \n\naccountability, develop allocation formulas for distribution of adult \n\nand youth programs, and in accordance with WIOA and these regulations, \n\nprepare the annual report and develope the statewide WLMIS.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.130(l) is consistent with WIOA sec. 101(d)(12). \n\nThis proposed regulation requires the State Board to assist the \n\nGovernor in the development of other policies that promote statewide \n\nobjectives and enhance the performance of the workforce development \n\nsystem in the State.\n\nSection 679.140 How does the State Board meet its requirement to \n\nconduct business in an open manner under ``sunshine provision'' of the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act sec. 101(g)?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.140 implements sec. 101(g) of WIOA, requires \n\n\n\nthat the State Board conduct its business in an open and transparent \n\nmanner, and describes several pieces of information that the board is \n\nrequired to provide to ensure transparency.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.140(b)(1) through (4) requires the State Board \n\nto make certain information available on a regular basis to ensure that \n\nit is conducting its business in an open manner. Transparency promotes \n\naccountability and provides valuable information to citizens on the \n\nFederal, State, and local government's activities. Therefore, the State \n\nBoard must make available to the public on a regular basis, through \n\nelectronic means and open meetings, information about State Board \n\nactivities such as the State Plan, modifications to the State Plan, \n\nboard membership, the board's by-laws, the minutes of meetings. This \n\ninformation must be easily accessed by interested parties. Ensuring \n\nthat this information is widely available promotes transparency and\n\n[[Page 20701]]\n\nprovides access to the public on how the State Board works to align, \n\nintegrate, and continuously improve the workforce development system.\n\nSection 679.150 Under what circumstances may the Governor select an \n\nalternative entity in place of the State Workforce Development Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.150(a) and (b) implement the requirements of \n\nWIOA sec. 101(e)(1) and describe the circumstances by which the \n\nGovernor may select an alternate entity in place of a State Board. \n\nParagraph (b) lists the conditions that must be met if a State uses an \n\nalternative entity in place of the State Board and requires that the \n\nentity meets the requirements of Sec.  679.110.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.150 (c)(1) through (3) stipulate that if the \n\nalternative entity does not provide representatives for each of the \n\ncategories required under WIOA sec. 101(b), the State Plan must explain \n\nthe manner in which the State will ensure an ongoing role for any \n\nunrepresented membership group in the workforce development system. The \n\nproposed section further requires that the State Board ensure that the \n\nalternative entity maintain a meaningful, ongoing role for \n\nunrepresented membership groups, including entities carrying out the \n\ncore programs, and to inform the Board's actions.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.150(d) stipulates if the membership structure of \n\nthe alternative entity had a significant change after August 7, 1998, \n\nthe entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the \n\nState Board. In such a case, the Governor must establish a new State \n\nBoard which meets all of the criteria of WIOA sec. 101(b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.150 (e)(1) and (2) define a significant change \n\nin the membership structure which includes a change in the organization \n\n\n\nof the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented \n\non the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative \n\nentity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal \n\norganization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the \n\nrequired change to the document has or has not been made. This proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.210(e).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.150(f) stipulates all State Board references in \n\n20 CFR parts 675 through 687 also apply to an alternative entity used \n\nby a State. This proposed section implements sec. 101(e)(2) of WIOA.\n\nSection 679.160 Under what circumstances may the State Board hire \n\nstaff?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.160 implements sec. 101(h) and describes the \n\nboard's authority to hire staff. Per proposed Sec.  679.160(c), the pay \n\nprovided to the director and staff hired by the board is subject to the \n\nlimitations on the payment of salary and bonuses described in WIOA sec. \n\n194(15).\n\n2. Subpart B--Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Local Governance \n\n(Workforce Development Areas)\n\n    The WIOA envisions a workforce development system that is customer-\n\nfocused on both the job seeker and business, and is able to anticipate \n\nand respond to the needs of regional economies. It requires Workforce \n\nDevelopment Boards and CEOs to design and govern the system regionally, \n\naligning workforce policies and services with regional economies and \n\nsupporting service delivery strategies tailored to these needs. To \n\nsupport this regional approach, WIOA requires States to identify \n\nintrastate and interstate regions which may be comprised of more than \n\none local area, and requires local areas to plan regionally. WIOA \n\nenvisions a regional system where not only do local areas plan \n\nregionally, but workforce system leaders partner and provide leadership \n\nas part of comprehensive, regional workforce and economic strategies. \n\nThis subpart provides the requirements for designation of regions and \n\nlocal areas under WIOA.\n\nSection 679.200 What is the purpose of a region?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.200 describes the purpose of requiring States to \n\nidentify regions: to align workforce development resources to regional \n\neconomies to ensure coordinated and efficient services to both job \n\nseekers and employers. WIOA requires States to establish regions in \n\norder to ensure that training and ES support economic growth and \n\nrelated employment opportunities and are meeting the skill competency \n\nrequirements of the regions. The development of comprehensive regional \n\npartnerships facilitates alignment of workforce development activities \n\n\n\nwith regional economic development activities, and better supports the \n\nexecution and implementation of sector strategies and career pathways. \n\nRegional cooperation may also lower costs and increase the \n\neffectiveness of service delivery to businesses that span more than one \n\nlocal workforce development area within a region and to job seekers \n\nthrough coordination of shared services, processes, and operations. The \n\nDepartment encourages States to use these processes to identify any \n\nperformance, fiscal, or planning challenges and to ensure that local \n\nand regional planning areas are aligned to support improved service \n\ndelivery, improved training and employment outcomes, better meet \n\nemployer needs, and greater effectiveness and efficiency in achieving \n\nthese outcomes.\n\nSection 679.210 What are the requirements for identifying a region?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210 outlines the requirements for identifying a \n\nregion.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(a) requires that the Governor assign local \n\nareas to a region prior to the submission of the State Unified or \n\nCombined Plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(b) explains that the Governor must develop a \n\npolicy for designation of a region prior to submission of the State \n\nUnified or Combined Plan, in order to receive WIOA title I-B adult, \n\ndislocated worker, and youth allotments. The regional assignment is \n\nimportant because regional economic development areas do not \n\nnecessarily correspond to State, county, or local workforce development \n\nareas, or municipal boundaries.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(b) clarifies the required factors that a \n\nGovernor must consider when identifying a region and the parties the \n\nGovernor must consult, implementing WIOA sec. 106(a)(1). The \n\nconsiderations for identifying a planning region are consistent with \n\nthose for local area designation outlined in proposed Sec.  679.240(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(c) provides additional criteria the Governor \n\nmay consider when identifying regions. These additional criteria, which \n\nprovide a more comprehensive picture of regional economies and labor \n\nmarkets, provide additional data points to inform the Governor's \n\ndecision to assign local areas to regions. However, the Department \n\nseeks comment on the appropriateness of these factors and requests \n\nsuggestions of additional data points for defining a regional economy \n\nand labor market.\n\n    The Department has included ``population centers'' in proposed \n\nSec.  679.210(c)(1) because they and their contiguous areas of growth \n\nare a basic factor distinguishing economic development areas and \n\n\n\nplanning regions.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(c)(2) allows the consideration of \n\n``commuting patterns'' because commuting pattern data can show the \n\nmovement of workers from their residence to their workplace. A\n\n[[Page 20702]]\n\nstrong flow of commuters from one local area, municipality, or county \n\ninto another is an indication of the economic interdependence of the \n\ntwo areas.\n\n    ``Land ownership'' is included in proposed Sec.  679.210(c)(3) \n\nbecause land ownership can significantly affect the economic \n\ndevelopment potential of an area.\n\n    ``Industrial composition'' has been proposed as a factor in Sec.  \n\n679.210(c)(4) because it is primarily based upon industry employment \n\npatterns. The factors used in determining regions could be jobs by \n\nindustry and share of total employment by industry.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(c)(5) permits the Governor to consider \n\n``location quotients,'' which are ratios that could be computed by \n\ndividing a local area's percentage of employment in a particular \n\nindustry by the State's percentage of employment in a particular \n\nindustry. The economic base of a local area includes those industries \n\nin which the local area has a higher proportion of employment than the \n\nState as a whole, or a higher location quotient. Adjacent local areas \n\nwith similar economic bases are strong candidates for placement in the \n\nsame region.\n\n    ``Labor force conditions'' is proposed as a factor in Sec.  \n\n679.210(c)(6). Local area labor force employment and unemployment data \n\ncould provide a measure of labor availability throughout the State. \n\nAdjacent local areas with similar labor force characteristics, such as \n\nunemployment rates, might have similar workforce/economic development \n\nneeds, thus joining those areas into a region may be beneficial.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(c)(7) suggests that the Governor consider \n\n``geographic boundaries'' when setting regions because they may serve \n\nto facilitate or hinder the movement of people and commerce between \n\nareas, thereby naturally delineating regional boundaries.\n\n    Finally, proposed Sec.  679.210(c)(8) indicates that the Secretary \n\nmay suggest additional factors in future guidance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.210(d), implementing sec. 106(a)(2) of WIOA, \n\noutlines the types of regions and how local areas may be assigned to \n\nregions. A region may consist of a single local area, two or more \n\ncontiguous local areas with a State, or two or more contiguous local \n\nareas in two or more States. When the Governor(s) assigns two or more \n\n\n\nlocal areas to a region, the region, per WIOA sec. 3(48), is considered \n\na planning region, which is required to coordinate regional service \n\nstrategies, regional sector initiatives, the collection and analysis of \n\nregional labor market data, administrative costs, transportation, \n\npartnership with economic develop agencies, and the negotiation of \n\nlocal performance consistent with the regional planning requirements at \n\nSec.  679.510. A single local area may not be split across two planning \n\nregions. Local areas must be contiguous in order to be a planning \n\nregion and effectively align economic and workforce development \n\nactivities and resources. The Department anticipates providing \n\nadditional guidance regarding the creation and management of interstate \n\nplanning regions.\n\nSection 679.220 What is the purpose of the local workforce development \n\narea?\n\n    Distinct from the regional designation, WIOA also provides for \n\nlocal workforce development areas. As described above, these local \n\nareas may be identified individually or in combination, as regions. \n\nProposed Sec.  679.220 describes the purpose of the local workforce \n\ndevelopment area (local area). The Governor must designate local areas \n\nin order to receive WIOA title I adult, dislocated worker, and youth \n\nallotments, as required by WIOA sec. 106. Local areas serve as a \n\njurisdiction for the administration of workforce development activities \n\nand execution of adult, dislocated worker, and youth funds allocated by \n\nthe State. States allocate workforce investment funds based on various \n\npopulation characteristics of the local area. Local areas may \n\ncorrespond to regions identified in WIOA sec. 106(a)(1) or may be \n\nsmaller geographic areas within a planning region, each with its own \n\nLocal Workforce Development Board.\n\nSection 679.230 What are the general procedural requirements for \n\ndesignation of local workforce development areas?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.230 describes the procedural requirements that \n\nthe Governor must use for the designation or redesignation of a local \n\nworkforce development area. Proposed Sec.  679.220 (a) through (c), \n\nimplementing WIOA sec. 106(b)(1)(A), requires the Governor to consult \n\nwith the State Board and CEO, and consider public comments from a wide \n\nrange of stakeholders consistent with provisions at WIOA sec. \n\n102(b)(2)(e)(iii)(II) as part of the process of identifying the local \n\narea. The Governor has the discretion to establish the process and \n\nprocedures to solicit comments that it determines appropriate; however \n\na wide-reaching, inclusive process allows sufficient time for \n\nstakeholders to provide substantive comments that will enable the \n\nGovernor to receive meaningful feedback from all interested \n\n\n\nstakeholders, ensuring that the Governor is able to consider all \n\nrelevant information, data, and opinions before making a decision to \n\ndesignate or redesignate a local area.\n\nSection 679.240 What are the substantive requirements for designation \n\nof local workforce development areas that were not designated as local \n\nareas under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.240 provides the substantive requirements that \n\nGovernor must use for the designation or redesignation of local \n\nworkforce development areas.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.240(a) explains that the Governor must develop a \n\npolicy for designation or redesignation of local workforce development \n\nareas, including the factors that the Governor must consider. The \n\nstatute requires that the Governor designate local areas that ``are \n\nconsistent'' with labor market and regional economic development areas: \n\nThe Department interprets this to mean that within a local area, there \n\nmust be common labor markets and economic development areas. Better \n\nintegration between the workforce and economic development systems \n\nserves to best connect the employment needs of workers with the skilled \n\nworkforce needs of employers. This section implements sec. 106(b)(1)(B) \n\nof WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.240(b) permits the Governor to approve a local \n\narea designation request from any unit of local government, including a \n\ncombination of multiple units. This provision implements sec. 106(b)(4) \n\nof WIOA and retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.250(c). \n\nProposed paragraph (c) permits the Governor to redesignate a local area \n\nthat has been designated or redesignated under Sec.  679.240(a) or has \n\nbeen designated under Sec.  679.250(a) or (c) if the local area \n\nrequests, and the Governor approves, the redesignation.\n\nSection 679.250 What are the requirements for initial and subsequent \n\ndesignation of workforce development areas that had been designated as \n\nlocal areas under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250 describes the requirements for initial and \n\nsubsequent designation of local areas that had been designated as local \n\nareas under WIA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(a) implements sec. 106(b)(2) of WIOA that \n\nrequires, during the first 2 full PYs following the enactment of WIOA, \n\na Governor is to approve a request for initial designation from any \n\nlocal area designated as a local area under WIA as long as the entity\n\n[[Page 20703]]\n\nwas designated a local area under WIA, performed successfully, and \n\nmaintained sustained fiscal integrity for 2 years prior to the \n\n\n\nenactment of WIOA. This provision requires the Governor to continue the \n\ndesignation of local areas that performed well and maintained sound \n\nfiscal practices under WIA. If a local area that was designated under \n\nWIA requests initial designation under WIOA but does not meet all of \n\nthe requirements of Sec.  679.250(a), the Governor has the discretion \n\nto approve the initial designation under WIOA or to redesignate the \n\nlocal area pursuant to the procedures described in Sec.  679.240.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(b) clarifies that initial designation \n\napplies to PYs 2015 and 2016, as per WIOA sec. 106.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(c), in accordance with sec. 106(b)(3) of \n\nWIOA, describes the requirements for the subsequent designation of \n\nlocal workforce development areas that were initially designated under \n\nSec.  679.250(a). Specifically, the Governor must approve requests for \n\nsubsequent designation as long as the local area performed \n\nsuccessfully, sustained fiscal integrity, and in the case of a local \n\narea in a planning region, met the planning region requirements during \n\nthe 2-year period of initial designation. Local areas that are able to \n\ndemonstrate successful performance and fiscal integrity must be \n\npermitted to continue to operate and may not be redesignated without \n\nthe consent of the Local Board and CEO in the local area.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(d) describes the role of the Governor in \n\nreviewing a local area's subsequent designation. Paragraph (d)(1) \n\npermits the Governor to evaluate a local area at any time to ensure the \n\nlocal area continues to meet the requirements for subsequent \n\neligibility at paragraph (c). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the Governor to \n\nreview local areas to ensure they continue to satisfy the requirements \n\nat paragraph (2) as part of each 4-year State planning cycle. Sections \n\n116(g)(2)(A) and 184(b)(1) of WIOA describe the required actions that \n\nthe Governor must take in the event that a local workforce area fails \n\nto meet its negotiated levels of performance or does not comply with \n\nadministrative requirements, respectively. Under these provisions the \n\nGovernor retains the authority to take corrective action in light of \n\nfailure of performance or fiscal management short of redesignation, and \n\nis not required to redesignate a local area that has failed to maintain \n\nthe requirements of paragraph (c). Furthermore, the Governor may \n\nredesignate local areas at any time with the cooperation of the CEO and \n\nLocal Board in a given local area.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(e) presumes that local areas will be \n\nconsidered to have requested continued designation unless the CEO and \n\nthe Local Board directly notify the Governor that they no longer wish \n\noperate as a local area. This newly proposed paragraph reduces the \n\nadministrative burden of maintaining local area status, while still \n\nholding local areas accountable to the requirements of paragraph (c).\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(f) specifies that the requirements for \n\nsubsequent designation do not apply to local areas that are designated \n\nor redesignated under Sec.  679.240 or are single-area States \n\ndesignated under Sec.  679.270.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.250(g) clarifies that rural concentrated \n\nemployment programs are not eligible to apply for initial designation \n\nas a local area. WIOA allows any unit of local government (or \n\ncombination of units of local government) to request designation as a \n\nlocal area; however, unlike under WIA, this provision does not extend \n\nto rural concentrated employment programs.\n\nSection 679.260 What do the terms ``performed successfully'' and \n\n``sustained fiscal integrity'' mean for purposes of designating local \n\nareas?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.260 defines the terms ``performed successfully'' \n\nand ``sustained fiscal integrity'' used in Sec.  679.250. This section \n\nimplements sec. 106(e) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.260(a) defines the term ``performed \n\nsuccessfully'' for the purpose of initial designation to mean that the \n\nlocal area met or exceeded all performance levels the Governor \n\nnegotiated with Local Board and CEO under WIA sec. 136(c) for the last \n\n2 full PYs before the enactment of WIOA. It also requires that the \n\nlocal area not fail any individual measure for the last 2 consecutive \n\nPYs before the enactment of WIOA. Proposed Sec.  679.260(a)(1) requires \n\nthe Governor, in order to determine if a local area has performed \n\nsuccessfully, to have defined the terms ``met or exceeded'' and \n\n``failure'' at the time the performance levels were negotiated. \n\nProposed Sec.  679.260(a)(2) clarifies that the Governor may not \n\nretroactively apply any higher WIOA threshold to performance negotiated \n\nand achieved under WIA for the purposes of local area designation.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.260(b) defines the term ``performed \n\nsuccessfully'' for the purpose of subsequent designation to mean that \n\nthe local area met or exceeded the levels of performance the Governor \n\nnegotiated with Local Board and CEO for core indicators of performance \n\ndescribed at WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). It also requires the Governor to \n\nhave defined the terms ``met or exceeded'' and ``failure'' in the State \n\nPlan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.260(a) and (b) expand on the definition at WIOA \n\nsec. 106(e)(1) to ensure that the initial and subsequent designation of \n\nlocal areas is conducted in a fair and transparent manner by ensuring \n\nthat the local area's performance is judged on the contemporaneous \n\nstandards agreed to between the State and local area at the time rather \n\nthan under subsequently imposed performance standards.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.260(c) defines the term ``sustained fiscal \n\nintegrity'' for the purpose of determining initial and subsequent local \n\narea designation to mean that the Secretary has not made a formal \n\ndetermination that either the grant recipient or any other entity \n\ncharged with expending local area funds misexpended such funds due to \n\nwillful disregard of the requirements of the provision involved, gross \n\nnegligence, or failure to comply with accepted standards of \n\nadministration for the 2-year period preceding the determination.\n\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  679.250 and 679.260 allow for an orderly \n\ntransition from WIA to WIOA and protects the designation status of \n\nlocal areas that meet or exceed performance targets negotiated in good \n\nfaith under the relevant authorizing legislation while allowing the \n\nGovernor both to oversee properly the performance of the local areas \n\nand take action necessary to improve the area's performance in a timely \n\nfashion.\n\nSection 679.270 What are the special designation provisions for single-\n\narea States?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.270 outlines the special designation provisions \n\nfor single-area States. Under WIOA sec. 106(d), the Governor of any \n\nsingle-area State under WIA may choose to continue to designate the \n\nState as a single-State area. However, proposed Sec.  679.270(b) \n\nclarifies that the Governor must identify the single-area status of the \n\nState in its Unified or Combined State Plan and proposed Sec.  \n\n679.270(c) further clarifies that the State Board in a single-area \n\nState must continue to carry out the functions of the State and Local \n\nBoards. This section is intended to clarify single-area States' \n\nresponsibilities and functions: Key local functions, such as \n\nmonitoring; entering into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with one-\n\nstop partners; selecting one-stop operators; selecting eligible \n\nproviders of youth activities, career services and training services; \n\nand\n\n[[Page 20704]]\n\ncertifying one-stop centers, are essential to the proper functioning of \n\nthe public workforce system and remain so within single-area States.\n\nSection 679.280 How does the State fulfill the requirement to provide \n\nassistance to local areas within a planning region that wish to \n\nredesignate into a single local area?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.280 describes how the State fulfills the \n\nrequirement to provide assistance to local areas within a planning \n\nregion that wish to redesignate into a single local area.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.280(a) asserts that the State must authorize \n\n\n\nstatewide funds for transition activities when all local areas in a \n\nplanning region petition the Governor for redesignation as a single \n\nlocal area as required by WIOA sec. 106(b)(6). WIOA introduces \n\nredesignation assistance as a required statewide activity. This \n\nprovision will help local areas consolidate where appropriate for the \n\npurposes of cost savings and streamlined service delivery.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.280(b) clarifies that when statewide funds are \n\nexhausted in a given PY, the State may fulfill the requirement to \n\nprovide redesignation assistance in the following PY. This section \n\nprovides States with the flexibility to balance priorities while \n\nensuring local areas receive redesignation assistance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.280(c) provides examples of the activities that \n\nlocal areas may elect to pursue with the redesignation assistance \n\nreceived from the State. However, the State may establish policy on \n\nwhat other activities local areas may use funds received for the \n\npurposes of redesignation or leave such determination to the local \n\nareas.\n\nSection 679.290 What right does an entity have to appeal the Governor's \n\ndecision rejecting a request for designation as a workforce development \n\narea?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.290 outlines the appeals process for an entity \n\nthat submits a request for initial or subsequent designation as a local \n\nworkforce development area that is rejected by the Governor. This \n\nsection implements sec. 106(b)(5) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.290(a) establishes that entities that are not \n\napproved as local areas may follow the process established at 20 CFR \n\n683.640. This section is essentially unchanged from WIA. However, while \n\nprovisions at WIOA sec. 106(b) permit any unit of local government or \n\ncombination of units to apply for designation as a local area, the law \n\ndoes not specify that rural concentrated employment programs may apply \n\nfor designation as a local area. The intent of this section was to \n\nprohibit such an arrangement under WIOA and that this prohibition \n\nlogically applies to the appeals process.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.290(b) establishes that an entity making an \n\nunsuccessful appeal to the State Board may request a review of the \n\nappeal by the Secretary of Labor if the State does not respond to the \n\nappeal in a timely manner or if the appeal for designation is denied by \n\nthe State. The Department defines a `timely manner' to be 60 days after \n\nthe submission of the appeal. This provides adequate time for the State \n\nto review and make a ruling on the appeal while not being so long as to \n\ndelay unreasonably the appeal and designation processes.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.290(c) summarizes the circumstances under which \n\nthe Secretary of Labor may require an entity to be designated as a \n\n\n\nlocal area. Specifically, the Secretary may require designation upon a \n\nfinding of either a denial of procedural rights or a finding that the \n\narea meets the requirements for designation. This section was updated \n\nfrom WIA to reflect that neither the `automatic' nor `temporary and \n\nsubsequent' designation statuses exist under WIOA.\n\n3. Subpart C--Local Boards\n\nSection 679.300 What is the vision and purpose of the Local Workforce \n\nDevelopment Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.300 explains the purpose of the Local Board. The \n\nLocal Board represents a wide variety of individuals, businesses, and \n\norganizations throughout the local area. The Local Board serves as a \n\nstrategic convener to promote and broker effective relationships \n\nbetween the CEOs and economic, education, and workforce partners.\n\n    The Local Board must develop a strategy to continuously improve and \n\nstrengthen the workforce development system through innovation in, and \n\nalignment and improvement of, employment, training, and education \n\nprograms to promote economic growth. Local Board members must establish \n\na platform in which all members actively participate and collaborate \n\nclosely with the required and other partners of the workforce \n\ndevelopment system, including public and private organizations. This is \n\ncrucial to the Local Board's role to integrate and align a more \n\neffective, job-driven workforce investment system.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.300(b)(1) and (2) outlines the purposes of the \n\nLocal Board. A key goal of Federally-funded training programs is to \n\nprepare job seekers ready to work with marketable skills. This includes \n\nproviding strategic and operational oversight in collaboration with \n\nrequired and other partners to help the workforce development system \n\nachieve the purposes outlined in WIOA sec. 2, and assist in the \n\nachievement of the State's strategic and operational vision and goals \n\noutlined in the State Plan. The Local Board must work to develop a \n\ncomprehensive and high-quality workforce development system by \n\ncollaborating with its workforce and education partners to improve and \n\nalign employment, training, and education programs under WIOA.\n\nSection 679.310 What is the Local Workforce Development Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310 defines the Local Workforce Development \n\nBoard. Proposed Sec.  679.310(a) explains that the CEO in each local \n\narea appoints the Local Board in accordance with WIOA sec. 107(b) and \n\nthat the Governor must certify the Local Board on a biannual basis. \n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.300(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310(b) describes that the Local Board sets \n\n\n\npolicy within the local area in partnership with the CEO, consistent \n\nwith State policy. This proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 661.300(b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310(c), asserts that the CEO may enter into an \n\nagreement with the Local Board that describes the respective roles and \n\nresponsibilities of the parties. However, the CEO remains liable for \n\nfunds received under title I of WIOA unless they reach an agreement for \n\nthe Governor to act as the local grant recipient and bear such \n\nliability. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at \n\n20 CFR 661.300(c).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310(d) describes that the Local Board, in \n\npartnership with the CEO, are responsible for the development of the \n\nlocal plan. This proposed section retains the same requirements found \n\nat 20 CFR 661.120(d).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310(e) affirms that in local areas with more \n\nthan one unit of general local government, the CEOs of the respective \n\nunits may execute an agreement to describe their responsibilities for \n\ncarrying out their roles and responsibilities. If the various parties \n\ncannot come to an agreement, the Governor may appoint the Local Board. \n\nThis proposed section retains the\n\n[[Page 20705]]\n\nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 661.300(3).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.310(f) indicates that in single-State areas, the \n\nState Board must fulfill the functions of the Local Board, which the \n\nDepartment also required under the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 661.300(f). \n\nAs required by WIOA sec. 107(c)(4)(B)(iii), the proposed section \n\nclarifies that the State is not required to establish or report on \n\nlocal performance measures. This clarification presents a logical \n\napproach to local performance because the local area performance will \n\nbe reflected in the State performance reports.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (g) requires the CEO to establish by-laws, \n\nconsistent with State policy, that help improve operations of the Local \n\nBoard. Proposed Sec.  679.310(g)(1) through (7) require that at a \n\nminimum the by-laws address the nomination process used by the CEO to \n\nelect the Local Board chair and members, term limitations and how the \n\nterm appointments will be staggered to ensure only a portion of \n\nmemberships expire in a given year, the process to notify the CEO of a \n\nboard member vacancy to ensure a prompt nominee, the proxy and \n\nalternative designee process that will be used when a board member is \n\nunable to attend a meeting and assigns a designee, the use of \n\n\n\ntechnology to improve board functions, brokers relationships with \n\nstakeholders, and any other conditions governing appointment or \n\nmembership on the Local Board as deemed appropriate by the CEO. In \n\naddition to these required elements, the CEO must include any \n\nadditional requirements in the board's by-laws that it believes is \n\nnecessary to ensure the orderly administration and functioning of the \n\nboard. An effective Local Board establishes clear roles, \n\nresponsibilities, procedures, and expectations through its by-laws, and \n\nthat these requirements will help Local Boards to be more agile and \n\nproactive in reacting to board turnover, increase board participation \n\nwhen board members are not able to physically attend board meetings, \n\nimprove board functionality, and help ensure that the public is \n\ninformed about the operation of the board.\n\nSection 679.320 Who are the required members of the Local Workforce \n\nDevelopment Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320 explains that the CEO in a local area must \n\nappoint a Local Workforce Development Board and provides guidelines on \n\nrequirements and options for the CEO to follow in appointing members to \n\nthe Local Board.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(b) requires that a majority of the Local \n\nBoard members must represent businesses as per WIOA sec. 107(b)(2)(A). \n\nBusiness representatives include owners, chief executive or operating \n\nofficers, and other business executives, including small businesses, \n\nand business organizations. As reflected in proposed paragraph (b)(2), \n\nWIOA requires that business representatives on the Local Board must \n\nrepresent business that provide employment opportunities in in-demand \n\nindustry sectors or occupations as defined in WIOA sec. 3(25). \n\nEmployers with employment opportunities in high-growth sectors are \n\nuniquely suited to communicate the emerging workforce needs of \n\nemployers in these high-growth, in-demand sectors to the Local Board.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(c) explains the required and optional member \n\ncategories that must make up at least 20 percent of the Local Board \n\nmembership representing labor organizations, or where they do not \n\nexist, employee representatives. Proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) \n\nrequire that the Local Board must include two or more representatives \n\nof labor organizations (or other employee representatives if there are \n\nno labor organizations operating in the local area) and one or more \n\nrepresentatives of a joint-labor management registered apprenticeship \n\nprogram (or other registered apprenticeship program if there is no \n\njoint labor-management program in the local area). The use of the word \n\n`representatives' with respect to labor organization membership \n\n\n\nindicates a requirement for two or more members. In areas with joint \n\napprenticeship programs, the apprenticeship representative must be a \n\nmember of a labor organization or a training director.\n\n    In addition to these required members, proposed paragraphs (c)(3) \n\nand (4) explain that the CEO may appoint one or more representatives of \n\nCBOs with experience in addressing the employment needs of individual \n\nbarriers to employment including organizations that serve veterans or \n\nthat provide or support competitive integrated employment for \n\nindividuals with disabilities, and one or more representative of \n\norganizations with experience addressing the employment needs of WIOA-\n\neligible youth, including serving OSY. While not mandatory, the two \n\nrepresentative categories in proposed paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) count \n\ntowards reaching the 20 percent threshold. Proposed Sec.  679.320(c) \n\nunderscores both the importance of registered apprenticeship, a proven \n\ntraining strategy that effectively meets the needs of both employers \n\nand workers,\\1\\ and the role of organized labor in workforce \n\ndevelopment, particularly in developing registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Ibid; and Kleinman, Liu, Mastri, Reed, Reed, Sattar, & \n\nZiegler (2012).

These sections require that Local Boards include a \n\nminimum of one member with experience providing adult education and \n\nliteracy activities under title II of WIOA and at least one member from \n\na higher education institution, which may include community colleges, \n\nthat provides workforce training.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d)(3) sets forth the statutory requirement that \n\na minimum of one Local Board member must be included from each of the \n\nfollowing organizations: Economic or community development \n\norganizations, the State ES Office under Wagner-Peyser serving the \n\nlocal area, and programs carried out under title I of the \n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 720, et seq.) other than sec. 112 \n\nor part C of that title.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(e) provides examples of other appropriate \n\noptional members of the board. In addition to the entities described in \n\n\n\n(e)(1) through (3), proposed paragraph (e)(4) explains that the CEO may \n\nappoint other individuals to the board at his or her discretion. This \n\nprovides the CEO the flexibility to assemble a Local Board that \n\nconnects all key resources and stakeholders.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(f) requires that Local Board members possess \n\noptimum policy-making authority in the organizations they represent. \n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.315(c).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(g) explains the nomination criteria for \n\nbusiness and labor representatives, as well as representatives of adult \n\neducation and literacy activities under title II when there are \n\nmultiple institutions providing these services in a local area. These \n\nnomination requirements are unchanged from the requirements at 20 CFR \n\n661.315(e), however, a formal policy ensures that business and labor \n\norganizations are provided the opportunity to provide input on board \n\nmember selection. When there is more than one local area provider of \n\nadult education and literacy activities under title II, or multiple \n\ninstitutions of higher education providing workforce\n\n[[Page 20706]]\n\ninvestment activities as described in WIOA 107(b)(2)(C)(i) or (ii), the \n\nCEO must solicit nominations from those particular entities. This \n\nrequirement provides for a representative selection process for these \n\nmembership categories.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(h) explains that an individual may be \n\nappointed as a representative of more than one entity if the individual \n\nmeets all the criteria for representation, including the criteria \n\ndescribed in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, for each \n\nentity. While such ``multiple entity'' representation may not be \n\nappropriate in all cases, the Department proposes to allow an \n\nindividual to represent more than one entity, because there may be \n\ninstances when such representation may be an effective tool for \n\nreducing board size while still ensuring that all entities entitled to \n\nrepresentation receive effective representation.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.320(i) explains that all required board members \n\nmust have voting privileges and that the CEO may give voting privileges \n\nto non-required members. Voting rights allow the required board members \n\nto have an effect on the Local Board's key decisions and initiatives. \n\nThis will enable the required board members to effectively represent \n\nthe individuals and organizations of their communities.\n\nSection 679.330 Who must chair a Local Board?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.330 affirms that the Local Board must elect a \n\nchairperson from the business representatives on the Local Board. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.320.\n\nSection 679.340 What is meant by the terms ``optimum policy-making \n\nauthority'' and ``demonstrated experience and expertise''?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.120 explains what is meant by ``optimum policy-\n\nmaking authority'' and ``demonstrated experience and expertise'' for \n\nmembers of the Local Board under sec. 107(b)(5) of WIOA. Proposed \n\nparagraph (a) defines an individual with ``optimum policy-making \n\nauthority'' as someone who can reasonably be expected to speak \n\naffirmatively on behalf of the entity he or she represents and to \n\ncommit that entity to a chosen course of action. In order for the \n\ndecisions of the board to have the greatest possible impact, all board \n\nmembers must be able to speak authoritatively when committing their \n\norganization to a decided course of action.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) define the qualifications \n\nthat satisfy the ``experience and expertise'' requirement for Local \n\nBoard members. The CEO has a duty to appoint only those board members \n\nthat have the skills and practical knowledge to contribute fully to the \n\nstrategic vision of the local area's workforce system.\n\nSection 679.350 What criteria will be used to establish the membership \n\nof the Local Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.350 affirms that the CEO appoints the Local \n\nBoard in accordance with the criteria in WIOA sec. 107(b) and \n\napplicable State criteria. This proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 661.325.\n\nSection 679.360 What is a standing committee, and what is its \n\nrelationship to the Local Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.360 establishes the roles and responsibilities \n\nof standing committees within the Local Board structure. Such \n\ncommittees were not legislated in the past, are optional under WIOA, \n\nand may be used to assist the Local Board in carrying out its \n\nresponsibilities as outlined in WIOA sec. 107. The Department \n\nencourages the use of standing committees to expand opportunities for \n\nstakeholders to participate in board decision-making, particularly for \n\nrepresentatives of organizations that may no longer sit on the Local \n\nBoard but continue to have a stake in the success of board decisions. \n\nSuch committees also expand the capacity of the board in meeting \n\nrequired functions.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) expressly authorizes Local Boards to \n\nestablish standing committees that include individuals who are not \n\nformal members of the board, but who have expertise to advise on issues \n\n\n\nthat support the board's ability to attain the goals of the State, \n\nlocal and regional plans, and the objective of providing customer-\n\nfocused services to individuals and businesses. The subpart provides \n\nexamples of areas where standing committees may be particularly \n\nbeneficial, including serving targeted groups of customers such as \n\nindividuals with disabilities and youth, and addressing one-stop system \n\nissues.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) provides for Local Board discretion in terms \n\nof what kinds of standing committees, in any, the Local Board creates.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) allows Local Boards to designate an entity \n\nin existence on the date that WIOA was enacted, such as an effective \n\nyouth council, to fulfill the requirements of a standing committee as \n\nlong as the entity meets the requirements outlined in paragraph (a).\n\nSection 679.370 What are the functions of the Local Board?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.370 provides the functions of the Local Boards \n\nas enumerated in statute. Under WIOA, the Local Board, in partnership \n\nwith the CEO, must perform a variety of functions to support the local \n\nworkforce system. Many of these functions have been expanded and \n\nenhanced under WIOA. Proposed Sec.  661.305(a), (c), (d), (g), (h), \n\n(j), (o), and (p) reiterate the relevant statutory requirements at WIOA \n\nsecs. 107(d)(1) through (3), (6), (7), (9), (12), and (13); no further \n\ndiscussion of these provisions is provided below.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) discusses a new role for Local Boards that \n\nare part of a planning region that includes multiple local areas. This \n\nregulation repeats the new statutory requirement that Local Boards that \n\nare part of a planning region must develop and submit a regional plan \n\nin collaboration with the other Local Boards in the region. Under WIOA, \n\nthe local plan is incorporated into the regional plan, where required, \n\nin accordance with Sec.  679.540.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) explains the role of the Local Boards in \n\nengaging employers, promoting business representation on the board, and \n\ndeveloping and implementing proven or promising strategies for meeting \n\nthe needs of employers and workers (like industry or sector \n\npartnerships) and providing linkages and coordination among employers \n\nand the workforce system. It enhances the Local Board's role in \n\nengaging employers beyond what was required by WIA by requiring the \n\nboard to develop and implement promising strategies for meeting the \n\nemployment skill needs of workers and employers. Engaging employers \n\npresents an opportunity to meet the local area's labor market and \n\n\n\nworkforce development needs and connect customers seeking jobs or \n\ncareer advancement to greater employment prospects.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) requires the Local Board to connect with \n\nrepresentatives of secondary and post-secondary education programs in \n\nthe local area in order to develop and implement career pathways. This \n\nregulation supports the statute's focus on career pathways.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (i) enhances the oversight role of the Local \n\nBoard beyond what was required in WIA. It requires the Local Board to \n\nconduct oversight, in partnership with the CEO, of the use and \n\nmanagement of funds, including\n\n[[Page 20707]]\n\nensuring the appropriate management and investment of funds to maximize \n\nperformance outcomes under WIOA sec. 116.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (k) requires that the Local Board must negotiate \n\nwith CLEO and required partners on the methods for funding the \n\ninfrastructure costs of one-stop centers in the local area in \n\naccordance with Sec.  678.715. This provision ensures each partner in \n\nthe one-stop system is provided resources equitably.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (l) also expands and enhances the Local Board's \n\nrole in the selection of eligible service providers in the local area \n\nwhich must be conducted consistent with 2 CFR part 200. The regulation \n\nmaintains the board's role in the identification of eligible providers \n\nof youth workforce investment activities, but now requires, consistent \n\nwith WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(B), that this identification be accomplished \n\nthrough the award of grants or contracts on a competitive basis. It \n\nalso adds that the recommendations of the youth standing committee, if \n\none is established, must be taken into account. It also indicates that \n\nthe Local Board must identify eligible providers of career services \n\nthrough the award of contracts, if the one-stop operator does not \n\nprovide such services. This provision does not impact those services \n\nprovided by State merit staff. The final proposed expansion in this \n\nsubpart is the requirement that Local Boards select one-stop operators \n\nthrough the competitive process described in Sec. Sec.  678.600 through \n\n678.635.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (m) describes the requirement that the Local \n\nBoard work with the State to ensure that there are sufficient numbers \n\nand types of providers of career and training services in the local \n\narea so that consumer choice and opportunities for employment for \n\nindividuals with disabilities are maximized.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (n) reflects a number of new functions for the \n\nLocal Board related to coordination with adult education and literacy \n\nproviders in the local area. The regulation requires the Local Board to \n\n\n\nreview applications to provide adult education and literacy activities \n\nunder title II to determine whether such applications are consistent \n\nwith the local plan. It also requires the board to make recommendations \n\nto the eligible agency to promote alignment with the local plan. \n\nFurther information regarding Local Board coordination with adult \n\neducation and literacy providers is provided at 34 CFR 463 which \n\nrequires the eligible agency to establish in its competition, a \n\nprocesses by which applicants must submit an application to the Local \n\nBoard for review prior to its submission to the eligible agency. This \n\nsubpart also includes a role for the board in replicating and \n\nimplementing cooperative agreements in accordance with subparagraph (B) \n\nof sec. 101(a)(11) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \n\n721(a)(11)), and implementing cooperative agreements in accordance with \n\nthat section with the local agencies administering plans under title I \n\nof that Act (29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.) (other than sec. 112 or part C of \n\nthat title (29 U.S.C. 732, 741) to enhance the provision of services to \n\nindividuals with disabilities and other individuals.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (q) requires the Local Board to certify one-stop \n\ncenters in accordance with Sec.  662.600.\n\nSection 679.380 How does the Local Board satisfy the consumer choice \n\nrequirements for career services and training services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.380 describes how the Local Board satisfies the \n\nconsumer choice requirements for career services and training services. \n\nWhile WIA required the Local Board to maximize consumer choice for \n\ntraining services, consumer choice for career services is a new \n\nrequirement under WIOA. Clarification of the board's role will minimize \n\nconfusion for one-stop managers and frontline staff.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) describe the process of how \n\nthe Local Board assists the State Board in identifying providers, \n\nensures a sufficient number of providers, and provides performance and \n\ncost information through the one-stop system.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) describe how the Local Board \n\nsatisfies the requirement to provide consumer choice for career \n\nservices. In general, the Local Board must decide which services are \n\nbest provided by the one-stop operator and which services may require a \n\ncontracted provider. Furthermore, these paragraphs require the board to \n\nidentify a wide range of services based on the needs in the local area \n\nwith special attention to services for individuals with disabilities \n\nand literacy services. Requiring the board to identify a wide array of \n\npotential career service providers, while still allowing the board to \n\nultimately determine the career service providers, balances board \n\nflexibility and customer choice. There is no requirement to provide \n\ncustomers with a choice of providers for a given career service.\n\n\n\nSection 679.390 How does the Local Board meet its requirement to \n\nconduct business in an open manner under the ``sunshine provision'' of \n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.390 maintains the Local Board's requirement to \n\nconduct business in an open manner, but expands on the scope of what \n\nthe public must be made aware of and requires that information be \n\nshared by electronic means as well as through open meetings as provided \n\nfor in WIOA sec. 107(e). These new requirements facilitate the \n\ntransparent functioning of the board and contribute to smoother board \n\noperations. This can only be accomplished by each Local Board member \n\nactively participating during Local Board meetings, and by developing \n\neffective by-laws that outline the nomination process, which includes \n\nsteps for a prompt nominee during a vacancy, term limitations, and \n\nencourage the use of technology and active participation.\n\nSection 679.400 Who are the staff to the Local Board and what is their \n\nrole?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.400 describes the Local Board's authority to \n\nhire staff and the appropriate roles for board staff. This proposal \n\nclarifies and differentiates the staff's role and requires the Local \n\nBoard to hire only qualified staff.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) authorizes the board to hire a director and \n\nother staff. The volunteer board may not have the capacity to fulfill \n\nthe required board functions at WIOA sec. 107(d). Board support ensures \n\nthese functions are achieved.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) requires the board to apply objective \n\nqualifications to the board director. It is in the best interest of the \n\npublic workforce system to ensure the director of the board is \n\ncompetent and experienced with workforce programs and service delivery.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) limits the board staff's role to assisting \n\nthe board fulfill the functions at WIOA sec. 107(d) unless the entity \n\nselected to staff the board enters into a written agreement with the \n\nboard and CEO as noted in paragraph (e) and described more fully in \n\nSec.  679.430 of this part. The reasons that the Department proposes to \n\nrequire a written agreement if the staff provide functions outside of \n\nthose in WIOA sec. 107(d) are discussed in the preamble to Sec.  \n\n679.430 of this part.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) requires Local Boards that elect to hire a \n\ndirector to establish objective qualifications to ensure that the \n\nselected candidate possesses the knowledge and skills to\n\n[[Page 20708]]\n\nassist the board in carrying out its functions.\n\n\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) limits the payment of the Local Board \n\ndirector and board staff to the basic pay rate for level II of the \n\nExecutive Schedule under sec. 5313 of title 5, U.S.C. This requirement \n\nensures that board staff are compensated at a reasonable level.\n\nSection 679.410 Under what conditions may a Local Board directly be a \n\nprovider of career services, or training services, or act as a one-stop \n\noperator?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.410 explains the situations in which the Local \n\nBoard may directly act as a one-stop operator, a provider of career \n\nservices or training services. Proposed Sec.  679.410(a)(1)(i) and (ii) \n\nestablishes that a Local Board may act as a one-stop operator where a \n\nLocal Board successfully participates in a competition or if the board \n\nmeets the criteria for sole source procurement. Under both \n\ncircumstances, as required by proposed Sec.  679.410(a)(2), \n\nimplementing WIOA sec. 107(g)(2), the Governor and CEO must agree to \n\nsuch selection. This clarifies the interaction between sec. \n\n122(d)(2)(A) of WIOA, which requires that Local Boards select a one-\n\nstop operator through a competitive process, and WIOA sec. 107(g)(2), \n\nwhich states that a Local Board can be designated as a one-stop \n\noperator only with the agreement of the Governor and CEO in the local \n\narea. One interpretation of sec. 107(g)(2) is that Local Boards, with \n\napproval of the Governor and CEO, could be selected as one-stop \n\noperators without undergoing a competitive process. However, such a \n\nnon-competitive selection is only appropriate after a competitive \n\nprocess has been conducted as required by WIOA sec. 122(d)(2)(A). The \n\nDepartment welcomes comments regarding this interpretation.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.410(a)(3) also requires that where a Local Board \n\nacts as a one-stop operator, the State must ensure certification of \n\none-stop centers. Local Boards are required to certify one-stop \n\ncenters; however, States must fulfill that role when a Local Board acts \n\nas a one-stop operator to avoid conflicts of interest with a Local \n\nBoard certifying its own performance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.410(b) provides that a Local Board may act as a \n\nprovider of career services only with the agreement of the CEO in the \n\nlocal area and the Governor. The Department interprets WIOA sec. \n\n107(g)(2) to operate as a general exception from the requirement that \n\nthe Local Board award contracts to providers of career services \n\nconsistent with 2 CFR part 200. A Local Board acting as a direct \n\nprovider of services is not optimal, as the Local Board is designed to \n\noversee the one-stop system and its services, not provide them. \n\nHowever, unlike the selection of one-stop operators, which are \n\nstatutorily required to be competitively selected, there is no \n\nsimilarly clear statutory requirement for providers of career services. \n\n\n\nTherefore, the Department does not propose to require that a \n\ncompetition fail before the Local Board may provide career services.\n\n    Proposed 679.410(c) specifies that a Local Board is prohibited from \n\nproviding training services unless the Governor grants a waiver in \n\naccordance with WIOA sec. 107(g)(1). Proposed Sec.  679.410(c)(1) \n\nrequires the State to develop a procedure to review waiver requests \n\nreceived from Local Boards and the limitations of the waiver that \n\nincorporates the criteria listed at WIOA sec. 107(g)(1)(B)(i). While \n\nWIA contained provisions for a similar waiver, it did not include any \n\nsuch criteria. The intent of this waiver is to provide the option for \n\nLocal Boards to provide training services in extenuating circumstances \n\nonly, such as rural areas with limited training providers. A formal \n\nprocedure facilitates transparency and clarity regarding the criteria \n\nfor the training waiver and ensures that any Local Board that applies \n\nis subject to the same criteria. Furthermore, the new criteria \n\nunderscore that the waiver is not appropriate for local areas that have \n\na robust network of training providers.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.410(c) indicates that the local area must make \n\nthe request to be designated as a training provider available through \n\npublic comment for a period of 30 days or more and include those \n\ncomments in the local area's final request to the State. The proposed \n\nsection also outlines the timeline for approval and Governor's \n\nauthority to revoke a waiver if the Governor determines it is no longer \n\nneeded or the Local Board demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate \n\nreferrals. This proposed section helps ensure that the local area is \n\nacting in good faith when asserting that there are insufficient \n\nproviders in the local area and protects against a conflict of \n\ninterest.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.410(d) affirms that the general prohibitions \n\nthat apply to Local Boards directly providing career services or \n\ntraining services also apply to board staff.\n\nSection 679.420 What are the functions of the local fiscal agent?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.420 describes the role of the local fiscal agent \n\nwhen the CEO in a local area elects to designate a fiscal agent. While \n\nthe term `fiscal agent' was widely used under WIA, the term was never \n\ndefined, which led to inconsistent understanding of their role and \n\nfunction throughout the workforce system. This section clarifies the \n\nrole of a fiscal agent to create a common understanding of that role.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) describes that the CEO or the Governor, \n\nwhere the Governor serves as the local grant recipient for a local \n\n\n\narea, may designate an entity to serve as a local fiscal agent.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) provides a list of the key functions of a \n\nfiscal agent. The appropriate role of fiscal agent is limited to \n\naccounting and funds management functions rather than policy or service \n\ndelivery. Proposed fiscal agent functions include those listed in \n\nparagraphs (b)(1) through (6) and (c) provide additional potential \n\nfunctions for single State areas. The Department requests comment from \n\nState and local stakeholders regarding appropriate functions for a \n\nfiscal agent.\n\nSection 679.430 How do entities performing multiple functions in a \n\nlocal area demonstrate internal controls and prevent conflict of \n\ninterest?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.430 clarifies how entities performing multiple \n\nfunctions in a local area demonstrate internal controls and prevent \n\nconflict of interest. This proposed provision requires a written \n\nagreement with the Local Board and CEO when a single entity operates in \n\nmore than one of the following roles: Local fiscal agent, Local Board \n\nstaff, one-stop operator, or direct provider of career services or \n\ntraining services. The proposed paragraph clarifies how the \n\norganization will carry out its responsibilities while demonstrating \n\ncompliance with WIOA and corresponding regulations, relevant OMB \n\ncirculars, and the State's conflict of interest policy. While it may be \n\nappropriate in some instances for a single organization to fulfill \n\nmultiple roles, a written agreement between the Local Board, CEO, and \n\nthe organization fulfilling multiple roles is the best method to limit \n\nconflict of interest or the appearance of conflict of interest, \n\nminimize fiscal risk, and develop appropriate firewalls within a single \n\nentity performing multiple functions.\n\n4. Subpart D--Regional and Local Plan\n\n    WIOA provides designated regions and local workforce areas the \n\nresponsibility and opportunity to develop employment and training \n\nsystems tailored specifically to regional economies. These systems must \n\nmeet the needs of the full range of learners and workers, including \n\nthose with\n\n[[Page 20709]]\n\nbarriers to employment. The system must also address the specific needs \n\nof regional employers and the skills they require. WIOA requires the \n\nLocal Board, in partnership with the CEO, to submit a local plan to the \n\nGovernor. If the local area is part of a planning region, the Local \n\n\n\nBoard will submit its local plan as part of the regional plan and will \n\nnot submit a separate local plan. The local or regional plan provides \n\nthe framework for local areas to define how their workforce development \n\nsystems will achieve the purposes of WIOA. The regional or local plans \n\nserve as 4-year action plans to develop, align, and integrate the \n\nregion and local area's job-driven workforce development systems, and \n\nprovides the platform to achieve the local area's visions and strategic \n\nand operational goals. Since the local plan is only as effective as the \n\npartnerships that operationalize it, it must represent a collaborative \n\nprocess among local elected officials, boards, and required and other \n\npartners (including economic development, education, and private sector \n\npartners) to create a shared understanding of the local area's \n\nworkforce investment needs, a shared vision of how the workforce \n\ninvestment system can be designed to meet those needs, and agreement on \n\nthe key strategies to realize this vision.\n\nSection 679.500 What is the purpose of the regional and local plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.500 describes the purpose of the regional and \n\nlocal plans. Proposed Sec.  679.500(a)(1) through (4) explain that the \n\nlocal plan is the primary vehicle for communicating the Local Board's \n\nvision for the local workforce system and aligning and integrating \n\nlocal service delivery across Federal programs in a region to foster \n\nbetter alignment of Federal investments in job training, integrate \n\nservice delivery across programs, and ensure that the workforce system \n\nis job-driven and matches employers with skilled individuals. Proposed \n\nSec.  679.500(b) clarifies that when a State-designated region \n\nencompasses two or more local areas, the regional plan must meet the \n\npurposes of the local plan and coordinate resources across the region \n\nand across local areas. This approach is intended to align resources \n\nbetween multiple Local Boards.\n\nSection 679.510 What are the requirements for regional planning?\n\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  679.510, 679.520, and 679.530 describe the \n\nrequired contents of the regional plan, the approval process, and when \n\nthe regional plan must be modified. While sec. 106(c) of WIOA clearly \n\ndescribes the required contents of the regional plan, it provides less \n\ndetail about the approval and modification process, saying only that \n\nofficials in the planning region must ``prepare, submit, and obtain \n\napproval'' of the plan. Because the local plan is a component of the \n\nregional plan, the Department has decided to apply the approval and \n\nmodification requirements, including the requirement to seek public \n\ncomment and sunshine provision, to the regional plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.510 implements sec. 106(c) of WIOA and describes \n\n\n\nthe State and local requirements for regional planning. Proposed Sec.  \n\n679.510(a)(1) requires Local Boards and CEOs to participate in a \n\nregional planning process. In some instances, where a single local \n\nworkforce development area comprises a region, the local area will \n\ncarry out its planning in this context.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.510(a)(2) describes the regional plan contents \n\nand submission process. The Local Boards and CEOs must submit a \n\nregional plan to the Governor for approval that includes the activities \n\nlisted at proposed Sec.  679.510(a)(1) and incorporates the local plans \n\ndeveloped for each local area. Local areas are not required to submit \n\nan additional local plan outside of the regional planning process. The \n\ncoordination required for regional planning is an effective method for \n\nlocal areas to identify areas of efficiency, coordinate effective \n\npractices, and streamline service delivery. While the regional plan \n\nrequires coordination of local performance negotiations with the State, \n\neach CEO, as required by Sec.  677.210(b) and (c) will negotiate \n\nperformance goals with the State and will remain ultimately responsible \n\nfor ensuring that the local area meets or exceeds those goals.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.510(b) requires Local Boards to make the \n\nregional plan available for comment before submitting the plan to the \n\nGovernor and describes the steps necessary to ensure adequate public \n\ncomment. This requirement provides all affected entities and the public \n\nan opportunity to provide input to inform plan development.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.510(b)(5) specifically requires the public \n\ncomment process to be consistent with the `sunshine provisions' at WIOA \n\nsec. 107(e), which requires that the Local Boards must make the plan \n\navailable through electronic means and open meetings. This requirement \n\nensures greater transparency in the planning process, and encourage \n\nregions to consider efforts to maximize the transparency and \n\ninclusiveness of the process.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.510(c) requires the State to provide technical \n\nassistance and labor market data to facilitate regional planning. \n\nBecause States possess a broader understanding of labor market \n\ninformation across jurisdictions and tools for analysis that individual \n\nlocal areas may not possess, States have a responsibility to provide \n\nand instruct local areas on the effective use of regional labor market \n\ninformation.\n\nSection 679.520 What are the requirements for approval of a regional \n\nplan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.520 describes the approval of the comprehensive \n\n4-year regional plan. This section requires that the Governor review \n\n\n\ncompleted plans and stipulates that unless the Governor determines that \n\nany of the conditions described in proposed paragraphs (a) through (c) \n\nare met the plan will be considered approved 90 days after submission \n\nof the plan to the Governor.\n\nSection 679.530 When must the regional plan be modified?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.530 describes when a regional plan must be \n\nmodified. Proposed Sec.  679.530(a) requires the Governor to establish \n\nprocedures governing regional plan modification, which will help ensure \n\nthat the biannual modification of regional plans is conducted \n\nconsistently throughout the State.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.530(b) explains that the Local Boards and \n\nappropriate CEOs in the planning region must review the regional plan \n\nevery 2 years and submit a modification based on significant changes in \n\nlabor market and economic conditions and other factors including \n\nchanges to local economic conditions, and any changes in the financing \n\navailable to support WIOA title I and partner-provided WIOA services. \n\nThis proposed requirement helps ensure that planning regions use their \n\nplans to drive economic development, sector, career pathway, and \n\ncustomer-focused service delivery strategies.\n\nSection 679.540 How are local planning requirements reflected in a \n\nregional plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.540 outlines how local planning requirements are \n\nreflected in a regional plan. WIOA is silent on the coordination of the \n\nregional and local plan, noting only that the regional plan must \n\n``incorporate local plans for each of the local areas in the planning \n\nregion.'' The Department has determined that the most appropriate and \n\nleast burdensome approach to implementing this provision is to \n\nincorporate the local plans within the regional plan. In this \n\narrangement, the regional plan is completed in\n\n[[Page 20710]]\n\ncooperation with the Local Boards and CEOs in a planning region, per \n\nSec.  679.510(a). Each individual Local Board and CEO will respond to \n\nthe local planning requirements at Sec.  679.560(b) through (e) \n\nindividually. The Local Boards and CEOs in a planning region must \n\ncooperate to develop a common response to the local planning \n\nrequirements that discuss regional labor market information, as \n\nrequired by Sec.  679.540(a), and any other appropriate requirements \n\npermitted by the Governor per Sec.  679.540(b). When these activities \n\nare completed, the planning region submits one regional plan to the \n\nGovernor that includes the common discussion of regional labor market \n\n\n\ninformation and other requirements as required by the Governor, as well \n\nas each local plan in a single document.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.540(a) requires regional plans to include the \n\nitems identified in Sec. Sec.  679.510 and 679.560, which implement \n\nsecs. 106(c)(1) and 108(b) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.540(b) specifies the Governor may issue regional \n\nplanning guidance that allows local areas to provide a common response \n\nto any local requirements it deems as a shared regional responsibility, \n\nwhich may include regional economic analysis. The Department recognizes \n\nthere are many planning requirements and encourages Governors to \n\nminimize the individual local area burden by reducing duplication and \n\nencouraging a coordinated service delivery strategy.\n\nSection 679.550 What are the requirements for the development of the \n\nlocal plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.550 explains the requirements for the \n\ndevelopment of the local plan. This section emphasizes the importance \n\nof collaboration and transparency in the development and submission of \n\nthe local plan and subsequent modifications.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.550(a) implements sec. 108(a) of WIOA and \n\ndescribes the general requirements for the preparation and content of \n\nthe local plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.550(b) requires Local Boards to make the local \n\nplan available for comment before submitting the plan to the Governor \n\nand describes the steps necessary to ensure adequate public comment. \n\nThis requirement provides all affected entities and the public an \n\nopportunity to provide input to inform plan development. This section \n\nimplements sec. 108(d) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.550(b)(5) requires the public comment process to \n\nbe consistent with the `sunshine provisions' at WIOA sec. 107(e) and \n\nproposed Sec.  679.390 and that the Local Board must make the plan \n\navailable through electronic means and in open meetings. This \n\nrequirement ensures transparency to the public. This provision \n\nimplements sec. 107(e) of WIOA.\n\nSection 679.560 What are the contents of the local plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560, consistent with sec. 108(b) of WIOA, \n\nexplains what information must be included in the local plan. These \n\nrequirements set the foundation for WIOA principles, by fostering \n\nstrategic alignment, improving service integration, and ensuring that \n\nthe workforce system is industry-relevant, responding to the economic \n\nneeds of the local workforce development area and matching employers \n\nwith skilled workers. In addressing these planning requirements, boards \n\nengage strategic partners to develop and implement regionally aligned \n\n\n\nworkforce development priorities and streamlined service delivery. \n\nLocal and regional planning also is expected to lead to greater \n\nefficiencies by reducing duplication and maximizing financial and human \n\nresources. WIOA significantly expands the content requirements for the \n\nlocal plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(a)(1) specifies that the local plan must \n\nmeet the requirements of WIOA sec. 108(b)(1). Of relevance to this \n\nsection, the use of economic and labor market information ensures that \n\nthe local strategies are based on a thorough understanding of the \n\neconomic opportunities and workforce needs of the region, and inform \n\nthe alignment of strategies to the best interests of job seekers and \n\nemployers with the economic future of the State. Similarly, the \n\ncontents of the plan must include an analysis of the workforce \n\ndevelopment activities in the region, including an analysis of the \n\nstrengths and weaknesses of such services to address the identified \n\neducation and skill needs of the workforce and employment needs in the \n\nregion. A thorough assessment of the best available information or \n\nevidence of effectiveness and performance information for specific \n\nservice models in the region, as well as a plan to improve the \n\neffectiveness of such programs by adopting proven or promising \n\npractices, is an important part of this assessment and strategic \n\nvision. In addition, the regional analyses described in this proposed \n\nsection may be conducted in cooperation with the other local areas in a \n\nlocal planning region as part of the regional planning requirements \n\ndescribed at Sec.  661.290 and must not be conducted by each local \n\narea.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(a)(1)(iii), consistent with sec. 108(c) of \n\nWIOA permits local areas to use an existing analysis to meet the \n\nrequirements in Sec.  679.560(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b) outlines the required contents of the \n\nlocal plan that are required by secs. 108(b)(2)-(21) of WIOA to ensure \n\nthat a local plan presents a comprehensive, customer-focused, and \n\nactionable service delivery strategy. This section emphasizes alignment \n\nand coordination to a greater extent than that required by WIA. Except \n\nwhere noted, the requirements outlined in Sec.  679.560(b)(2) through \n\n(21) simply reiterate the statutory requirements without additional \n\nexplanation.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(2) requires elaboration on the strategies \n\nfor alignment by requiring that the Local Board describe how such \n\nalignment will improve access to services and to activities that lead \n\n\n\nto a recognized post-secondary credential. Proposed Sec.  \n\n679.560(b)(2)(ii) explains that the Local Board must describe how they \n\nwill work with entities carrying out core programs to facilitate the \n\ndevelopment of career pathways and co-enrollment, as appropriate, in \n\ncore programs. Co-enrollment allows partners to leverage resources, \n\nwhile providing a more comprehensive service delivery strategy that \n\nmeets the needs of customers with several barriers to employment. \n\nAdditionally, coordination of services in a customer-focused manner \n\nminimizes the possibility of subsequent reentry into the public \n\nworkforce system in cases where needed services were not provided or \n\npossible barriers not addressed.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(4) explains that the Local Board must \n\ndescribe how they will coordinate local workforce investment activities \n\nwith regional economic development activities that are carried out in \n\nthe local area and how the Local Board will promote entrepreneurial \n\nskills training and microenterprise services. Alignment between the \n\npublic workforce system and local economic development activities is \n\ncritical in order to identify and fulfill industry talent needs by \n\ntraining customers for emerging and in-demand job skills. Furthermore, \n\nmicroenterprise services refers to training for the purposes of self-\n\nemployment. This training strategy may be appropriate for individuals \n\nor participants with multiple barriers to employment, including persons \n\nwith disabilities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(5) focuses on the delivery of services \n\nthrough the one-stop delivery system in the local area\n\n[[Page 20711]]\n\nand requires descriptions regarding how the Local Board will ensure the \n\ncontinuous improvement of eligible providers of services, including \n\nthrough the promotion of proven and promising approaches and \n\nevaluation; how the Local Board will facilitate access to services, \n\nincluding in remote areas, through the use of technology and other \n\nmeans; how entities within the one-stop delivery system, including one-\n\nstop operators and the one-stop partners, will comply with WIOA sec. \n\n188, if applicable, and applicable provisions of the Americans with \n\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) regarding physical \n\nand programmatic accessibility; and the roles and resource \n\ncontributions of the one-stop partners. WIOA, and the corresponding \n\nregulations at Sec.  678.420, establishes the roles of one-stop \n\npartners. These include providing access to the partner's programs \n\n\n\nthrough the one-stop system; making program funds available to maintain \n\nthe one-stop delivery system, including infrastructure costs; providing \n\napplicable career services; entering into a MOU with the Local Board \n\nregarding one-stop operation; ongoing participation in the one-stop \n\nsystem; and providing representation on State and Local Workforce \n\ndevelopment boards as required and Board committees as needed. \n\nAdditionally, one-stop partners are responsible for sharing \n\ninfrastructure and career services costs. Documenting how one-stop \n\npartners will manage their shared roles and contribute to the funding \n\nof the one-stop in the local plan increases accountability and \n\ntransparency.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(6) through (11) focus on coordination \n\nactivities for improving services and avoiding duplication. Proposed \n\nSec.  679.560(b)(11) reflects a new statutory requirement not contained \n\nin WIA that the local plan include plans, assurances and strategies for \n\nmaximizing coordination with Wagner-Peyser Act services and other \n\nservices provided through the one-stop system.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(12) and (13) are also new requirements \n\nunder WIOA. Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(12) speaks to coordination with \n\nadult education and literacy activities under title II of WIOA and \n\nrequires a description of how the Local Board will carry out the review \n\nof local applications submitted under title II. Proposed Sec.  \n\n679.560(b)(13) is intended to enhance the provision of services to \n\nindividuals with disabilities through cooperative agreements, as \n\ndefined in WIOA sec. 107(d)(11), and other collaborative efforts \n\nbetween the Local Board and the local VR entity. All such collaborative \n\nefforts must be described in the local plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(16) requires the Local Board to include \n\nlocal levels of performance that the board has negotiated with the \n\nGovernor in the local plan. Additionally, this section proposes that \n\nthe local plan must include the standards, process, or performance \n\nmeasures that the Local Board will use to evaluate the performance of \n\nthe local fiscal agent where the CEO has designated such an entity. \n\nThese proposed requirements increase transparency and public \n\naccountability, while helping ensure the Local Board has the \n\ninformation it needs to ensure sustained fiscal integrity of public \n\nfunds.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(19) maintains the requirement that the \n\nlocal plan include a description of the process used by the Local Board \n\nto provide for public input into the development of the plan and for \n\npublic comment on the completed plan prior to its submission. Unlike \n\n\n\nWIA, this regulation identifies the 30-day timeframe for public comment \n\nprior to submission of the plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(20), new to WIOA, requires a description \n\nof how the one-stop centers are implementing and transitioning to an \n\nintegrated, technology-enabled intake and case management information \n\nsystem for programs carried out under WIOA and by one-stop partners.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(b)(21) requires that the plan include the \n\nprocess by which priority of service must be applied by the one-stop \n\noperator, but also clarifies that such priority is for adult career and \n\ntraining services and must be given to recipients of public assistance, \n\nother low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills \n\ndeficient. The Department is proposing to include this requirement \n\nunder the authority to require additional reporting, recordkeeping, and \n\ninvestigations. Including the priority service policy in the local plan \n\nwill help ensure a more uniform application of the policy throughout \n\nthe local area.\n\n    As permitted by sec. 108(b)(22) of WIOA, proposed Sec.  679.560(c) \n\nrequires that the plan include any additional information required by \n\nthe Governor.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(d) recommends that the local plan identify \n\nthe portions of the local plan that the Governor has designated as \n\nappropriate for common response among all local areas in a planning \n\nregion, as per the regulations at 20 CFR 679.540.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.560(e) reflects the requirement in WIOA sec. \n\n108(e) that any comments submitted during the public comment period \n\nthat represent disagreement with the plan must be submitted with the \n\nlocal plan.\n\nSection 679.580 When must the local plan be modified?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.580(a) requires the Governor to establish \n\nprocedures governing local plan review and modification to ensure that \n\nthe biannual review and modification of local plans is conducted \n\nconsistently throughout the State.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.580(b) explains that the Local Board and \n\nappropriate CEOs must review the local plan every 2 years and submit a \n\nmodification as needed, based on significant changes in labor market \n\nand economic conditions and other factors including changes to local \n\neconomic conditions, changes in the financing available to support WIOA \n\ntitle I and partner-provided WIOA services, changes to the Local Board \n\nstructure, or a need to revise strategies to meet performance goals. \n\nThis requirement is consistent with WIOA sec. 108(a). This proposed \n\nrequirement helps ensure that local areas use their plans to drive \n\nservice delivery strategies and the activities the local area is \n\n\n\nperforming remains consistent with the plan.\n\nSection 679.570 What are the requirements for approval of a local plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.570 describes the approval of the comprehensive \n\n4-year local plan. Proposed Sec.  679.570(a) requires that the Governor \n\nreview completed plans and stipulates that unless the Governor \n\ndetermines that the conditions described in paragraphs (a)(1) through \n\n(3) are met the plan will be considered approved 90 days after \n\nsubmission of the plan to the Governor. This section implements sec. \n\n108(e) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.570(b) outlines the processes, roles, and \n\nresponsibilities for situations in which the State is a single local \n\narea. Proposed Sec.  679.570(b)(1) clarifies the State must incorporate \n\nthe local plan in the State's Unified or Combined State Plan submitted \n\nto DOL. Proposed Sec.  679.570(b)(2) states that the Secretary of Labor \n\nwill perform the roles assigned to the Governor as they relate to local \n\nplanning activities. Proposed Sec.  679.570(b)(3) indicates the \n\nSecretary of Labor will issue planning guidance for single area States. \n\nThis section implements sec. 106(d) of WIOA.\n\n    The Department recognizes that the development of the local plan is \n\ndependent on several other essential State and local WIOA \n\nimplementation activities and that local areas may not be\n\n[[Page 20712]]\n\nable to respond fully to each of the required elements of the local \n\nplan in the timeframe provided. The Department seeks comment on the \n\nscope of the challenges local areas may face regarding regional and \n\nlocal planning, and potential actions that the Department can take to \n\nhelp local areas address these challenges.\n\n5. Subpart E--Waivers/WorkFlex (Workforce Flexibility Plan)\n\n    This subpart describes the statutory and regulatory waiver \n\nauthority provided by WIOA sec. 189(i), and the requirements for \n\nsubmitting a Workforce Flexibility Plan under WIOA sec. 190. WIOA \n\nprovides States the flexibility to request a waiver of program \n\nrequirements in order to implement new strategic goals for the \n\nimprovement of the statewide workforce development system and to \n\nprovide better customer service in exchange for accountability for \n\nexpected programmatic outcomes. A Workforce Flexibility plan provides \n\nadditional flexibility to the State. In general, a State with an \n\napproved Workforce Flexibility plan is given the authority to identify \n\nlocal level provisions to waive without further approval from the \n\nSecretary of Labor to achieve outcomes specified in the plan.\n\n    A description of what provisions of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser may and \n\n\n\nmay not be waived is included, along with an explanation of the \n\nprocedures for requesting a waiver. The subpart also describes what may \n\nand may not be waived under a Workforce Flexibility Plan, and the \n\nprocedures for obtaining approval of a plan. The WIOA requirements for \n\nobtaining approval for a waiver or Workforce Flexibility Plan are \n\nsimilar to those in WIA secs. 189(i) and 192, respectively; therefore, \n\nmany of the proposed regulations are the same as the regulations \n\nimplementing WIA.\n\nSection 679.600 What is the purpose of the General Statutory and \n\nRegulatory Waiver Authority in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \n\nAct?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.600(a) explains that the purpose of the general \n\nstatutory and regulatory waiver authority, provided under WIOA sec. \n\n189(i)(3), is to provide flexibility to States and local areas to \n\nenhance their ability to improve the statewide workforce investment \n\nsystem to carry out WIOA's goals and purposes.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.600(b) explains that a waiver may be requested \n\nto address impediments to a strategic plan that is consistent with the \n\npurposes of title I of WIOA, which are identified at Sec.  675.100(a) \n\nthrough (h).\n\nSection 679.610 What provisions of the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act and the Wagner-Peyser Act may be waived, and what \n\nprovisions may not be waived?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.610(a) implements WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A)(i), and \n\nexplains that the Secretary may waive for a State or local area any of \n\nthe statutory or regulatory requirements of WIOA title I, subtitles A, \n\nB, and E, except for the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(1) \n\nthrough (12). As noted in this section, the purposes of title I of WIOA \n\nare described at 20 CFR 675.100(a) through (h). The Department will \n\nprovide examples of requirements that it will not waive in subsequently \n\nissued guidance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.610(b) follows WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A)(ii), and \n\nexplains that the Secretary may waive the statutory or regulatory \n\nrequirements of Wagner-Peyser secs. 8 through 10, except for the \n\nrequirements listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2).\n\nSection 679.620 Under what conditions may a Governor request, and the \n\nSecretary approve, a general waiver of statutory or regulatory \n\nrequirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(a) through (f) implements WIOA sec. \n\n189(i)(3) and describes the conditions under which a Governor may \n\nrequest, and the Secretary may approve a waiver of statutory or \n\nregulatory requirements.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(a) explains that the Secretary will issue \n\nguidelines on waiving WIOA and Wagner-Peyser requirements. States will \n\nbe required to follow the Secretary's guidelines, which supplement the \n\nrequirements listed in 20 CFR 679.600 through 679.620. The guidelines \n\nwill be issued contemporaneously with State planning guidance. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.420(f).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(b) explains that the Governor may request a \n\ngeneral waiver in consultation with the appropriate CEOs by submitting \n\na waiver plan which accompanies the State's WIOA 4-year Unified or \n\nCombined State Plan, 2-year modification, or by directly submitting a \n\nwaiver plan at any time after a State's WIOA Plan is approved. This \n\napproach is consistent with WIOA secs. 102 and 103, which require the \n\nState to submit either a 4-year Unified or Combined State Plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(c) explains that a Governor's waiver request \n\nmay seek waivers for the entire State or for one or more local areas \n\nwithin the State. This proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 661.420(b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(d) lists the required components of a waiver \n\nplan for the improvement of the statewide workforce development system \n\nand includes the requirements of WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(B). Specifically, \n\nthe plan must identify the statutory or regulatory requirements that \n\nare requested to be waived, and the goals that the State or local area \n\nintend to achieve as a result of the waiver. The plan must also \n\ndescribe the actions that the State or local area has taken to remove \n\nState or local statutory or regulatory barriers; the goals of the \n\nwaiver and the expected programmatic outcomes if the waiver is granted; \n\nthe individuals affected by the waiver; and the processes used to \n\nmonitor the progress in implementing the waiver, provide notice to any \n\nLocal Board affected by the waiver, and provide any Local Board \n\naffected by the waiver an opportunity to comment on the request.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(d)(1) requires that the waiver plan explain \n\nhow the goals of the waiver relate to the Unified or Combined State \n\nPlan. Waivers must support State strategies as enumerated in the State \n\nPlan. Waivers are not separate or detached from the Unified or Combined \n\nState Plan: An approved waiver constitutes a modification of the State \n\nPlan.\n\n    Additionally, as required by Sec.  679.620(d)(4), the waiver plan \n\nmust describe how the waiver will align with the Department's \n\npriorities, such as supporting employer engagement, connecting \n\n\n\neducation and training strategies, supporting work-based learning, and \n\nimproving job and career results. The Department's priorities may \n\nchange and evolve to reflect major changes in the economy, changes in \n\nthe needs of the workforce, and new developments in service strategy \n\napproaches. This new requirement ensures that the Department is issuing \n\nwaivers that align with and help achieve the priorities of the \n\nDepartment. As noted in Sec.  679.620(d)(4)(v), a more complete list of \n\ncurrent priorities will be articulated in future guidance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(d)(5) requires the waiver plan to generally \n\ndescribe the individuals affected by the proposed waiver. This section \n\nspecifically requires that the plan describe how the waiver will impact \n\nservices for disadvantaged populations and individuals with multiple \n\nbarriers to employment. One of the primary purposes of WIOA is to \n\nincrease and enhance education, employment, and\n\n[[Page 20713]]\n\ntraining opportunities for individuals with barriers to employment, \n\nincluding low-income individuals, individuals with disabilities, the \n\nNative American population, and the other groups identified in sec. \n\n3(24) of the Act. The Department has added this specific requirement to \n\nensure that the State, as part of its waiver request, considers the \n\nemployment and training needs of these groups and how the proposed \n\nwaiver would affect these populations.\n\n    An additional requirement at proposed Sec.  679.620(d)(6)(iv) is \n\nthat the plan must describe the processes used to ensure meaningful \n\npublic comment, including comment by business and organized labor. This \n\nrequirement was included to ensure as transparent a process as \n\npossible, to make sure that the public is given an opportunity to voice \n\ntheir concerns or support of potential changes in the public workforce \n\nsystem, while the Governor is afforded an opportunity to reflect on the \n\nopinions of the public before proceeding with a waiver request. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.420(c)(5)(iv).\n\n    The Governor must also describe, per Sec.  679.620(d)(6)(v), the \n\nprocess used to collect and report information about the goals and \n\noutcomes achieved under the waiver plan in the State's WIOA Annual \n\nReport. The Department approves waivers in order to assist States and \n\nlocal areas in achieving goals and outcomes that will improve the \n\nstatewide workforce development system. This collection and reporting \n\nrequirement holds States accountable for the goals and outcomes to be \n\nachieved with the approved waivers and provides a regular and public \n\n\n\nassessment of the effectiveness of States and local areas in doing so.\n\n    Finally, proposed Sec.  679.620(d)(7) explains that if a waiver is \n\nup for renewal, the Secretary may require that States provide the most \n\nrecent data available about the outcomes achieved under the existing \n\nwaiver. This requirement will ensure that the Department has the most \n\nrecent, relevant information before deciding whether to renew a waiver. \n\nAs part of its decision the Department may take other factors into \n\naccount when deciding to renew or deny a waiver.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(e) specifies that the Secretary will issue a \n\ndecision on a waiver request within 90 days of the receipt of the \n\nwaiver, consistent with WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(C).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(f) implements the requirements of WIOA secs. \n\n189(i)(C)(i) and (ii), and explains that the Secretary will approve a \n\nwaiver request only to the extent that the Secretary determines that \n\nthe requirements for which a waiver is requested impede the ability of \n\neither the State or local area to implement the State's plan to improve \n\nthe statewide workforce investment system, and the State has executed a \n\nMOU with the Secretary requiring the State to meet, or ensure that the \n\nlocal area meets, agreed-upon outcomes and to implement other \n\nappropriate measures to ensure accountability. This section also makes \n\napproval of the waiver contingent on the Secretary's determining that \n\nthe waiver plan meets all of the requirements of WIOA sec. 189(i)(3) \n\nand Sec. Sec.  679.600 through 679.620. This proposed section retains \n\nthe same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.420(e), except that the \n\nstatutory reference has changed from sec. 189(i)(4) to sec. 189(i)(3).\n\n    Consistent with current practice, proposed Sec.  679.620(g) \n\nauthorizes the Secretary to approve a waiver for as long as the \n\nSecretary determines is appropriate; however, the duration of the \n\nwaiver may not exceed the duration of a State's current Unified or \n\nCombined State Plan. For example, a waiver granted during the third \n\nyear of the Plan would have to be reconsidered as part of the \n\nsubsequent plan submission and approval cycle, at the latest. By \n\nlimiting the duration of the waiver, the Department will be able to \n\nensure that the waiver is consistent with the goals of the State's plan \n\nand remains consistent with the priorities of the Department.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.620(h) gives the Secretary the authority to \n\nrevoke a State's waiver under certain circumstances. The Secretary has \n\nan obligation to oversee the implementation and performance of States \n\nunder their State plan, including any waivers granted by the \n\nDepartment. As part of this responsibility, the Department proposes to \n\nallow the Secretary to revoke a waiver granted under this section if \n\n\n\nthe State fails to meet the agreed upon outcomes and measures, the \n\nState fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the MOU or other \n\ndocument that includes the terms and conditions of the waiver, and if \n\nthe Secretary determines that the waiver no longer meets any of the \n\nrequirements of Sec. Sec.  679.600 through 679.620. Limiting the \n\nSecretary's authority to revoke to these circumstances balances the \n\nState's need for flexibility with the Secretary's duty to oversee the \n\nimplementation of the waiver.\n\nSection 679.630 Under what conditions may the Governor submit a \n\nWorkforce Flexibility Plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630 describes the conditions under which the \n\nGovernor may submit a workforce flexibility (work-flex) plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(a) includes the requirements of WIOA sec. \n\n190(a), and explains that a State may submit a workforce flexibility \n\nplan for approval by the Secretary, under which three categories of \n\nstatutory or regulatory requirements can be waived.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(a)(1), implementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(1), \n\npermits a State to waive any of the statutory or regulatory \n\nrequirements that are applicable to local areas under WIOA title I (if \n\nthe local area requests the waiver), except for the requirements listed \n\nin proposed paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv). In addition to the \n\nstatutory exceptions, this proposed section adds the requirement that \n\nany of the statutory provisions essential to WIOA's title I purposes \n\ncannot be waived.\n\n    The second category, described in proposed Sec.  679.630(a)(2), and \n\nimplementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(2), explains that any of the statutory or \n\nregulatory requirements applicable to the State under Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nsecs. 8 through 10 may be waived, except for requirements listed at \n\nSec.  679.630(a)(2)(i) and (ii). This proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(a)(2).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(a)(3), implementing WIOA sec. 190(a)(3), \n\npermits waiver of the statutory or regulatory requirements applicable \n\nunder the Older Americans Act of 1965 to State agencies on aging with \n\nrespect to activities carried out using funds allotted under sec. \n\n506(b) of the Older Americans Act, except the for requirements \n\nidentified at Sec.  679.630(a)(3)(i) through (iv).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b) explains what States are required to \n\ninclude in their workforce flexibility plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(1) and (3) implement the requirements at \n\nWIOA sec. 190(b)(1), and specify that a State workforce flexibility \n\nplan must include a description of the process by which local areas in \n\nthe State may submit and obtain State approval of applications for \n\nwaivers, and the requirements of title I of WIOA that are likely to be \n\n\n\nwaived by the State under the plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(2) adds the requirement that the plan \n\ninclude a description of the criteria that the State will use to \n\napprove local area waiver requests and how such requests support \n\nimplementation of the goals identified\n\n[[Page 20714]]\n\nin the State plan. These criteria must be addressed in the waiver \n\nreview process discussed at Sec.  679.630(b)(1). This requirement \n\nensures that all local waiver requests are evaluated consistently by \n\nthe State.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(4) implements the requirements of WIOA \n\nsec. 190(b)(2) and requires a description of the Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nsecs. 8 through 10 that are proposed for waiver, if any. This proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(c)(3).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(5) implements the requirements of WIOA \n\nsec. 190(b)(3) and requires a description of the requirements of the \n\nOlder Americans Act that are proposed for waiver, if any. This proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.430(c)(4).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(6) implements the requirements of sec. \n\n190(b)(4) of WIOA by requiring that the plan describe the outcomes to \n\nbe achieved by the waivers. The section explains that ``outcomes'' \n\ninclude, when appropriate, revisions to adjusted levels of performance \n\nincluded in the State or local plan under WIOA title I, and a \n\ndescription of the data or other information the State will use to \n\ntrack and assess outcomes. This provision allows the Department to \n\nmeasure more effectively the impact of waivers. For some waivers, it \n\nmay be difficult to make a direct connection between the waiver and a \n\ndirect impact on performance; in those instances the State must discuss \n\nthe impact of a waiver on performance to the extent that the State has \n\navailable data.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(b)(7) implements WIOA sec. 190(b)(5) and \n\nrequires that the plan include the measures to be taken to ensure \n\nappropriate accountability for Federal funds in connection with the \n\nwaivers. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at \n\n20 CFR 661.430(b)(6).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(c) explains that a State's workforce \n\nflexibility plan may accompany the State's Unified or Combined State \n\nPlan, the required 2-year modification of the State's Unified or \n\nCombined State Plan, or may be submitted separately as a plan \n\nmodification. This requirement emphasizes that the State may submit a \n\nworkforce-flexibility plan at any time.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(d) explains that the Secretary may approve a \n\nworkforce flexibility plan consistent with a period of approval of the \n\nState's Unified or Combined State Plan, and not more than 5 years. For \n\nexample, if a workflex plan is approved in the third year of a 4-year \n\nUnified Plan, the approval would be for the remainder of the period \n\ncovered by the plan and then would need to be reconsidered as part of \n\nthe subsequent Unified Plan or Combined Plan. Approving a workforce \n\nflexibility plan for the life of a currently approved Unified or \n\nCombined State Plan ensures that the waivers granted under the plan are \n\nconsistent with the strategies outlined in the State Plan. The period \n\nof up to 5 years is consistent with sec. 190(c) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(e) implements WIOA sec. 190(d) and requires \n\nthe State to provide notice and opportunity for comment on the proposed \n\nwaiver request to all interested parties and the general public before \n\nsubmitting the workforce flexibility plan to the Secretary. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.430(e).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.630(f) explains that the Secretary will issue \n\nguidelines under which States may request designation as a workflex \n\nState. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 \n\nCFR 661.430(f) and notes that the Secretary's guidelines may include \n\nrequirements for a State to implement an evaluation of the impact of \n\nwork-flex in that State.\n\nSection 679.640 What limitations apply to the State's Workforce \n\nFlexibility Plan authority under the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.640 explains the limitations that apply to the \n\nState's Workforce Flexibility Plan authority under WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.640(a)(1) specifies that under work-flex waiver \n\nauthority, a State must not waive WIOA, Wagner-Peyser Act, or Older \n\nAmericans Act requirements which are excepted from the work-flex waiver \n\nauthority and described in Sec.  679.630(a). This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 661.440(a)(1).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.640(a)(2) explains that requests to waive title \n\nI of WIOA requirements that are applicable at the State level may not \n\nbe granted under work-flex waiver authority granted to a State. These \n\nrequests may only be granted by the Secretary under the general waiver \n\nauthority which is described at Sec. Sec.  679.610 through 679.620. The \n\nDepartment included this provision to emphasize that work-flex waivers \n\n\n\nare issued under separate authority than general waivers, and that \n\nStates may not use work-flex waiver authority as a substitute for the \n\ngeneral State-level waivers available under sec. 189(i)(3). This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n661.440(a)(2).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  679.640(b) expands on Sec.  679.630(b)(6) by \n\nexplaining that once approved the Secretary may terminate a work-flex \n\ndesignation if the State fails to meet agreed-upon outcomes or the \n\nterms and conditions contained in its workforce flexibility plan. The \n\nDepartment included this provision to emphasize that the Department \n\nreserves the authority to terminate a workflex plan if a State is not \n\nmeeting the terms and conditions agreed to between the Department and \n\nthe State, including the relevant performance outcomes.\n\nD. Part 680--Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities Under Title I of \n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    In this part of the proposed rule, the Department describes \n\nrequirements relating to the services that are available for adults and \n\ndislocated workers under WIOA. Adult services are provided to job \n\nseekers who are at least 18 years old; the statute and the proposed \n\nrule, in providing for such services, establish a priority for serving \n\nlow-income individuals, participants on public assistance, and \n\nindividuals lacking basic work skills. Dislocated worker services are \n\ntargeted for workers who are unemployed and have lost a job, through no \n\nfault of their own, sometimes through mass layoffs that happen during \n\nthe business cycle. The goal of these services is to provide for the \n\nreturn of these individuals to quality employment. Dislocated workers \n\ngenerally include an individual who:\n\n     Has been terminated or laid off, or has received a notice \n\nof termination or layoff from employment;\n\n     Is eligible for or has exhausted entitlement to UC or has \n\nbeen employed for a duration sufficient to demonstrate attachment to \n\nthe workforce but is not eligible for UC due to insufficient earnings \n\nor works for an employer not covered under State UC law; and\n\n     Is unlikely to return to a previous industry or \n\noccupation.\n\n    Under WIOA, adults and dislocated workers may access career \n\nservices and training services. WIOA provides for a workforce system \n\nthat is universally accessible, customer centered, and training that is \n\n\n\njob-driven. WIOA will provide for career and training services at the \n\nnation's nearly 2,500 one-stop centers. Training is supported through a \n\nrobust ETPL, comprised of entities with a proven capability of securing \n\nparticipants with quality employment. WIOA also provides enhanced \n\naccess\n\n[[Page 20715]]\n\nand flexibility for work-based training options, such as OJT, \n\ncustomized training, and incumbent worker training. In this part, the \n\nDepartment also discusses supportive services and needs-related \n\npayments that can be provided, based on customer needs, to enable them \n\nto participate in WIOA career and training services.\n\n2. Subpart A--Delivery of Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities Under \n\nTitle I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\nIntroduction\n\n    This subpart discusses the role of WIOA adult and dislocated worker \n\nservices through the one-stop delivery system. The one-stop delivery \n\nsystem is the foundation of the workforce system. The system provides \n\nuniversal access to career services to meet the diverse needs of adults \n\nand dislocated workers. The grant recipient(s) for the adult and \n\ndislocated worker program is a required partner in the one-stop \n\ndelivery system and is subject to the required partner responsibilities \n\nset forth in Sec.  678.415.\n\n    Career and training services, tailored to the individual needs of \n\njobseekers, form the backbone of the one-stop delivery system. While \n\nsome jobseekers may only need self-service or other basic career \n\nservices like job listings, labor market information, labor exchange \n\nservices or information about other services, some jobseekers will need \n\nservices that are more comprehensive and tailored to their individual \n\ncareer needs. These services may include comprehensive skills \n\nassessments, career planning, and development of an individual \n\nemployment plan that outlines the needs and goal of successful \n\nemployment. Under WIA, career services were identified as core and \n\nintensive services and generally participants would go through each \n\nlevel of service in order to eventually receive training. WIOA \n\nclarifies that individuals receiving services in the one-stop centers \n\nmust receive the service that is needed to assist the individual to \n\nmeet his or her job search goals, and does not need to follow a fixed \n\nsequence of services that may not be necessary to effectively serve the \n\nindividual.\n\n    Under WIOA, the Department proposes to classify career services \n\ninto two categories: Basic and individualized career services. This \n\n\n\ngrouping is not designed to create barriers to training, but rather \n\nidentifies the importance that these two types of career services can \n\nhave in helping individuals obtain employment. Basic career services \n\nmust be made available to all job seekers and include services such as \n\nlabor exchange services, labor market information, job listings, and \n\ninformation on partner programs. Individualized career services \n\nidentified in WIOA and described in these proposed regulations are to \n\nbe provided by local areas as appropriate to help individuals to obtain \n\nor retain employment.\n\n    Under WIA, participants often were required to undergo a sequence \n\nof core and intensive services in order to receive training. WIOA \n\nclarifies that there is no sequence of service requirement in order to \n\nreceive training. Training is made available to individuals after an \n\ninterview, assessment or evaluation determines that the individual \n\nrequires training to obtain employment or remain employed. Supportive \n\nservices, including needs-related payments, can be essential to enable \n\nindividuals to participate in career and training services.\n\nSection 680.100 What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker \n\nprograms in the one-stop delivery system?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.100 directs that the one-stop system is the \n\nfoundational system through which adult and dislocated worker program \n\nservices are provided to eligible individuals. WIOA merges the \n\ncategories of core services and intensive services under WIA into the \n\ncategory of career services.\n\nSection 680.110 When must adults and dislocated workers be registered \n\nand considered a participant?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.110 addresses the important distinction between \n\nregistration and participation--two separate actions in the process by \n\nwhich adults and dislocated workers seek direct, one-on-one staff \n\nassistance from the one-stop system. The distinction is important for \n\nrecordkeeping and program evaluation purposes. Individuals who are \n\nprimarily seeking information are not treated as participants and their \n\nself-service or informational search requires no registration. When an \n\nindividual seeks more than minimal assistance from staff in taking the \n\nnext step towards self-sufficient employment, the person must be \n\nregistered and eligibility must be determined. To register, as defined \n\nin Sec.  675.300, is the point at which information that is used in \n\nperformance information begins to be collected. Participation is the \n\npoint at which the individual has been determined eligible for program \n\nservices and has received or is receiving a WIOA service, such as \n\ncareer services, other than self-service or informational service and \n\nis the point at which an individual is to be included in performance \n\ncalculations for the primary indicators in 20 CFR part 681.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.110(a) describes the registration process for \n\ncollecting information to support a determination of eligibility for \n\nthe WIOA adult and dislocated worker programs. This section explains \n\nthat registration can be done electronically, through interviews, or \n\nthrough an application. This section proposes to distinguish the term \n\n``participation'' from registration by providing that participation \n\noccurs after IC and eligibility determination, when an individual \n\nreceives a WIOA service, other than self-service or informational \n\nactivities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.110(b) requires that adults and dislocated \n\nworkers who receive services other than self-service and informational \n\nactivities must be registered and considered a participant for WIOA \n\ntitle I services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.110(c) maintains the requirement in WIA \n\nregulation Sec.  663.105(c) that EO data be collected on every \n\nindividual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I \n\nfinancially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training, and who has \n\nsignified that interest by submitting personal information in response \n\nto a request from the service provider.\n\nSection 680.120 What are the eligibility criteria for career services \n\nfor adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?\n\n    An individual must be 18 years of age or older to receive career \n\nservices in the adult program. Priority for individualized career \n\nservices and training services funded with title I adult funds must be \n\ngiven to low-income adults and public assistance recipients and \n\nindividuals who are basic skills deficient, in accordance with WIOA \n\nsec. 134(c)(3)(E) and proposed Sec.  680.600.\n\nSection 680.130 What are the eligibility criteria for career services \n\nfor dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.130(a) states that an individual must meet the \n\ndefinition of ``dislocated worker'' in WIOA sec. 3(15) to receive \n\ncareer services in the dislocated worker program.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.130(b) provides that Governors and Local Boards \n\nmay develop policies and procedures for one-stop operators to use in \n\ndetermining a dislocated worker's eligibility for career services \n\nconsistent with the definitions provided in the statute,\n\n[[Page 20716]]\n\nregulations and any guidance issued by the Secretary.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.130(b)(1) and (2) allows for Governors and Local \n\nBoards to develop policies and procedures for what constitutes a \n\n``general announcement'' of a plant closing. These policies and \n\nprocedures could include policies and procedures for what constitutes a \n\n\n\n``general announcement'' of a plant closing or for what constitutes \n\n``unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the \n\ncommunity in which the individual resides or because of natural \n\ndisasters'' for individuals who are self-employed, including family \n\nmembers and ranch hands.\n\nSection 680.140 What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \n\nadult and dislocated worker services are Local Boards required and \n\npermitted to provide?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.140 describes generally the availability of \n\nfunds for use in providing services for adult and dislocated workers \n\nunder title I of WIOA. Local areas have significant flexibility when \n\nproviding services with adult and dislocated worker funds. In addition \n\nto the required career and training services, local areas may use these \n\nfunds to provide additional job seeker services, business services, as \n\nwell as facilitate enhanced coordination between other partner programs \n\nand entities at the State and local level. Local areas can use these \n\nfunds to develop new types of technical assistance, develop new intake \n\nprocedures, test new procurement methods which may lead to better \n\noutcomes for jobseekers, and ensure robust services to businesses \n\nthroughout the workforce system.\n\n    Paragraph (a) provides that WIOA title I adult and dislocated \n\nworker funds to local areas must be used to provide career and training \n\nservices through the one-stop delivery system. Local areas have \n\ndiscretion in the appropriate mix of services, but both career and \n\ntraining services must be made available through the one-stop system \n\nfor provision to eligible individuals served through the system.\n\n    Paragraph (b) describes the services that may be provided with WIOA \n\ntitle I adult and dislocated worker funds in local areas.\n\n    Subparagraph (b)(1) identifies ``Job Seeker Services.'' These \n\nservices include customer support activities to help individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment, training programs for displaced homemakers and \n\nindividuals training for nontraditional occupations, work support \n\nactivities for low-wage workers, supportive services and needs-related \n\npayments, and providing transitional jobs to individuals with barriers \n\nto employment who are chronically unemployed or have an inconsistent \n\nwork history.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(2) identifies ``Employer Services.'' These services \n\ninclude customized screening and referral of qualified participants in \n\ntraining to employers, customized employment-related services to \n\nemployers, and business services.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(3) identifies ``Coordination Activities.'' \n\n\n\nCoordination is required among training and employment activities under \n\nWIOA, child support agencies and services, Department of Agriculture \n\nextension programs, facilitating remote access by using technology and \n\nthe one-stop delivery system, economic development agencies, linkages \n\nbetween the public workforce system and employers and those between the \n\none-stop delivery system and unemployment insurance programs, and \n\norganizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(4) authorizes local areas to enter into pay-for-\n\nperformance contracts as part of a training strategy. Local areas may \n\nuse up to 10 percent of their total adult and dislocated worker funds \n\nunder this procurement method.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(5) provides for technical assistance for one-stop \n\noperators, partners, and ETPs regarding the provision of services to \n\nindividuals with disabilities.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(6) provides for local areas to adjust the economic \n\nself-sufficiency standards for local areas. Levels of self-sufficiency \n\nmay vary by local area and the local economy; this flexibility allows \n\nlocal areas to tailor their services in a way that works in their local \n\neconomy.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(7) provides for the implementation of promising \n\nservices to workers and employers. Local areas can build upon promising \n\npractices to improve service delivery to both job seekers and \n\nemployers.\n\n    Paragraph (b)(8) provides for the use of funds for incumbent worker \n\ntraining. Local areas can use up to 20 percent of their combined adult \n\nand dislocated worker funds to do incumbent worker training consistent \n\nwith subpart F of this part.\n\nSection 680.150 What career services must be provided to adults and \n\ndislocated workers?\n\n    At a minimum, all of the basic career services described in WIOA \n\nsec. 134(c)(2)(A)(i)-(xi) and Sec.  678.430(a) must be provided in each \n\nlocal area through the one-stop delivery system. These services include \n\nreferrals to partner programs, initial assessments, and labor exchange \n\nservices.\n\n    In addition, services described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) and \n\nSec.  678.430(b), such as career counseling and the development of an \n\nindividual employment plan, must be made available if appropriate for \n\nan individual to obtain or retain employment. These services are \n\ncategorized as ``Individualized Career Services'' in Sec.  678.430(b). \n\nAn individual employment plan is discussed in connection with proposed \n\nSec.  680.180.\n\n\n\n    Appropriate follow-up services must be made available to a \n\nparticipant placed in unsubsidized employment for a minimum of 12 \n\nmonths following the participant's first date of employment. Follow-up \n\nservices can be useful for participants in order to maintain \n\nemployment. One-stop staff can provide workplace information and tips \n\nfor success in a workplace environment. Additionally, follow-up \n\nservices provide a continuing link between the participant and \n\nworkforce system; these services allow the one-stop to assist with \n\nother services the participant may need once he or she obtains \n\nemployment. Examples may include assistance with employer benefits, \n\nhealth insurance, and financial literacy and budgeting assistance.\n\nSection 680.160 How are career services delivered?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.160 explains that career services must be \n\nprovided through the one-stop delivery system. Career services may be \n\nprovided by the one-stop operator or through contracts with service \n\nproviders approved by the Local Board. A Local Board may not be the \n\nprovider of career services unless it receives a waiver from the \n\nGovernor and meets other statutory and regulatory conditions.\n\nSection 680.170 What is an internship or work experience for adults and \n\ndislocated workers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  683.170 defines an internship or work experience as \n\na planned, structured, time-limited learning experience that takes \n\nplaces in a workplace. An internship or work experience may be paid or \n\nunpaid, as appropriate. An internship or work experience may be \n\nprovided in the private for-profit, non-profit, or public sectors. \n\nLabor standards apply to any internship or work experience in which an \n\nemployee/employer relationship exists under applicable law. The \n\nDepartment recognizes the role work experiences and internships play in\n\n[[Page 20717]]\n\nhelping individuals obtain the skills they need to succeed in the \n\nworkplace. An internship or work experience for a participant in WIOA \n\nis classified as an Individualized Career Service as described in Sec.  \n\n678.430(b). Internships and work experiences provide a helpful means \n\nfor an individual to gain experience that leads to unsubsidized \n\nemployment.\n\nSection 680.180 What is the individual employment plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.180 explains that an individual employment plan \n\nis an individualized career service, as described in Sec.  678.430(b), \n\n\n\njointly developed by the participant and career planner, that may be \n\nappropriate for an individual. The plan includes an ongoing strategy to \n\nidentify employment goals, achievement objectives, and an appropriate \n\ncombination of services for the participant to obtain these goals and \n\nobjectives. Individual employment plans are one of the most effective \n\nways to serve individuals with barriers to employment, and to \n\ncoordinate the various services including training services they may \n\nneed to overcome these barriers.\n\n3. Subpart B--Training Services\n\nIntroduction\n\n    Training services are discussed at proposed Sec. Sec.  680.200 \n\nthrough 680.230. WIOA is designed to increase participant access to \n\ntraining services. Training services are provided to equip individuals \n\nto enter the workforce and retain employment. Training services may \n\ninclude, for example, occupational skills training, OJT, registered \n\napprenticeship which incorporates both OJT and classroom training, \n\nincumbent worker training, pre-apprenticeship training, workplace \n\ntraining with related instruction, training programs operated by the \n\nprivate sector, skill upgrading and retraining, entrepreneurial \n\ntraining, and transitional jobs. Training services are available for \n\nindividuals who, after interview, evaluation or assessment, and case \n\nmanagement are determined to be unlikely or unable to obtain or retain \n\nemployment that leads to self-sufficiency or higher wages from previous \n\nemployment through career services alone. The participant must be \n\ndetermined to be in need of training services and to possess the skills \n\nand qualifications to successfully participate in the selected program. \n\nThe Department explains that some participants may need additional \n\nservices to assist their vocational training, such as job readiness \n\ntraining, literacy activities including English language training, and \n\ncustomized training.\n\nSection 680.200 What are training services for adults and dislocated \n\nworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.200 directs the reader to WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(D) \n\nfor a description of available training services. The proposal provides \n\na series of examples that is not all-inclusive.\n\nSection 680.210 Who may receive training services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.210(a) discusses the process used to determine \n\nwhen and what training services must be made available to an \n\nindividual. Under WIOA, an individual may receive training services \n\nafter an interview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning if \n\nthe one-stop operator or partner determines the individual is unlikely \n\nor unable, by only receiving career services, to retain employment that \n\nleads to economic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher \n\n\n\nthan wages from previous employment. Additionally, the one-stop \n\noperator or partner must also determine that the training the \n\nindividual receives would result in employment leading to economic \n\nself-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than wages from \n\nprevious employment. The one-stop operator or partner must also \n\ndetermine that the individual has the skills and qualifications to \n\nsuccessfully participate in and complete the training. Upon a \n\ndetermination that career services are unlikely to obtain these \n\nemployment outcomes, the individual may be enrolled in training \n\nservices. The individual should have the skills and qualifications \n\nneeded to successfully participate in and complete the training \n\nservices.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.210(b) requires that individuals, for whom \n\ntraining has been deemed appropriate, select a training program linked \n\nto employment opportunities in the local area or in an area to which \n\nthe individual is willing to commute or relocate. The selection of this \n\ntraining program should be fully informed by the performance of \n\nrelevant training providers, and individuals must be provided with the \n\nperformance reports for all training providers who provide a relevant \n\nprogram.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.210(c) explains that WIOA training services must \n\nbe provided when other sources of grant assistance are unavailable to \n\nthe individual.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.210(d) requires that training services provided \n\nunder the WIOA adult funding stream must be provided in accordance with \n\nthe State or Local Board's priority system.\n\nSection 680.220 Are there particular career services an individual must \n\nreceive before receiving training services under Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act?\n\n    WIOA removed the requirement under WIA that an individual had to \n\nreceive an intensive service before receiving training services. The \n\nproposal explains that, other than an interview, evaluation, or \n\nassessment and career planning there is no requirement that additional \n\ncareer services must be provided before an individual enrolls in \n\ntraining. Where an assessment is provided, a previous assessment may be \n\nadequate for this purpose. There is no requirement for a sequencing of \n\nservices under WIOA. If individuals are determined to be in need of \n\ntraining consistent with WIOA sec. 134(c)(3) then they may be placed in \n\ntraining services. The Department encourages the use of individualized \n\ncareer services under Sec.  678.420(b) when appropriate for an \n\nindividual; an individual employment plan or career counseling informed \n\nby local labor market information and training provider performance \n\n\n\nreports often will be appropriate before an individual receives \n\ntraining services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.220(b) requires that the case files for \n\nindividuals must document the participant eligibility for training \n\nservices and explain how this determination was made--by interview, \n\nevaluation or assessment, career planning, or other career service, \n\nsuch as an individual employment plan. It is important that the one-\n\nstop gather enough information, by whatever means, be they through an \n\ninterview or through career services, to justify the need for training \n\nservices.\n\nSection 680.230 What are the requirements for coordination of Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act training funds and other grant \n\nassistance?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.230 restates the requirements for coordination \n\nwith other forms of assistance that apply under WIA. The Department has \n\nalso added a sentence to Sec.  680.230(a)(2) to reflect the new \n\nprovision in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(B)(iii) that one-stop operators and \n\none-stop partners may take into account the full cost of the training, \n\nincluding the cost of supportive services. The Department encourages \n\nprogram operators to do so.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.230(a) states that when coordinating other grant \n\nassistance the one-stop operator or\n\n[[Page 20718]]\n\npartner may take into account the full cost of participating in \n\ntraining services, including the cost of dependent care and \n\ntransportation and other appropriate costs. Additionally, the one-stop \n\noperator or partner must coordinate training funds available and make \n\nfunding arrangements with one-stop partners and other entities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.230(b) states that WIOA participants may enroll \n\nin WIOA-funded training while the participant has a Pell Grant \n\napplication pending as long as the one-stop operator has made \n\narrangements with the training provider and the WIOA participant \n\nregarding the award of the Pell Grant. The training provider must \n\nreimburse the one-stop operator or partner the amount of the WIOA funds \n\nused to pay for the training costs covered by the Pell Grant in the \n\nevent that one is approved after WIOA-funded training has begun. \n\nReimbursement from the participant for education-related expenses is \n\nnot required.\n\n4. Subpart C--Individual Training Accounts\n\nIntroduction\n\n    Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) are key tools used in the \n\ndelivery of many training services. The Department seeks to provide \n\n\n\nmaximum flexibility to State and local program operators in managing \n\nITAs. These proposed regulations do not establish the procedures for \n\nmaking payments, restrictions on the duration or amounts of the ITA, or \n\npolicies regarding exceptions to the limits. The authority to make \n\nthose decisions resides with the State or Local Boards. The authority \n\nthat States or Local Boards may use to restrict the duration of ITAs or \n\nrestrict funding amounts must not be used to establish limits that \n\narbitrarily exclude eligible providers.\n\n    Through the one-stop center, individuals will be provided with \n\nquality and performance information on providers of training and, with \n\neffective career services, case management, and career planning with \n\nthe ITA as the payment mechanism. ITAs allow participants the \n\nopportunity to choose the training provider that best meets their \n\nneeds. Under WIOA, ITAs can more easily support placing participants \n\ninto registered apprenticeship programs than under WIA.\n\nSection 680.300 How are training services provided?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.300 explains that in most circumstances an \n\nindividual will receive training services through an ITA. An ITA is \n\nestablished on behalf of the participant, where services are purchased \n\nfrom eligible providers selected in consultation with a career planner. \n\nPayments may be made through electronic transfers of funds, vouchers, \n\nor other appropriate methods. Payments may be made at the beginning of \n\nthe training program or on an incremental basis; the payment processes \n\nmust be decided at the local level. As explained in proposed Sec.  \n\n680.300, an ITA is used by an individual to access training services \n\nfrom an entity on the State's ETPL. In some circumstances involving \n\nwork-based training, such as OJT, customized training, registered \n\napprenticeship, incumbent worker training and transitional jobs, the \n\nLocal Board may contract out the training services. The section allows \n\nfor a Local Board itself to provide the training services if it \n\nreceives a waiver from the Governor. Local Boards must coordinate \n\nfunding for ITAs with funding from other Federal, State, local, or \n\nprivate job training programs or sources to assist individuals in \n\nobtaining training services.\n\nSection 680.310 Can the duration and amount of Individual Training \n\nAccounts be limited?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.310 maintains the State and local flexibility to \n\nimpose limits on ITAs that exists under WIA.\n\nSection 680.320 Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than \n\nIndividual Training Accounts be used to provide training services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.320(a) discusses the exceptions to the otherwise \n\n\n\nrequired use of an ITA for training. In situations covered by these \n\nexceptions, a contract for services may be used to provide for \n\ntraining. The exceptions include:\n\n    1. OJT, which could include placing participants in a registered \n\napprenticeship, customized training, incumbent worker training, or \n\ntransitional jobs.\n\n    2. Where a Local Board determines there are an insufficient number \n\nof eligible providers in the local area to accomplish the purpose of an \n\nITA. The local plan must describe how this determination was made and \n\nthe process used for contracting for services. This exception maintains \n\nthe same language as WIA.\n\n    3. If the Local Board determines a CBO or other private \n\norganization provides effective training services to individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment. The Local Board must develop criteria to show \n\nthat the program is effective.\n\n    4. Training for multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors \n\nor occupations, as long as the contract does not limit the individual's \n\nconsumer choice.\n\n    5. Circumstances in which a pay-for-performance contract is \n\nappropriate, consistent with Sec.  683.510.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.320(b) includes the term ``individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment'' in place of the term ``special participant,'' \n\nas used under WIA. ``Individuals with barriers to employment'' is \n\nbroader than ``special participants.'' ``Individuals with barriers to \n\nemployment'' includes: Displaced homemakers (see Sec.  680.630); low-\n\nincome individuals; Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians; \n\nindividuals with disabilities; older individuals; ex-offenders; \n\nhomeless individuals; youth who are in or have aged out of the foster \n\ncare system; individuals who are English learners, have low literacy \n\nlevels, or face substantial cultural barriers; eligible MSFWs; \n\nindividuals within 2 years of exhausting lifetime eligibility under \n\nTANF; single parents (including pregnant women); long-term unemployed \n\nindividuals; and members of other groups identified by the Governor.\n\nSection 680.330 How can Individual Training Accounts, supportive \n\nservices, and needs-related payments be used to support placing \n\nparticipating adults and dislocated workers into a registered \n\napprenticeship program and support participants once they are in a \n\nregistered apprenticeship program?\n\n    This regulation is designed to ensure States and local areas have \n\nthe flexibility to serve individuals in both being placed into a \n\nregistered apprenticeship as well as to assist currently registered \n\napprentices. WIOA provides a new opportunity for registered \n\napprenticeship programs to automatically qualify to be placed on the \n\n\n\nState's ETPL, allowing ITAs to support participants in registered \n\napprenticeship programs, and more directly connecting apprenticeship \n\nprograms to job seekers in one-stop centers. Some apprenticeship \n\nprograms are with a single employer, whereas others may operate through \n\na joint labor-management organization where participants are selected \n\nfor the apprenticeship but not immediately hired by a specific \n\nemployer. The Department is seeking comment on how registered \n\napprenticeship programs and individuals enrolled or seeking to be \n\nenrolled in such programs may be best served within the one-stop \n\ndelivery system.\n\n[[Page 20719]]\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.330(a) states that participants may use an ITA \n\nto receive training at a pre-apprenticeship program that is on the \n\nState's ETPL. Pre-apprenticeship programs provide training to increase \n\nmath, literacy, and other vocational skills needed to gain entry to a \n\nregistered apprenticeship program. A pre-apprenticeship program funded \n\nwith an ITA must have at least one registered apprenticeship partner; \n\nsuch pre-apprenticeship programs must possess or develop a strong \n\nrecord of enrolling their pre-apprenticeship graduates into a \n\nregistered apprenticeship program. The Department is also open to \n\ncomment on how pre-apprenticeship programs and individuals enrolled or \n\nseeking to be enrolled in such programs may be best served within the \n\none-stop delivery system.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.330(b) explains that the cost of tuition may be \n\npaid through an ITA to the training provider involved in a registered \n\napprenticeship program. In such instances, the training provider may be \n\nan employer, a joint labor-management entity, a labor organization, or \n\nan outside training provider.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.330(c) states that supportive services may be \n\nprovided to support the placement of a participant into a registered \n\napprenticeship program, consistent with the rules governing supportive \n\nservices in subpart H.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.330(d) explains that needs-related payments may \n\nbe provided to support the placement of a participant into a registered \n\napprenticeship program, consistent with the rules governing needs-\n\nrelated payments in subpart H.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.330(e) provides a citation to the regulations on \n\nusing OJT funds with registered apprenticeships.\n\nSection 680.340 What are the requirements for consumer choice?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.340 largely restates the consumer choice \n\n\n\nrequirements established under WIA. The term ``career planner,'' used \n\nin WIOA, replaces the term ``case manager,'' used in WIA. Proposed \n\nSec.  680.340(e) provides that one-stop operators may coordinate \n\nfunding for ITAs with other funding sources in order to assist the \n\nindividual in obtaining training services. Proposed Sec.  680.340(f) \n\nrequires that priority consideration be given to programs that are \n\naligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in the local \n\narea.\n\n5. Subpart D--Eligible Training Providers\n\n    This part describes the methods by which organizations qualify as \n\neligible providers of training services under WIOA. It also describes \n\nthe roles and responsibilities of the State and Local Boards in \n\nmanaging this process and disseminating ETPLs. The State ETPL and the \n\nrelated eligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality, and \n\nlabor-market relevance of programs of training services that receive \n\nfunds through WIOA title I-B. The regulations emphasize that the list \n\nand accompanying information must be easily understood and disseminated \n\nwidely, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and serve all \n\nsignificant population groups.\n\n    The State plays a leadership role in ensuring the success of the \n\neligible provider system in partnership with Local Boards, the one-stop \n\nsystem, and its partners. The Governor must establish eligibility \n\ncriteria and procedures for initial determination and renewals of \n\neligibility for training providers and training programs to receive \n\nfunds under WIOA title I-B. In doing so, the Governor may establish \n\nminimum performance levels for eligibility and the Department \n\nencourages Governors to do so. In establishing minimum performance \n\nlevels for eligibility, the Govenor should take into consideration the \n\nneed to serve targeted populations. The Local Board may establish \n\nadditional performance levels for program eligibility within a local \n\narea.\n\n    The proposed regulations implement WIOA sec. 122 and refer to WIOA \n\nsecs. 107, 116, and 134 where those sections affect provider \n\neligibility, the ETPL, the use of ITAs, and the inclusion of registered \n\napprenticeship programs on the ETPL. In Sec.  680.410, the regulations \n\nclarify that all training providers, including those operating under \n\nthe ITA exceptions, must qualify as eligible providers, except for \n\nthose engaged in OJT and customized training (for which the Governor \n\nmust establish qualifying procedures as discussed in Sec.  680.530). \n\nThe proposed regulations also explain how registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms, which WIOA treats differently than other providers in some \n\nrespects, are to be included in the list. Finally, the regulations \n\ndescribe how the State ETPL must be disseminated with accompanying \n\n\n\nperformance and cost information. The performance information must be \n\npresented in a way that is easily understood, in order to maximize \n\ninformed consumer choice and serve all significant population groups. \n\nSeparately, ETP performance reports, which require providers to supply \n\nperformance information for all individuals enrolled in a program are \n\naddressed in Sec.  677.230.\n\n    In response to concerns expressed by stakeholders that some \n\nproviders of training would face difficulties in participating in this \n\nWIOA-revised system, the Department has clarified the interrelated \n\neligibility requirements and explained that while WIOA places an \n\nemphasis on quality training as measured by performance criteria, State \n\nand Local Boards and training providers must work together in attaining \n\nthis goal. The proposed regulations emphasize the Governor's discretion \n\nin offering financial or technical support to training providers where \n\nthe information requirements of this section result in undue cost or \n\nburden. Making a wide variety of high-quality training programs \n\navailable to participants will increase customer choice and that \n\ntraining providers may find performance information useful to improve \n\ntheir programs of study, which in turn will provide a direct benefit to \n\nparticipants. The Department also encourages the Governor to work with \n\nETPs to return aggregate performance information to the provider in \n\nways that will help the training providers improve their program \n\nperformance. Given that training providers may have many programs of \n\nstudy within their institution, the department is seeking comment on \n\nways that States can help streamline performance reporting for training \n\nproviders and minimize the burden associated with reporting on multiple \n\nprograms of study. The State and Local Boards must work together to \n\nensure sufficient numbers and types of training providers and programs \n\nin order to maximize customer choice while maintaining the quality and \n\nintegrity of training services. In addition, the proposed regulations \n\nexplain that CBOs have the opportunity to deliver training funded under \n\nWIOA through contracts for services rather than ITAs, provided the \n\nlocal area determines this is necessary to meet local customer needs \n\nand also that the provider meets training performance requirements. \n\nBecause of WIOA's emphasis on ensuring the provision of quality \n\ntraining, and the importance of using performance criteria to obtain \n\nsuch quality, the Department does not intend to waive any of the \n\nrequirements of this section. The Department is seeking comment on \n\npossible adaptations of ETP eligibility and reporting requirements to \n\nensure small CBOs, especially those serving hard to\n\n\n\n[[Page 20720]]\n\nserve participant populations, have the capacity to qualify as ETPs.\n\nSection 680.400 What is the purpose of this subpart?\n\n    The workforce development system established under WIOA emphasizes \n\ninformed consumer choice, job-driven training, provider performance, \n\nand continuous improvement. The quality and selection of providers and \n\nprograms of training services is vital to achieving these core \n\nprinciples. As required by WIOA sec. 122, proposed Sec.  680.400 \n\nexplains that States, in partnership with Local Boards, must identify \n\nproviders of training services that are qualified to receive WIOA funds \n\nto train adults and dislocated workers. Therefore, WIOA requires that \n\neach State must maintain a list of ETPs. The list must be accompanied \n\nby relevant performance and cost information and must be made widely \n\navailable, including in electronic formats, and presented in a way that \n\nis easily understood, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and \n\nserve all significant population groups.\n\nSection 680.410 What entities are eligible providers of training \n\nservices?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.410 defines the types of entities that may be \n\nconsidered eligible to provide training services and the specific funds \n\nto be used for this purpose. This proposed section explains that \n\ntraining providers, including those operating under the ITA exceptions, \n\nmust qualify as eligible providers, except for those engaged in OJT and \n\ncustomized training (for which the Governor must establish qualifying \n\nprocedures as discussed in Sec.  680.530). The proposed regulations \n\nidentify registered apprenticeship programs as included in the list as \n\nlong as the program remains registered. This is further explained in \n\nproposed Sec.  680.470.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) explains that only providers that the State \n\ndetermines to be eligible, as required in WIOA sec. 122, may receive \n\ntraining funds under WIOA title I-B. This refers to funds used to \n\nprovide training for adult and dislocated worker participants who \n\nenroll in a program of training services. Proposed paragraph (a) states \n\nthat the Governor will establish the criteria and procedures for \n\ndetermining eligibility. These criteria must take into account, at a \n\nminimum the items in WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(A). Under the requirements of \n\nWIOA sec. 122, the procedures for determining eligibility of providers \n\nare established at the State level and include application and renewal \n\nprocedures, eligibility criteria, and information requirements.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) list the categories of \n\npotentially eligible training entities. This list is largely unchanged \n\nfrom WIA. Potentially eligible entities include post-secondary \n\n\n\neducation institutions, registered apprenticeship programs, other \n\npublic or private providers of training, Local Boards that meet certain \n\nconditions, and CBOs or private organizations providing training under \n\ncontract with the Local Board.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) specify that these eligibility \n\nrequirements apply to adult and dislocated worker funds. The \n\nrequirements apply to both participants who seek training using ITAs \n\nand those who seek training through the exceptions described in \n\nproposed Sec. Sec.  680.320 and 680.530. Under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(G), \n\nlimited exceptions allow local areas to provide training through a \n\ncontract for services rather than ITAs in order to maintain consumer \n\nchoice. These exceptions include: OJT training, customized training, \n\nincumbent worker training, or transitional employment; instances where \n\nthe Local Board determines there are insufficient numbers of eligible \n\nproviders of training services in the local area; where the Local Board \n\ndetermines an exception is necessary to meet the needs of individuals \n\nwith barriers to employment (including assisting individuals with \n\ndisabilities or adults in need of adult education and literacy \n\nservices); where the Local Board determines that it would be most \n\nappropriate to award a contract to an institution of higher education \n\nor other eligible provider to facilitate the training of multiple \n\nindividuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations (where the \n\ncontract does not limit customer choice); and, for pay-for-performance \n\ncontracts.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b)(2) explains that the requirements to become \n\nan eligible provider of training services apply to all organizations \n\nproviding training to adults and dislocated workers, with the specific \n\nexception for registered apprenticeship programs. WIOA makes a change \n\nfrom WIA in that registered apprenticeship programs must be included \n\nand maintained on the list for as long as the program remains \n\nregistered. Registered apprenticeship programs are not subject to the \n\nsame application and performance information requirements as other \n\nETPs. However, because it is possible that particular registered \n\napprenticeship programs may prefer not to be included on the list, the \n\nproposed regulation requires registered apprenticeship programs to \n\nindicate their interest in being on the State list, according to a \n\nmechanism established by the Governor. The pertinent requirements for \n\nregistered apprenticeship programs are explained in proposed Sec.  \n\n680.470.\n\nSection 680.420 What is a ``program of training services''?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.420 defines the term ``program of training \n\nservices,'' which is used throughout this part. The Department explains \n\nthat a program of training services includes a structured regimen that \n\n\n\nleads to specific outcomes. Our definition reinforces a key principle \n\nof WIOA to improve accountability and performance. Proposed paragraphs \n\n(a) through (c) align the outcomes for a program of training services \n\nwith the performance requirements described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). \n\nThese potential outcomes include post-secondary credentials, industry-\n\nrecognized credentials, employment, and measurable skill gains toward \n\ncredentials or employment.\n\nSection 680.430 Who is responsible for managing the eligible provider \n\nprocess?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.430 explains the roles of the Governor and Local \n\nBoards in administering the eligible provider process. Throughout this \n\nsubpart, the Department emphasizes the Governor's discretion, in \n\nconsultation with stakeholders, to establish eligibility procedures. \n\nThe eligible provider process under WIOA sec. 122 requires the Governor \n\nto establish eligibility procedures and to clarify State and Local \n\nBoard roles and responsibilities. In various sections, WIOA assigns \n\nresponsibilities to Local Boards concerning ETPs and identifies \n\nadditional optional activities that may be undertaken by Local Boards. \n\nFor the convenience of stakeholders and the public, the Department has \n\nlisted in proposed Sec.  680.430 these required and potential \n\nactivities.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) explains the Governor's responsibilities for \n\nmanaging the process for determining eligibility, developing and \n\nmaintaining the State's list of ETPs, and disseminating the list to \n\nLocal Boards, as required by WIOA sec. 122. In keeping with WIOA secs. \n\n122(a)(1) and (c)(1), proposed paragraph (a) further requires that \n\nGovernors consult with the State Board when establishing these \n\nprocedures. Proposed paragraph (b) authorizes the Governor to designate \n\na State agency to carry out the requirements of this section. While \n\nWIOA sec. 122 does not address this point, the Department anticipates \n\nthat most States will work through a designated State agency (or \n\nappropriate State entity) to administer the\n\n[[Page 20721]]\n\nrequirements of this section. The Department proposes paragraph (b) to \n\nmake this option explicit.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) describe the State's \n\nresponsibilities for developing and maintaining the State list of \n\nproviders. The State may establish minimum performance levels. The \n\nState is responsible for determining if such performance targets are \n\nmet. It is also the State's responsibility to determine whether \n\naccurate information has been submitted, take enforcement actions as \n\n\n\nneeded, and disseminate the list to the Local Boards, the one-stop \n\nsystem, its partner programs, and the public. This includes \n\ndissemination through Web sites and searchable databases and any other \n\nmeans the State uses to disseminate information to consumers. Under \n\nWIA, similar responsibilities were primarily assigned to the Local \n\nWorkforce Boards. In establishing greater accountability and \n\nflexibility at the State level, WIOA sec. 122 specifically requires the \n\nState to manage the ETP process. Proposed paragraph (b) describes these \n\nresponsibilities and notes the Governor's primary role in exercising \n\nthese responsibilities, including the assignment of duties to be \n\nundertaken by Local Boards.\n\n    Paragraph (c) identifies the required responsibilities of Local \n\nBoards, which are found in WIOA secs. 107 and 134. These include \n\nresponsibilities assigned to Local Boards statutorily as well as \n\nresponsibilities that may be assigned by the Governor. Proposed \n\nparagraph (c)(1) makes clear that the Local Board must carry out \n\nprocedures assigned to it by the State, as provided for under WIOA \n\nsec.122(c)(1). The Department provides examples of the responsibilities \n\nthat the Governor may choose to assign to Local Boards, including \n\nduties similar to those undertaken by Local Boards under WIA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c)(2) explains the Local Boards' responsibility \n\nto work with the State to ensure that there are sufficient number and \n\nvariety of programs to provide participants, as consumers, adequate \n\nchoice among providers, as described in WIOA sec. 107. Local Boards are \n\ncharged with working with the State to ensure that there are sufficient \n\nnumbers and types of providers to meet the skill development needs of \n\nadults and dislocated workers, including those who are disabled and/or \n\nrequire adult literacy assistance. This proposed paragraph emphasizes \n\nthat Local Boards and the State must work together to ensure adequate \n\nconsumer choice.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c)(3) explains, as required by WIOA sec. \n\n134(a)(2)(B), that Local Boards must also ensure that the State' \n\neligible training provider list is disseminated publicly through the \n\nlocal one-stop system, and its partner programs. The list is a tool to \n\nassist one-stop customers in evaluating training programs and provider \n\noptions. The dissemination of the list is also discussed under proposed \n\nSec.  680.500.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) explains the roles that a Local Board may \n\nchoose to exercise in the eligible provider process. The Governor's \n\nprocedure may not prevent Local Boards from exercising these options.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d)(1) emphasizes the potential for Local Board \n\n\n\ninput into the Governor's development of the eligible provider \n\nprocedure. WIOA sec. 122(e) requires the Governor to provide an \n\nopportunity for interested members of the public to make \n\nrecommendations and submit comments regarding the eligibility \n\nprocedure. Although not explicitly addressed in the WIOA sec. 122, the \n\nDepartment interprets its language to encompass Local Boards and thus \n\nhave included this requirement in the proposed paragraph.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) include the provisions at WIOA \n\nsec. 122(b)(3), which allow Local Boards to set additional eligibility \n\ncriteria, information requirements, and minimum performance levels for \n\nlocal providers beyond what is required by the Governor's procedure. \n\nStakeholders and the public must note that any additional requirements \n\nimposed by a Local Board will only affect a program's eligibility and \n\nperformance requirements within the local area.\n\nSection 680.440 What are the transition procedures for Workforce \n\nInvestment Act-eligible providers to become eligible under the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.440 explains the procedure established by WIOA \n\nsec. 122(c) for training providers that were eligible as of the date \n\nWIOA was enacted, July 21, 2014, to continue their eligibility under \n\nWIOA. The Department anticipates the majority of providers previously \n\neligible under WIA will be affected by this transition.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) explains that the Governor may establish a \n\ntransition period and states that providers that were eligible on July \n\n21, 2014 will remain eligible under WIOA until December 31, 2015, or \n\nsuch earlier date as the Governor may set. Proposed paragraph (b) \n\nexplains that in order to retain eligibility after the transition \n\nperiod, these providers will be subject to the application procedure \n\nestablished by the Governor for providers that have previously been \n\nfound eligible, as further explained in proposed Sec.  680.460. \n\nProposed paragraph (c) explains that providers that have previously \n\nbeen found eligible are not subject to the initial eligibility \n\nprocedures, as described in proposed Sec.  680.450. As discussed in \n\nSec.  680.450, the initial eligibility procedures apply only to \n\nproviders that were not previously eligible under WIA or WIOA.\n\nSection 680.450 What is the initial eligibility procedure for new \n\nproviders?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.450 describes the process for adding ``new''' \n\nproviders to the ETPL (i.e., those that have not previously been found \n\neligible under sec. 122 of either WIA or WIOA). Such providers must \n\nfirst apply for initial eligibility according to procedures set by the \n\n\n\nGovernor. In accordance with WIOA sec. 122(b)(4), this proposed section \n\ndescribes the factors the Governor must take into consideration in \n\ndeveloping this procedure and take into account in setting criteria for \n\ninitial eligibility. Eligibility is determined on a program-by-program \n\nbasis for each provider. Proposed Sec.  680.450 distinguishes between \n\nregistered apprenticeship programs seeking inclusion on the list and \n\nother providers. Registered apprenticeship programs, consistent with \n\nWIOA sec. 122(a)(3), are not subject to the initial eligibility \n\napplication procedure. However, registered apprenticeship programs are \n\nrequired to indicate their interest to be included in the ETPL, \n\naccording to a mechanism established by the Governor, as discussed in \n\nSec.  680.470.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) explains that the Governor's procedure must \n\nrequire that providers of training seeking initial eligibility submit \n\nrequired information in order to receive initial eligibility.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) explains the exception for providers who are \n\ncarrying out registered apprenticeship programs under the National \n\nApprenticeship Act. Such programs are included and maintained on the \n\nlist of eligible providers of training for as long as the program \n\nremains registered. Therefore, registered apprenticeship programs are \n\nnot subject to a period of initial eligibility or to initial-\n\neligibility procedures. Rather, the Department proposes paragraph (b) \n\nto require the Governor to establish a procedure whereby registered \n\napprenticeship programs may indicate their interest to be included and \n\nmaintained on the list. This requirement is further discussed in Sec.  \n\n680.470.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) explains the requirement that the Governor \n\nmust consult with Local Boards and solicit\n\n[[Page 20722]]\n\npublic comment in determining the initial eligibility procedure. While \n\nthe Governor is responsible for developing the initial eligibility \n\nprocedure, input by the Local Board and public comment remain important \n\nfor shaping a public workforce system that is responsive to local \n\nneeds. The Local Board is responsible for working with the State to \n\nensure that there are sufficient numbers and types of providers of \n\ncareer and training services, as required by WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E) \n\nand described in proposed Sec.  679.370(m). Therefore, the Department \n\nis requiring that the Governor consult with Local Boards about the \n\ninitial eligibility procedure in order to maximize consumer choice at \n\nthe local level. This is also in keeping with WIOA sec. 122(e) on the \n\nrequirements for public comment. In addition, although WIOA does not \n\naddress this point, the Department proposes requiring the Governor to \n\n\n\ndescribe the procedure, eligibility criteria, and information \n\nrequirements for initial eligibility in the State Plan. Although States \n\nwill need a separate mechanism for public comment during the first year \n\nof implementation, in subsequent years the State Plan process will \n\nafford the opportunity to solicit comments and recommendations from key \n\nstakeholders. In addition, the State Plan submission and review process \n\nallows the Department to ensure compliance with statutory and \n\nregulatory requirements and identify promising practices and technical \n\nassistance needs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor must establish \n\ncriteria and State requirements for non-exempt providers seeking \n\ninitial eligibility. These initial requirements apply to providers that \n\nwere not previously eligible under this section (or sec. 122 of WIA, as \n\nin effect on the day before the enactment of WIOA).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) describes the factors that the Governor must \n\ntake into account in establishing the criteria for determining initial \n\neligibility. For those institutions that are not exempt from complying \n\nwith the ETP application process, the State must establish consistent \n\nand uniform criteria for providers seeking initial eligibility. The \n\ninformation that must be submitted to the State for review will be \n\ndefined by the Governor, but must, at a minimum, address factors \n\nrelated to program elements included in both WIOA secs. 122(b)(4)(D) \n\nand 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV). The Department has listed these required \n\nelements in proposed paragraphs (e)(2) through (5). The elements taken \n\nfrom WIOA sec. 122 include information addressing factors related to \n\nprogram performance indicators, any partnership a program has with a \n\nbusiness, attributes indicating high quality training services and \n\ncredentialing, and the alignment of the program's services with in-\n\ndemand industry sectors. WIOA requires that providers provide \n\n``verifiable program-specific performance information.'' The Department \n\nis interested in comments about the types of verifiable program \n\nspecific-information this would include. The Department is particularly \n\ninterested in the methods of providing verifiable information that are \n\nthe least costly to the training provider and the easiest to verify to \n\nreduce the cost to the State or local area. The Department has added a \n\nrequirement that the applicant provide a description of the program. \n\nThe Department thinks this information is not burdensome and is \n\nessential to enable customers to understand whether the program meets \n\ntheir training needs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) describes the Governor's discretion to \n\nestablish minimum performance standards. As with the application \n\nprocedures described in Sec.  680.460, the Governor may establish \n\n\n\nminimum performance levels in the initial eligibility procedures, and \n\nthe Department encourages them to do so.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.450(g) emphasizes the time limit for initial \n\neligibility, which is 1 fiscal year for a particular program, per WIOA \n\nsec. 122(b)(4)(B).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (h) clarifies that after the period of initial \n\neligibility, these training providers are subject to the Governor's \n\napplication procedure, described at proposed Sec.  680.460 in order to \n\nremain eligible.\n\nSection 680.460 What is the application procedure for continued \n\neligibility?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.460 explains the detailed application process \n\nfor previously WIA-eligible providers to remain eligible under WIOA. \n\nEligibility is determined on a program-by-program basis for each \n\nprovider.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) list the two groups of providers \n\nthat are subject to the requirements of proposed Sec.  680.460. These \n\ninclude new training providers that were previously eligible under WIA \n\n(following the Governor's transition period, which ends December 31, \n\n2015 or such earlier date established by the Governor) as well as new \n\ntraining providers whose initial eligibility expires after 1 fiscal \n\nyear.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) explain that the Governor is \n\nrequired to gather and consider input from Local Boards, providers, and \n\nthe public, including representatives of business and labor \n\norganizations. The Local Board is responsible for working with the \n\nState to ensure that there are sufficient numbers and types of \n\nproviders of career and training services, as required by WIOA sec. \n\n107(d)(10)(E) and described in proposed Sec.  679.370(m). Therefore, \n\nthe Department is requiring that the Governor consult with Local Boards \n\nregarding training provider eligibility procedures in order to maximize \n\nconsumer choice among quality training providers at the local level. \n\nThis is also in keeping with WIOA sec. 122(e) regarding the \n\nrequirements for public comment. While WIOA does not specify a \n\ntimeframe within which the consultation and determination must be \n\ncompleted, proposed paragraph (b)(3) requires the Governor to establish \n\na timeframe for that purpose while leaving the amount of time to the \n\nGovernor's discretion. The same requirements for Local Board \n\nconsultation and a public comment period are described above in \n\nconnection with proposed Sec.  680.450(c) for the Governor's \n\ndevelopment of initial eligibility procedures.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) clarifies that registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms are exempted from these application procedures. Under WIOA \n\n\n\nsec. 122(a)(3), registered apprenticeship programs must be included and \n\nmaintained on the State list for as long as the program remains \n\nregistered. While registered apprenticeships are considered eligible, \n\nnot all registered apprenticeship sponsors may wish to be included. As \n\ndescribed in Sec.  680.470, the Department proposes that the Governor's \n\nprocedure must include a means for registered apprenticeship program to \n\nindicate interest in being included on the list.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor's procedure must \n\ndescribe the roles of the State and local areas in the application and \n\neligibility process. WIOA gives the Governor discretion to assign some \n\nof the responsibility for receiving, reviewing, and making eligibility \n\ndeterminations to local areas. WIOA emphasizes the Governor's \n\ndiscretion in establishing eligibility procedures.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) requires the Governor's procedure to be \n\ndescribed in the State Plan. Although WIOA does not address this point, \n\nthe Department proposes requiring the Governor to describe the \n\nprocedure, eligibility criteria, and information requirements for \n\ninitial eligibility in the State Plan. Although States will need a \n\nseparate mechanism for public comment during the first year of \n\nimplementation, in subsequent years the State Plan process will afford \n\nthe opportunity to solicit\n\n[[Page 20723]]\n\ncomments and recommendations from key stakeholders. In addition, the \n\nState Plan submission and review process allows the Department to \n\nensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and \n\nidentify promising practices and technical assistance needs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) explains the factors that the Governor must \n\ntake into account in developing the eligibility criteria. These include \n\nnine required factors and any additional factors that Governor \n\nconsiders appropriate. The proposed language closely tracks the \n\nlanguage from WIOA sec. 122(b), providing a comprehensive description \n\nof the requirements for the application process. WIOA sec. 122(b) \n\nincludes multiple cross-references to WIOA sec. 116 which identifies \n\nrequired performance accountability measures. Proposed paragraph (f)(1) \n\ngenerally describes the kinds of performance information which training \n\nproviders must submit as part of their application, which pertain to \n\nparticipants receiving training under WIOA title I-B. The Department \n\nrecommends the Governor's procedure emphasize these performance \n\nindicators as a way of establishing minimum standards and a means for \n\ncomparison among training providers offering similar training in \n\n\n\nsimilar areas. The Department recommends States use these measures to \n\nensure performance accountability, continuous improvement, training \n\nprovider quality, and informed consumer choice. The Department \n\nanticipates that complete performance data as required under (f)(1) may \n\nnot be available until PY 2018, given the lag time inherent in the \n\nperformance indicators. Proposed pargraph (f)(1) allows the Govenor to \n\ntake into account alternate factors for any performance information \n\nthat is not yet available until such performance data are available. \n\nThe Department seeks comment on alternate factors related to \n\nperformance that may be used to establish eligibility during this time.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (f)(2) through (10) list the other factors that \n\nthe Governor's criteria must take into account. These include the need \n\nto ensure access to training services in rural areas, information \n\nregarding Federal and State training programs other than within WIOA \n\ntitle I-B, alignment with in-demand industry sectors, State licensure \n\nrequirements, encouraging industry-recognized credentials, provision of \n\npost-secondary credentials, the quality of program and training \n\nservices, and meeting the needs of individuals with barriers to \n\nemployment.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f)(10) requires the Governor's criteria to take \n\ninto account whether the providers timely and accurately submitted \n\neligible training provider performance reports, as required under WIOA \n\nsec. 116(d)(4). This requirement is consistent with the requirement \n\nunder WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(A)(ii) that the criteria to be taken into \n\naccount include the outcomes of the training programs for students in \n\ngeneral with respect to employment and earnings under the indicators of \n\nperformance described in WIOA sec. 116(d)(2). The ETP reports provide \n\ninformation on these employment and earnings outcomes for all \n\nindividuals in a program of study, and the failure to submit such \n\nreports on a timely and accurate basis would undermine the ability of \n\nthe Governor to take such outcomes into account. The Department seeks \n\ncomment on how best to apply the timely and accurate submission of \n\nthese ETP performance reports as a factor for eligibility.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f)(11) explains the Governor's discretion to \n\ntake into account other factors. This paragraph echoes the key \n\nprinciples of the ETPL and WIOA to ensure performance accountability, \n\nto meet the needs of local employers and participants, and to ensure \n\ninformed customer choice.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (g) lists the information that training \n\nproviders are required to provide as part of their application. As \n\ndiscussed in paragraph (k), the Governor has broad discretion to \n\nprescribe additional types of information.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (h) establishes two additional requirements \n\n\n\nconcerning performance, cost, and information collection. Proposed \n\nparagraph (h)(1) states that eligible providers must submit performance \n\nand cost information required by paragraph (g) and the Governor's \n\nprocedure to the State (WIOA secs. 122(b)(1) and (2)). In accordance \n\nwith the State accountability and flexibility intended by WIOA, the \n\ntimeframe and manner for submitting this information is to be \n\ndetermined by the State but at least every 2 years. Proposed paragraph \n\n(h)(2) states that the collection of information required to \n\ndemonstrate compliance with the criteria cannot be unduly burdensome or \n\ncostly to providers, citing to WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (i) explains that the Governor's eligibility \n\nprocedure must provide for the State to biennially review training \n\nprovider eligibility information and assess the renewal of training \n\nprovider eligibility, per WIOA sec. 122(c)(2). In keeping with WIOA's \n\nemphasis on providing discretion to the Governor, the Department has \n\nnot prescribed in paragraph (i) the timeline and manner in which this \n\nbiennial review takes place. These particulars are to be established by \n\nState procedure. The Governor or State agency is not required to \n\nestablish minimum levels of performance, although the Department \n\nencourages them to do so. If minimum levels are established, the \n\nGovernor's procedure must state these requirements and the State may \n\nrequire eligible providers to meet them in order to remain eligible.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (j) requires the Governor's procedure to verify \n\nthe status of registered apprenticeship programs as a part of the \n\nbiennial review of the State list. Although registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms are not subject to the same review procedures as other \n\nproviders, the State must verify the status of the registered \n\napprenticeship programs in order to remove from the list any \n\napprenticeship programs that are no longer registered.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (k) establishes that, as was the case under WIA, \n\nLocal Boards may set additional criteria for eligibility to provide \n\nservices in a local area. WIOA includes this provision at sec. \n\n122(b)(3).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (l) explains that the Governor may establish \n\nprocedures for providing technical assistance in order to assist \n\neligible providers in meeting these requirements. This is in addition \n\nto financial assistance the Governor may provide, as described in \n\nproposed Sec.  680.490.\n\nSection 680.470 What is the procedure for registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms that seek to be included on the State's eligible training \n\nprovider list?\n\n    WIOA encourages registered apprenticeship programs to be active \n\npartners in the public workforce system. These programs are proven job-\n\n\n\ndriven strategies that provide workers with career pathways and \n\nopportunities to earn while they learn. Under WIOA sec. 122(a)(3), a \n\nregistered apprenticeship program is included on the list of ETPs so \n\nlong as the program remains registered. This allows a participant \n\nenrolled in a registered apprenticeship who is eligible to use WIOA \n\ntitle I-B funds to use those funds toward apprentice training, \n\nconsistent with their availability and limitations as prescribed by \n\nproposed Sec.  680.300. The use of ITAs and other WIOA title I-B funds \n\ntoward apprenticeship training is further described in proposed Sec.  \n\n680.330. Registered apprenticeship programs differ from other training \n\nproviders in some respects, notably that a participant's enrollment \n\noccurs only\n\n[[Page 20724]]\n\nthrough an agreement among the participant, the registered \n\napprenticeship program sponsor, and an employer.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.470 explains how registered apprenticeship \n\nprograms are included and maintained on the ETPL. Registered \n\napprenticeship programs are not subject to the application procedures \n\nand information requirements of other training providers to be included \n\non the ETPL, in light of the detailed application and vetting \n\nprocedures under which apprenticeship programs become registered.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) requires registered apprenticeship programs \n\nto indicate interest in being on the State list of ETPs. While \n\nregistered apprenticeship programs are automatically eligible, not all \n\nregistered apprenticeship sponsors may wish to be included on the list. \n\nThe Department proposes that the Governor's procedure include a \n\nmechanism for registered apprenticeship programs to indicate their \n\ninterest.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) explains that a registered apprenticeship \n\nprogram will remain on the list until it loses its registration or \n\nnotifies the State that it no longer wishes to be included on the list.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) explains that when a registered \n\napprenticeship program is included on the State ETPL, this allows an \n\nindividual who eligible to use WIOA title I-B funds to use those funds \n\ntoward apprentice training, consistent with their availability and \n\nlimitations as prescribed by proposed Sec.  680.300.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) addresses performance reporting requirements \n\nfor apprenticeship programs. Registered apprenticeship programs are not \n\nsubject to the same information reporting requirements as other \n\ntraining programs. However, in light of WIOA's emphasis on performance \n\naccountability and informed customer choice, the Department encourages \n\n\n\nGovernors to consult with the State and Local Boards, the Department's \n\nOffice of Apprenticeship, recognized State apprenticeship agencies \n\n(where they exist in the Governor's State), or other State agencies, to \n\nestablish voluntary reporting of performance information.\n\nSection 680.480 May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.480 describes enforcement provisions that are \n\nlargely unchanged from WIA. The Governor has the ability to remove \n\ntraining providers or programs of training services from the State list \n\naccording to the Governor's eligibility and review procedures. Under \n\nWIOA sec. 122(f), States must remove from the eligibility list any \n\nproviders that willfully supply false performance information or that \n\nsubstantially violate requirements of WIOA. Under WIOA, a provider may \n\nalso be removed from the list following the Governor's biennial review \n\nof the provider's program. These provisions support key principles of \n\nWIOA by reinforcing performance accountability and ensuring the high \n\nquality of training programs made available.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) affirms that a provider must deliver \n\npositive results and provide accurate information in order to maintain \n\neligibility.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) explains that if a provider intentionally \n\nprovides inaccurate information or substantially violates any provision \n\nof WIOA or its regulations the provider must be removed from the State \n\nlist for a period of not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all \n\nadult and dislocated worker funds it received during the period of non-\n\ncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures which \n\nindividual or entity is responsible for making these determinations and \n\nthe process by which the determination will be made, which must include \n\nan opportunity for a hearing.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) allows the Governor to remove a program or \n\nprograms from the list for failing to meet State-established criteria \n\nor performance levels. The Department seeks comment on how to \n\nstrengthen enforcement with non-compliant providers over time.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) explains that the Governor must establish an \n\nappeal procedure for providers to appeal a denial of eligibility under \n\nthis section. An appeals process is required by WIOA sec. 122 (c)(1). \n\nProposed Sec.  683.630(b) explains the appeal process for the denial or \n\ntermination of a training provider's eligibility.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) provides that a local area may remove a \n\nprogram or programs from the list for failing to meet higher local \n\nstandards. The local area must also provide the program with an appeal \n\nprocess.\n\nSection 680.490 What kind of performance and cost information must \n\n\n\neligible training providers provide for each program of training?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.490 describes the performance information that \n\nproviders are required to submit to the State in order to establish or \n\nrenew eligibility, as described in WIOA sec. 122(b)(2).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) requires ETPs to submit performance \n\ninformation at least every 2 years, according to procedures established \n\nby the Governor. While the Governor may require reporting at more \n\nfrequent intervals, the Department interprets WIOA sec. 122 to require \n\nthat provider performance information for eligibility purposes must be \n\nsubmitted to the State at least biennially.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) list the program-specific \n\nperformance information, described in WIOA sec. 122, that must be \n\nsubmitted by training providers. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) includes a \n\ncross-reference to the performance elements described at WIOA secs. \n\n116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV). These elements are further discussed in \n\nproposed Sec.  680.460(g)(i) through (iv). Proposed paragraphs (b)(2) \n\nthrough (4) list additional information that must be supplied by \n\nproviders; this includes information on post-secondary credentials \n\noffered, program costs, and the completion rate for WIOA participants \n\nin the program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) explains that the Governor may require any \n\nadditional performance information that he or she considers appropriate \n\nfor determining or renewing eligibility. Separate reporting \n\nrequirements for the State's ETP performance reports under WIOA sec. \n\n116(d)(4) are addressed in Sec.  677.230.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) emphasizes the collaborative relationship \n\nbetween a State and its training providers and explains that the \n\nGovernor must assist providers in supplying the information required of \n\nthem under WIOA and the proposed regulations. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) \n\nstates the statutory requirement, at WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv), that \n\nthe Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for the \n\ncollection of information. Proposed paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) explain \n\nthat the Governor may provide technical and other assistance to \n\nproviders in helping them to meet the performance requirements and that \n\nfunds reserved for statewide activities under WIOA sec. 134 (a)(2)(B) \n\nmay be used for this purpose. While WIOA emphasizes performance \n\naccountability, it is also important to assist ETPs in maintaining \n\ntheir eligibility, especially as training providers adjust to the more \n\ndemanding reporting requirements of WIOA.\n\nSection 680.500 How is the State list of eligible training providers \n\ndisseminated?\n\n    The public's ability to access and easily understand the State ETPL \n\n\n\nand its accompanying information are cornerstones of informed customer \n\nchoice and transparency. In keeping\n\n[[Page 20725]]\n\nwith WIOA's intent for program alignment and service integration, the \n\nDepartment proposes strengthening the distribution of the list to \n\nemphasize dissemination to the public through one- stop partner \n\nprograms in addition to the one-stop system. The ETP performance \n\nreports at WIOA sec. 116(d)(4) are addressed separately in Sec.  \n\n677.230, which requires the coordinated dissemination of the \n\nperformance reports with the ETPL and the information required to \n\naccompany the list.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.500 explains the requirements for distributing \n\nthe list and accompanying information about the programs and providers \n\non the list. These requirements recognize the central importance of the \n\nlist as the means to provide participants, as consumers of employment \n\nand training activities, effective choices among programs and providers \n\nof these services. As discussed previously, informed consumer choice is \n\na key principle under WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) requires the State to disseminate the list \n\nwith accompanying performance and cost information to Local Boards in \n\nthe State and to members of the public online including Web sites and \n\nsearchable databases, through whatever means the State uses to \n\ndisseminate information to consumers, including the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem and its program partners. Local Boards must disseminate the list \n\nthrough the one-stop system as well, as described in proposed Sec.  \n\n680.430(c)(3). Proposed paragraph (b) requires the list to be updated \n\nregularly, while provider eligibility is reviewed biennially. The \n\nDepartment is making a distinction between the eligibility of \n\nindividual providers and updates to the actual list because the \n\nDepartment anticipates the list may be updated on an on-going basis, \n\neven though the review of a particular provider's eligibility status \n\nmay occur biennially.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) requires the State list and accompanying \n\ninformation to be easily available to all one-stop customers through \n\nthe one-stop system and its partner programs. The State list is a key \n\npiece of the State one-stop system. As such, it must be made available \n\nto individuals seeking information on training programs as well as \n\nparticipants receiving career services funded under WIOA and other \n\nprograms. Proposed paragraph (c) further explains that the list must be \n\navailable to individuals who are eligible for training under WIOA as \n\nwell as to individuals whose training is supported by other one-stop \n\n\n\npartners.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) describes the information that must \n\naccompany the list to help participants in making informed choices \n\nregarding training programs and providers. Proposed paragraphs (d)(1) \n\nthrough (4) describe the information that must accompany the list, \n\nincluding recognized post-secondary credentials offered, other \n\ninformation as may be required by the Governor's eligibility criteria, \n\nand performance and cost information. The information available for \n\nprograms in the initial eligibility stage will be different from, and \n\nless extensive than, the information available from programs in the \n\ncontinuing eligibility stage.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d)(3) includes the requirement that the State \n\nmust disseminate the provider list with ``other appropriate \n\ninformation.'' The Department interprets this language to include the \n\nperformance and cost information described at Sec.  680.490.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d)(4) states that the Governor may include any \n\nadditional information to accompany the list as he or she considers \n\nappropriate. The Department encourages States to include any \n\ninformation that, consistent with WIOA's goal of promoting consumer \n\nchoice, will assist participants in choosing training activities and \n\nproviders.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) requires, as described in WIOA sec. \n\n122(d)(3), that the accompanying information must not reveal personally \n\nidentifiable information about an individual participant. In addition, \n\ndisclosure of personally identifiable information from an education \n\nrecord must be carried out in accordance with the FERPA, including the \n\ncircumstances relating to prior written consent.\n\n    The Department is interested in comments on specific ways to \n\nstructure the accompanying information so that it provides a complete \n\nand easily understandable picture of provider performance but is not so \n\ndetailed or complex that it discourages users from consulting it or \n\nlimits its utility to the lay person. Should, for example, there be a \n\nsummary sheet that is easy and quick to read and, if so, what \n\ninformation must be on the summary sheet?\n\nSection 680.510 In what ways can a Local Board supplement the \n\ninformation available from the State list?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.510 explains that Local Boards may choose to \n\nsupplement the criteria and information requirements established by the \n\nGovernor's procedure in order to facilitate informed consumer choice in \n\na local area.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) states that a Local Board may require that \n\nproviders of training services furnish additional criteria and \n\n\n\ninformation as allowed under WIOA sec. 122(b)(3). These requirements \n\nimpact the provision of services in the local area involved.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) explain the type of \n\nadditional information that the Local Board may require providers to \n\nsupply in their application to become eligible. These provisions are \n\nlargely unchanged from the WIA regulations. The Local Board may request \n\nthat the provider of training services explain how the training program \n\nspecifically links to occupations that are in demand within the local \n\narea. The Local Board may also request specific program performance and \n\ncost information particular to a local area where programs are offered \n\nat multiple sites. The Department further explains that Local Boards \n\nmay request information from training providers that indicates how \n\nprograms are responsive to these local requirements, as provided for in \n\nWIOA sec. 122(b)(3).\n\nSection 680.520 May individuals choose training providers located \n\noutside of the local area?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.520 explains that an individual may choose a \n\ntraining provider located outside the local area, and, in some \n\ninstances, in other States. States may enter into reciprocity \n\nagreements with other States under which providers of training services \n\nare allowed to accept ITAs provided by another State. Providers of \n\ntraining services that are located outside the local area may not be \n\nsubject to State eligibility procedures if the provider has been \n\ndetermined eligible by another State with such an agreement. The option \n\nto enter into reciprocity agreements diminishes the burden on States \n\nand providers of training services to be subject to duplicative \n\nprocedures and is allowable under WIOA sec. 122(g). This provision also \n\nexpands the array of training options available for individuals seeking \n\ntraining.\n\nSection 680.530 What requirements apply to providers of on-the-job \n\ntraining, customized training, incumbent worker training, and other \n\ntraining exceptions?\n\n    In proposed Sec.  680.530, the Department explains that providers \n\nof OJT, customized training, incumbent worker training, internships, \n\npaid or unpaid work experience, or transitional employment are not \n\nsubject to the eligibility requirements under WIOA\n\n[[Page 20726]]\n\nsecs. 122(a)-(f), but are required to provide performance information \n\nestablished by the Governor. The Department further explains that the \n\nlocal one-stop operator is required to collect and disseminate \n\ninformation that identifies these providers as meeting the Governor's \n\nperformance criteria. Although these providers are not included on the \n\n\n\nState ETPL they are considered to be eligible providers of training \n\nservices.\n\n6. Subpart E--Priority and Special Populations\n\nIntroduction\n\n    The services provided with adult funds can be a pathway to the \n\nmiddle class for low-income adults, public assistance recipients, and \n\nindividuals who are basic skills deficient. The proposed regulations \n\nimplement the statutorily-required priority for the use of adult funds. \n\nThis subpart contains proposed regulations about how participants from \n\ncertain populations are able to access adult and dislocated worker \n\nservices and establish priority access to these services. WIOA sec. \n\n134(c)(3)(E) provides that priority must be given to recipients of \n\npublic assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who \n\nare basic skills deficient. Under WIA, this priority applies only when \n\nadult funds are limited. Under WIOA, however, priority access to \n\nservices by members of this group applies automatically. Nonetheless, \n\nWIOA allows one-stop operators to provide individualized career \n\nservices to individuals who are not members of these groups, if \n\ndetermined appropriate by the one-stop operator.\n\n    The Department strongly encourages close cooperation between WIOA-\n\nfunded programs and other Federal and State sources of assistance for \n\njob seekers. Coordination between WIOA-funded programs and the TANF \n\nprogram is a crucial element in serving individuals who are on public \n\nassistance. TANF is a required partner in the one-stop delivery system. \n\nThrough close cooperation, each program's participants will have access \n\nto a much broader range of services to promote employment retention and \n\nself-sufficiency than if they relied only on the services available \n\nunder a single program.\n\n    In this subpart, the Department explains how displaced homemakers \n\nmay be served with both adult and dislocated worker funds. Under WIOA, \n\na displaced homemaker qualifies as an ``individual with a barrier to \n\nemployment'' (see proposed Sec.  680.320(b) and its discussion above). \n\nWIOA provides a focus on serving ``individuals with a barrier to \n\nemployment'' to ensure they have opportunities to enter meaningful \n\nemployment; this term is defined in WIOA sec. 3(24). Additionally, \n\ndisplaced homemakers meet the definition of a ``dislocated worker,'' as \n\ndefined in WIOA sec. 3(15)(D). The proposed regulations implement \n\nWIOA's requirements and effectuate its purpose to aid displaced \n\nhomemakers, whose work, albeit without a formal connection to the \n\nworkforce, is recognized for its value, but who may need WIOA services \n\nto develop further work skills. WIOA also expands the definition of \n\ndisplaced homemakers to include dependent spouses of the Armed Forces \n\n\n\non active duty to ensure they have access to WIOA title I services.\n\n    This subpart ensures that veterans and certain service members have \n\naccess to adult and dislocated worker programs. Under WIOA, as was the \n\ncase under WIA, veterans receive priority of service in all Department-\n\nfunded employment and training programs. The proposed regulations \n\ndescribe what is meant by ``priority of service.'' The Department has \n\nproposed a regulation consistent with guidance it issued in Training \n\nand Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) 22-04 that separating service \n\nmembers meet the eligibility requirements for dislocated worker \n\nactivities. This proposed regulation will ensure that service members \n\nwill have access to the full array of services available through the \n\none-stop delivery system.\n\nSection 680.600 What priority must be given to low-income adults and \n\npublic assistance recipients and individuals who are basic skills \n\ndeficient served with adult funds under title I?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.600 provides priority access to career services \n\nand training services funded under WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) and \n\nadult title I. In Sec.  678.430(b), the Department proposes to \n\ncategorize these services as individualized career services. WIOA \n\nbuilds on the priority given under WIA to providing training services \n\nto low-income individuals and individuals receiving public assistance. \n\nUnder WIOA, the priority also extends to individuals who are basic \n\nskills deficient.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.600(a) explains that individualized career \n\nservices and training services must be given on a priority basis to \n\nlow-income adults, public assistance recipients, and individuals who \n\nare basic skills deficient in the local area under the WIOA adult \n\nprogram. For adults, the term ``basic skills deficient'' is defined in \n\nWIOA sec. 3(5)(B) and applies when an individual is unable to compute \n\nor solve problems, or read, write, or speak English, at a level \n\nnecessary to function on the job, in the individual's family, or in \n\nsociety. Priority must be given regardless of funding levels.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.600(b) requires States and local areas to \n\nestablish criteria for providing priority to individualized career \n\nservices and training services with WIOA adult funds under title I. The \n\ncriteria may include other resources and funds for providing career and \n\ntraining-related services in the local area, as well as the needs of \n\nspecific groups in the local area, as well as other factors the local \n\nareas determines appropriate.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.600(c) clarifies that while priority must be \n\ngiven under WIOA adult funds to low-income individuals, public \n\nassistance recipients, or individuals who are basic skills deficient \n\n\n\nfor individualized career services and training services, the Local \n\nBoard and Governor may establish a process that also gives priority to \n\nother individuals.\n\nSection 680.610 Does the statutory priority for use of adult funds also \n\napply to dislocated worker funds?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.610 clarifies that the statutory priority for \n\nlow-income individuals, public assistance recipients, and individuals \n\nwho are basic skills deficient only applies to the WIOA adult program \n\nand not the WIOA dislocated worker program.\n\nSection 680.620 How does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n\nprogram relate to the one-stop delivery system?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.620 explains how the TANF program relates to the \n\none-stop delivery system. Cooperation among required partner programs \n\nis vital to build pathways to the middle class for individuals on \n\npublic assistance and low-income individuals. Partners, working \n\ntogether, can ensure the best mix of services for each individual \n\nseeking to enhance their lives and employment.\n\n    Under WIOA, TANF is a required partner in the one-stop system, \n\nunless the Governor opts out. TANF provides assistance to needy \n\nfamilies and by coordinating closely with WIOA local areas can ensure \n\nprograms and services include the needs of individuals on public \n\nassistance. This section encourages cooperation among the WIOA and TANF \n\nprograms to maximize\n\n[[Page 20727]]\n\nservices available to participants eligible under both programs.\n\nSection 680.630 How does a displaced homemaker qualify for services \n\nunder title I?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.630 explains displaced homemakers' eligibility \n\nfor dislocated worker activities. A displaced homemaker can qualify for \n\neither adult or dislocated worker funds. First, if an individual meets \n\nthe definition of a displaced homemaker under WIOA sec. 3(16), the \n\nindividual is eligible for dislocated worker career and training \n\nservices. Second, the displaced homemaker may be served with title I \n\nadult funds if the individual meets the eligibility requirements for \n\nthis program; generally priority in the adult program is given to low-\n\nincome individuals, individuals on public assistance, or if they lack \n\nbasic work skills. A State may also use reserve funds that target \n\ndisplaced homemakers in which they would be eligible.\n\n    Under WIOA, the definition of a displaced homemaker is expanded to \n\nexplicitly include dependent spouses of a member of the Armed Forces on \n\nactive duty (as defined in sec. 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States \n\n\n\nCode) and whose family income is significantly reduced because of a \n\ndeployment, a call or order to active duty, a permanent change in \n\nstation, or the service-connected death or disability of the service \n\nmember.\n\nSection 680.640 May an individual with a disability whose family does \n\nnot meet income eligibility criteria under the Act be eligible for \n\npriority as a low-income adult?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.640 explains that under WIOA an individual with \n\na disability whose family does not meet income eligibility criteria \n\nwill still qualify for priority as a low-income adult if the individual \n\nmeets the low-income criteria in WIOA sec. 3(36). Additionally, the \n\nDepartment proposes that if an individual with a disability meets the \n\nincome eligibility criteria for payments under any Federal, State, or \n\nlocal public assistance program that individual will also be eligible \n\nfor priority as a low-income adult consistent with WIOA sec. \n\n3(36)(A)(i). This includes recipients of SNAP, TANF, and recipients of \n\nthe Supplemental Security Income program.\n\nSection 680.650 Do veterans receive priority of service under the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.650 builds on the Department's efforts to ensure \n\nveterans are entitled to priority of service in all Department-funded \n\ntraining programs under 38 U.S.C. 4215 and 20 CFR 1010. The proposal \n\nstates that veterans must receive priority of service in programs for \n\nwhich they are eligible. In programs that require income-based \n\neligibility to receive services, amounts paid while on active duty or \n\npaid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for VR, disability, or \n\nother related VA programs are not considered as income when determining \n\nlow-income status. Generally, this means many separating service \n\nmembers may qualify for the WIOA adult program because it provides \n\npriority for low-income individuals and military earnings are not to be \n\nconsidered income for this purpose.\n\nSection 680.660 Are separating service members eligible for dislocated \n\nworker activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.660 explains, consistent with the Department's \n\nlong-standing policy, that service members exiting the military qualify \n\nas dislocated workers. Dislocated worker funds under title I can help \n\nseparating service members enter or reenter the civilian labor force.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.660(a) clarifies that a notice of separation, a \n\nDD-214 from the Department of Defense, or other appropriate \n\ndocumentation that shows a separation or imminent separation from the \n\nArmed Forces qualifies as a notice of termination or layoff required \n\nfor the dislocated worker definition.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.660(b) clarifies that a separating service \n\nmember meets the dislocated worker requirements concerning UC.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.660(c) clarifies that a separating service \n\nmember meets the dislocated worker requirement that an individual is \n\nunlikely to return to his or her previous industry or occupation.\n\n7. Subpart F--Work-Based Training\n\nIntroduction\n\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  680.700 through 680.850 are proposed \n\nregulations for work-based training under WIOA. The proposed \n\nregulations apply to (OJT) training, customized training, incumbent \n\nworker training, and transitional jobs. The proposed regulations \n\ninclude specific information about general, contract, and employer \n\npayment requirements. Work-based training is employer-driven with the \n\ngoal of unsubsidized employment after participation. Generally, work-\n\nbased training involves a commitment by an employer or employers to \n\nfully employ successful participants after they have completed the \n\nprogram. Registered apprenticeship training is a type of work-based \n\ntraining that can be funded in the adult and dislocated worker \n\nprograms; additionally pre-apprenticeships may be used to provide work \n\nexperiences that can help participants obtain the skills needed to be \n\nplaced into a registered apprenticeship.\n\n    Work-based training can be an effective training strategy that can \n\nprovide additional opportunities for participants and employers in both \n\nfinding high quality work and in developing a high quality workforce. \n\nEach of these work-based models can be effectively used to target \n\ndifferent job seeker and employer needs. OJT is primarily designed to \n\nprovide a participant with the knowledge and skills necessary for the \n\nfull performance of the job. Incumbent worker training is designed to \n\nensure that employees of a company are able to gain the skills \n\nnecessary to retain employment and advance within the company or to \n\nprovide the skills necessary to avert a layoff. Customized training is \n\ndesigned to provide local areas with flexibility to ensure that \n\ntraining meets the unique needs of the job seekers and employers or \n\ngroups of employers.\n\n    Both training providers and OJT providers must be providing the \n\nhighest quality training to participants. OJT contracts must be \n\n\n\ncontinually monitored so that WIOA funds provided through OJT contracts \n\nare providing participants with successful employment. It is important \n\nthat OJTs have a strong ability to provide participants with in-demand \n\nskills with opportunities for career advancement and employers with a \n\nskilled workforce.\n\n    Under WIA, States could apply for a waiver to increase \n\nreimbursement amounts of the OJT wage rate. Under WIOA, the statute \n\nenables a Governor or Local Board to increase this rate to 75 percent \n\nwithout a waiver. This change is designed to give States and Local \n\nBoards additional flexibility in developing OJT opportunities that work \n\nbest with the participating employers and in the local economy.\n\n    WIOA also explicitly allows for incumbent worker training at the \n\nlocal level. WIOA introduces incumbent worker training as an allowable \n\ntype of training for a local area to provide. Under WIA, States could \n\nuse their statewide activities funds to conduct incumbent worker \n\ntraining, and local areas could conduct incumbent worker training with \n\nan approved waiver. Incumbent worker training is designed to either \n\nassist workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain employment \n\nor to avert layoffs and must increase both a participant's and a \n\ncompany's\n\n[[Page 20728]]\n\ncompetitiveness. Local areas may use up to 20 percent of their local \n\nadult and dislocated worker funds for incumbent worker training. In \n\nthis proposed regulation, the Department seeks to ensure that incumbent \n\nworker training is targeted to improving the skills and competitiveness \n\nof the participant and increasing the competitiveness of the employer. \n\nThe training should, wherever possible, allow the participant to gain \n\nindustry-recognized training experience, and ultimately should lead to \n\nan increase in wages. To receive incumbent worker funding under WIOA, \n\nan incumbent worker must have an employer-employee relationship, and an \n\nestablished employment history, with the employer. Incumbent workers \n\nare employed at the time of their participation, and the contract funds \n\nare paid to the employer for training provided to the incumbent worker \n\neither to avert a lay-off or otherwise retain employment. An ideal \n\nincumbent worker training would be one where a participant acquires new \n\nskills allowing him or her to move into a higher skilled and higher \n\npaid job within the company, thus allowing the company to hire a job \n\nseeker to backfill the incumbent worker's position. The Departments are \n\nseeking comment on the best way to structure these arrangements to \n\n\n\nmaximize the likelihood that this ideal outcome occurs.\n\n    WIOA also discusses transitional jobs as a way for adults and \n\ndislocated workers with barriers to employment who are experiencing \n\nchronic unemployment or have an inconsistent work history to develop a \n\nwork history and basic work skills essential to keeping a job. \n\nTransitional jobs are time-limited, subsidized employment in the \n\nprivate, non-profit, or public sectors.\n\nSection 680.700 What are the requirements for on-the-job training?\n\n    OJT is a type of training that is provided by an employer to a \n\nparticipant. During the training, the participant is engaged in \n\nproductive work in a job for which he or she is paid, and the training \n\nprovides the knowledge or skills essential to the full and adequate \n\nperformance of the job. Studies over the past 3 decades have found that \n\nin the United States formal OJT programs have positive employment and \n\nearnings outcomes.\\2\\ OJT is a critical tool that can help jobseekers \n\nenter into successful employment.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ Kleinman, Liu, Mastri, Reed, Reed, Sattar, Ziegler, An \n\nEffectiveness Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis of Registered \n\nApprenticeship in 10 States, Mathematica Policy Research, July 2012, \n\nPrepared for the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training \n\nAdministration.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.700(a) explains that OJT may be provided under \n\ncontract with an employer in the public, private non-profit, or private \n\nsectors. Under WIOA, the reimbursement level may be raised up to 75 \n\npercent of the wage rate, in contrast to 50 percent of the wage rate \n\nunder WIA. Typically, the OJT contract provides reimbursement to the \n\nemployer for a portion of the wage rate of the participant for the \n\nextraordinary costs of providing training and supervision related to \n\nthe training.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.700(b) states that contracts must not be entered \n\ninto with an employer that received payments under previous contracts \n\nunder WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of failing to \n\nprovide OJT participants with continued long-term employment as regular \n\nemployees with wages, employment benefits, or working conditions at the \n\nsame level as other employees performing the same type of work for the \n\nsame length of time.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.700(c) continues the requirement under WIA that \n\nOJT contracts must be limited in duration to the time necessary for a \n\nparticipant to become proficient in the occupation for which they are \n\nreceiving the OJT training. When determining the length of the \n\ncontract, the Governor or Local Boards must take into account the skill \n\nrequirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill \n\nlevel of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's \n\nindividual employment plan.\n\nSection 680.710 What are the requirements for on-the-job training \n\ncontracts for employed workers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.710 is unchanged from the WIA regulations. The \n\nproposal identifies the requirements for OJT contracts used to train \n\nemployed workers.\n\nSection 680.720 What conditions govern on-the-job training payments to \n\nemployers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.720 identifies the conditions that govern OJT \n\npayment to employers. OJT payments are to be compensation to the \n\nemployer for the extraordinary costs associated with training \n\nparticipants. The Department does not seek to define through this \n\nregulation what ``extraordinary costs'' are, and is seeking public \n\ncomment on this issue. The Department generally believes extraordinary \n\ncosts are those costs the employer has in training participants who may \n\nnot yet have the knowledge or skills to obtain the job through an \n\nemployer's normal recruitment process.\n\nSection 680.730 Under what conditions may a Governor or Local Board \n\nraise the on-the-job training reimbursement rate up to 75 percent of \n\nthe wage rate?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.730(a) identifies the factors that a Governor or \n\nLocal Board must consider and document in determining whether to raise \n\nthe reimbursement rate for OJT contracts up to 75 percent of the wage \n\nrate.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.730(1) allows for the wage rate to be up to 75 \n\npercent after taking into consideration, among other factors, the \n\ncharacteristics of the participants (WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(H)(ii)(I)), \n\nincluding whether the OJT contract is leading to employment for \n\nindividuals with barriers to employment. Proposed Sec.  680.730(2) \n\nstates that the size of the employer is a factor that must be \n\nconsidered; proposed Sec.  680.730(3) states that the quality of \n\nemployer-provided training and advancement opportunities is a factor \n\n\n\nthat must be considered. Proposed Sec.  680.730(4) states that the \n\nGovernor or Local Board may consider other factors in determining \n\nwhether it is appropriate to raise the reimbursement rate. Such other \n\nfactors may include the number of employees participating, wage and \n\nbenefit levels of employees both before and after OJT completion, and \n\nrelation of training to the competitiveness of the participant. \n\nProposed Sec.  680.730(b) requires that the Governor or Local Board \n\nmust document the factors that they considered when deciding to \n\nincrease the wage reimbursement levels above 50 percent up to 75 \n\npercent. The Department is seeking comments from the public on how the \n\nrelation of training to the competitiveness of the participant must be \n\nanalyzed when implementing this provision.\n\nSection 680.740 How can on-the-job training funds be used to support \n\nplacing participants into a registered apprenticeship program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.740(a) clarifies that an OJT contract may be \n\nmade with a registered apprenticeship program for training \n\nparticipants. OJT contracts are made with the employer, and registered \n\napprenticeships generally involve both classroom and on-the-job \n\ninstruction. The OJT contract may be made to support the OJT portion of \n\nthe registered apprenticeship program. The Department also notes that \n\nregistered apprenticeship programs vary in length, so the OJT may \n\nsupport the entire duration of training while other means\n\n[[Page 20729]]\n\nmay support the beginning of the registered apprenticeship training. \n\nThe Department is seeking comments on what an appropriate maximum \n\namount of time would be for OJT funds to be used to support \n\nparticipants in registered apprenticeships.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies that in some instances a \n\nregistered apprenticeship is operated by the employer and in others it \n\nis operated by a training provider with a direct connection to an \n\nemployer or group of employers. If a participant is in a registered \n\napprenticeship and employed as part of that arrangement, then the OJT \n\nmust be treated as other OJTs provided for employed workers as \n\ndescribed in Sec.  680.710. If a participant is in a registered \n\napprenticeship but is unemployed, the OJT funds may be provided in same \n\nmanner as other OJTs as described in Sec.  680.700.\n\nSection 680.750 Can Individual Training Account and on-the-job training \n\nfunds be combined to support placing participants into a registered \n\napprenticeship program?\n\n    Local areas may use an ITA to support classroom portions of a \n\n\n\nregistered apprenticeship program and OJT funds may be used to support \n\nthe on-the-job portions of the registered apprenticeship program. This \n\nis to ensure local areas have maximum flexibility in serving \n\nparticipants and supporting their placement into registered \n\napprenticeship programs.\n\nSection 680.760 What is customized training?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.760 explains that customized training is to be \n\nused to meet the special requirements of an employer or group of \n\nemployers, conducted with a commitment by the employer to employ all \n\nindividuals upon successful completion of training. The employer must \n\npay for a significant share of the cost of the training.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.760(a) and (b) are unchanged from WIA. In \n\nparagraph (c) under WIA employers were required to pay for not less \n\nthan 50 percent of the cost of the training, WIOA removes the precise \n\nfigure and says that the employer must pay for a ``significant cost of \n\nthe training.''\n\nSection 680.770 What are the requirements for customized training for \n\nemployed workers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.770 identifies the eligibility requirements for \n\nemployed workers to receive customized training. There may be instances \n\nwhere a worker is employed but then receives customized training under \n\ncontract between the local area and the employer. In order for the \n\nemployed worker to qualify, the employee must not be earning a self-\n\nsufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy, the requirements \n\nof customized training in proposed Sec.  680.760 must be met, and the \n\ntraining must incorporate new technologies, processes, or procedures; \n\nskills upgrades; workplace literacy; or other appropriate purposes, as \n\nidentified by the Local Board. Proposed Sec.  680.770 is unchanged from \n\nWIA. The Department is interested in comments that discuss how to \n\ndistinguish customized training from OJT. Should they focus on \n\ndifferent service populations, different training strategies, or \n\ndifferent types of jobs?\n\nSection 680.780 Who is an ``incumbent worker'' for purposes of \n\nstatewide and local employment and training activities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.780 is designed to update the definition of an \n\nincumbent worker from WIA. An incumbent worker is employed with the \n\ncompany when the incumbent worker training starts. The Department is \n\nseeking comment on the appropriate amount of time an employee must have \n\nworked for the employer before being eligible for incumbent worker \n\n\n\ntraining. The Department is proposing a minimum of 6 months, but is \n\nseeking substantive comments on this proposal. The Department is also \n\nseeking comments on how incumbent worker training should increase the \n\ncompetitiveness of the employee or employer for the purposes of \n\nidentifying high-quality incumbent worker opportunities.\n\nSection 680.790 What is incumbent worker training?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.790 discusses the purposes served by and the \n\nconditions relating to incumbent worker training as prescribed by WIOA \n\nsec. 134(d)(4)(B).\n\n    Incumbent worker training is designed to meet the special \n\nrequirements of an employer (including a group of employers) to retain \n\na skilled workforce or avert the need to lay off employees by assisting \n\nthe workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain employment. The \n\nemployer or group of employers must pay for a portion of the cost of \n\nproviding the training to incumbent workers.\n\nSection 680.800 What funds may be used for incumbent worker training?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.800 provides that under WIOA, local areas may \n\nuse up to 20 percent of their combined total of adult and dislocated \n\nworker allotments for incumbent worker training. States may use their \n\nstatewide activities funds and Rapid Response funds for statewide \n\nincumbent worker training activities.\n\nSection 680.810 What criteria must be taken into account for an \n\nemployer to be eligible to receive local incumbent worker funds?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.810 provides the criteria a Local Board must use \n\nwhen deciding on using funds for incumbent worker training with an \n\nemployer. Paragraphs (a) through (c) address participant \n\ncharacteristics, the relationship of the training to the \n\ncompetitiveness of the participant and employer, and other factors that \n\nthe Local Board determines appropriate. These factors may include the \n\nnumber of employees in training, wages and benefits (including post-\n\ntraining increases), and the existence of other training opportunities \n\nprovided by the employer.\n\nSection 680.820 Are there cost sharing requirements for local area \n\nincumbent worker training?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.820 clarifies that there are cost sharing \n\nrequirements for employers participating in incumbent worker training \n\nto pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of providing training to \n\nincumbent workers of the employers.\n\nSection 680.830 What is a transitional job?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.830 explains that transitional jobs are time-\n\nlimited work experiences that are subsidized for individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment who are chronically unemployed or have an \n\ninconsistent work history. These jobs may be in the public, private, or \n\nnon-profit sectors. Transitional jobs can be effective solutions for \n\nindividuals to gain necessary work experience that they would otherwise \n\nnot be able to get through training or an OJT contract. The goal is to \n\nestablish a work history for the individual, demonstrate work success, \n\nand develop skills that lead to entry into unsubsidized employment. The \n\ndifference between a transitional job and an OJT contract is that in a \n\ntransitional job there is no expectation that the individual will \n\ncontinue his or her hire with the employer after the work experience is \n\ncomplete.\n\nSection 680.840 What funds may be used for transitional jobs?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.840 states that local areas may reserve up to 10 \n\npercent of their combined total of adult and dislocated worker \n\nallotments for transitional jobs and must be provided\n\n[[Page 20730]]\n\nalong with comprehensive career services and supportive services.\n\nSection 680.850 May funds provided to employers for work-based training \n\nbe used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.850 clarifies that there is an explicit \n\nprohibition on the use of work-based training funds which includes OJT, \n\ncustomized training, incumbent worker training, transitional jobs or \n\nregistered apprenticeship for assisting, promoting, or deterring union \n\norganizing activities.\n\n8. Subpart G--Supportive Services\n\nIntroduction\n\n    This section defines the scope and purpose of supportive services \n\nand the requirements governing their disbursement. A key principle in \n\nWIOA is to provide local areas with the authority to make policy and \n\nadministrative decisions and the flexibility to tailor the workforce \n\nsystem to the needs of the local community. To ensure maximum \n\nflexibility, the regulations provide local areas the discretion to \n\nprovide the supportive services they deem appropriate subject to the \n\nlimited conditions prescribed by WIOA. Local Boards must develop \n\npolicies and procedures to ensure coordination with other entities to \n\nensure non-duplication of resources and services and to establish \n\nlimits on the amount and duration of such services. Local Boards are \n\n\n\nencouraged to develop policies and procedures that ensure that \n\nsupportive services are WIOA-funded only when these services are not \n\navailable through other agencies and that the services are necessary \n\nfor the individual to participate in title I activities. Supportive \n\nservices may be made available to anyone participating in title I \n\nactivities.\n\n    Needs-related payments are designed to provide a participant with \n\nresources for the purpose of enabling them to participate in training \n\nservices. The Department recognizes that many individuals in need of \n\ntraining services may not have the resources available to participate \n\nin the training. Needs-related payments can help individuals meet their \n\nnon-training expenses and help them to complete training successfully. \n\nA participant must be enrolled in a training program in order to \n\nreceive needs-related payments.\n\nSection 680.900 What are supportive services for adults and dislocated \n\nworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.900 explains that supportive services are \n\nservices, such as transportation, child care, dependent care, housing, \n\nand needs-related payments, that are necessary to enable an individual \n\nto participate in career and training services. Referrals to supportive \n\nservices are one of the career services that must be made available to \n\nadults and dislocated workers through the one-stop delivery system. The \n\nproposed section also provides that Local Boards, in consultation with \n\nthe one-stop partners and other community service providers, must \n\ndevelop a policy on supportive services that ensures resource and \n\nservice coordination in the local area. The policy must address \n\nprocedures for referral to such services, including how such services \n\nwill be funded when they are not otherwise available from other \n\nsources. When developing this policy, the Department encourages Local \n\nBoards to consider incorporating local legal aid services. Legal aid is \n\nable to reduce barriers to employment and establish employment \n\neligibility such as by helping secure a driver's license, expunging \n\ncriminal records, and addressing debts or credit reporting issues.\n\n    In the context of a coordinated one-stop delivery system envisioned \n\nby WIOA, the one-stop needs to take into consideration all of the \n\navailable supportive service resources so that participants may receive \n\nthe best supportive services available and to ensure that funds are \n\nspent to maximize participants' opportunity to participate in career \n\nand training services.\n\nSection 680.910 When may supportive services be provided to \n\nparticipants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.910 states that supportive services may only be \n\nprovided to participants who are in career or training services, unable \n\n\n\nto obtain supportive services through other programs providing \n\nsupportive services, and that they must be provided in a manner \n\nnecessary to enable individuals to participate in career or training \n\nservices. The proposed rule removes references to ``core'' and \n\n``intensive'' services, terms now characterized as ``career services'' \n\nunder WIOA.\n\nSection 680.920 Are there limits on the amounts or duration of funds \n\nfor supportive services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.920 provides that Local Boards may establish \n\nlimits on providing supportive services or allow the one-stop operator \n\nto establish limits, including caps on the amount of funding and length \n\nof time for supportive services to be made available. The rule text \n\nmakes no changes from WIA.\n\nSection 680.930 What are needs-related payments?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.930 defines needs-related payments as financial \n\nassistance to a participant for the purpose of enabling the individual \n\nto participate in training. Needs-related payments are a type of \n\nsupportive service that provides direct financial payments to a \n\nparticipant, and unlike other supportive services, the participant must \n\nbe enrolled in training to receive needs-related payments. The rule \n\ntext makes no substantive changes from WIA; it provides updated \n\ncitations to WIOA.\n\nSection 680.940 What are the eligibility requirements for adults to \n\nreceive needs-related payments?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.940 clarifies that for an adult to receive a \n\nneeds-related payment he or she must be unemployed, not qualify for or \n\nhave ceased to qualify for UC, and be enrolled in a training program.\n\nSection 680.950 What are the eligibility requirements for dislocated \n\nworkers to receive needs-related payments?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.950 provides that dislocated workers may receive \n\nneeds-related payments if they are unemployed, ceased to qualify for UC \n\nor trade readjustment allowance under Trade Adjustment Assistance \n\n(TAA), and be enrolled in training by certain deadlines. It makes one \n\nclarification from WIA in that it provides that the dislocated worker \n\nmust be enrolled in training.\n\nSection 680.960 May needs-related payments be paid while a participant \n\nis waiting to start training classes?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.960 states that payments may be provided if the \n\nparticipant has been accepted into a program that will begin within 30 \n\ncalendar days.\n\nSection 680.970 How is the level of needs-related payments determined?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.970(a) explains that the needs-related payment \n\nlevel for adults must be established by the Local Board. The Department \n\n\n\nrecognizes the costs of different labor markets and believes that \n\npayment levels are best set locally to ensure the needs-related \n\npayments meet their purpose of enabling participants to receive \n\ntraining services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  680.970(b) explains how needs-related payments for \n\ndislocated workers are calculated. If the participant is a dislocated \n\nworker and has established eligibility for UC, the needs-related \n\npayment must not exceed the\n\n[[Page 20731]]\n\nhigher of the weekly level of UC the participant receives or an amount \n\nequal to the poverty level for an equivalent time period. If the \n\nparticipant qualifies for dislocated worker services, but not for UC as \n\na result of the qualifying layoff, the needs-related payment must not \n\nexceed the higher of the weekly level of UC the participant would \n\nreceive if she or he had qualified, if the weekly benefit amount that \n\nthe participant would have received can be determined, or an amount \n\nequal to the poverty level for an equivalent time period. Local Boards \n\nmust adopt policies to adjust the weekly payment level if there are \n\nchanges in total family income.\n\nE. Part 681--Youth Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    Under WIOA, Federal, State, and local partnerships that put the \n\nyouths' interests first will help the nation's disconnected youth to \n\nsucceed. The common performance measures across WIOA core programs, \n\nadult and youth programs under WIOA title I, and Adult Education and \n\nVocational Rehabilitation programs under WIOA titles II and IV provide \n\na mechanism to support youth service alignment. WIOA envisions the \n\nDepartment's youth programs, including Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the \n\nyouth formula-funded program, coordinating to support systems alignment \n\nand service delivery for youth. Local and State plans will articulate \n\nthis vision of youth workforce investment activities and help ensure a \n\nlong-term supply of skilled workers and leaders in local communities.\n\n    WIOA affirms the Department's commitment to providing high quality \n\nservices for youth and young adults beginning with career exploration \n\nand guidance, continued support for educational attainment, \n\nopportunities for skills training in in-demand industries and \n\noccupations, and culminating with a good job along a career pathway or \n\nenrollment in post-secondary education. All of the Department's youth-\n\nserving programs continue to promote evidence-based strategies that \n\n\n\nalso meet the highest levels of performance, accountability, and \n\nquality in preparing young people for the workforce. The Department's \n\nfocus on performance and accountability is emphasized through the \n\nimplementation of the new primary indicators of performance for \n\neligible youth across programs and through their use of the primary \n\nindicators for program management and decision-making.\n\n    WIOA maintains WIA's focus on OSY in Job Corps and YouthBuild, \n\nwhile greatly increasing the focus on OSY in the WIOA youth formula-\n\nfunded program. The shift in policy to focus on those youth most in \n\nneed is based on the current state of youth employment. With an \n\nestimated 6 million 16-24 year olds in our country not employed or in \n\nschool, WIOA youth programs provide a continuum of services to help \n\nthese young people navigate between the educational and workforce \n\nsystems. The Department, working with its Education and Health and \n\nHuman Services partners, plans to provide intensive technical \n\nassistance around meeting the needs of this population.\n\n    WIOA calls for customer-focused services based on the needs of the \n\nindividual participant. This includes the creation of career pathways \n\nfor youth in all title I youth programs, including a connection to \n\ncareer pathways as part of a youth's individual service strategy in the \n\nyouth formula-funded program. In addition, many services under title I \n\nyouth programs are based on the individual needs of participants. WIOA \n\nalso calls for this population to be intimately involved in the design \n\nand implementation of services so the youth voice is represented and \n\ntheir needs are being met.\n\n    This integrated vision also applies to the workforce system's other \n\nshared customer-employers. By repositioning youth as an asset to \n\nemployers with a need for skilled workers, the value of employers \n\nengaging the youth workforce system and programs is enhanced. Employers \n\nare critical partners that provide meaningful growth opportunities for \n\nyoung people through work experiences that give them the opportunity to \n\nlearn and apply skills in real-world setting and ultimately jobs that \n\nyoung people are ready to fill given the opportunity.\n\n    The Department recognizes that much of this alignment and \n\nintegration is already happening in local areas and regions across the \n\ncountry. WIOA aims to build upon these existing efforts through an \n\nemphasis on system alignment, an increased focus on serving OSY and \n\nthose most in need, an emphasis on the needs of individual \n\nparticipants, and the prioritization of connections with employers, \n\n\n\nespecially through work experience opportunities. The Department \n\nrecognizes that WIOA also includes major shifts in approach and is \n\ncommitted to working with the youth workforce investment system to \n\npartner in the implementation of these changes through guidance and \n\ntechnical assistance.\n\n    WIOA supersedes the youth formula-funded program under title I, \n\nsubtitle B, chapter 2 Youth Workforce Investment Activities. It further \n\naligns the WIOA youth program with the other ETA youth training \n\nprograms, including YouthBuild and Job Corps, as well as with titles II \n\nand IV of WIOA by requiring common performance measures across all core \n\nprograms.\n\n    WIOA includes a number of significant changes for the youth \n\nformula-funded program. The biggest change under WIOA is the shift to \n\nfocus resources primarily on OSY. WIOA increases the minimum percentage \n\nof funds required to be spent on OSY from 30 percent to 75 percent. \n\nThis intentional shift refocuses the program to serve OSY during a time \n\nwhen large numbers of youth and young adults are out of school and not \n\nconnected to the labor force. While the Department recognizes this \n\ntransition to serve more OSY will take time to implement, it is \n\ncritical that States and local areas begin to incorporate strategies \n\nfor recruiting and serving more OSY.\n\n    These strategies must incorporate strong framework services which \n\nmust include intake, objective assessments, and the development of \n\nindividual service strategy, case management, supportive services, and \n\nfollow-up services. They must also consider how to ensure that American \n\nJob Center staff have the requisite knowledge and sensitivity to the \n\nneeds of OSY to effectively serve them. The Department plans to release \n\nsubsequent guidance on these matters but also welcomes comments at this \n\ntime on preferred approaches.\n\n    In addition, WIOA includes a major focus on providing youth with \n\nwork experience opportunities. WIOA prioritizes work experiences with \n\nthe requirement that local areas must spend a minimum of 20 percent of \n\nlocal area funds on work experience. Under WIOA, work experience \n\nbecomes the most important of the program elements. WIOA also \n\nintroduces five new program elements: Financial literacy; \n\nentrepreneurial skills training; services that provide labor market and \n\nemployment information about in-demand industry sectors or occupations \n\navailable in the local areas; activities that help youth prepare for \n\nand transition to post-secondary education and training; and education \n\n\n\noffered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce \n\npreparation activities and training for a specific occupation or \n\noccupational cluster.\n\n[[Page 20732]]\n\n    WIOA enhances the youth program design through an increased \n\nemphasis on individual participant needs by adding new components to \n\nthe objective assessment and individual service strategy. WIOA \n\nincorporates career pathways as part of both the objective assessment \n\nand development of the individual service strategy. In addition, the \n\nindividual service strategy must directly link to one or more of the \n\nperformance indicators. The program design under WIOA also includes \n\neffective connections to employers, including small employers, in in-\n\ndemand industry sectors and occupations.\n\n2. Subpart A--Standing Youth Committees\n\nSection 681.100 What is a standing youth committee?\n\n    This proposed section describes a standing youth committee. WIOA \n\neliminates the requirement for Local Boards to establish a youth \n\ncouncil; however, the Local Board may choose to establish, ``a standing \n\ncommittee to provide information and to assist with planning, \n\noperational, and other issues relating to the provision of services to \n\nyouth, which must include CBOs with a demonstrated record of success in \n\nserving eligible youth'' (WIOA sec. 107(b)(4)(A)(ii)). The Department \n\nrecognizes the difficulty under WIA in some local areas in maintaining \n\nthe required youth council partnerships. The Department encourages \n\nLocal Boards to consider establishing standing youth committees, taking \n\nadvantage of the flexibility under WIOA to design standing youth \n\ncommittee membership to meet the local area's needs. Additionally, the \n\nlaw further clarifies that an existing youth council may be designated \n\nas the youth standing committee if they are fulfilling the requirements \n\nof a standing committee which means that they have members of the Local \n\nBoard who have the appropriate experience and expertise in youth \n\neducational and workforce development (WIOA sec. 107(b)(4)(C)). The \n\nDepartment encourages Local Boards to designate high performing youth \n\ncouncils as standing youth committees if appropriate. Local Boards are \n\nresponsible for the oversight of youth programs. Under WIA, youth \n\ncouncils were mandated to fulfill this function for the Board. Local \n\nBoards now may choose to fulfill the oversight responsibility, or have \n\nthe discretion to delegate this function to a standing youth committee. \n\nIf Local Boards choose not to delegate this function to a standing \n\nyouth committee, they are responsible for conducting oversight of youth \n\n\n\nworkforce investment activities under WIOA sec. 129(c).\n\nSection 681.110 Who is included on a standing youth committee?\n\n    This proposed section describes the members of a standing youth \n\ncommittee if the Local Board chooses to establish such a committee \n\nbased on WIOA secs. 107(b)(4)(A)(ii) and 129(c)(3)(C). The members must \n\ninclude a member of the Local Board, who must chair the committee, \n\nmembers of CBOs with a demonstrated record of success in serving \n\neligible youth and other individuals with appropriate expertise and \n\nexperience who are not members of the Local Board. The committee may \n\nalso include parents, participants, and youth. A Local Board may \n\ndesignate an existing entity such as an effective youth council as the \n\nstanding youth committee if its membership meets the WIOA membership \n\nrequirements.\n\nSection 681.120 What does a standing youth committee do?\n\n    This proposed section describes the duties of a standing youth \n\ncommittee if the Local Board chooses to establish such a committee \n\nbased on WIOA secs.107(b)(4)(A)(ii) and 129(c)(3)(C). The standing \n\ncommittee's main function is to inform and assist the Local Board in \n\ndeveloping and overseeing a comprehensive youth program. The details of \n\nits responsibilities are assigned by the Local Board.\n\n3. Subpart B--Eligibility for Youth Services\n\nSection 681.200 Who is eligible for youth services?\n\n    This proposed section based on WIOA sec. 3(18) describes \n\neligibility for the WIOA title I youth formula-funded program which \n\nincludes two groups: In-school youth (ISY) and OSY and establishes \n\nspecific criteria for each group. The eligible WIOA title I youth \n\npopulation represents youth who face challenges and barriers to success \n\nin the labor market.\n\nSection 681.210 Who is an ``out-of-school youth''?\n\n    This proposed section describes how one meets the eligibility for \n\nan OSY for purposes of the title I WIOA youth program. OSY youth must \n\nnot attend any school, be between the ages of 16 and 24 at time of \n\nenrollment, and meet one or more of a list of eight criteria. With one \n\nexception, the WIOA criteria are generally the same as those under WIA. \n\nThe section clarifies that age is based on time of enrollment and as \n\nlong as the individual meets the age eligibility at time of enrollment \n\nthey can continue to receive WIOA youth services beyond the age of 24. \n\nUnlike under WIA or under the definition of an ISY, low income is not a \n\nrequirement to meet eligibility for most categories of OSY under WIOA. \n\nHowever, low income is now a part of the criteria for youth who need \n\nadditional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to \n\nsecure or hold employment. Also, WIOA has made youth with a disability \n\na separate eligibility criterion.\n\n\n\n    In addition, WIOA includes a new criterion: A youth who is within \n\nthe age of compulsory school attendance, but has not attended school \n\nfor at least the most recent school year calendar quarter. Because \n\nschool districts differ in what they use for school year quarters, the \n\ntime period of a school year quarter is based on how a local school \n\ndistrict defines its school year quarters. WIOA lists this criterion as \n\nthe second on the list of eight that satisfy the third of the three \n\nprimary requirements.\n\nSection 681.220 Who is an ``in-school youth''?\n\n    This proposed section describes how one meets the eligibility for \n\nan ISY for purposes of the WIOA title I youth program. ISY youth must \n\nbe attending school, including secondary or post-secondary school, be \n\nbetween the ages of 14 and 21 at time of enrollment, be low-income, and \n\nmeet one or more of a list of seven criteria. These are essentially the \n\nsame criteria as under WIA but the disability criterion has been \n\nseparated from the ``needs additional assistance'' criterion. The \n\nsection clarifies that age is based on time of enrollment and as long \n\nas the individual meets the age eligibility at time of enrollment they \n\ncan continue to receive WIOA youth services beyond the age of 21. WIOA \n\nincludes a youth as low-income if he or she receives or is eligible to \n\nreceive a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell \n\nNational School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).\n\nSection 681.230 What does ``school'' refer to in the ``not attending or \n\nattending any school'' in the out-of-school and in-school definitions?\n\n    The term school refers to both secondary and post-secondary school \n\nas defined by the applicable State law for secondary and post-secondary \n\ninstitutions. This proposed section provides that for purposes of title \n\nI of WIOA, the Department does not consider providers of adult \n\neducation under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild\n\n[[Page 20733]]\n\nprograms, or Job Corps programs as schools. Therefore, if the only \n\n``school'' the youth attends is adult education provided under title II \n\nof WIOA, YouthBuild, or Job Corps, the Department will consider the \n\nindividual an OSY youth for purposes of title I of WIOA youth program \n\neligibility.\n\n    WIOA emphasizes the importance of coordination among Federally-\n\nfunded employment and training programs, including those authorized \n\nunder titles I and II. Many disconnected youth age 16 to 24 meet \n\neligibility requirements for both WIOA title I youth activities and \n\nWIOA title II adult education. Co-enrollment between these two programs \n\ncan be very beneficial to disconnected youth as they can receive work \n\n\n\nexperience and occupational skills through title I funding and literacy \n\nskills through title II funding. Because the eligibility for title II \n\nis similar to that for an OSY under title I, an individual who is not \n\nenrolled or required to be enrolled in secondary school under State \n\nlaw, it is consistent to consider such youth already enrolled in title \n\nII as an OSY for purposes of title I WIOA youth eligibility.\n\nSection 681.240 When do local youth programs verify dropout status, \n\nparticularly for youth attending alternative schools?\n\n    This proposed section provides that dropout status is determined at \n\nthe time of enrollment for eligibility as an OSY and that once a youth \n\nis enrolled as an OSY, that status continues, for purposes of the 75 \n\npercent OSY enrollment requirement, for the duration of the youth's \n\nenrollment, even if the youth later returns to a school. Because WIOA \n\ndoes not define the term alternative school, States must develop a \n\ndefinition. The Department advises States to define alternative school \n\nconsistent with their State education agency alternative school \n\ndefinition. As of September 2014, 43 States and the District of \n\nColumbia have formal definitions of alternative education. The intent \n\nof WIOA is to serve more OSY who are disconnected from school and work, \n\nwhile continuing to develop strategies and provide services to ISY in \n\ncollaboration with community partners.\n\nSection 681.250 Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply \n\nto?\n\n    This proposed section discusses the low-income eligibility criteria \n\nfor OSY and ISY. For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a \n\nsecondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either \n\nbasic skills deficient or an English language learner and youth who \n\nrequire additional assistance to enter or complete an educational \n\nprogram or to secure or hold employment must be low-income. For OSY who \n\nare subject to the justice system, homeless, pregnant or parenting, or \n\nhave a disability, income eligibility documentation is not required by \n\nstatute. All ISY must be low-income. Under WIOA, there are \n\ncircumstances when local areas will find documenting low income for \n\nyouth formula program eligibility less burdensome than it was under the \n\nWIA youth program. For example, for ISY a local program can use \n\neligibility for free or reduced price lunch as low-income \n\ndocumentation. For all youth, those living in a high-poverty area are \n\nconsidered low-income. The section also sets out the exception to the \n\nlow-income requirement that up to 5 percent of youth who meet all the \n\nother eligibility requirements need not be low-income. The 5 percent is \n\ncalculated based on all youth served in the WIOA local youth program in \n\na given PY.\n\n\n\nSection 681.260 How does the Department define ``high poverty area'' \n\nfor the purposes of the special rule for low-income youth in Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    WIOA contains a new provision that allows for youth living in a \n\nhigh-poverty area to automatically meet the low-income criterion that \n\nis one of the eligibility criteria for ISY and for some OSY. In order \n\nto maintain consistency across the country, the Department proposes \n\nthat a high-poverty area be defined as a Census tract; a set of \n\ncontiguous Census tracts; Indian Reservation, tribal land, or Native \n\nAlaskan Village; or a county that has a poverty rate of at least 30 \n\npercent as set every 5 years using American Community Survey 5-Year \n\ndata. While there is no standard definition for the term ``high-poverty \n\narea'' in Federal programs, the Census Bureau uses two similar \n\nconcepts. One is ``poverty area,'' that is an area with a poverty rate \n\nof at least 20 percent and the other is ``area with concentrated \n\npoverty,'' that is an area with a poverty rate of at least 40 percent. \n\nThe term high-poverty area implies an area that has more poverty than a \n\n``poverty area'' but not as much poverty as an ``area with concentrated \n\npoverty.'' In addition, current Department competitive grant programs \n\nfor ex-offenders define high poverty areas as communities with poverty \n\nrates of at least 30 percent. The Department is seeking comments on \n\nwhether the poverty thresholds the Department is proposing are the most \n\nappropriate levels for youth living in a high poverty area.\n\nSection 681.270 May a local program use eligibility for free or reduced \n\nprice lunches under the National School Lunch Program as a substitute \n\nfor the income eligibility criteria under title I of the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section describes a change from WIA in which a local \n\nprogram can use eligibility for free or reduced price lunch under the \n\nRichard B. Russell National School Lunch Act as one of the factors to \n\ndetermine whether a participant meets the low-income criteria for \n\neligibility for the WIOA youth program.\n\nSection 681.280 Is a youth with a disability eligible for youth \n\nservices under the Act if their family income exceeds the income \n\neligibility criteria?\n\n    This proposed section reiterates the WIOA provision that, for an \n\nindividual with a disability, income level for eligibility purposes is \n\nbased on his/her own income rather than his/her family's income.\n\nSection 681.290 How does the Department define the ``basic skills \n\ndeficient'' criterion in this part?\n\n    This proposed section reiterates the basic skills deficient \n\ncriterion that is part of the eligibility criteria for both OSY and \n\nISY, for purposes of title I of WIOA. For the second part of the \n\n\n\ndefinition, which reads ``a youth who is unable to compute or solve \n\nproblems, or read, write, or speak English at a level necessary to \n\nfunction on the job, in the individual's family, or in society,'' the \n\nState and/or Local Board must further define how the State or Local \n\nBoard will determine if a youth is unable to demonstrate these skills \n\nwell enough to function on the job, in their family, or in society as \n\npart of its respective State or local plan. The section also provides \n\nthat local programs must use valid and reliable assessment instruments \n\nand provide reasonable accommodations to youth with disabilities in the \n\nassessment process in making this determination.\n\nSection 681.300 How does the Department define the ``requires \n\nadditional assistance to complete an educational program, or to secure \n\nand hold employment'' criterion in this part?\n\n    This proposed section allows States and/or local areas to define \n\nthe ``requires additional assistance . . .'' criterion that is part of \n\nthe OSY and ISY eligibility. It clarifies that if this criterion is not \n\ndefined at the State level and a local area uses this criterion in \n\ntheir OSY or ISY eligibility, the local\n\n[[Page 20734]]\n\narea must define this criterion in their local plan.\n\nSection 681.310 Must youth participants enroll to participate in the \n\nyouth program?\n\n    This proposed section clarifies that there is no self-service \n\nconcept for the WIOA youth program and every individual receiving \n\nservices under WIOA youth must meet ISY or OSY eligibility criteria and \n\nformally enroll in the program. It defines enrollment as the collection \n\nof information to support an eligibility determination and \n\nparticipation in any one of the 14 program elements. Under WIA the \n\nDepartment received many questions about the point in time that a youth \n\nbecame enrolled in the program. The Department hopes the proposed \n\naddition of connecting enrollment to receipt of a program element \n\nclarifies the moment at which enrollment occurs. The reference to EO \n\ndata in the corresponding section under WIA was dropped because all \n\nrules related to data collection are covered in Sec.  677 on \n\nperformance management.\n\n4. Subpart C--Youth Program Design, Elements, and Parameters\n\nSection 681.400 What is the process used to select eligible youth \n\nproviders?\n\n    WIA regulations did not address the process for identifying and \n\nselecting eligible youth providers required in WIA sec. 123. The \n\nDepartment has received numerous inquiries asking for clarification on \n\nthe competitive selection of youth providers and which services must be \n\n\n\nprovided by entities identified in accordance with WIA sec. 123. This \n\nproposed regulation clarifies which youth activities may be conducted \n\nby the local grant recipient and which services must be provided by \n\nentities identified in accordance with WIOA sec. 123. Consistent with \n\nSec.  664.405(a)(4), the competitive selection requirement in WIOA sec. \n\n123 does not apply to framework services if the grant recipient/fiscal \n\nagent provides these services. The Department allows this because in \n\nsome cases the grant recipient/fiscal agent may be best positioned to \n\nprovide such services. For example, the grant recipient/fiscal agent \n\nthat provides framework services can ensure continuity of WIOA youth \n\nprogramming as youth service providers change.\n\nSection 681.410 Does the requirement that a State and local area expend \n\nat least 75 percent of youth funds to provide services to out-of-school \n\nyouth apply to all youth funds?\n\n    This proposed section describes the new minimum expenditure \n\nrequirement under WIOA that States and local areas must expend a \n\nminimum of 75 percent of youth funds on OSY. Under WIA, local areas \n\nwere required to spend at least 30 percent of funds to assist eligible \n\nOSY. This represents a significant shift in the focus of the WIOA youth \n\nprogram and the Department recognizes such a shift will require \n\nadditional technical assistance and guidance, including assistance to \n\nother youth-serving programs. This section also describes that the \n\nminimum 75 percent OSY expenditure applies to both local area funds and \n\nstatewide youth activities funds reserved by the Governor. However, \n\nonly those statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are \n\nsubject to the OSY expenditure requirement. Funds spent on statewide \n\nyouth activities that do not provide direct services to youth, such as \n\nmost of the required statewide youth activities listed in WIOA sec. \n\n129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. In \n\naddition, local area administrative costs are not subject to the 75 \n\npercent OSY minimum expenditure. The OSY expenditure rate is calculated \n\nfor statewide funds after subtracting out funds that are not spent on \n\ndirect services to youth. The OSY expenditure rate is calculated for \n\nlocal area funds after subtracting the funds spent on administrative \n\ncosts. For example, if a local area receives $1 million and spends \n\n$100,000 on administrative costs, the remaining $900,000 is subject to \n\nthe OSY expenditure rate. In this example, the local area would be \n\nrequired to spend at least $675,000 (75 percent) of the $900,000 on \n\nOSY.\n\n    This section also clarifies the guidelines by which a State that \n\nreceives a minimum allotment under WIOA sec. 127(b)(1) or under WIOA \n\n\n\nsec. 132(b)(1) may request an exception to decrease the expenditure \n\npercentage to not less than 50 percent. The OSY exception language at \n\nWIOA sec. 129(a)(4)(B) references sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv) and sec. \n\n132(b)(1)(B)(iv), which includes States that receive 90 percent of the \n\nallotment percentage for the preceding year under the youth or adult \n\nformula programs (WIOA secs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(I) and \n\n132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(I)) and States that receive the small State minimum \n\nallotment under either program (WIOA secs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) and \n\n132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II)). Under WIA this exception was only available to \n\nStates receiving the small State minimum allotment, and no State \n\nsubmitted a request for the exception. The Department proposes to limit \n\nthe approval of requests described in WIOA sec. 129(a)(4)(B) to only \n\nthose States that receive the small State minimum allotment under WIOA \n\nsecs. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) and 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II). Thus, requests to \n\ndecrease the percentage of funds to be used to provide activities to \n\nOSY will not be granted to States based on their having received 90 \n\npercent of the allotment percentage for the preceding year. When the \n\nSecretary receives such a request from a State based on having received \n\n90 percent of the allotment percentage for the preceding year, the \n\nrequest will be denied without the Secretary exercising further \n\ndiscretion.\n\n    While the list of States receiving the small State minimum \n\nallotment is generally consistent, there is an almost complete yearly \n\nturnover of the States receiving the 90 percent minimum allotment. \n\nGiven this continuous turnover, approving a request from these States \n\nfor an exception to the 75 percent expenditure requirement would cause \n\nsignificant disruption in the operation of local youth programs. In \n\nparticular, States and local areas would be unable to develop and \n\nimplement long-term service delivery strategies and plans and would be \n\nunable to establish the appropriate infrastructure necessary to meet \n\nthe 75 percent expenditure requirement. These disruptions would \n\nadversely affect the quality of services that could be delivered to \n\nyouth program participants, particularly OSY, thereby undermining one \n\nof the most significant changes in priorities from WIA to WIOA. Given \n\nthe disruption and harm that would result from approving requests from \n\nStates receiving the 90 percent minimum allotment for an exception to \n\nthe 75 percent expenditure requirement, the Department proposes to \n\nlimit the approval of this exception to States receiving the small \n\nState minimum allotment.\n\n    Even in those States receiving a small State minimum allotment, it \n\nwill be very difficult for a State to make an affirmative determination \n\n\n\nthat, after analysis of the local area's youth population, the local \n\narea ``will not be able'' to use 75 percent of its funds for OSY, which \n\nis a required element of any request.\n\n[[Page 20735]]\n\nSection 681.420 How must Local Boards design Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act youth programs?\n\n    This proposed section describes the framework for the WIOA youth \n\nprogram design. The framework includes an objective assessment; an \n\nindividual service strategy, which programs must update as needed to \n\nensure progression through the program; and general case management; \n\nand follow-up services that lead toward successful outcomes for WIOA \n\nyouth program participants. WIOA makes two significant changes to WIA's \n\nrequirements for service strategies. One is that the service strategy \n\nmust be linked to one or more of the indicators of performance in WIOA \n\nsec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii). The other is that the service strategy must \n\nidentify career pathways that include appropriate education and \n\nemployment goals. For both objective assessment and individual service \n\nstrategy, programs may use recently completed assessments or service \n\nstrategies conducted by another education or training program rather \n\nthan create new assessments or service strategies if they determine it \n\nis appropriate to do so.\n\n    This proposed section also describes the requirement that Local \n\nBoards must link to youth-serving agencies and adds local human \n\nservices agencies to the list that WIA required. It provides that Local \n\nBoards must provide eligible youth with information about the full \n\narray of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local \n\nBoard or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners. It also \n\nprovides that Local Boards must refer eligible youth to appropriate \n\nservices that have the capacity to serve them on a concurrent or \n\nsequential basis. The proposed section also provides that eligible \n\nproviders must refer youth who either do not meet the enrollment \n\nrequirements for that program or cannot be served by that program for \n\nfurther assessment, if necessary, or to appropriate programs to meet \n\nthe skills and training needs of the participant. Local Boards must \n\nalso involve specific members of the community, including parents and \n\nyouth participants, in designing and implementing the WIOA youth \n\nprogram.\n\n    A new provision in WIOA allows the Local Board to use up to 10 \n\npercent of their funds to implement pay-for-performance contracts for \n\n\n\nthe program elements described in Sec.  681.460. Pay-for-performance \n\ncontracts are further described in Sec.  683.500.\n\nSection 681.430 May youth participate in both the Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act youth and adult programs concurrently, and how do \n\nlocal program operators track concurrent enrollment in the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act youth and adult programs?\n\n    This proposed section provides that youth may participate in both \n\nthe WIOA youth program and the adult program at the same time if they \n\nare eligible for both and it is appropriate. If such concurrent \n\nenrollment occurs, local programs must track expenditures separately by \n\nprogram. This section eliminated the reference, included in the WIA \n\nregulations, to concurrent enrollment in the dislocated worker program \n\nbecause any youth meeting eligibility for the dislocated worker program \n\nwould have already successfully attained a job and would most likely be \n\nmore appropriately served under the dislocated worker program. The \n\nsection also provides that youth who are eligible under both programs \n\nmay enroll concurrently in WIOA title I and II programs.\n\nSection 681.440 How does a local youth program determine if an 18 to 24 \n\nyear old is enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nyouth program or Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act adult \n\nprogram?\n\n    Individuals aged 18 to 24 are eligible for the WIOA adult and youth \n\nprograms and local areas must determine whether to serve such \n\nindividuals in the youth program, adult program, or both. This proposed \n\nsection provides that a local youth program must determine whether to \n\nenroll an 18 to 24 year old in the youth program or adult program based \n\non the individual's career readiness as determined through an objective \n\nassessment.\n\nSection 681.450 For how long must a local Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act youth program serve a participant?\n\n    The Department proposes this new section because the Department's \n\nmonitoring of local areas commonly found WIA youth were exited before \n\nsuccessfully completing the program due to artificial time constraints \n\nor the ending of youth service provider contracts. In order to ensure \n\nthat youth are not prematurely exited from the WIOA youth program, the \n\nDepartment proposes that youth programs serve participants for the \n\namount of time necessary to ensure they are successfully prepared to \n\nenter post-secondary education and/or unsubsidized employment. While \n\nthere is no minimum or maximum time a youth can participate in the WIOA \n\nyouth program, programs must link program participation to a \n\nparticipant's individual service strategy and not the timing of youth \n\nservice provider contracts or PYs.\n\n\n\nSection 681.460 What services must local programs offer to youth \n\nparticipants?\n\n    This proposed section lists the 14 program elements, including 5 \n\nnew youth program elements in WIOA sec. 129(c)(2) that were not \n\nincluded under WIA. These new elements are (1) education offered \n\nconcurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation \n\nactivities and training for a specific occupation or occupational \n\ncluster; (2) financial literacy education; (3) entrepreneurial skills \n\ntraining; (4) services that provide labor market and employment \n\ninformation about in-demand industry sectors or occupations available \n\nin the local area, such as career awareness, career counseling, and \n\ncareer exploration services; and (5) activities that help youth prepare \n\nfor and transition to post-secondary education and training. In \n\naddition, WIOA has revised some of the WIA program elements. For \n\nexample, the element on tutoring, study skills training, instruction \n\nleading to the completion of secondary school, including dropout \n\nprevention strategies, has been revised to provide that the dropout \n\nprevention (and recovery) strategies must be evidence-based and to make \n\nclear that the completion of secondary school can be accomplished by \n\nattainment of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent, \n\nincluding a certificate of attendance or similar document for \n\nindividuals with disabilities. This change is consistent with WIOA's \n\nemphasis on evidence-based programs. WIOA also combines the two WIA \n\nelements of summer youth employment programs and work experiences so \n\nthat summer youth employment programs become one item in a list of work \n\nexperiences and adds pre-apprenticeship programs to the list of work \n\nexperiences. Finally, WIOA expands the description of the occupational \n\nskill training element to provide for priority consideration for \n\ntraining programs that lead to recognized post-secondary credentials \n\nthat are aligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations if the \n\nprograms meet WIOA's quality criteria. This change is consistent with \n\nWIOA's increased emphasis on credential attainment. The section \n\nclarifies that while local WIOA youth programs must\n\n[[Page 20736]]\n\nmake all 14 program elements available to WIOA youth participants, \n\nlocal programs have the discretion to determine which elements to \n\nprovide to a participant based on the participant's assessment and \n\nindividual service strategy.\n\nSection 681.470 Does the Department require local programs to use \n\n\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds for each of the 14 \n\nprogram elements?\n\n    This proposed section clarifies that local WIOA youth programs must \n\nmake all 14 program elements available to youth participants, but not \n\nall services must be funded with WIOA youth funds. Local programs may \n\nleverage partner resources to provide program elements that are \n\navailable in the local area. If a local program does not fund an \n\nactivity with WIOA title I youth funds, the local area must have an \n\nagreement in place with the partner to offer the program element and \n\nensure that the activity is closely connected and coordinated with the \n\nWIOA youth program if enrolled youth participate in the program \n\nelement. By closely connected and coordinated, the Department means \n\nthat case managers must contact and monitor the provider of the non-\n\nWIOA-funded activity to ensure the activity is of high quality and \n\nbeneficial to the youth participant.\n\nSection 681.480 What is a pre-apprenticeship program?\n\n    This proposed section defines a pre-apprenticeship program, which \n\nis one of the types of work experiences listed under WIOA sec. \n\n129(c)(2)(C). The reference to pre-apprenticeship programs is new in \n\nWIOA. The definition is based on TEN No. 13-12 that defined a quality \n\npre-apprenticeship program. Local youth programs must coordinate pre-\n\napprenticeship programs to the maximum extent feasible with registered \n\napprenticeship programs, which are defined in WIOA sec. 171(b)(10), and \n\nrequire at least one documented partnership with a registered \n\napprenticeship program. Quality pre-apprenticeship programs play a \n\nvaluable role in preparing entrants for registered apprenticeship and \n\ncontribute to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce. Pre-\n\napprenticeship programs can be adapted to meet the needs of \n\nparticipants, the various employers and sponsors they serve, and the \n\nspecific employment opportunities available in a local labor market. \n\nPre-apprenticeship training programs have successfully demonstrated \n\nthat obstacles such as low math skills, poor work habits, lack of \n\naccess to transportation, and lack of knowledge of sector opportunities \n\ncan be overcome when coordinated training and support is provided to \n\nworkers.\n\nSection 681.490 What is adult mentoring?\n\n    This proposed section describes the adult mentoring program \n\nelement. It provides that mentoring must last at least 12 months and \n\ndefines the mentoring relationship. It clarifies that mentoring must be \n\nprovided by an adult other than the WIOA youth participant's assigned \n\ncase manager since mentoring is above and beyond typical case \n\n\n\nmanagement services. Mentoring may take many forms, but at a minimum \n\nmust include a youth participant matched with an individual adult \n\nmentor other than the participant's case manager. Mentoring services \n\nmay include group mentoring, mentoring via electronic means, and other \n\nforms as long as it also includes individual mentoring from an assigned \n\nmentor. Local programs should use evidence-based models of mentoring to \n\ndesign their programs. The Department recommends that programs provide \n\nrigorous screening, training, and match support for mentors, and \n\nfrequent contact with youth and parents as the match progresses.\n\nSection 681.500 What is financial literacy education?\n\n    This proposed section describes the financial literacy program \n\nelement, new under WIOA. Financial literacy is described in the \n\nallowable statewide youth activities in WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(D) and the \n\nproposed section reiterates what was stated in the allowable statewide \n\nactivities section of supporting financial literacy. The Department has \n\nadded an element on informing participants about identity theft to the \n\nlist in WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(D). The Department recognizes the \n\nimportance of equipping workers with the knowledge and skills they need \n\nto achieve long-term financial stability and solicits comments on how \n\nbest to achieve this goal.\n\nSection 681.510 What is comprehensive guidance and counseling?\n\n    This proposed section describes the types of guidance and \n\ncounseling services that fall under the program element comprehensive \n\nguidance and counseling, which includes referral to services provided \n\nby partner programs, as appropriate. When referring participants to \n\nnecessary counseling that cannot be provided by the local youth program \n\nor its service providers, the local youth program must coordinate with \n\nthe organization it refers to in order to ensure continuity of service.\n\nSection 681.520 What are leadership development opportunities?\n\n    This proposed section includes all of the examples of leadership \n\ndevelopment opportunities included in WIA regulations and adds two new \n\nexamples of appropriate leadership development opportunities that a \n\nlocal area may consider when providing leadership development \n\nopportunities. One new example is civic engagement activities; the \n\nother is activities which put the youth in a leadership role.\n\nSection 681.530 What are positive social and civic behaviors?\n\n    While WIA included positive social behaviors as part of the \n\ndescription of leadership development opportunities, WIOA adds ``civic \n\nbehaviors'' to the description of the leadership development program \n\nelement. This proposed section expands the examples of positive social \n\nbehaviors to include keeping informed of community affairs and current \n\nevents.\n\nSection 681.540 What is occupational skills training?\n\n\n\n    This proposed section provides a definition for the occupational \n\nskills training program element. It was not previously defined under \n\nWIA. WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(D) further sharpens the focus on occupational \n\nskills training by requiring local areas to give priority consideration \n\nfor training programs that lead to recognized post-secondary \n\ncredentials that align with in-demand industries or occupations in the \n\nlocal area. The Department interprets this requirement to mean that \n\nwhen seeking occupational skills training for a participant, local \n\nareas must first seek training programs that lead to recognized post-\n\nsecondary credentials in in-demand industries or occupations and only \n\nif none are available should they refer a participant to a training \n\nprogram that does not lead to a recognized post-secondary credential. \n\nThe Department has further defined this priority by requiring that such \n\ntraining be outcome oriented and focused on an occupational goal in a \n\nparticipant's individual service strategy and that it be of sufficient \n\nduration to impart the skills needed to meet that occupational goal. In \n\nall cases, local areas must ensure that the training program meets the \n\nquality standards in WIOA sec. 123.\n\n[[Page 20737]]\n\nSection 681.550 Are Individual Training Accounts permitted for youth \n\nparticipants?\n\n    Prior WIA regulations provide that ITAs are not an authorized use \n\nof youth funds. However, more than 30 States received waivers under WIA \n\nto use ITAs for older and OSY to: (1) Expand training options; (2) \n\nincrease program flexibility; (3) enhance customer choice; and (4) \n\nreduce tracking, reporting and paperwork that comes with dual \n\nenrollment. ITAs have therefore become a critical component in WIA to \n\nprovide training services to older and OSY. WIOA is silent on the use \n\nof ITAs for youth participants.\n\n    This proposed section allows ITAs for older OSY aged 18 to 24. This \n\nchange will enhance individual participant choice in their education \n\nand training plans and provide flexibility to service providers. ITAs \n\nalso reduce the burden for local areas by eliminating duplicative \n\npaperwork needed for enrolling older youth in both youth and adult \n\nformula programs. ITAs will benefit disconnected youth and reinforce \n\nWIOA's emphasis on increasing access to and opportunities for workforce \n\ninvestment services for this population. To the extent possible, local \n\nprograms must ensure that youth participants are involved in the \n\nselection of their educational and training activities. The Department \n\nwelcomes comments on the proposed allowance of ITAs for older OSY.\n\n\n\nSection 681.560 What is entrepreneurial skills training and how is it \n\ntaught?\n\n    This proposed section defines entrepreneurial skills training, a \n\nnew program element under WIOA. While entrepreneurial skills training \n\nwas previously listed as an example of a work experience in WIA, under \n\nWIOA it is a separate program element. The Department has also provided \n\na list of possible methods of teaching youth entrepreneurial skills \n\ntraining. The Department is specifically seeking comments from \n\nstakeholders around developmentally appropriate types and methods of \n\nteaching entrepreneurial skills.\n\nSection 681.570 What are supportive services for youth?\n\n    This proposed section lists examples of supportive services for \n\nyouth and includes two additional examples which were not listed in WIA \n\nyouth regulations. Needs-related payments were listed as an example of \n\nan adult supportive service under WIA and also can be critical to youth \n\nliving on their own who participate in a youth program. WIOA lists \n\nneeds-related payments as a supportive service at sec. 3(59). In \n\naddition, the Department lists assistance with educational testing and \n\naccommodations as examples because they are prime example of services \n\nthat can be necessary to enable an individual to participate in \n\nactivities authorized by WIOA. For example, assistance with educational \n\ntesting can provide OSY with the opportunity to take high school \n\nequivalency tests, as well as other exams for occupational \n\ncertifications and credentials, while accommodations may be necessary \n\nfor youth with disabilities to participate in certain assessments and \n\nto have equal access and opportunity to participate in a variety of \n\nwork-based learning activities.\n\nSection 681.580 What are follow-up services for youth?\n\n    This proposed section discusses the importance of follow-up \n\nservices and lists examples of follow-up services for youth, which WIOA \n\nrequires be provided for a minimum of 12 months. It clarifies that \n\nfollow-up services may be different for each individual based on his or \n\nher individual needs. It also clarifies that follow-up services are \n\nmore than a contact attempted or made to gather information for \n\nreporting purposes because follow-up services provide the necessary \n\nsupport to ensure the success of youth post-program. Therefore, to meet \n\nfollow-up requirements, programs must do more than just make an attempt \n\nto contact to gather reporting information. The Department seeks \n\ncomments on whether this section includes reasonable requirements for \n\nfollow-up services.\n\nSection 681.590 What is the work experience priority?\n\n\n\n    The proposed section discusses the 20 percent minimum expenditure \n\nrequirement on the work experience program element in WIOA sec. \n\n129(c)(4). Work experience is a critical WIOA youth program element, \n\narguably the most important program element as signaled by the minimum \n\nexpenditure requirement. Work experience helps youth understand proper \n\nworkplace behavior and what is necessary in order to attain and retain \n\nemployment. Work experience can serve as a stepping stone to \n\nunsubsidized employment and is an important step in the process of \n\ndeveloping a career pathway for youth. Research shows work experience \n\nis correlated with higher high school graduation rates and success in \n\nthe labor market. This is particularly important for youth with \n\ndisabilities.\n\nSection 681.600 What are work experiences?\n\n    The proposed section defines the work experience program element \n\nusing language similar to the corresponding WIA regulation and includes \n\nthe four work experience categories listed in WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C). \n\nIn addition, the section eliminates the language under the \n\ncorresponding WIA rule that OJT is not an appropriate work experience \n\nactivity for youth. WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C)(4) explicitly enumerates OJT \n\nopportunities as one type of work experience.\n\n    Work experiences are designed to enable youth to gain exposure to \n\nthe working world and its requirements. Work experiences should help \n\nyouth acquire the personal attributes, knowledge, and skills needed to \n\nobtain a job and advance in employment.\n\nSection 681.610 How will local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nyouth programs track the work experience priority?\n\n    This proposed section discusses the new requirement under WIOA that \n\na local youth program must use not less than 20 percent of the funds \n\nallocated to the local area to provide youth participants, both ISY and \n\nOSY, with paid and unpaid work experiences. In order to ensure that \n\nlocal WIOA youth programs meet this requirement, the Department \n\nproposes that local WIOA youth programs track program funds spent on \n\npaid and unpaid work experiences and report such expenditures as part \n\nof the local WIOA youth financial reporting. Program expenditures on \n\nthe work experience program element include wages as well as staffing \n\n\n\ncosts for the development and management of work experiences. Like the \n\n75 percent OSY expenditure requirement, local area administrative costs \n\nare not subject to the 20 percent minimum work experience expenditure \n\nrequirement. The work experience expenditure rate is calculated for \n\nlocal area funds after subtracting out funds spent on administrative \n\ncosts and is calculated based on remaining total local area youth funds \n\nrather than calculated separately for in-school and OSY.\n\nSection 681.620 Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nrequire Local Boards to offer summer employment opportunities in the \n\nlocal youth program?\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(C), summer employment opportunities are \n\none of four suggested components of the paid and unpaid work \n\nexperiences\n\n[[Page 20738]]\n\nprogram element. While local WIOA youth programs must provide paid and \n\nunpaid work experiences, they may take the form of a number of \n\nactivities including: summer employment opportunities and employment \n\nopportunities available throughout the year, pre-apprenticeship \n\nprograms, internships and job shadowing, and OJT. While summer \n\nemployment opportunities are an allowable activity and a type of work \n\nexperience that counts toward the work experience priority (which \n\nrequires a minimum of 20 percent of funds allocated to a local area are \n\nspent on work experience) they are not a required program element as \n\nthey previously were under WIA.\n\nSection 681.630 How are summer employment opportunities administered?\n\n    Local areas must adhere to the provisions outlined in WIOA sec. 123 \n\nfor selecting service providers when administering summer employment \n\nopportunities. This proposed section discusses that WIOA requires local \n\nareas to identify youth providers of youth workforce investment \n\nactivities, including work experiences such as summer employment \n\nopportunities, by awarding grants or contracts on a competitive basis. \n\nAs provided in WIOA sec. 123, if there is an insufficient number of \n\neligible providers of youth workforce investment activities, Local \n\nBoards may award grants or contracts on a sole source basis. This \n\nsection also clarifies that the summer employment administrator does \n\nnot need to select the employers who are providing the employment \n\nopportunities through a competitive process.\n\nSection 681.640 What does education offered concurrently with and in \n\n\n\nthe same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a \n\nspecific occupation or occupational cluster mean?\n\n    This proposed section describes the new program element at WIOA \n\nsec. 129(c)(2)(E): ``education offered concurrently and in the same \n\ncontext as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific \n\noccupation or occupational cluster.'' The new program element requires \n\nintegrated education and training to occur concurrently and \n\ncontextually with workforce preparation activities and workforce \n\ntraining for a specific occupation or occupational cluster for the \n\npurpose of educational and career advancement. Youth participants will \n\nnot be required to master basic academic skills before moving on to \n\nlearning career-specific technical skills. This approach aligns with \n\nrecent research which found students using an integrated education and \n\ntraining model had better rates of program completion and persistence \n\nthan a comparison group (Jenkins 2009).\n\nSection 681.650 Does the Department allow incentive payments for youth \n\nparticipants?\n\n    This proposed section clarifies that incentives under the WIOA \n\nyouth program are permitted. The Department has included the reference \n\nto 2 CFR 200 to emphasize that while incentive payments are allowable \n\nunder WIOA, the incentives must be in compliance with the requirements \n\nin 2 CFR part 200. This is not a change; under WIA, incentives must \n\nhave followed the Uniform Administrative Requirements at 29 CFR parts \n\n95 and 97 and the cost principles at 2 CFR parts 220, 225, and 230. The \n\nUniform Administrative Requirements were recently consolidated into 2 \n\nCFR part 200. For example, under 2 CFR part 200, Federal funds may not \n\nbe spent on entertainment costs. Therefore, incentives may not include \n\nentertainment, such as movie or sporting event tickets or gift cards to \n\nmovie theaters or other venues whose sole purpose is entertainment. \n\nAdditionally, under 2 CFR part 200, there are requirements related to \n\ninternal controls to safeguard cash which also apply to safeguarding of \n\ngift cards, which are essentially cash.\n\nSection 681.660 How can parents, youth, and other members of the \n\ncommunity get involved in the design and implementation of local youth \n\nprograms?\n\n    This proposed section discusses the requirement in WIOA sec. \n\n129(c)(3)(C) for the involvement of parents, participants, and \n\ncommunity members in the design and implementation of the WIOA youth \n\nprogram and provides examples of the type of involvement that would be \n\nbeneficial. The Department has also included in this proposed section \n\nthe requirement in WIOA sec. 129(c)(8) that Local Boards must also make \n\nopportunities available to successful participants to volunteer to help \n\n\n\nparticipants as mentors, tutors, or in other activities.\n\n5. Subpart D--One-Stop Services to Youth\n\nSection 681.700 What is the connection between the youth program and \n\nthe one-stop service delivery system?\n\n    This proposed section reiterates the connections between the youth \n\nprogram and the one-stop system that were provided in the WIA \n\nregulations and includes additional examples of such connections \n\nincluding collocating WIOA youth program staff at one-stop centers and/\n\nor equipping one-stop centers and staff with the information necessary \n\nto advise youth on programming to best fit their needs. The intent \n\nbehind this section is to encourage staff working with youth under \n\ntitles I, II, and IV of WIOA to coordinate better services for youth. \n\nThis could include youth-focused one-stop centers in locations where \n\nyouth tend to gather and making one-stops more accessible to youth.\n\nSection 681.710 Do Local Boards have the flexibility to offer services \n\nto area youth who are not eligible under the youth program through the \n\none-stop centers?\n\n    Consistent with WIA, this proposed section clarifies that Local \n\nBoards may provide services to youth through one-stop career centers \n\neven if the youth are not eligible for the WIOA youth program.\n\nF. Part 682--Statewide Activities Under Title I of the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    WIOA provides a reservation of funds for employment and training \n\nactivities to be undertaken on a statewide basis. These activities are \n\nundertaken by the States, rather than by Local Boards. WIOA requires \n\nStates to undertake certain statewide activities, but authorizes States \n\nto undertake a much wider range of activities. These required and \n\nallowable activities are addressed by this part of the proposed \n\nregulations. WIOA designates the percentage of funds that may be \n\ndevoted to these activities from annual allotments to the States--up to \n\n15 percent must be reserved from youth, adult, and dislocated worker \n\nfunding streams, and up to an additional 25 percent of dislocated \n\nworker funds must be reserved for statewide rapid response activities.\n\n    The up to 15 percent funds from the three funding streams may be \n\nexpended on employment and training activities without regard to the \n\nsource of the funding. For example, funds reserved from the adult \n\nfunding stream may be used to carry out statewide youth activities and \n\nvice versa. These funds must be used for certain specified activities, \n\nsuch as for State evaluations and for provision of data for Federal \n\nevaluations and research. If funds permit, States have authority to \n\nprovide a variety of other activities. State set-\n\n\n\n[[Page 20739]]\n\naside funds allow States to continually improve their comprehensive \n\nworkforce programs, ensure a national system that meets the needs of \n\njob seekers, workers and employers, and contribute to building a body \n\nof evidence to improve the effectiveness of services under WIOA.\n\n2. Subpart A--General Description\n\n    This subpart describes what is encompassed by the term ``statewide \n\nemployment and training activities.'' It explains that States have both \n\nrequired and allowable activities to be undertaken on a statewide basis \n\nfor adults, dislocated workers and youth. States have significant \n\nflexibility in the development of policies and strategies for the use \n\nof their statewide funds.\n\nSection 682.100 What are the statewide employment and training \n\nactivities under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \n\nAct?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.100 provides that there are both required and \n\nallowable statewide employment and training activities. States may use \n\nup to 15 percent of adult, youth and dislocated worker funds for \n\nstatewide activities relating to youth, adult, dislocated workers. The \n\nStates are encouraged to develop policies and strategies for utilizing \n\nthese funds, and must include descriptions of these activities in their \n\nState Plan.\n\nSection 682.110 How are statewide employment and training activities \n\nfunded?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.110 does not change how statewide employment and \n\ntraining activities from how such activities were funded under WIA. The \n\nGovernor has authority to use up to 15 percent of the adult, dislocated \n\nworker, and youth funds allocated to the State for statewide \n\nactivities. The regulation provides that the adult, dislocated worker \n\nand youth 15 percent funds may be combined for use on required or \n\nallowed statewide activities regardless of the funding source.\n\n3. Subpart B--Required and Allowable Statewide Employment and Training \n\nActivities\n\n    This subpart first discusses required statewide activities. WIOA \n\ncontinues the activities that were required under WIA, but adds several \n\nadditional required activities, such as assistance to State entities \n\nand agencies described in the State Plan, alignment of data systems, \n\nregional planning, implementation of industry or sector partnerships, \n\nand cooperation in providing data for Federal evaluation and research \n\nprojects. Required statewide activities under WIA and continued under \n\nWIOA include: Outreach to businesses, dissemination of information on \n\n\n\nthe performance and cost of attendance for programs offered by ETPs, \n\nand conducting evaluations.\n\n    This subpart also discusses allowable statewide activities. The \n\nDepartment provides States with a significant amount of flexibility in \n\nhow these funds may be used for statewide activities. States can test \n\nand develop promising strategies. This regulation is not designed to be \n\nan exhaustive list, but more illustrative of the types of allowable \n\nstatewide activities that may be provided with these funds.\n\nSection 682.200 What are required statewide employment and training \n\nactivities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(a) explains that rapid response activities \n\nare a required statewide employment and training activity, as described \n\nin Sec.  682.310.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(b) explains the different types of \n\ninformation States are required to disseminate to the workforce system, \n\nincluding ETPLs, providers of work-based training providers, business \n\npartnership and outreach information, promising service delivery \n\nstrategies, performance information about training providers, eligible \n\nproviders of youth activities, and information about physical and \n\nprogrammatic accessibility for individuals with disabilities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(c) states that the information listed in \n\nSec.  682.200(b) be made widely available. It explains that this may be \n\nachieved by various means, including posting information on State Web \n\nsites, physical and electronic handouts for dissemination to one-stop \n\ncenters, and other appropriate means of sharing information.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(d) explains that under WIOA sec. \n\n134(a)(2)(B)(vi), States are required to use the 15 percent set aside \n\nto conduct evaluations in accordance with WIOA sec. 116(e) whose \n\nrequirements are implemented in Sec.  682.220.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(e) requires States to provide technical \n\nassistance to local areas in carrying out activities described in the \n\nState Plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(f) requires States to assist local areas, \n\none-stop operators, and eligibile providers in providing opportunities \n\nfor individuals with barriers to employment to enter in-demend industry \n\nsectors, and developing exemplary program activities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(g) and (h) require States to assit local \n\nareas carry out the regional planning and service delivery efforts, and \n\nprovide local areas information on and support for the effective \n\ndevelopment, convening, and implementation of industry and sector \n\n\n\npartnerships.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(i) requires the States to provide technical \n\nassistance to local areas that fail to meet their performance goals.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(j) requires the State to carry out \n\nmonitoring and oversight activities of the programs providing services \n\nto youth, adults and dislocated workers in WIOA. Under this authority, \n\nStates may conduct reviews that compare services provided to male and \n\nfemale youth.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(k) clarifies that States may provide \n\nadditional assistance to local areas that have high concentrations of \n\neligible youth to ensure a transition to education or unsubsidized \n\nemployment.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.200(l) requires States to operate a fiscal and \n\nmanagement accountability system. This system is vital to ensure high \n\nlevels in integrity of managing Federal funds and conveying important \n\ninformation on the services being provided to job seekers and \n\nemployers. As required by WIOA, the Department will consult with a wide \n\nrange of stakeholders to establish guidelines for this system (see WIOA \n\nsec. 116(i)(1)).\n\nSection 682.210 What are allowable statewide employment and training \n\nactivities?\n\n    In addition to the required statewide activities, States are \n\nprovided with significant flexibility to innovate within the workforce \n\nsystem with various allowable statewide employment and training \n\nactivities. These allowable activities are vital to ensuring a high \n\nquality workforce system, and can be used to ensure continuous \n\nimprovement throughout the system. This regulation is not designed to \n\nbe an exhaustive list, but more illustrative of the types of allowable \n\nstatewide activities that may be provided with these funds.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(a) provides that State administration of the \n\nadult, dislocated worker, and youth employment and training activities \n\nis an allowable statewide employment and training activity. This \n\nproposed section maintains the same 5 percent administrative cost limit \n\nthat existed under WIA and clarifies that the 5 percent is calculated \n\nbased on the total allotment received by the State and counts towards \n\nthe amount reserved for statewide activities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(b) permits States to use WIOA funds to \n\ndevelop and implement innovative programs and\n\n[[Page 20740]]\n\nstrategies designed to meet employer needs, including small business \nneeds. The workforce system provides services to dual customers--the \n\n\n\njob seeker and the employer. The Department values ways in which States \ncan engage businesses with all levels of the workforce system. Under \nthis section, States have authority to carry out a variety of programs \nidentified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(i), such as sectoral and industry \n\ncluster strategies, microenterprise and entrepreneurial training, and \nutilization of business intermediaries.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(c) permits States to develop and implement \n\nstrategies for serving individuals with barriers to employment and \nencourages States to partner with other agencies to coordinate services \namong all the one-stop partners.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(d) and (e) allow the development and \nidentification of education and training programs that respond to real-\ntime labor market analysis, that allow for use of direct or prior \nassessments, and that provide credit for prior learning, or which have \nother characteristics identified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(iii). States \ncan also use these funds to increase training for individuals placed in \nnon-traditional employment.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(f) permits States to undertake research and \ndemonstrations related to meeting the education and employment needs of \nyouth, adults and dislocated workers, as stated in WIOA secs. \n129(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) and sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(ix).\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(g) provides that States may utilize \nstatewide funds to support the development of alternative, evidence-\nbased programs, and other activities which increase the choices \navailable to eligible youth and encourage them to reenter and complete \nsecondary education, enroll in post-secondary education and advanced \ntraining, progress through a career pathway, and/or enter unsubsidized \nemployment that leads to economic self-sufficiency.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(h) provides that States may utilize \nstatewide funds to support the provision of career services throughout \nthe one-stop delivery system in the State.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(i) provides that States may incorporate a \nvariety of financial literacy identified in WIOA sec. 129(b)(23)(D) \n\nactivities into the service delivery strategy within the one-stop \ndelivery system. Financial literacy activities are important services \nfor job seekers to receive as part of their career services. The \n\nDepartment encourages States to develop and implement strategies for \nlocal areas to utilize to coordinate financial literacy services to \nparticipants under this authority and to provide financial literacy \nactivities to youth under Sec.  682.210(i).\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(j) allows for States to provide incentive \ngrants to local areas for reaching performance goals. Incentive grants \ncan be an effective way to develop and maintain a culture of continuous \nimprovement throughout the workforce system.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(k) allows for States to provide technical \nassistance to local areas, CEOs, one-stop operators, one-stop partners, \nand eligible providers in local areas for the development of exemplary \nprogram activities and the provision of technology to facilitate remote \naccess to services provided through the one-stop delivery system in the \nState (WIOA sec. 129(b)(2)(E));\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(l) allows States to provide technical \nassistance to local areas using pay-for-performance contract \n\nstrategies. Under WIOA, pay-for-performance is an allowable use of \nfunds that could potentially be an effective mechanism to improve \n\nparticipant outcomes. Technical assistance will be of vital importance \n\nto ensure these strategies are being implemented effectively. Under \nthis authority, such technical assistance may include providing \nassistance with data collections, meeting data entry requirements, \nidentifying levels of performance, and conducting evaluations of pay-\n\nfor-performance strategies.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(m) allows for States to utilize technology \nto allow for remote access to training services provided through the \none-stop delivery system. The Department recognizes that there are many \n\ndifferent means by which individuals may get training and that the use \nof technology may be particularly helpful to participants in rural \nareas. The Department encourages States to develop and build upon \n\nstrategies that enable job seekers to connect with the workforce system \nremotely.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(n) allows States to conduct activities that \nincrease coordination between workforce investment activities and \neconomic development approaches. This proposed regulation also allows \nStates to undertake activities that provide coordination with services \nprovided by other agencies, such as child support services and \nassistance (provided by State and local agencies carrying out part D of \ntitle IV of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.)), cooperative extension \nprograms (carried out by the Department of Agriculture), programs in \nthe local areas for individuals with disabilities (including the \nprograms identified in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(viii)(II)(cc)), adult \neducation and literacy activities including those carried out by public \nlibraries, and activities in the corrections system to connect ex-\noffenders reentering the workforce. The Department strongly encourages \nStates to engage in these coordination activities. States are also \nencouraged to use funds to develop and disseminate workforce and labor \nmarket information (WLMI).\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(o) allows States to implement promising \npractices for workers and businesses as described in WIOA sec. \n134(a)(3)(A).\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(p) allows States to develop economic self-\nsufficiency standards that specify the income needs of families, \nincluding the number and ages of children. The Department recognizes \nthat different regions in a State may have different levels of self-\nsufficiency; therefore the proposed regulation allows for States to \ntake geographical considerations into account in developing self-\nsufficiency standards.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(q) allows States to develop and disseminate \ncommon intake procedures across core and partner programs, including \ncommon registration procedures. The Department strongly encourages \nStates to utilize this approach in a customer-focused way. By \n\n\n\ndeveloping common procedures one-stop staff can reduce duplication and \nenhance the job seeker experience in the workforce system.\n    Proposed Sec.  682.210(r) encourages coordinating activities with \nthe child welfare system to facilitate provision of services to \nchildren and youth who are eligible for assistance.\nSection 682.220 What are States' responsibilities in regard to \nevaluations and research?\n    The Department proposes to add rules on new State responsibilities \nand opportunities in regard to evaluation and research under WIOA sec. \n116(e). State and Federal evaluations and research are intended to \nimprove the quality and effectiveness of programs under WIOA, and \ncontribute to an expanding body of knowledge on customers, their needs, \nexisting services, and innovative approaches. Examples of the \n\nstrategies that might be explored in evaluation and research include, \nbut are not limited to, interventions envisioned in WIOA itself, such \nas integrated systems, coordinated services, career pathways, and \nmultiple forms of engagement with businesses.\n\n[[Page 20741]]\n\n    WIOA continues the long-standing support of evaluation and research \n\nfound in prior law, but strengthens it in several ways, including \n\npermitting States to evaluate activities under all of the title I-IV \n\ncore programs, including adult education and vocational education, and \n\npermitting the use of funds from any of these programs for evaluations. \n\nWIOA expands coordination and the consultative process regarding \n\nevaluations and research beyond the workforce system to State agencies \n\nfor the other core programs. Further, WIOA now also requires States to \n\ncoordinate their own studies with evaluations and research projects \n\nundertaken by the Departments of Labor and Education, as well as to \n\ncooperate in provision of data and information for such Federal \n\nevaluations.\n\n    Provisions on the Department's role in evaluation and research, now \n\nfound under WIOA sec. 169 (corresponding to secs. 171 and 172 in WIA), \n\nauthorize a wide array of studies. Evaluation and research projects, \n\npermissible under WIOA sec. 169 include process and outcome studies, \n\npilot and demonstration projects, analyses of programmatic and economic \n\ndata, impact and benefit-cost analyses, and use of rigorous designs to \n\ntest the efficacy of various interventions, such as random assignment. \n\nWIOA also implies that State evaluations are synonymous with multiple \n\nforms of research to test various interventions and to examine program \n\nservices and outcomes in greater depth and over a longer time frame \n\nthan is typically done for performance accountability purposes for \n\nState and local programs.\n\n    Section 169 also includes numerous examples of studies to be \n\nconducted in collaboration with other Federal Departments. WIOA sec. \n\n\n\n169 also requires several research projects (evaluations of title I \n\nprograms, a study of career pathways in health and child care, and \n\nresearch on equivalent pay), suggests seven research projects (relating \n\nto disconnected youth, business needs, nontraditional occupations, \n\nperformance indicators, public housing assistance recipients, older \n\nworkers, and credentials for prior learning), and permits studies of \n\nFederally-funded employment-related programs and activities under \n\n``other provisions of law.'' An evaluation of Job Corp is also required \n\nunder WIOA sec. 161.\n\n    WIOA recognizes in sec. 116(e) the vital role of States in \n\nproviding various forms of quantitative and qualitative data and \n\ninformation for Federal evaluations and research. Data, survey \n\nresponses, and site visit information, from both the State and local \n\nlevels are essential in Federal research designed to understand and \n\nevaluate various existing systems and services as well as new \n\ninterventions. All of these forms of data and information are needed to \n\nunderstand key participant characteristics, labor market outcomes, the \n\nrole of decision-makers, how faithfully interventions are implemented, \n\nand the quality of the customer experience. Further, there are multiple \n\npotential data sources which could include, for example, UI \n\nadministrative data and wage records, data from other workforce \n\nprograms, various documents, and individual or focus group interviews \n\nwith State officials, local program staff and customers.\n\n    To assure that data are consistently available from all States, the \n\nrules emphasize the need for States to cooperate, to the extent \n\npracticable, in data collection activities for evaluations conducted by \n\nthe Departments of Labor and Education, as related to services under \n\nWIOA and to other employment-related programs and activities. The rules \n\nalso clarify the need for States to provide data from sub-State level \n\nand from State and local workforce boards and, further, to encourage \n\nprovision of data by other partner programs. A method for informing the \n\nDepartment about possible problems in providing the various forms of \n\ndata and for resolving such problems is also proposed below.\n\n    Specifically, the rules include the following:\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(a)(1) explains that under WIOA secs. 116(e), \n\n129(b)(1)(A) and 134(a)(2)(B)(vi), States are required to use funds \n\nreserved by the Governor for statewide activities (the State set-aside) \n\nto conduct evaluations of activities of the core programs. Paragraph \n\n(b)(1) requires States to coordinate such evaluations with Federal \n\nevaluation and research activities under WIOA secs. 169 and \n\n242(c)(2)(D) (regarding adult education), under the Rehabilitation Act \n\nof 1973 and under the Wagner-Peyser Act [29 U.S.C. 49i(b)]. Paragraph \n\n(a) delineates the role of evaluations and research in promoting \n\n\n\ncontinuous improvement and high performance in existing programs and \n\nidentifies an additional purpose of evaluation activities: Testing \n\ninnovative services and strategies.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(a)(2) clarifies that the States may use set-\n\naside funds to conduct other research and demonstration projects that \n\nrelate to the education and employment needs for youth, adults and \n\ndislocated workers. Proposed Sec.  682.220(a)(3) clarifies that States \n\nmay use funds from other WIOA title II-IV core programs but only as \n\ndetermined through the consultative processes required with State and \n\nLocal Boards and agencies responsible for the core programs as \n\nreferenced in paragraph (b)(1). Paragraph 682.220(e) highlights the \n\nopportunity for States to use and combine funds from other sources \n\n(consistent with Federal and State law, regulation, and guidance). The \n\nsources might include other Federal and State grants and contracts, as \n\nwell as private philanthropic or other sources.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(b) promotes State efforts to conduct \n\nevaluations and research, assure they relate to State goals and \n\nstrategies, and are coordinated and designed in conjunction with State \n\nand Local Boards and other agencies responsible for the core programs. \n\nThe proposed rule also lists some key features that States can include \n\ntheir evaluations and research projects when appropriate and feasible, \n\nnot as a ``one-size-fits-all'' checklist of requirements for every \n\nevaluation and research project. As such, paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) \n\nimplement WIOA sec. 116(e), but qualifies the requirements for States \n\nto include an analysis of customer feedback and of outcome and process \n\nmeasures when appropriate, to coordinate with Federal evaluations to \n\nthe extent feasible, and to use the most rigorous analytical and \n\nstatistical methods that are reasonably feasible.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(c) implements sec. 116(e)(3) of WIOA, which \n\nrequires States to share their evaluations with the public, including \n\nthrough electronic means, such as posting the results of all types of \n\nresearch and evaluations that States conduct on the relevant State Web \n\nsite.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(d)(1) implements sec. 116(e)(4) of WIOA, \n\nwhich requires States to cooperate, to the extent practicable, in \n\nproviding data, responding to surveys, and allowing site visits in a \n\ntimely manner for Federal evaluation, research, and investigation \n\nactivities conducted by the Secretaries of Labor and Education or their \n\nagents under WIOA secs. 169 and 242, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n\nand the Wagner-Peyser Act, as listed in Sec.  682.200(d) and above. \n\n(The provision of UI data for Federal evaluations and research is \n\n\n\nsubject to regulations found in 20 CFR part 603.) The Department of \n\nLabor intends to work with States and the United States Census Bureau \n\n(Census) to explore the potential to meet the requirement that States \n\nprovide UI wage record data for Federal evaluations and research using \n\nthe wage record data\n\n[[Page 20742]]\n\nStates currently provide to Census for the Longitudinal Employer-\n\nHousehold Dynamics (LEHD) program. This approach to provision of UI \n\ndata may reduce burden on State UI infrastructure, while also making \n\nthe LEHD data set more useful to a broad array of researchers. Since \n\ndata and survey responses from local subgrantees and State and local \n\nworkforce boards are often critical in Federal evaluation and research \n\nprojects, the rule also requires that States provide timely data and \n\nsurvey responses from these entities and that States assure that \n\nsubgrantees and boards allow timely site visits for Federal \n\nevaluations. States are proposed to assume these responsibilities \n\nbecause of their relationship with and support of the boards as well as \n\ntheir role in overseeing the operation of subgrantees. Since States do \n\nnot set the requirements for other one-stop partners, proposed Sec.  \n\n682.220(d)(2) requires States to encourage these partners to cooperate \n\nin data provision for the relevant Federal evaluations and research.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.220(d)(3) requires a Governor to inform the \n\nSecretary in writing if a State finds that it is not practicable to \n\nparticipate in timely provision of data, survey responses and site \n\nvisits for Department of Labor or Department of Education evaluations \n\nand research, and, further, to explain why it is not practicable for \n\nthe State to provide the requested information. This explanation will \n\nhelp the Department to work more effectively with the State to \n\naccommodate its concerns and mitigate or overcome any problems \n\npreventing the State from providing the information needed for Federal \n\nevaluations or research conducted under the various authorities cited \n\nin Sec.  682.200(d).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  665.220(e) provides that States may use or combine \n\nfunds, consistent with Federal and State law, regulation, and guidance, \n\nfrom other public or private sources, to conduct evaluations, research, \n\nand demonstration projects relating to activities under the WIOA title \n\nI-IV core programs. The Department will provide information, technical \n\nassistance, and guidance to support States in conducting their own \n\nevaluations and research, at the highest levels of quality and \n\nintegrity, consistent with State goals and priorities, and using \n\n\n\nmethodologies appropriate to the research objectives and the funds \n\navailable. The technical assistance and guidance will also address how \n\nStates can coordinate with studies conducted by the Departments of \n\nLabor and Education under WIOA and cooperate in providing data and \n\nother information for such Federal research.\n\n4. Subpart C--Rapid Response Activities\n\nIntroduction\n\n    This subpart discusses the important role that rapid response plays \n\nin providing customer-focused services both to dislocated workers and \n\nemployers, thereby ensuring immediate access to affected workers to \n\nhelp them quickly reenter the workforce. The proposed regulations \n\nreflect the Department's experience in managing the PYs and lessons \n\nlearned from the innovations and best practices of various rapid \n\nresponse programs around the country in planning for and meeting the \n\nchallenges posed by events precipitating substantial increases in the \n\nnumber of unemployed individuals in States, regions and local areas. \n\nThe proposed regulations provide a comprehensive framework for \n\noperating successful rapid response programs in a way that promotes \n\ninnovation and maintains flexibility to enable States to successfully \n\nmanage economic transitions.\n\n    Section 134(a)(2) of WIOA authorizes the use of reserved funds for \n\nstatewide activities to plan for and respond to events that precipitate \n\nsubstantial increases in the number of unemployed individuals. Except \n\nfor a new provision, at sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(ii), that addresses the use \n\nof unobligated funds for rapid response activities, WIOA largely \n\nreplicates the language in sec. 134 of WIA. The proposed regulations \n\nprovide additional, detailed direction regarding required and optional \n\nrapid response activities. The WIA regulations concerning the rapid \n\nresponse program provided substantial flexibility in program design and \n\nimplementation. This flexibility allowed for customized planning and \n\nresponses based upon specific factors in a given situation--an \n\nimportant component to delivering effective services. However, some \n\nStates and local operators did not understand the full range of \n\nactivities allowable under the program. In crafting the proposed \n\nregulations, the Department has worked to maintain the same flexibility \n\nthat the current regulation allows, while providing more detailed \n\ninformation about appropriate activities, such as layoff aversion, \n\nengaging business, and illustrating how these funds can be used.\n\n    Our proposed approach is based on the premise that successful rapid \n\nresponse programs are flexible, agile, and focused on promptly \n\ndelivering comprehensive solutions to businesses and workers in \n\n\n\ntransition. Rapid response, when operated successfully, delivers on the \n\npromises that the workforce system makes to businesses, workers, and \n\ncommunities--to provide economically valuable solutions to businesses \n\nand critically important services to workers at the time when they are \n\nmost needed. These proposed regulations are designed to ensure that \n\nrapid response programs in all States are capable of meeting those \n\npromises, that service levels are consistent in quality yet customized \n\nto specific events, and activities are driven always by the goal of \n\npreventing or minimizing unemployment. The proposed regulations also \n\nfocus specifically on anticipating needs and planning for them, rather \n\nthan only responding to layoff events.\n\nSection 682.300 What is rapid response, and what is its purpose?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.300 describes the purpose of rapid response--to \n\npromote economic development and vitality--and identifies the \n\nactivities and responsibilities to meet this purpose. Proposed Sec.  \n\n682.300(a) identifies as key components of rapid response the \n\nstrategies and activities necessary to plan for and respond to layoffs \n\nor other dislocation events, including natural or other disasters. \n\nWhile many States will provide rapid response services for layoffs of \n\nall sizes, some States have restricted rapid response services to \n\nlayoffs of 50 or more workers, or for which they received a Worker \n\nAdjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notice. While rapid \n\nresponse is required for closures and mass layoffs, the Department's \n\nintention is that effective services are provided to as many workers \n\nand companies as possible. Most employers have fewer than 50 workers, \n\nand thus, a substantial percentage of layoffs do not qualify for WARN \n\ncoverage; therefore, using either of these criteria as the only \n\ntriggers for the provision of rapid response assistance means that most \n\ncompanies and workers affected by dislocations will not be provided \n\nrapid response services. Establishing a strict threshold is counter to \n\nthe purpose of rapid response, and prevents many workers and companies \n\nfrom receiving valuable services at a time when they are needed.\n\n    Therefore, the proposed regulations do not define any threshold for \n\nthe size of a layoff for which rapid response services are provided. \n\nThe regulation does not specifically address plant closures because the \n\nDepartment considers the layoffs associated with closures to be covered \n\nunder the general principles applicable to layoffs. Based on the fact \n\nthat most companies employ fewer than 50 workers and the rapid response \n\nservices provide significant\n\n[[Page 20743]]\n\n\n\nvalue to both affected workers and businesses, the Department expects \n\nthat States and local areas will provide rapid response services to \n\nlayoffs and closures of all sizes, as practicable. However, for any \n\nplant closure or layoff of 50 or more, rapid response services must be \n\nprovided per the statutory reference to mass layoffs. Additionally, \n\nrapid response must be provided for any layoff which receives a WARN \n\nnotice. State and local area rapid response providers must establish \n\npolicies and procedures that allow them to serve the most companies and \n\naffected workers or to determine the specific scenarios which meet this \n\ncriterion and for which they will provide rapid response services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.300(a) identifies the need to expeditiously \n\ndeliver services in order to enable dislocated workers to transition \n\nquickly to new employment. The two critical phrases in this section--\n\n``plan for and respond'' and ``as quickly as possible''--demonstrate \n\nthat rapid response must include strategic planning and other \n\nactivities that will ensure that dislocated workers can be reemployed \n\nas soon as possible.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.300(b) explains that the purpose of rapid \n\nresponse is a proactive, strategic set of actions, not simply a \n\nresponse to layoffs. The proposal establishes rapid response as a \n\ncritical tool in managing economic transition and supporting economic \n\ngrowth in communities. As stated in the proposal, rapid response \n\nincludes a wide array of strategies and activities of which layoff \n\naversion is a key component. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) describes the \n\ndirect and informational services rapid response must provide to \n\nworkers affected by layoffs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b)(2) describes the services that rapid \n\nresponse must provide to businesses. Building and maintaining \n\nrelationships with the business community, throughout the growth and \n\ndecline that characterizes the business cycle, is a critical aspect of \n\nrapid response; establishing and maintaining these relationships allows \n\nfor early knowledge of potential layoffs. This information not only \n\nprovides time for undertaking actions that may prevent the layoffs from \n\noccurring but may also allow affected workers to connect, in a timely \n\nmanner, with businesses that can use their skills, thereby avoiding \n\nunemployment or minimizing its duration.\n\n    Engaging with businesses and delivering effective solutions to \n\ntheir needs is critical--to allow rapid response teams to meet and work \n\nwith individuals affected by layoff, preferably before layoff and on \n\ncompany time, but also to identify companies that are growing and may \n\n\n\nhire dislocated workers or to deliver services that may prevent workers \n\nat those companies from being laid off in the future.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b)(3) describes the role that rapid response \n\nmust play in developing strong, comprehensive networks of partners and \n\nservice providers to ensure that all needed services are provided to \n\nbusinesses, workers, and communities.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b)(4) covers the need for rapid response to \n\nundertake strategic planning and data gathering to ensure readiness to \n\nact appropriately whenever the need arises.\n\nSection 682.310 Who is responsible for carrying out rapid response \n\nactivities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.310 is a new section that was split from Sec.  \n\n665.300 under the current regulations. Its text follows the current \n\nregulation, Sec.  665.300(b), without substantive change, but it \n\nchanges the verb used to describe the delivery of rapid response from \n\n``provide'' to ``carry out'' to track the language used in WIOA sec. \n\n134(a)(2).\n\nSection 682.320 What is layoff aversion, and what are appropriate \n\nlayoff aversion strategies and activities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.315 significantly enhances the required \n\nactivities from those set forth in the current regulation. Rapid \n\nresponse experience under WIA has shown the importance of layoff \n\naversion as a critical component of a successful rapid response \n\nprogram, to be used by States and Local Boards to prevent or minimize \n\nlayoffs. This section describes strategies and activities which are \n\ndesigned to prevent or minimize the duration of unemployment.\n\n    Layoff aversion is a comprehensive approach requiring the \n\nintegration of data, relationships, partnerships, and policies and \n\nprocedures to allow an assessment of the economic situation that exists \n\nwithin a given area. This approach enables the development of a plan \n\nthat may be applied, at any time, to intervene and manage transition \n\nthat occurs within that area. Layoff aversion strategies and activities \n\nare customized to specific needs, quickly deployable, informed by \n\neconomic data, and designed and coordinated with partners as necessary. \n\nThis proposed section describes examples of these strategies and \n\nactivities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.315 provides a definition for layoff aversion, \n\nwhich has been adapted from TEGL 30-09, and describes a number of \n\npotential layoff aversion strategies and activities that rapid response \n\nprograms must include, many of which were first described in (TEN) 9-\n\n12.\n\n\n\nSection 682.330 What rapid response activities are required?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330 describes rapid response activities that are \n\nrequired to be carried out with rapid response funds. The elements \n\ninclude activities that have been previously discussed in guidance and \n\nthrough technical assistance; elements that are required by the current \n\nregulation; and elements that were previously allowable, but which are \n\nnow required. In particular, the regulation now specifically identifies \n\nlayoff aversion activities and the provision of additional assistance \n\nto local areas experiencing increased dislocation events as required \n\nrapid response activity (paragraphs (a) and (i)) and adds new \n\nresponsibilities in paragraphs (g) through (k). The Department's \n\nexperience under WIA has shown that such activities are critical for a \n\nsuccessful rapid response program. To meet the needs of affected \n\nworkers and businesses, a rapid response program must be proactive, \n\ndata-driven, engaged with businesses, and focused on preventing layoffs \n\nor minimizing their negative impacts. Substantially increasing the \n\nlevel of required activities under rapid response is designed to drive \n\nthose outcomes. By undertaking these activities, the State and local \n\nareas will be able to effectively manage, review and evaluate rapid \n\nresponse and layoff aversion efforts.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(a) describes layoff aversion as a required \n\nrapid response activity. Layoff aversion strategies and activities are \n\ndescribed in proposed Sec.  682.315. The proposal requires that States \n\nand local areas have the capability to conduct layoff aversion; \n\nhowever, it is left to the discretion of the operators of rapid \n\nresponse programs to determine which strategies and activities are \n\napplicable in a given situation, based upon specific needs, policies, \n\nand procedures within the State and operating areas. The current \n\nregulation requires rapid response operators to assess the potential \n\nfor averting layoffs; this proposal expands on this requirement by \n\nlisting a number of specific strategies and activities that are \n\ncritical to maintaining readiness and ensuring the ability to \n\ncapitalize on opportunities that will prevent, or minimize the duration \n\nof, unemployment.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(b) through (e) are consistent with the \n\ncurrent regulations; these activities are retained as required under \n\nthe proposed WIOA regulations.\n\n    This proposed regulation does not define the term ``emergency \n\nservices'' as\n\n[[Page 20744]]\n\n\n\nused in proposed Sec.  682.330(f); however, in the past States and \n\nlocal areas have used rapid response teams and resources for a wide \n\narray of activities in response to disaster situations. Such activities \n\nhave included outreach, support, and assistance for impacted \n\nindividuals with accessing UI or disaster unemployment assistance; \n\nacquisition of and support for mobile one-stop units; demographic \n\ninformation gathering for potential emergency grant applications; and \n\ncoordination with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or other \n\ndisaster-response organizations. State and local area rapid response \n\nproviders must work closely with other State and local agencies and \n\nother critical partners through strategic planning processes to ensure \n\neffective and immediate responses can be undertaken when the need \n\narises.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(g) discusses the requirement that State or \n\nlocal rapid response programs collect and utilize data as a core \n\ncomponent of their work. Proposed Sec.  682.330(g)(1) requires States \n\nand/or local areas to identify sources of information that will provide \n\nearly warning of potential layoffs, and to gather this data in a manner \n\nthat best suits their needs. Proposed Sec.  682.330(g)(2) requires the \n\nprocessing and analysis of a range of economic data and information to \n\nensure the best possible services are delivered to businesses and \n\nworkers at the appropriate time. Proposed Sec.  682.330(g)(3) requires \n\nthat States and/or local areas track data and other information related \n\nto the activities and outcomes of the rapid response program, so as to \n\nprovide an adequate basis for effective program management, review, and \n\nevaluation of rapid response and layoff aversion efforts.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(h) highlights the need for strategic and \n\noperational partnerships. Rapid response operators must develop and \n\nmaintain partnerships with a wide range of partners to ensure the \n\ncapability to deliver needed services and resources to businesses, \n\nworkers, and communities whenever the need arises. The proposal \n\nprovides some examples of organizations with which to partner, but \n\nStates and local areas should establish partnerships with those \n\norganizations that are necessary to ensure the successful functioning \n\nof their rapid response program. Proposed Sec.  682.330(h)(1) discusses \n\nthe use of these partnerships to conduct strategic planning and to \n\nensure that assistance provided to companies, workers, and communities \n\nis comprehensive. Proposed Sec.  682.330(h)(2) requires that the \n\npartnerships developed to support rapid response programs actively \n\nshare information on resources available on a regular basis to ensure \n\nthat the needs of businesses, workers, and communities will be met at \n\n\n\nthe time they are needed.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(i) requires rapid response services to be \n\nprovided to workers upon the filing of a petition for TAA. If the \n\nDepartment no longer processes TAA petitions due to an expiration or \n\ntermination of the program, there will be no explicit requirement \n\npertaining to TAA participants. However, such individuals, as \n\ndislocated workers, will continue to receive rapid response services \n\nupon notification of layoff consistent with State or local area \n\nprocedure.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(j) requires States to provide additional \n\nassistance to local areas that experience an event that causes \n\nsignificant layoffs that exceed the capacity of the local area to \n\nrespond to with existing formula resources. This requirement is found \n\nin the current regulation at Sec.  665.300(b); the Department has made \n\nslight wording changes and moved it to this part. The additional \n\nassistance is required by WIOA sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(II). Proposed Sec.  \n\n682.330(j) establishes the requirement that such assistance be \n\nprovided; proposed Sec.  682.350 defines and describes what additional \n\nassistance entails.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.330(k) describes the role of rapid response in \n\norganizing or supporting labor management committees. This proposed \n\nparagraph uses the language from the current regulation that addresses \n\nthis point, 20 CFR 655.310(c)(1) and (2). This support is required by \n\nWIOA sec. 3(51), as it was under WIA sec. 101(38), where labor and \n\nmanagement voluntarily agree that the establishment of such a committee \n\nis appropriate. It has been the Department's experience that in some \n\ncircumstances such committees have proven ineffective; therefore, their \n\nestablishment is not a required rapid response activity. However, where \n\nlabor and management desire to establish such a committee, guidance and \n\nfinancial support must be provided by rapid response.\n\n    The proposal does not include the requirement, now in 20 CFR \n\n655.310(c)(3), that a neutral chairperson be appointed for such a \n\ncommittee. Based on feedback received regarding the difficulties \n\ninvolved in obtaining a neutral chairperson who is familiar with the \n\nimmediate problem, the leadership of such a committee is better left to \n\nthe discretion of the parties involved.\n\n    The proposal does not include the language in the current \n\nregulation referring to ``workforce transition committees''--the \n\nDepartment now refers to these as groups as ``community transition \n\nteams.'' Their role is explained in proposed Sec.  682.340.\n\nSection 682.340 May other activities be undertaken as part of rapid \n\nresponse?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.340 identifies additional activities that may be \n\nundertaken as part of the rapid response program. Proposed Sec.  \n\n682.340(a) is designed to allow for innovative approaches and to ensure \n\nadditional flexibility to prepare for and respond to layoffs, and to \n\nreact to unusual or unforeseeable situations. Although the proposal \n\nleaves considerable discretion, any allowable activities must be \n\ndesigned to prevent or minimize the duration of unemployment, or to \n\ndevelop strategies or activities that will lead to better programmatic \n\noutcomes.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.340(b) provides for the creation and operation \n\nof community transition teams. Community transition teams are designed \n\nto expand the ability of the public workforce system to enlist \n\npartners, community organizations, and others to provide services and \n\nresources in communities or areas in response to major layoffs or other \n\nevents that have caused significant impact that are beyond the capacity \n\nof the public workforce system to address. Rapid response funds may be \n\nused to organize or sustain community transition teams that are \n\norganized to provide relief to impacted communities.\n\nSection 682.350 What is meant by ``provision of additional assistance'' \n\nin Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Section 665.330 of the current regulations is not maintained in the \n\nproposed regulations. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) \n\nprogram to which it refers has ended. Proposed Sec.  682.350, which \n\ndescribes the provision of ``additional assistance'' to local areas, \n\nhas been largely maintained from the existing WIA regulations. The \n\nDepartment has made a slight change to the language in the existing \n\nregulations for clarity, but the concept has not changed. While the \n\nprovision of additional assistance is required, as described in \n\nproposed Sec.  682.330(i), the mechanisms by which such assistance may \n\nbe provided are left to the discretion of the States.\n\n[[Page 20745]]\n\nSection 682.360 What rapid response, layoff aversion, or other \n\ninformation will States be required to report to the Employment and \n\nTraining Administration?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.360 does not appear in the current regulations; \n\nit requires that States report information about the receipt of rapid \n\nresponse services by individuals enrolled as dislocated workers. This \n\ninformation is currently required under WIA reporting guidelines. The \n\nDepartment also reserves authority to issue further guidance on the \n\nreporting of rapid response activities. Should such reporting become \n\n\n\nrequired, the Department will work with States and local areas to \n\nensure that reporting burdens are minimized while still meeting program \n\nreporting goals.\n\nSection 682.370 What are ``allowable statewide activities'' for which \n\nrapid response funds remaining unspent at the end of the year of \n\nobligation may be recaptured by the State?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  682.370 addresses the WIOA provision at sec. \n\n134(a)(2)(B) that allows a State to ``recapture'' any funds reserved \n\nfor rapid response that remain unspent at the end of the PY of \n\nobligation and utilize them for State set-aside activities. The \n\nDepartment has provided further definition around required and \n\nallowable activities under the rapid response provisions of the WIOA, \n\nwhich may support States to more fully utilize rapid response funds \n\nwhile better serving businesses and workers.\n\nG. Part 683--Administrative Provisions Under Title I of the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    This proposed part establishes the administrative provisions that \n\napply to formula and discretionary grants and cooperative agreements \n\nauthorized under title I of WIOA. Some administrative provisions are \n\nalso applicable to grants provided under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as \n\nindicated in specific sections of this part. The remaining Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act administrative rules are still located in 20 CFR part 658. \n\nWagner-Peyser grants are included in this part to ensure consistent \n\napplication of the common administrative provisions that apply to all \n\ngrants awarded under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act. For \n\ninstance, the audit requirements for discretionary and formula grantees \n\nfor title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds can be found in one section. \n\nThe internal control requirements for both programs can be found in \n\nthis part as well. However, contracts, rather than grants or \n\ncooperative agreements, are used to award most funds authorized for Job \n\nCorps. As such, the administrative provisions for Job Corps (subtitle C \n\nof title I of WIOA) will be addressed separately in 20 CFR part 686.\n\n    Many of the proposed requirements in this part 683 are impacted by \n\nthe Department's new rule ``Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost \n\nPrinciples, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards Final Rule,'' at \n\n2 CFR part 2900 published on December 19, 2014, and OMB's Uniform \n\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements \n\nfor Federal Awards Final Rule, dated December 26, 2013 found at 2 CFR \n\npart 200 (``Uniform Guidance'' or ``2 CFR part 200''). The Uniform \n\n\n\nGuidance, which can be found at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf, streamlines \nand consolidates OMB Circulars A-\n\n21 (2 CFR part 220), A-50, A-87 (2 CFR part 225), A-89, A-102 (29 CFR \n\npart 97), A-110 (29 CFR part 95), A-122 (2 CFR part 230), and A-133 (29 \n\nCFR part 96) into a single document. The Uniform Guidance standardizes \n\nthe administrative, cost, and audit provisions for nearly all grants \n\nacross the Federal government including those awarded by the \n\nDepartment's WIOA Federal partners, including ED, HHS, and the \n\nDepartment of Agriculture. Federal agencies were allowed to submit \n\nexceptions, as defined at 2 CFR 200.102, that deviate from the Uniform \n\nGuidance. The list of the Department's exceptions to the Uniform \n\nGuidance is available at 2 CFR part 2900. Requirements of this Uniform \n\nGuidance, including the Department's exceptions, apply to all grants \n\nand cooperative agreements provided under this part.\n\n    In this proposed part, the Department hopes to strengthen its \n\nadministration of grants and enhance program results by providing \n\nconsistent and uniform guidance that increases accountability and \n\ntransparency, promotes fiscal integrity, and reduces duplication.\n\n2. Subpart A--Funding and Closeout\n\n    This subpart addresses the grant life cycle from fund availability \n\nto closeout for formula grants awarded to States under WIOA title I, \n\nsubtitle B, and the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the grant life cycle for \n\ndiscretionary or competitive WIOA grants, awarded under subtitle D of \n\ntitle I. This subpart identifies the three financial assistance \n\ninstruments that will be used to award funds under title I of WIOA and \n\nWagner-Peyser: Contracts, grant agreements, and cooperative agreements. \n\nOne shift from WIA to WIOA is that the Secretary will no longer use the \n\nGovernor/Secretary agreements used under WIA. In compliance with the \n\nUniform Guidance, the Department will use Notices of Award as the \n\nfunding instrument for all grants, both formula and discretionary. \n\nAnother shift to promote full expenditure of funds is to require that \n\nrecipients expend the funds with the shortest period of performance \n\nbefore expending other funds. This proposed subpart also implements the \n\nWIOA statute's flexibility in allowing a Local Board to transfer up to \n\n100 percent of a PY allocation between the adult and dislocated workers \n\nfunding streams subject to the Governor's approval. Additionally, the \n\nsubpart proposes processes on the handling of unobligated rapid \n\nresponse funds and ETA's role in the annual reallotment process that \n\ntakes place between the States and the Department after each PY. The \n\nproposed responsibility review provisions are also different from those \n\nunder WIA to reflect the new requirements in the Uniform Guidance. \n\nLastly, this subpart outlines the closeout procedures for title I of \n\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf\n\n\nWIOA and Wagner-Peyser awards.\n\nSection 683.100 When do Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant \n\nfunds become available for obligation?\n\n    This proposed section describes the statutory requirements for the \n\nDepartment's release of formula funds under title I of WIOA and the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act. WIOA youth funds may be released earlier than other \n\nformula funds, as early as April, to assist States and locals in \n\nplanning youth activities. Adult and dislocated worker funds will be \n\nawarded on a PY basis in two payments: In July after the beginning of \n\nthe PY and a second release of funds in October of each PY. Wagner-\n\nPeyser funds will also be released on a PY basis, in July of each \n\nfiscal year. The availability of funds awarded on a competitive or \n\ndiscretionary basis will be dependent on the annual appropriation and \n\non the grant or cooperative agreement.\n\nSection 683.105 What award document authorizes the expenditure of funds \n\nunder title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act?\n\n    This section recognizes the use of the three funding instruments \n\nthat conform with the Uniform Guidance: Grant agreements, cooperative \n\nagreements, and contracts. The Department will no longer use the \n\nGovernor/Secretary agreement, used under WIA, as a\n\n[[Page 20746]]\n\nfunding instrument because it is not consistent with the Uniform \n\nGuidance. Proposed paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section specify \n\nthe type of funding instruments that will be used for different WIOA \n\nprograms. Proposed paragraph (e)(3) implements WIOA sec. 169(b)(6)(B), \n\nwhich states that the Department may not award a contract or grant for \n\nresearch, studies, or multi-State projects ``to the same organization \n\nfor more than 3 consecutive years unless such grant or contract is \n\ncompetitively reevaluated within such period.'' The Department \n\ninterprets the central purpose of this provision to promote \n\ncompetition--it prohibits the Department from awarding lengthy \n\ncontracts or grants on a non-competitive basis to the same \n\norganization. However, as long as the contract or grant is awarded on a \n\ncompetitive basis, the project (and therefore the award) may span over \n\na period of more than 3 years. This is consistent with the Department's \n\nneed to conduct lengthy research and other projects and with the new \n\nflexibility to incrementally fund evaluations, research, and other \n\nprojects, provided in sec. 189(g)(2)(B)(ii) of WIOA. Finally, proposed \n\n\n\nparagraph (f) of Sec.  683.105 makes clear that all three funding \n\ninstruments are subject to the closeout procedures in the Uniform \n\nGuidance.\n\nSection 683.110 What is the period of performance of Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?\n\n    This proposed section describes the period of performance for \n\ndifferent types of WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act grant awards. \n\nProposed paragraph (a) provides a general explanation about expenditure \n\nperiods. Specifically, the period of performance for grants is the \n\nstatutory period of availability for expenditure, unless otherwise \n\nprovided in the grant agreement. Funds must be spent in a timely \n\nmanner; if they are not expended by the end of the performance period, \n\nthey risk losing their availability. Grantees must expend funds with \n\nthe shortest period of availability first, unless otherwise authorized \n\nin the agreement or in a subsequent modification. The proposed \n\nparagraph includes a sentence encouraging grantees to follow this rule, \n\nso that they use funds expeditiously and effectively. This approach \n\nshould help reduce unexpended funds at the end of a grant's period of \n\nperformance\n\n    Proposed Sec.  683.110(b) through (h) restate the applicable \n\nperiods of performance for WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act grants. WIOA \n\ndid not change these periods for formula funds--adult/dislocated worker \n\nand youth formula funds allotted during any PY are available for \n\nexpenditure by the State only during that PY and the 2 succeeding PYs; \n\nfunds allocated by the State to a local area for any PY are available \n\nfor expenditure only during that PY and the succeeding PY (WIOA sec. \n\n189(g)(2)). Proposed paragraph (c)(2) also requires that funds \n\nunexpended by a local area in the 2 year period be returned to the \n\nState and be used for specific purposes. This is unchanged from the WIA \n\nregulation at 20 CFR 667.107. However, proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii) \n\nnotes an exception to the 2-year performance period for local areas in \n\nthe case of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracting strategies, a new \n\noption added by secs. 129(c)(1)(D) and 134(d)(1)(iii) of WIOA and more \n\nfully discussed in proposed subpart E. Under this paragraph, and in \n\naccordance with sec. 189(g)(2)(D) of WIOA, funds used by local areas to \n\ncarry out WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies remain available \n\nuntil expended. Additional information on this provision is explained \n\nbelow in the discussion of proposed Sec.  683.530. Proposed paragraph \n\n(h) also implements sec. 5(c) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, and explains \n\nthat funds allotted to States for grants under secs. 3 and 15 of the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act for any PY are available for expenditure by the State \n\nreceiving the funds only during that PY and the 2 succeeding PYs.\n\n\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) provide the expenditure period for \n\nthe Native American programs and MSFW programs under secs. 166(c) and \n\n167(a) of WIOA, respectively. In both programs, WIOA requires the \n\nSecretary to enter into grants or contracts with eligible entities \n\nevery 4 years. Accordingly, the proposed paragraphs explain that funds \n\nawarded by the Department under these programs are available for \n\nexpenditure during the period identified in the award document, which \n\nwill not exceed 4 years.\n\n    For grants awarded for research or evaluations under WIOA sec. 169, \n\nfunds remain available until expended, in accordance with sec. \n\n189(g)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, or for the period of performance specified in \n\nthe terms and conditions of the award. The Secretary has the authority \n\nto limit the period of expenditure of these funds in the terms and \n\nconditions of the grant award.\n\n    Finally, proposed paragraph (f) explains that funds allotted for \n\nother programs under title I of WIOA, including secs. 170 (National \n\nDislocated Worker Grants (NDWGs) and 171 (Youthbuild program), are \n\navailable for expenditure for the period of performance identified in \n\nthe grant or contract.\n\nSection 683.115 What planning information must a State submit in order \n\nto receive a formula grant?\n\n    This proposed section implements the statutory requirement that an \n\napproved Unified State Plan or Combined State Plan be submitted before \n\nformula funds under title I, subtitle B, of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser can \n\nbe issued. As discussed in the preamble discussion of part 676, WIOA is \n\napparently inconsistent as to whether outlying areas must submit a \n\nUnified or Combined State Plan to receive funding under title I. The \n\npreamble discussion of part 676 details the apparent inconsistency and \n\nidentifies potential options to resolve the inconsistency.\n\nSection 683.120 How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title \n\nI formula funds allocated to local areas?\n\n    This proposed section describes the timeframe and formula factors a \n\nGovernor must employ when allocating funds to local areas under secs. \n\n128 and 133. It also specifies the steps a Governor must take when \n\nissuing allocations, including consulting with Local Boards and elected \n\nofficials prior to issuing the allocation. The Governors must issue the \n\nfunds to the local areas in a timely manner to allow for an adequate \n\nplanning process.\n\n    This section also adopts the provision in sec. 134(2)(A)(ii) of \n\nWIOA that allows States to use unobligated rapid response funds, after \n\nthe completion of the PY, for statewide activities.\n\nSection 683.125 What minimum funding provisions apply to Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act adult, dislocated worker, and youth \n\n\n\nallocations?\n\n    This proposed section addresses the minimum funding thresholds for \n\nStates funded under subtitle B of title I of WIOA. Minimum funding \n\nthresholds are established to offset the impact of fluctuations in the \n\nformula factors that result from shifts in the economy that may be \n\ncompounded by additional downturns in a particular industry or market \n\nin a particular State. Sections 128(b)(2)(A) and 133(b)(2)(A) of WIOA \n\ncontain these minimum funding requirements to avoid significant swings \n\nin the amount of funding a State receives from 1 year to the next and \n\nto avoid any disruption of services or planning.\n\n[[Page 20747]]\n\nSection 683.130 Does a Local Board have the authority to transfer funds \n\nbetween the adult employment and training activities allocation and the \n\ndislocated worker employment and training activities allocation?\n\n    This proposed section provides flexibility to local areas to \n\nprovide services in the areas of greatest need by allowing fund \n\ntransfers of up to 100 percent of a PY allocation between the local \n\nadult and local dislocated worker allocations. Proposed Sec.  \n\n683.130(b) requires a Local Board to obtain written approval of the \n\nGovernor before making such a transfer. This flexibility to transfer \n\nfunds is contained in sec. 133(b)(4) of WIOA.\n\nSection 683.135 What reallotment procedures does the Secretary use?\n\n    This proposed section implements secs. 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA, \n\nand explains the Department's process for recapture and reallotment of \n\nformula funds awarded to the States under title I. The proposed rule \n\nrequires the Secretary to make the determination about whether the \n\nState has obligated 80 percent of the funds during the second quarter \n\nof each PY, rather than the first quarter. The procedures are the same \n\nas those in the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.150, with a few \n\nexceptions. The Department proposes to make the determination during \n\nthe second quarter because State financial reports for the end of the \n\nPY period are not locked for modification until the next quarter's \n\nreports are submitted, which is during the second quarter of the PY. \n\nThe Department also uses the term ``each'' to make it clear that the \n\nDepartment performs the reallotment procedures every PY with respect to \n\nthe prior PY. Further, the section clarifies that the amount subject to \n\nrecapture is based on the unobligated balance of the prior ``program'' \n\nyear, in accordance with secs. 127(c)(2) and 132(c)(2) of the statute. \n\nFinally, the proposed section clarifies the language that the recapture \n\namount, if any, is determined separately for each funding stream.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  683.135(c) defines the term ``obligation'' in \n\naccordance with the new OMB Administrative Requirements at 2 CFR 200.71 \n\n\n\n(``[w]hen used in connection with a non-Federal entity's utilization of \n\nfunds under a Federal award, obligations means orders placed for \n\nproperty and services, contracts, and subawards made, and similar \n\ntransactions during a given period that require payment by the non-\n\nFederal entity during the same or a future period.''). The Department \n\nis using this definition to be consistent in our application of 2 CFR \n\npart 200, which is applicable to all funds awarded as grants or \n\ncooperative agreements. The proposed rule includes the same additions \n\nto the definition of ``obligation'' that are in the WIA regulation at \n\n20 CFR 667.150(d)(1) and (2). The Department will continue to recognize \n\nthe monies allocated to the local areas through the formula process \n\nunder subtitle B of title I as obligated by the States for the purposes \n\nof this section, and the Department has clarified this by adding the \n\nwords ``to the local area'' in proposed paragraph (c)(1). Because of \n\nthis, local transfers between the adult and dislocated worker funding \n\nstreams do not impact the Department's recapture calculation for \n\nreallotment among the States. Similarly, the fact that up to 10 percent \n\nof local funds may be reserved for administrative costs does not affect \n\nthe calculation. Recapture and reallotment of funds among States will \n\noccur during PY 2015 based on obligations in PY 2014, because the \n\nprocedures for realloting funds did not change from WIA to WIOA.\n\n    New in WIOA, sec. 134(a)(2)(A)(ii) permits the Governor to use \n\nrapid response funds that remain unobligated after the first PY for \n\nwhich they were allotted to carry out statewide employment and training \n\nactivities. The rapid response funds will be included in the \n\ncalculation of unobligated funding to determine if a State is subject \n\nto reallotment. Sections 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA do not except rapid \n\nresponse funds from recapture--a tool which provides a strong incentive \n\nfor States to expeditiously expend funds.\n\n    Excepting rapid response funds from the reallotment calculation \n\nwould effectively remove the reallotment provision out of the statute. \n\nThe Department generally is able to recapture and reallot only \n\ndislocated worker funds, because States immediately obligate 85 percent \n\nof their adult and youth program funds by allocating them to the local \n\nareas through the formula process. Because sec. 133(a)(2) of WIOA \n\nallows the Governor to reserve up to 25 percent of dislocated worker \n\nfunds for rapid response activities, there may never be a situation \n\nwhere 80 percent of the remaining dislocated worker funds have not been \n\nobligated. Therefore, the Department includes rapid response funds in \n\nthe calculation of a State's unobligated funding to determine if the \n\nState is subject to recapture and reallotment.\n\n\n\n    However, even if a State is subject to reallotment, the Governor \n\nmay use the unobligated rapid response funds described in WIOA sec. \n\n134(a)(2)(A)(ii) that remain available after reallotment to carry out \n\nstatewide employment and training activities (in addition to rapid \n\nresponse activities). This preserves the additional flexibility \n\nprovided to the Governors in WIOA sec. 134, by permitting Governors to \n\nuse rapid response funds for statewide employment and training \n\nactivities if not expended in the first year of availability. The \n\nDepartment welcomes comments on the proposed reallotment approach and \n\npotential impact on States, including the transfer flexibility.\n\nSec.  683.140 What reallocation procedures must the Governors use?\n\n    This proposed section describes the procedures for reallocating \n\nyouth, adult, and dislocated worker funds among local areas in the \n\nState, in accordance with secs. 128(c) and 133(c) of WIOA, and is \n\nunchanged from the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.160 except that \n\nproposed paragraph (a) requires the Governor to consult with the State \n\nBoard before reallocating, as required by secs. 128(c)(1) and 133(c)(1) \n\nof WIOA. Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies that the amount to be \n\nrecaptured, if any, must be separately determined for each funding \n\nstream, and the calculations of unobligated balances in each stream \n\nmust be adjusted to account for any funds that are transferred between \n\nfunding streams under proposed Sec.  683.130. The Department also notes \n\nthat States and local areas are required to adhere to the definition of \n\n``obligations'' in 2 CFR 200.71.\n\nSection 683.145 What merit review and risk assessment does the \n\nDepartment conduct for Federal financial assistance awards made under \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I, subtitle D?\n\n    This proposed section includes new requirements mandated by the \n\nUniform Guidance. First, there is a requirement for the use of merit \n\nreview as a means to ensure that discretionary or competitive grants \n\nand cooperative agreements are awarded through a competitive, merit-\n\nbased process. Second, this section incorporates the Uniform Guidance \n\nrequirement, found at 2 CFR 200.205, that an agency must have ``a \n\nframework for evaluating the risks posed by applicants before they \n\nreceive Federal Awards.'' The factors the Grant Officer will consider \n\nare listed in this section and drawn from 2 CFR 200.205. Additional \n\nguidance will be issued to further specify how the Grant Officer will \n\nevaluate these factors in determining whether the applicant\n\n[[Page 20748]]\n\nshould be precluded from receipt of Federal financial assistance.\n\nSection 683.150 What closeout requirements apply to grants funded with \n\n\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nfunds?\n\n    This proposed section is new; there is not one like it in the WIA \n\nregulations. It addresses closeout, which is an important component to \n\ncomplete the grant life cycle. This section paraphrases the Uniform \n\nAdministrative requirement sections on closeout and post-closeout \n\nadjustments (2 CFR 200.343-344). Specifically, when the period of \n\nperformance ends, the Department will close out the Federal award after \n\ndetermining that all administrative actions and required work have been \n\ncompleted by the grant recipient. The grant recipient must submit all \n\nrequired reports and liquidate all obligations and/or accrued \n\nexpenditures within 90 days of the end of the performance period. The \n\nDepartment will promptly reimburse the grant recipient for allowable \n\nreimbursable costs under the Federal award being closed out. The non-\n\nFederal entity must promptly refund any balanced of unobligated cash \n\nthat is owed to the Department. The Department will settle for any \n\nupward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after \n\ncloseout reports are received. The grant recipient must account for any \n\nreal and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from \n\nthe Federal government. The Department must complete all closeout \n\nactions no later than 1 year after receiving and accepting all required \n\nfinal reports; however, closeout does not affect the Department's right \n\nto disallow costs and recover funds, or obligations of the grantee, \n\nincluding audit, property management, and records retention \n\nrequirements. After award closeout, a relationship created under the \n\naward may be modified or ended. Grant recipients that award funds to \n\nsubrecipients must institute a timely closeout process after the end of \n\nperformance to ensure a timely closeout in accordance with this \n\nsection.\n\n3. Subpart B--Administrative Rules, Costs and Limitations\n\n    Financial and Administrative Rules. These proposed regulations \n\nprovide the rules applicable to WIOA grants in the areas of fiscal and \n\nadministrative requirements, audit requirements, and allowable cost/\n\ncost principles, and includes changes as the result of the Uniform \n\nGuidance at 2 CFR part 200 and any exceptions to 2 CFR part 200 that \n\nhave been released by the Department under 2 CFR part 2900. To support \n\nthe fiscal integrity of the grant process, proposed Sec.  683.220 \n\nrequires recipients and subprecipients of WIOA or Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nfunds to have an internal control structure in place that provides \n\nsafeguards to protect personally identifiable information and other \n\nsensitive information. This section is new to WIOA; there is no \n\n\n\ncorresponding section in the WIA regulations. Another new section \n\nprovides rules for using real property with Federal equity. Under this \n\nprovision, Federal equity acquired in real property through grants to \n\nStates awarded under title III of the SSA or the Wagner-Peyser Act is \n\ntransferred to the States that used the grant to acquire the equity; \n\nthe portion of the equity transferred must be used to carryout \n\nactivities authorized under these programs and/or WIOA. The new section \n\nalso provides instructions on using properties funded with Reed Act \n\nequity or the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).\n\n    Costs and Limitations. This proposed regulation in Sec.  683.205 \n\ndelineates activities and functions associated with the cost of \n\nadministration as well as cost limitations (discussed in proposed Sec.  \n\n683.205). The intent continues to be that the function and intended \n\npurpose of an activity should be used to determine whether the costs \n\nare administrative or programmatic. There is a new section on salary \n\nand bonus limitations, which prescribes limits on salaries and bonuses \n\nin both WIOA and Wagner-Peyser programs. The proposed subpart also \n\ndescribes activities that are prohibited under WIOA, such as employment \n\ngenerating activities and activities that encourage business \n\nrelocation.\n\n    Responsibilities toward participants and employees. These proposed \n\nregulations provide rules on employee displacement, wage and labor \n\nstandards, health and safety standards, and non-discrimination.\n\n    Other rules. There is a new section addressing the allowability of \n\nearning under WIOA grants.\n\nSection 683.200 What general fiscal and administrative rules apply to \n\nthe use of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-\n\nPeyser funds?\n\n    This proposed section describes the application of the Uniform \n\nGuidance and the corresponding exceptions authorized by the Department \n\nat 2 CFR part 2900 for all grant recipients and subrecipients, \n\nincluding for-profit organizations and foreign entities. It references \n\nthe cost principles, discusses when prior approval for certain \n\nexpenditures is required, and highlights a number of specific \n\nrequirements in the Uniform Guidance and the WIOA statute. For example, \n\nthis section addresses the requirement that interest income be disposed \n\nof using the addition method and requires an entity to provide \n\nadditional program services with those funds. This section also \n\naddresses times when income is earned and how it is recognized, \n\nreported, and applied to the program. It outlines the code of conduct \n\nand conflict of interest requirements that must be implemented under 2 \n\nCFR part 200, as well as certain restrictions imposed on grant \n\nrecipients and subrecipients when using WIOA and Wagner-Peyser funds, \n\n\n\nincluding the Buy-American provision in sec. 502 of WIOA. Likewise, \n\nthis section requires adherence to the mandatory disclosure \n\nrequirements found in 2 CFR part 200 on all violations of Federal \n\ncriminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations \n\npotentially affecting the Federal award. Additional disclosures on \n\nlobbying, drug-free workplace, debarment, and suspension continue to be \n\nrequired as well. Such disclosures must be timely and in writing. \n\nFailure to make the required disclosures can result in any of the \n\nremedies described in Sec.  200.338, remedies for noncompliance, \n\nincluding suspension or debarment.\n\nSection 683.205 What administrative cost limitations apply to Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act title I grants?\n\n    This proposed section specifies the statutory administrative cost \n\nlimitations on title I grant funds. States receiving formula WIOA funds \n\nare limited to spending no more than 5 percent of their annual \n\nallotment on administrative costs. Local areas are limited to spending \n\nno more than 10 percent of their annual allocation on administrative \n\ncosts. Flexibility is provided to States and local areas in the statute \n\nby allowing administrative funds from the three formula funding streams \n\nawarded under subtitle B to be pooled and used together for \n\nadministrative costs for any of the three programs, at the State and \n\nlocals' discretion. For other WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser funding, \n\nthe administrative cost limits can be found in the grant agreement and \n\nare subject to the Uniform Guidance.\n\n[[Page 20749]]\n\nSection 683.210 What audit requirements apply to the use of Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act title I and title III funds?\n\n    This proposed section specifies the audit requirements for all \n\ngrant recipients and subrecipients of WIOA funds that expend more than \n\n$750,000 in Federal funds during the fiscal year, including for-profit \n\nentities that are grant recipients or subrecipients of WIOA title I or \n\nWagner-Peyser funds. As this proposed section notes, the audit \n\nrequirements do not normally pass through to contractors, but will in \n\nsome situations, such as where the payments are found to constitute a \n\nFederal award rather than a payment for goods and services. This \n\nsection seeks to implement the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.\n\nSection 683.215 What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \n\nfunctions and activities constitute the costs of administration subject \n\nto the administrative cost limitation?\n\n    The proposed section defines the functions and activities that \n\n\n\nconstitute administration in accordance with sec. 3(1) of WIOA, and \n\ntherefore are subject to the administrative cost limitations discussed \n\nin proposed Sec.  683.205. The Department notes that this proposed \n\nsection applies to activities performed under all grants awarded under \n\ntitle I of WIOA. It does not apply to activities funded through \n\ncontracts, such as operation of Job Corps centers. The proposed rule is \n\nthe same as the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.220 with a few exceptions. \n\nFor clarification, fiscal agent responsibilities are now included in \n\nthe list of enumerated administrative costs. Regions are also included \n\nin the list of entities that can incur administrative costs, consistent \n\nwith sec. 106 of WIOA. The Department made these enhancements because \n\nservices can be integrated and streamlined through regions that may \n\ncross geographical boundaries or local economic areas. Additionally, \n\nthe section refers to ``contractors'' instead of ``vendors'' to be \n\nconsistent with the Uniform Guidance, which replaces vendor with \n\ncontractor and defines ``contractor'' at 2 CFR 200.23.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  683.215(c) describes some activities that can be \n\nadministrative, programmatic, or both, depending on whether the \n\nunderlying functions which they support are classified as programmatic \n\nor administrative. These include costs of activities such as \n\ninformation systems development and operation, travel, and continuous \n\nimprovement. For example, the costs of developing an information \n\nsystem, which serves both administrative functions, and the tracking \n\nand monitoring of participants, would be allocated between program \n\ncosts and administrative costs in proportion to the use of the system \n\nfor each intended purpose.\n\n    On the other hand, preparing program-level budgets and program \n\nplans are classified as program costs. The negotiation of MOUs and one-\n\nstop infrastructure agreements, and certifications of one-stop centers \n\nare also program costs, because they build or support the one-stop \n\ndelivery system and services to participants.\n\n    The Department welcomes comments regarding whether it is more \n\nadvantageous to issue the proposed list of administrative costs in \n\nSec.  683.215(b) as a regulation, or to provide a general description \n\nof administrative costs similar to the definition in sec. 3(1) of WIOA \n\nand provide a rationale for why such an approach is advantageous. The \n\nDepartment also seeks comment on whether this list will need to be \n\nflexible, and subject to review and change periodically, or whether it \n\nis anticipated to be stable. Additionally, the Department seeks comment \n\nas to whether indirect costs should be included as programmatic or \n\nadministrative.\n\n    Finally, proposed Sec.  683.215(d) requires entities to make \n\n\n\nefforts to streamline administrative services and reduce administrative \n\ncosts by minimizing duplication and effectively using information \n\ntechnology to improve services. The Department expects that \n\nstreamlining the administration of the program will minimize \n\nduplication of multiple systems at different levels of grant \n\nadministration so that more funds will be available for program \n\nactivities.\n\nSection 683.220 What are the internal control requirements for \n\nrecipients and subrecipients of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \n\nAct title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?\n\n    This proposed new section describes the internal controls that \n\nrecipients and subrecipients must install and have in place when \n\nexpending WIOA and Wagner-Peyser Act funds, and is based on 2 CFR \n\n200.303. The controls include having a structure and policies in place \n\nto protect personally identifiable and sensitive information, including \n\ninformation that the Department considers to be sensitive, and \n\nproviding reasonable assurances that the recipient or subrecipient is \n\nmanaging the award in compliance with Federal law and the terms of the \n\naward, complying with Federal law and the conditions of the award, \n\nevaluating and monitoring the recipient's or subrecipient's compliance \n\nwith Federal law and award terms, and taking prompt action when \n\nnoncompliance is identified. The internal controls must meet the \n\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) \n\nframework. The framework established has been used in the private \n\nsector for numerous years and provides standards to achieve reasonable \n\nassurance in the achievement of the following: Effectiveness and \n\nefficiency of operations; reliability of financial reporting; \n\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations; and safeguarding of \n\nassets. Complying with the internal control requirements will increase \n\naccountability and transparency in the use of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser \n\nAct funds. Through past monitoring and oversight, the Department \n\ndiscovered that some grantees did not have the tools or access to \n\nresources to build a strong internal control structure. The Department \n\nwill work with States and discretionary grantees to provide tools and \n\nassistance to achieve better results through its internal control \n\nstructure. Direct grant recipients must assist their subrecipients in \n\nachieving an internal control structure framework consistent with 2 CFR \n\npart 200 and COSO.\n\nSection 683.225 What requirements relate to the enforcement of the \n\nMilitary Selective Service Act?\n\n    This proposed section specifies the requirements of the Military \n\n\n\nSelective Service Act for programs and activities authorized under \n\ntitle I of WIOA and found in sec. 189(h) of WIOA. This proposed section \n\nis substantively the same as the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.250.\n\nSection 683.230 Are there special rules that apply to veterans when \n\nincome is a factor in eligibility determinations?\n\n    This proposed section addresses the laws governing the \n\ndetermination of eligibility for veterans and their spouses for WIOA \n\nfunded services with income qualification requirements. The parameters \n\nfor the exclusion of certain income from the eligibility determination \n\nprocess are outlined in this section. This section also states that the \n\nsame method of excluding certain income of veterans must also be used \n\nwhen a local area imposes a priority of service threshold when funding \n\nfor program services is limited.\n\n[[Page 20750]]\n\nSection 683.235 May Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \n\nfunds be spent for construction?\n\n    This proposed section is different from the WIA regulations at 20 \n\nCFR 667.260. It is based on the requirements in the Uniform Guidance at \n\n2 CFR 200.439(b)(3). The proposed text states that WIOA title I funds \n\nmust not be spent on construction, purchase of facilities or buildings, \n\nor other capital expenditures for improvements to land or buildings \n\nexcept with prior approval of the Secretary. Under the statute, WIOA \n\ntitle I funds can be used for construction only in limited situations, \n\nincluding meeting obligations to provide physical and programmatic \n\naccessibility and reasonable accommodations, certain repairs, \n\nrenovations, alterations, and capital improvements of property, and for \n\ndisaster relief projects under WIOA sec. 170(d), YouthBuild programs \n\nunder WIOA sec. 171(c)(2)(A)(i), and for other projects that the \n\nSecretary determines necessary to carry out WIOA, as described by under \n\nsec. 189(c) of WIOA. The proposed regulatory text is meant to include \n\nall these situations, but not offer an exclusive list to ensure that \n\nthe Secretary is able to use the funds for construction in any \n\nsituation where it might be necessary.\n\nSection 683.240 What are the instructions for using real property with \n\nFederal Equity?\n\n    The proposed section provides rules on State Employee Security Act \n\n(SESA) properties, Reed Act-funded properties, and JTPA-funded \n\nproperties. The proposed section provides guidance on these different \n\nproperties because the use of these properties can play an integral \n\npart in WIOA's intent to align Federal investments to support jobs \n\nseekers and employers. Such efforts are not only achieved through \n\n\n\nstrategic coordination among one-stop partners, but through physical \n\npresence at offices in the one-stop delivery system. Many buildings \n\nthat have existing Federal equity currently house Wagner-Peyser \n\nprograms, and it seems logical to use these facilities as American Job \n\nCenters if they are accessible and available and can support the \n\nrequirements for colocation outlined in proposed Sec. Sec.  678.310 \n\nthrough 678.320. Properties with Reed Act equity may also play a role \n\nin the American Job Center System. Lastly, the Department is aware that \n\nmany local workforce development areas that were previously known as \n\nservice delivery areas (SDAs) continue to be used as facilities for WIA \n\nprograms, and they should continue to be used for the one-stop delivery \n\nservice system under WIOA. The Department welcomes feedback on these \n\nprovisions. Making use of these properties for the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem in accordance with statutory requirements will maximize the \n\ninvestments already made in these buildings and help to achieve the \n\ngoals of WIOA.\n\n    With respect to Federal equity in SESA properties, the proposed \n\nsection restates the requirements of sec. 192 of WIOA, and explains \n\nthat Federal equity acquired in real property through grants to States \n\nawarded under title III of the SSA or the Wagner-Peyser Act is \n\ntransferred to the States that used the grant to acquire the equity. \n\nThe portion of the real property attributable to the Federal equity \n\ntransferred must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, \n\ntitle III of the SSA, or the Wagner-Peyser Act. When the property is no \n\nlonger needed to carry out those activities, the States are directed to \n\nrequest disposition instructions from the Grant Officer. Proceeds from \n\nthe disposition must be used to carry out activities authorized under \n\nWIOA, title III of the SSA, or the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\n    The statutory limitation in sec. 192(b) of WIOA is provided as \n\nwell. States are not permitted to use funds awarded under WIOA, title \n\nIII of the Social Security, or the Wagner-Peyser Act to amortize the \n\ncosts of the real property that is purchased by any State after \n\nFebruary 15, 2007.\n\n    The Department has also included the new requirement from sec. \n\n121(e)(3) of WIOA and sec. 3(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act that \n\nproperties occupied by Wagner-Peyser ESs be collocated with one-stop \n\ncenters.\n\n    With respect to Reed Act-funded properties, the proposed rule \n\nstates that properties with Reed Act equity may be used for the one-\n\nstop delivery system to the extent that the proportionate share of Reed \n\nAct equity is less than or equal to the proportionate share of \n\noccupancy by the Wagner-Peyser and UC programs. However, subject to \n\nconditions specified in sec. 903(c)(2) of the SSA and any \n\n\n\nappropriations limitations, a State is permitted, at its discretion, to \n\nuse Reed Act funds for ``the administration of its UC law and public \n\nemployment offices.'' When the property is no longer needed for these \n\nactivities, the State must request disposition instructions from the \n\nGrant Officer prior to sale. Because Reed Act funded properties are \n\ndifferent than other Federal equity properties, disposition \n\ninstructions will include a requirement to return the funds \n\nattributable to the Reed Act equity to the State's account in the \n\nUnemployment Trust fund. See discussion in TEGL 3-07 ``Transfer of \n\nFederal Equity in State Real Property to the States.'' It is expected \n\nthat additional guidance will be issued to update the guidance \n\ncontained in TEGL 3-07, which will include instructions on the handling \n\nof such properties when considering colocation of Wagner-Peyser, as \n\nrequired in sec. 121(e)(3) of WIOA and sec. 3(d) of the Wagner-Peyser \n\nAct (as added by the amendments in title III of WIOA).\n\n    For JTPA funded properties, the proposed rule states that real \n\nproperty that was purchased with JTPA funds and transferred to WIA, is \n\nnow transferred to the WIOA title I programs and may be used for WIOA \n\npurposes. It is the Department's position that the Federal equity \n\nremains with the property while in use. Many properties that were \n\npurchased with JTPA funds continue to be locations that house and serve \n\nindividuals and staff persons under WIA, and as such, those same \n\nbuildings must continue to be used for the purposes of WIOA. If JTPA \n\nproperties that were being used for WIA activities will not be used for \n\nWIOA programs, disposal of the property must occur. When the real \n\nproperty is no longer needed for the WIOA activities, the recipient \n\nmust seek instructions from the Grant Officer prior to disposition or \n\nsale. A subrecipient would seek instructions from the State. Such \n\ninstructions must be consistent with 2 CFR part 200. The Department \n\nwelcomes any feedback from the workforce development system that \n\npromotes the use of these properties and streamlines the disposition \n\nprocess.\n\nSection 683.245 Are employment generating activities, or similar \n\nactivities, allowable under title I of the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section implements sec. 181(e) of WIOA, which \n\nrestricts the use of WIOA funds for employment generating activities \n\nexcept where the activities are directly related to training for \n\neligible individuals. The proposed section states that employer \n\noutreach and job development activities are considered to be directly \n\n\n\nrelated to training for eligible individuals, and it lists a number of \n\nexamples of acceptable activities. The section also describes the \n\nconditions in which WIOA funds can be used for employer outreach.\n\nSection 683.250 What other activities are prohibited under title I of \n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section describes other activities that are expressly \n\nprohibited\n\n[[Page 20751]]\n\nin title I of WIOA, including foreign travel paid for by WIOA formula \n\nfunds (sec. 181(e) of WIOA) payment of wages of incumbent workers \n\nparticipating in economic development activities (sec. 181(b) of WIOA), \n\ncontracts with persons falsely labeling products as made in America \n\n(sec. 502(c) of WIOA), and others.\n\nSection 683.255 What are the limitations related to religious \n\nactivities in title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section describes the limitations related to using \n\nWIOA funds to support religious activities, including the preclusion on \n\nemployment of participants for the construction, operation, or \n\nmaintenance of facilities used for sectarian purposes or worship, which \n\nis contained in sec. 188(a)(3) of WIOA. This section also references 29 \n\nCFR part 2, subpart D, which describes other limitations in detail, \n\nalong with certain exceptions. This proposed section contains similar \n\nrequirements as the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.266.\n\nSection 683.260 What prohibitions apply to the use of Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act title I funds to encourage business \n\nrelocation?\n\n    This proposed section describes the prohibitions on the use of WIOA \n\ntitle I funds to encourage business relocation, including specific \n\ntimeframes when entities can begin working with such businesses. This \n\nsection also describes the States' obligation to develop procedures to \n\nimplement these rules. These provisions implement the requirements of \n\nsec 181(d) of WIOA. This proposed section contains the same \n\nrequirements as the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.268.\n\nSection 683.265 What procedures and sanctions apply to violations of \n\nthis part?\n\n    This proposed section lists the provisions that provide for \n\nsanctions resulting from the violation of Sec. Sec.  683.235-260.\n\nSection 683.270 What safeguards are there to ensure that participants \n\nin Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act employment and training \n\nactivities do not displace other employees?\n\n    This proposed section outlines conditions and safeguards to ensure \n\n\n\nthat any WIOA title I participant does not displace an existing \n\nemployee by participating in a WIOA title I program or activity. It \n\nalso states that an employee can file a complaint alleging \n\ndisplacement. Section 181(b)(2) of WIOA did not change the WIA \n\ndisplacement requirements at sec. 181(b)(2) of WIA. Accordingly, this \n\nregulation is unchanged from the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667. 270.\n\nSection 683.275 What wage and labor standards apply to participants in \n\nactivities under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \n\nAct?\n\n    This proposed section describes the wage and labor standards that \n\napply to WIOA title I participants, including the requirements under \n\nthe Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and State and local minimum \n\nwage laws. The regulation is unchanged from the WIA regulations at 20 \n\nCFR 667.272, except that it includes two additional provisions from \n\nsec. 181 of WIOA. The first is that the reference to the FLSA minimum \n\nwage requirement does not apply to territorial jurisdictions in which \n\nthe minimum wage requirement does not apply (WIOA sec. 181(a)(1)(B)), \n\nand the second is that WIOA title I funds must not be used to pay the \n\nwages of incumbent employees during their participation in economic \n\ndevelopment activities provided through a statewide workforce delivery \n\nsystem (WIOA sec. 181(b)(1)). This requirement is also found in \n\nproposed Sec.  683.250(a)(1), but it is included here as well to give a \n\ncomplete list of the wage standards that apply to WIOA participants.\n\nSection 683.280 What health and safety standards apply to the working \n\nconditions of participants in activities under title I of the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    The proposed section explains what health and safety standards and \n\nworkers compensation laws apply to WIOA title I participants. The \n\nstandards in WIOA are the same as those in WIA, so the regulation is \n\nunchanged from the WIA regulation at 20 CFR 667.274.\n\nSection 683.285 What are a recipient's obligations to ensure \n\nnondiscrimination and equal opportunity, and what are a recipient's \n\nobligations with respect to religious activities?\n\n    This proposed section describes the nondiscrimination, equal \n\nopportunity, and religious activities requirements that recipients, as \n\ndefined in WIOA sec. 188 and at 29 CFR part 37, must adhere to when \n\nusing WIOA title I funds. WIOA did not change these requirements, so \n\nthe proposed section contains the same requirements as the WIA \n\nregulation at 20 CFR 667.275, with a few exceptions. Accordingly, \n\nparagraph (a)(1) of the proposed rule refers to ``Job Corps \n\ncontractors,'' instead of ``vendors,'' to conform with 29 CFR part 37. \n\nAdditionally, proposed Sec.  683.285(a)(4) implements sec. 188(a)(4) of \n\nWIOA, which prohibits discriminating against an individual because of \n\n\n\nthat person's status as a WIOA title I participant. Proposed Sec.  \n\n683.285(a)(5) also implements the requirement at sec. 188(a)(5) of WIOA \n\nthat participation in WIOA title I programs and activities be available \n\nto citizens and nationals of the United States, lawfully admitted \n\npermanent resident aliens, refugees, asylees, and parolees, and other \n\nimmigrants authorized by the Attorney General to work in the United \n\nStates. Finally, the proposed section includes the Wagner- Peyser \n\nprogram as an example of a Department program that is covered by 29 CFR \n\npart 2, subpart D.\n\nSection 683.290 Are there salary and bonus restrictions in place for \n\nthe use of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act funds?\n\n    This proposed section implements the requirements of sec. 194(15) \n\nof WIOA related to salary and bonus restrictions that apply to \n\nrecipients or subrecipients. Although the statute applies the \n\nrestrictions to WIOA title I funding, the Department expanded \n\napplication to Wagner-Peyser Act recipients and subrecipients. The \n\nappropriations acts for the last 9 years (Pub. L. 109-234 June 15, \n\n2006) have applied the limitation to all ETA-funded programs; thus, \n\ninterpreting the provision as applying to Wagner-Peyser funded \n\nactivities is appropriate. Additionally, it is the Department's policy \n\nto ensure that funding is directed to substantive workforce employment \n\nand training activities to the greatest extent possible, rather than to \n\nadministrative costs.\n\n    The proposed section restates the WIOA statutory provisions. \n\nSpecifically, it prohibits recipients and subrecipients from paying the \n\nsalary and bonuses of an individual, either as direct or indirect \n\ncosts, at a rate in excess of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed \n\nfor level II of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5313. \n\nAdditionally, the limitation does not apply to contractors providing \n\ngoods and services as defined in OMB's Uniform Administrative \n\nrequirements (which supersedes OMB Circular A-133 cited in the \n\nstatute). The Department has used the term ``contractors'' instead of \n\nthe statutory term ``vendor'' to be consistent with the term used in \n\nthe Uniform Guidance. The proposed rule also explains the provision at \n\nWIOA sec. 194(15)(B) that a State may establish a lower limit for \n\nsalaries and bonuses.\n\n    Finally, the Department has provided direction for scenarios in \n\nwhich an employee may be funded by various\n\n[[Page 20752]]\n\nprograms or work for multiple offices. If funds awarded under title I \n\nof WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act pay only a portion of the employee's \n\n\n\nsalary or bonus, the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyer Act funds may only be \n\ncharged for the share of the employee's salary or bonus attributable to \n\nthe work performed on the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser Act grant. That \n\nportion cannot exceed the proportional Executive level II rate. This \n\nrestriction applies to the sum of salary and bonus payments made to an \n\nindividual whether they are charged as direct costs or indirect costs \n\nunder title I of WIOA and Wagner-Peyer. When an individual is working \n\nfor the same recipient or subrecipient in multiple offices that are \n\nfunded by title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act, the recipient or \n\nsubrecipient must ensure that the sum of the individual's salary and \n\nbonus payments does not exceed the prescribed limitation. These \n\nclarifications will help to ensure that WIOA and Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nfunds are not overcharged for salary and bonus payments and that there \n\nare no ``loopholes'' in applying the limitation.\n\nSection 683.295 Is earning of profit allowed under the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section addresses earning profit under WIOA. As the \n\nnetwork of training services and one-stop operators has changed over \n\nthe years, the Department is including the proposed section to address \n\nworking with for-profit entities and the earning of profit by these \n\nentities. Proposed Sec.  683.295(a)(2) includes a requirement for \n\ngrants and other Federal financial assistance awarded under secs. \n\n121(d) and 134(b) of WIOA, which states that where a Federal financial \n\nassistance award authorizes one-stop operators, service providers, or \n\nETPs to earn profit, the pass through entity must follow 2 CFR 200.323 \n\nto ensure that the entities' charges are reasonable and fair. The \n\nrequirement in 2 CFR 200.323 that profit be negotiated as a separate \n\nelement of the price will provide greater transparency as to the amount \n\nof profit earned by for-profit entities whether they are subrecipients \n\nor subcontractors. This paragraph (a)(2) describes an exception to the \n\ngeneral rule that for-profit entities acting under a contract are \n\nallowed to earn profit. When the for-profit entity is a recipient of a \n\ngrant or other Federal financial assistance, the entities will now be \n\ncovered by the Uniform Guidance rather than the Federal Acquisition \n\nRegulations. The general rule, for when for-profit entities are working \n\nas contractors, is included in proposed Sec.  683.295(a)(3). The \n\nparagraph notes that the profit is allowable provided that the \n\ncontractor abides by the requirements of 2 CFR 200.323. Proposed Sec.  \n\n683.295(b) states that for programs authorized by other sections of \n\n\n\nWIOA, profit will be prohibited unless authorized by the terms and \n\nconditions of the Federal award.\n\n4. Subpart C--Reporting Requirements\n\n    This subpart provides guidance for reporting that will promote \n\ntransparency and accountability at the grant recipient level. With \n\ntoday's demand for data in an open and transparent environment, the \n\nFederal government meets the challenges with initiatives such as the \n\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act, requiring the Department \n\nto open access to data and use common data metrics. Performance and \n\nfinancial data, when made available, can lead to innovation. Not only \n\ndoes the Secretary seek to employ fresh and innovative approaches in \n\nserving job seekers and employers, the Department wants to utilize our \n\nresources and reporting portals to provide to the public visualizations \n\nrich in data and metrics to assist in better understanding of the \n\nemployment environment. It is the Department's intent to use data \n\ncollected from the financial, performance, and annual reports to \n\nempower our workforce system while providing transparency and \n\naccountability to our stakeholders. This subpart seeks to promote the \n\ngovernment's initiative to manage information as an asset to increase \n\noperational efficiencies, reduce costs, improve services, support \n\nmission needs, safeguard personal information, and increase public \n\naccess. One way to promote this initiative is through the collection \n\nand transmission of data, using machine readable formats whenever \n\npossible. To safeguard personally identifiable information, recipients \n\nand subrecipients must limit the collection and transmission of such \n\ndata and use encrypted transmission software. To increase operational \n\nefficiencies and reduce costs, the Department and its grantees work \n\ntogether to find solutions that allow for the streamlining of reporting \n\nand the reduction of duplication of systems and efforts. The \n\nDepartment's existing financial expenditure form (ETA-9130) will be \n\nmodified to reflect new reporting requirements. The Secretary will \n\nissue additional guidance on this topic.\n\n683.300 What are the reporting requirements for programs funded under \n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    To continue with efforts for accountability and transparency as \n\nwell as to provide data to our stakeholders, the Department requires \n\nits recipients to submit financial and performance reports, as well as \n\nan annual performance report. The data contained in these reports must \n\nbe generated and processed in formats that are compatible with other \n\ncommonly used data systems and be in machine readable formats. This \n\nproposed section specifies the reporting requirements for grant \n\n\n\nrecipients and the deadlines for such reports. This section also sets \n\nforth recipients' responsibility to collect data from subrecipients. \n\nPargraphs (b), (d), and (e) separately describe the performance \n\nreporting requirements for the core programs under sec. 116 of WIOA and \n\npart 677 and other grant programs authorized under title I of WIOA.\n\n5. Subpart D--Oversight and Resolution of Findings\n\n    This proposed subpart addressees the oversight and resolution \n\nresponsibilities of the Department and grant recipients of WIOA funds. \n\nOversight and monitoring is a valuable tool in effectively managing \n\ngrants and this subpart emphasizes the need for careful application of \n\nthese requirements by the Department and by recipients.\n\n    Oversight. These regulations which provide for oversight and \n\nresolution responsibilities of the Department and its grant recipients \n\nare an important part of the Department's overall strategy to improve \n\ngrant administration and to promote the vision of WIOA. As in WIA, \n\nStates will review their subrecipients and validate their compliance \n\nwith the Uniform Guidance on an annual basis and certify compliance to \n\nthe Secretary every 2 years. The States and grant recipients must also \n\ninstall a monitoring system that meets the requirements of the Uniform \n\nGuidance and includes the examination of such items as performance, \n\nprogram goals, non-discrimination, conflict of interest, and mandatory \n\ndisclosures.\n\n    Resolution. The resolution of findings that arise from audits, \n\ninvestigations, monitoring reviews, and the Grant Officer resolution \n\nprocess is specified in this proposed subpart. It also provides \n\nclarification on the effect of the Uniform Guidance on the resolution \n\nprocess at the subrecipient level. When action to resolve findings is \n\ninadequate, the Department will take additional action\n\n[[Page 20753]]\n\nagainst the State or other direct grant recipient to reach resolution. \n\nSuch action will include the Grant Officer resolution process, \n\nincluding the initial and final determination process, as described in \n\nproposed Sec.  683.440.\n\nSec.  683.400 What are the Federal and State monitoring and oversight \n\nresponsibilities?\n\n    This proposed section identifies the requirements of the Department \n\nin performing oversight and monitoring of its grant recipients and of \n\nthe Department's grant recipients' responsibility for subrecipients. \n\nProposed Sec.  683.400(c) describes the requirements WIOA has placed on \n\nthe States to create a monitoring system for their subrecipients. \n\n\n\nProposed paragraph (d) also requires the retention of evidence related \n\nto monitoring functions and resolution actions. This section also \n\ncovers the new requirements under the Uniform Guidance which requires \n\nan examination of recipient and subrecipient non-discrimination and \n\nconflict of interest policies, mandatory disclosures of all violations \n\nof Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity \n\nviolations potentially affecting the Federal award.\n\nSection 683.410 What are the oversight roles and responsibilities of \n\nrecipients and subrecipients of Federal financial assistance awarded \n\nunder title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and \n\nWagner-Peyser?\n\n    This proposed section defines the roles and areas in which \n\noversight must be conducted by the recipients and subrecipients, \n\nincluding ensuring compliance with relevant rules and developing a \n\nmonitoring system. Proposed paragraph (b) of the section also discusses \n\na number of requirements for the States' monitoring systems and the \n\nGovernor's biannual certification. The Department has always placed \n\nsignificant emphasis on monitoring as a tool in providing effective \n\ngrants managements and this emphasis is further supported by the \n\ninclusion of monitoring in the Uniform Guidance. Monitoring and \n\noversight also helps in identifying technical assistance needs, areas \n\nfor improvement, and best practices.\n\nSection 683.420 What procedures apply to the resolution of findings \n\narising from audits, investigations, monitoring, and oversight reviews?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  683.420(a) describes the steps and procedures that \n\nmust be taken by grant recipients to resolve findings at the \n\nsubrecipient level. For formula funds, sec. 184(a) of WIOA requires \n\nStates to use the procedures they have in place for other Federal grant \n\nprograms or, in the absence of such procedures, write standards for \n\nthis program. Paragraph (a)(2) states that non-formula grant recipients \n\nmust have written monitoring and resolutions procedures that adhere to \n\nthe Uniform Guidance governing monitoring of subrecipients. All \n\nrecipients must ensure that the rules governing the use of WIOA funds \n\nare being followed, including adherence to cost categories and cost \n\nlimitations. Proposed Sec.  683.420(b) also describes the processes the \n\nDepartment will use to resolve findings of its direct grant recipients, \n\nand proposed paragraph (c) describes the processes to resolve findings \n\nregarding the non-discrimination provisions in sec. 188 of WIOA.\n\nSection 683.430 How does the Secretary resolve investigative and \n\nmonitoring findings?\n\n    This proposed section describes the actions the Secretary will take \n\nto resolve findings. This section also describes the process when the \n\n\n\nGrant Officer agrees that the recipient's actions are sufficient to \n\nresolve a finding and when they are not satisfactory. This proposed \n\nsection implements the requirements of sec. 184(a)(7) of WIOA. Proposed \n\nSec.  683.430(b) states that audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be \n\nresolved through the Grant Officer resolution process described in \n\nproposed Sec.  683.440.\n\nSection 683.440 What is the Grant Officer resolution process?\n\n    This proposed section describes the Grant Officer's resolution \n\nprocess when dissatisfied with the actions taken by the grant recipient \n\nto resolve findings. This process involves the issuance of an Initial \n\nDetermination followed by a period for informal resolution which allows \n\nthe recipient to work with the Department to provide the necessary \n\ndocumentation or take certain action to reach a resolution. At the end \n\nof that period, the Grant Officer issues a Final Determination with \n\nfindings listing any unresolved issues, establishing any debts, and \n\nlisting required corrective actions, as well as offering the \n\nopportunity for a hearing. This process is unchanged from the process \n\nunder WIA.\n\n6. Subpart E--Pay-for-Performance Contract Strategies\n\nIntroduction\n\n    WIOA's Pay-for-Performance provisions were designed to provide \n\nflexibility at the local level in an effort to infuse the system with \n\nmore innovation, improve results for participants, and reward providers \n\nwho deliver outstanding results. This regulatory proposal builds on the \n\nDepartment's experience with innovations and evidence-based work funded \n\nunder the Workforce Innovation Fund and other Federally authorized \n\nactivities. Moreover, the statute authorizes States to use non-Federal \n\nfunds to establish incentives for Local Boards to implement WIOA Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contract strategies. We encourage States to adopt \n\nevidence-based approaches and innovate in the way they deliver services \n\nto participants in order to improve outcomes, and recognize that WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contracting strategies, while still experimental, \n\nare one promising method to do so.\n\n    A performance-based contract is a contracting strategy that \n\nestablishes specific benchmarks that must be achieved in order for the \n\ncontractor to receive payment. The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts \n\nare a specific form of contracting that, as authorized by WIOA, have \n\nsix distinct characteristics: (1) They must provide adult training \n\nservices described in sec. 134(c)(3) of WIOA or youth activities \n\n\n\ndescribed in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA; (2) they must specify a fixed \n\namount that will be paid to the service provider based on the \n\nachievement of specified levels of performance on the performance \n\noutcomes in sec. 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA within a defined timetable; (3) \n\nthe performance outcomes achieved must be independently validated using \n\nhigh-quality, reliable, and verified data; (4) outcomes must be \n\nreported in accordance with sec. 116(d)(2)(K) of WIOA; (5) pursuant to \n\nsec. 3(47)(A) of WIOA, bonuses may be built into WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contracts so long as such bonuses are used to expand the \n\ncontractor's capacity to provide effective training; and (6) there may \n\nbe an extended period of availability to expend funds under Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract strategies. Additionally, the funds obligated for \n\nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies are limited to 10 percent \n\nof the total of the local adult and dislocated worker allotments \n\nprovided under sec. 133(b) of WIOA, and 10 percent of the local youth \n\nallotment provided under sec. 128(b) of WIOA.\n\n    The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is one of several \n\ninnovative strategies WIOA adopts to place a higher emphasis on \n\nperformance outcomes and provider accountability, drive better results, \n\nand incorporate rigorous evaluation and evidence-based practice into \n\nthe delivery of workforce\n\n[[Page 20754]]\n\nservices. The Department intends to support this contracting approach \n\nby incorporating WIOA Pay-for-Performance into its WIOA performance \n\nreporting requirements for States in which local areas are adopting \n\nsuch a contracting approach.\n\n    The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy can benefit local \n\nareas, job seekers, and business customers when used to support \n\ninterventions that have a high probability of success based on prior \n\nevidence; have measurable outcomes supported with authoritative data \n\nand strong evaluation methodologies; and are overseen by experienced \n\nmanagers that have flexibility to adjust their approach.\n\n    Given the heavy emphasis that WIOA Pay-For-Performance authorities \n\nplace on outcome-based payment and independent validation, the quality \n\nof local area data and data systems should be of high enough quality to \n\nbe able to (1) reliably and validly establish appropriate performance \n\nbenchmarks for the target population, and (2) support independent \n\nvalidation of actual performance outcomes.\n\n    In particular, in order for these contracting mechanisms to work \n\n\n\neffectively and efficiently, they must incorporate measures to prevent \n\nor account for potential ``creaming'' by service providers, and strong \n\ndata systems are essential to this function. The use of outcome data \n\nfrom comparison groups--substantially similar populations who are not \n\nreceiving services through the provider--is one potential method to \n\nminimize creaming. Another potential method adopted by WIOA to address \n\ncreaming is the use of a statistical adjustment model for (1) the \n\nestablishment of performance targets, and (2) the adjustment of actual \n\nperformance based on economic conditions and the characteristics of the \n\nparticipants. In either case, the use of valid and reliable baseline \n\ndata will help to inform appropriate performance targets and that \n\nstrong data systems are necessary to support this approach.\n\n    Additionally, it is important to engage in a feasibility analysis \n\nbefore engaging in a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, and that these \n\nanalysis should be built into a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \n\nstrategy. Such a feasibility analysis could include items like \n\nassessing the availability and quality of necessary data, including the \n\nsource and cost of such data; determining the target population to be \n\nserved; determining the availability of competent providers; whether \n\nany other additional professional services are required to support the \n\nexecution of the contract; and reviewing other operational factors that \n\nwould affect the feasibility of the contract.\n\n    The Department is soliciting comments on the appropriate strategies \n\nto implement different varieties of Pay for Performance contracts, \n\nincluding issues involving what components should be included in a Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contracting strategy; what factors should be considered \n\nin a feasibility analysis; which entities should be eligible to enter \n\ninto these contracts; how different varieties of contracts should be \n\nstructured; how to best establish baseline performance information for \n\ntarget populations served; how best to prevent or account for creaming; \n\nthe best methods to account for the relative and absolute risk to \n\ngovernment, the contractor, and other stakeholders when setting payment \n\nterms; how best to balance the total cost to government against bonus \n\nand incentive payments included in the contract and potential outcome \n\nimprovements for participants; how comprehensive services can be \n\nprovided in a Pay-for-Performance contract context; and how to \n\nfacilitate the participation of small service providers.\n\n    Because of the requirements contained in statute, the Department is \n\nconsidering how best to incorporate reporting into performance and \n\n\n\nfiscal information collection requests, which will be included in the \n\nperformance and fiscal PRA packages, or whether a separate information \n\ncollection is needed. We welcome comments regarding the burden of \n\nadditional reporting requirements, such as specifics about local areas \n\nutilizing pay-for-performance contract strategies; the service \n\nproviders, the amount of contracts, duration, and monitoring and \n\nevaluation findings. The Department expects to put performance and \n\nimplementation requirements in place in the future.\n\nSection 683.500 What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contract strategy?\n\n    This proposed section describes the components of a WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract strategy and describes WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontract as a specific type of performance-based contract. It draws a \n\ndistinction between the WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract itself and \n\nthe broader goals and strategies surrounding it, which are the \n\ncontracting strategy.\n\n    Local area WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies must \n\ninclude: (1) Identification of the problem space and target populations \n\nfor which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract; \n\n(2) the outcomes the local area would hope to achieve through a Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; (3) the \n\nacceptable cost associated with implementing such a strategy; (4) a \n\nfeasibility study to determine whether the service delivery strategy to \n\nbe funded is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracting \n\nstrategy; (5) independent validation of the performance outcomes \n\nachieved under each contract within the strategy prior to payment \n\noccurring; and (6) a description of how the local area will reallocate \n\nfunds to other activities under the contract strategy in the event a \n\nservice provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contract.\n\n    The Department will issue additional guidance to both State and \n\nlocal areas on the development of the broader Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontract strategy, including the scope and minimum requirements of the \n\nrequired feasibility study.\n\nSection 683.510 What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contract?\n\n\n\n    This proposed section defines the requirements associated with a \n\nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, which would be awarded under a WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contract strategy.\n\n    Paragraph (a) identifies a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \n\nstrategy as a type of performance-based contract. A performance-based \n\ncontract is a contracting mechanism that establishes specific \n\nbenchmarks that must be achieved in order for the contractor to receive \n\npayment. Performance-based contracting in general is defined and \n\ndiscussed in subpart 37.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n\n    Paragraph (b) articulates that WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts \n\ncan only be used when they are part of a broader WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance Contract Strategy described in Sec.  683.500.\n\n    To be consistent with past practice and with the Uniform Guidance \n\nat 2 CFR part 200, proposed paragraph (c) prohibits the use of cost-\n\nplus percentage contracts in WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts.\n\n    The specifications in proposed paragraphs (d) through (f) regarding \n\neligible service providers, structure of payments, target populations, \n\nand program elements are derived directly from the statute, at WIOA \n\nsecs. 3(47), 129(c)(1)(D), 129(c)(2), 134(c)(3), and 134(d)(1)(iii). \n\nProposed paragraph (e) specifically requires that the performance \n\nelements that must be included in any WIOA Pay-for-\n\n[[Page 20755]]\n\nPerformance contract are the primary indicators of performance \n\ndescribed in sec. 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA and further defined in proposed \n\nSec.  677.155. These include:\n\n    i. The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized \n\nemployment during the second quarter after exit from the program;\n\n    ii. the percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized \n\nemployment during the fourth quarter after exit from the program;\n\n    iii. the median earnings of program participants who are in \n\nunsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the \n\nprogram;\n\n    iv. the percentage of program participants who obtain a recognized \n\npost-secondary credential, or a secondary school diploma or its \n\nrecognized equivalent (subject to sec. 116(b)(iii) of WIOA), during \n\nparticipation in or within 1 year after exit from the program;\n\n    v. the percentage of program participants who, during a program \n\nyear, are in an education or training program that leads to a \n\nrecognized post-secondary credential or employment and who are \n\nachieving measurable skill gains toward such a credential or \n\n\n\nemployment; and\n\n    vi. the indicators of effectiveness in serving employers \n\nestablished pursuant to sec. 116(b)(iv) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (h) states that under WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontracts, bonus payments and/or incentive payments are authorized to \n\nbe paid to the service providers who enter into the WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contracts. Such bonus payments must be used to expand the \n\ncontractor's capacity to provide effective training. These payments are \n\nauthorized by sec. 3(47)(A) of WIOA. Incentive payments must be \n\nconsistent with incentive payments for performance-based contracting as \n\ndescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. WIOA Pay-For-\n\nPerformance contracts may also utilize positive and negative incentives \n\nto other forms of performance-based contracts. To be consistent with \n\nperformance-based contracting and in alignment with WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract characteristics, such as recognizing high \n\nperformers and providing boards with flexibility to make adjustments, \n\nincentive payments should be based on the total and relative amount of \n\nrisk incurred by the service provider or contractor versus that \n\nincurred by the local area or other stakeholders.\n\n    Because the Department is responsible for reporting on local \n\noutcomes annually to Congress, as well as providing recommendations for \n\nimprovements in and adjustments to WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \n\nstrategies, proposed paragraph (i) requires specific reporting by the \n\nlocal areas to the State regarding the performance outcomes achieved by \n\nthe service providers that enter into WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontracts. Additionally, proposed paragraph (j) requires independent \n\nvalidation of a contractor's achievement of performance benchmarks \n\nunder a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract, as required by sec. 3(47)(B) \n\nof WIOA, and requires that this validation be based on high-quality, \n\nreliable, and verified data. The Secretary will issue guidance related \n\nto standards for independent evaluation as part of its Pay-for-\n\nPerformance guidance to States and local areas.\n\n    Paragraph (k) indicates that the Secretary may issue additional \n\nguidance related to use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts.\n\n    Under WIA, many Workforce Development Boards utilized elements of \n\nperformance-based contracts with training providers. These contracts \n\nincorporated performance outcomes that contractors were required to \n\nmeet to obtain payment. However, these contracts did not contain \n\nrequired elements of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract articulated in \n\nthis section. The Department encourages local areas to refocus these \n\ntraditional performance-based contracts to place an emphasis on the \n\ncontractor achieving outcomes like participants obtaining and retaining \n\n\n\ngood jobs, rather than outputs like the number of people served. Also, \n\nthe provision for the inclusion of bonus payments is limited to WIOA \n\nPay-For-Performance contracts. Contracts that are not executed under \n\nthe WIOA Pay-For-Performance contracting authority may continue to \n\ninclude performance incentives, either positive or negative or both, in \n\ncompliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Workforce \n\nDevelopment Boards may continue to use performance-based contracts that \n\nare not WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts. The 10 percent limitation \n\nprovisions in secs. 129(c)(1)(D) and 134(d)(1)(A)(iii) of WIOA only \n\napply to WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies, including WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contracts.\n\nSection 683.520 What funds can be used for Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategies?\n\n    This proposed section restates the WIOA requirements that funds \n\nallocated under secs. 133(b)(2) and (3) of WIOA can be used for WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contract strategies providing adults and dislocated \n\nworker training, and funds allocated under sec. 128(b) of WIOA can be \n\nused for WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies providing youth \n\nactivities. No more than 10 percent of the total local adult and \n\ndislocated worker allotments can be expended on the implementation of \n\nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for adult training \n\nservices described in sec. 134(c)(3) of WIOA. No more than 10 percent \n\nof the local youth allotment can be expended on the implementation of \n\nWIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies for youth training \n\nservices and other activities described in secs. 129(c)(1) and (c)(2) \n\nof WIOA. There is no limit on the use of funds for typical performance-\n\nbased contracts, as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The \n\n10 percent limits apply only to those performance-based contracts that \n\nare WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies as defined above.\n\nSection 683.530 How long are funds used for Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategies available?\n\n    Section 189(g)(2)(D) of WIOA specifies that funds used for WIOA \n\nPay-for-Performance contract strategies are available until expended. \n\nThis allows local areas to structure contracts that include time-\n\nintensive service delivery strategies and/or that structure payments \n\nbased on outcomes that may take longer to achieve, measure, and \n\nvalidate than the typical 2-year funding availability of local area \n\nfunds. Funds that are obligated but not expended due to contractor not \n\n\n\nachieving the levels of performance specified in a WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract may be reallocated for further activities related \n\nto WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies only. This also allows \n\nthe local area to realize one of the benefits of performance-based \n\ncontracting strategies--the local area does not pay a financial penalty \n\nfor contracted services that do not achieve the stated outcomes. This \n\nprovision gives the local area the discretion to choose whether to use \n\nthe funds for these strategies, and if the local area so chooses, the \n\nfunds will remain available until expended. This will require new grant \n\nmanagement practices for local areas that choose to carry out WIOA Pay-\n\nfor-Performance strategies. The Department will issue guidance to \n\nexplain these new practices and we welcome comments with suggestions on \n\nhow to maximize the use of these contract strategies and the expanded \n\navailability of the funds.\n\n[[Page 20756]]\n\nSection 683.540 What is the State's role in assisting local areas in \n\nusing Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontract strategies?\n\n    This proposed section describes both allowable and required State \n\nactivities related to WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies. The \n\nsection indicates that States may provide technical assistance to local \n\nareas, including assistance with structuring WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontracting strategies, performance data collection, meeting \n\nperformance data entry requirements, and identifying levels of \n\nperformance. This technical assistance can help local areas move \n\nforward in using this contracting strategy. Additionally, the State may \n\neither conduct evaluations of such strategies and/or provide technical \n\nassistance to locals regarding the importance of evaluation of Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract strategies. The State and local areas may conduct \n\ntheir own evaluations of the WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts, or \n\nprocure an independent evaluator. The Department welcomes comments \n\nregarding use of independent evaluators and whether the cost of such \n\nevaluations is feasible within the amount of funds available to local \n\nareas for pay-for-performance contracts. The Department also seeks \n\ncomments on how the Department might facilitate local areas' ability to \n\nconduct evaluations. Further, sec. 116(h) of WIOA authorizes States to \n\nuse non-Federal funds to incentivize use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\n\n\ncontract strategies for the delivery of training services or youth \n\nactivities by Local Boards.\n\n    This section also identifies required activities States must \n\nundertake if a local area implements at WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontract strategy. Because of the unique reporting requirements in sec. \n\n116(d)(2)(K) for WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts, the performance \n\nsection of this proposed rule, as well as the forthcoming Information \n\nCollection Request package, will clearly articulate the State's \n\nresponsibility to track and report data on the primary indicators of \n\nperformance as well as the State and local evaluations of the design of \n\nthe programs and performance of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract \n\nstrategies and, where possible, the level of satisfaction with the \n\nstrategies among employers and participants benefitting from the \n\nstrategies.\n\n    The State must also monitor local areas' use of WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contracts to ensure compliance with the following: The \n\nrequired elements listed in Sec.  683.500, the contract specifications \n\nin Sec.  683.510, State procurement policies, the 10 percent \n\nlimitations, and achievement of performance benchmarks.\n\n7. Subpart F--Grievance Procedures, Complaints, and State Appeals \n\nProcesses\n\n    This subpart provides regulations governing the grievance, \n\ncomplaint, and appeals procedures that apply at the State and local \n\nlevel and to discretionary grantees under WIOA, as well as appeals to \n\nthe Secretary. Providing clear rules for resolving complaints and \n\nfiling appeals promotes transparency and fairness, which are \n\nfundamental requirements of the workforce investment system grant \n\nprocess. Included are rules governing the appeals of local area non-\n\ndesignation, denial or termination of training provider eligibility, \n\nand appeals of formula program participants who are tested or \n\nsanctioned for the use of controlled substances. Appeals of the \n\nGovernor's imposition of sanctions for substantial violations of fiscal \n\nor other substantive requirements or performance failures under WIOA \n\ntitle I are also addressed. Finally, this subpart explains the process \n\nof reporting information and complaints involving criminal fraud, \n\nwaste, abuse, or other criminal activity under WIOA.\n\nSection 683.600 What local area, State and direct recipient grievance \n\nprocedures must be established?\n\n    This proposed section requires local areas, States, outlying areas, \n\nand direct grant recipients of WIOA title I funds to establish and \n\nmaintain a procedure for grievances and complaints, including appeals \n\n\n\nas appropriate, and describes what the procedure much include, as \n\nrequired by WIOA sec. 181(c)(1). While this section of WIOA does not \n\nrequire outlying areas or direct grant recipients to establish such \n\nprocedures, the Department has included them in this section to ensure \n\nthat all participants receiving services under title I of WIOA have the \n\nsame opportunity to report and receive relief from the negative actions \n\nof the WIOA funded grantees.\n\n    This proposed section also clarifies that allegations of violations \n\nof the non-discrimination provisions of WIOA are subject to the \n\npolicies and procedures described in 29 CFR part 37, which is \n\nadministered by the Department's Civil Rights Center, and that \n\ncomplaint and grievance procedures related to Job Corps are in part 686 \n\nof this title. This section retains the same requirements found at 20 \n\nCFR 667.600.\n\nSection 683.610 What processes does the Secretary use to review \n\ngrievances and complaints of title I recipients?\n\n    This proposed section describes the situations in which the \n\nDepartment will review allegations, and the procedures that the \n\nSecretary will use, that arise through local, State, and other direct \n\nrecipient grievance procedures in accordance with WIOA sec. 184(c)(2). \n\nThis section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 667.610.\n\nSection 683.620 How are complaints and reports of criminal fraud and \n\nabuse addressed under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This proposed section provides the requirements for reporting \n\ninformation and complaints involving non-criminal complaints and \n\ncriminal fraud, waste, abuse or other criminal activity through the \n\nDepartment's Incident Reporting System to the Department's Office of \n\nthe Inspector General. This section retains the same requirements found \n\nat 20 CFR 667.630.\n\nSection 683.630 What additional appeal processes or systems must a \n\nState have for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act program?\n\n    This proposed section describes the processes and systems that a \n\nState must establish to hear appeals of: Entities that are denied \n\ninitial or subsequent designation as a local area; training service \n\nproviders that are denied eligibility as providers of training \n\nservices; and WIOA title I subtitle B participants who are subject to \n\ntesting or sanctions for the use of controlled substances. The section \n\nrestates the WIOA appeal requirements in secs. 106(b)(5) (local area \n\nnon-designation), 122 (training provider eligibility denial or \n\ntermination); 181(f) (participant testing and sanctioning for use of \n\ncontrolled substances).\n\nSection 683.640 What procedures apply to the appeals of non-designation \n\n\n\nof local areas?\n\n    This proposed section describes the procedures that apply when a \n\nState Board denies an appeal for initial or subsequent designation of a \n\nlocal area made by a unit of local government or grant recipient under \n\nSec.  683.630(a). This section restates and implements the appeal \n\nrequirements required by WIOA sec. 106(b)(5).\n\n[[Page 20757]]\n\nSection 683.650 What procedures apply to the appeals of the Governor's \n\nimposition of sanctions for substantial violations or performance \n\nfailures by a local area?\n\n    This proposed section describes the procedures that apply to \n\nappeals of the Governor's imposition of sanctions for substantial \n\nviolations of fiscal or other substantive requirements of title I of \n\nWIOA or of performance failures by local areas.\n\n8. Subpart G--Sanctions, Corrective Actions, and Waiver of Liability\n\n    While technical assistance, oversight, and monitoring are tools to \n\nensure compliance with program and funding requirements, sanctions and \n\ncorrective action plans are necessary where those tools fail. This \n\nsubpart addresses sanctions and corrective actions, waiver of \n\nliability, advance approval of contemplated corrective actions, as well \n\nas the offset and State deduction provision. Of particular note in this \n\nsubpart are the procedures for allowing a waiver of liability or an \n\noffset from other funds owed to the recipient. The statutory provisions \n\nare largely unchanged from those under WIA, though the Uniform Guidance \n\nhas resulted in some changes to this subpart.\n\nSection 683.700 When can the Secretary impose sanctions and corrective \n\nactions on recipients and subrecipients of title I Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act funds?\n\n    This proposed section describes the procedures and circumstances \n\nunder which the Department will impose sanctions or take corrective \n\nactions, as described in sec. 184(b) and (e), against States, local \n\nareas, and grant recipients and subrecipients. For actions other than \n\nthose under WIOA sec. 188(a), the process outlined in Sec.  683.440 \n\nwill be used before corrective actions or sanctions are taken against \n\ndirect recipients. This section also gives the Grant Officer the \n\nauthority to take direct action against local areas or other \n\nsubrecipients, which will also be done using the process in Sec.  \n\n683.440. This section also clarifies that the procedures described at \n\n20 CFR part 677 will be used to impose a sanction or corrective action \n\nfor a violation of sec. 116 of WIOA. This section generally implements \n\n\n\nsec. 184 of WIOA and retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n667.700. The Department seeks comments on appropriate sanctions and \n\ncorrective actions in a variety of circumstances.\n\nSection 683.710 Who is responsible for funds provided under title I and \n\nWagner-Peyser?\n\n    This proposed section identifies the recipient as the responsible \n\nparty for title I and Wagner-Peyser funds. For local areas receiving \n\nfunds, this section explains how to identify the responsible party. \n\nWhere a planning region includes two separate units of local \n\ngovernment, the CEO of each unit of local government would be the \n\nresponsible party. The general rule of recipient responsibility arises \n\nfrom the Uniform Guidance, while the rules pertaining to local areas \n\ncome from WIOA sec. 184.\n\nSection 683.720 What actions are required to address the failure of a \n\nlocal area to comply with the applicable uniform administrative \n\nprovisions?\n\n    This proposed section requires the Governor to take corrective \n\naction and impose sanctions on a local area if it fails to comply with \n\nthe requirements described in the section. This section also describes \n\nthe local area's appeal rights and actions the Secretary may take if \n\nthe Governor fails to monitor and certify local areas' compliance or \n\npromptly take corrective action to bring the local area into \n\ncompliance. The requirements in this section are taken from WIOA sec. \n\n184.\n\nSection 683.730 When can the Secretary waive the imposition of \n\nsanctions?\n\n    This proposed section permits a recipient to request a waiver of \n\nliability, and describes the factors the Grant Officer will consider \n\nwhen determining whether to grant the request. This provision \n\nimplements sec. 184(d) of WIOA and retains the same requirements found \n\nat 20 CFR 667.720.\n\nSection 683.740 What is the procedure to handle a recipient of title I \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds' request for advance \n\napproval of contemplated corrective actions?\n\n    This proposed section describes the procedures which a recipient \n\nmust use to request advance approval of corrective action from the \n\nDepartment. It describes the factors the Grant Officer will consider \n\nand when advance approval may be appropriate. This provision implements \n\nsec. 184(d) of WIOA and retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n667.730.\n\nSection 683.750 What procedure must be used for administering the \n\noffset/deduction provisions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \n\n\n\nAct?\n\n    This proposed section outlines the steps that must be taken in \n\norder for the Department to consider and allow an offset or deduction \n\nof a debt, including the offset rules for direct recipients and the \n\nrule for a State making a deduction from a subrecipient's PY \n\nallocation. This section implements the requirements of WIOA sec. \n\n184(c)(2).\n\n9. Subpart H--Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review\n\n    This subpart specifies those actions which may be appealed to the \n\nDepartment's Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ), and the rules \n\nof procedure and timing of decisions for OALJ hearings as well as the \n\nprocess for judicial review by a United States Circuit Court of \n\nAppeals. This subpart is similar to that currently in effect under WIA \n\nbecause the WIOA statute itself had only minor changes to the \n\nrequirements in this subpart.\n\nSection 683.800 What actions of the Department may be appealed to the \n\nOffice of Administrative Law Judges?\n\n    This proposed section outlines the actions that can be appealed \n\nthrough an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) under WIOA sec. 186(a), \n\nincluding a determination to not award financial assistance or a \n\ncorrective action or sanction against a recipient or subrecipient. This \n\nsection describes the appeal deadlines and the contents that an \n\napplicant is required to include in its appeal request. Paragraph (e) \n\nstates that these procedures also apply when parties fail to reach \n\nresolution through the process described in Sec.  683.840.\n\nSec.  683.810 What rules of procedure apply to hearings conducted under \n\nthis subpart?\n\n    This proposed section adopts the rules of procedure for hearings \n\nconducted before the OALJ found at 29 CFR part 18, with some \n\nclarifications. This section also describes the Secretary's subpoena \n\nauthority under WIOA. Finally, this section sets forth the burdens of \n\nproduction and persuasion in hearings conducted under this subpart. Per \n\nparagraph (c), the grant officer has the initial burden of production, \n\nwhich is satisfied by the submission of an administrative file. After \n\nthe grant officer submits the administrative file, the party seeking to \n\noverturn the Grant Officer's determination has the burden of \n\npersuasion. This section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n667.810.\n\n[[Page 20758]]\n\nSection 683.820 What authority does the Administrative Law Judge have \n\nin ordering relief as an outcome of an administrative hearing?\n\n    This section, which applies to all discretionary grants issued \n\n\n\nunder subpart D of title I of WIOA, specifies the remedies that an ALJ \n\nmay award. Paragraph (a) applies to cases other than grant selection \n\ncases and is unchanged from the WIA regulation.\n\n    Paragraph (b) specifies the remedies for grant selection cases, and \n\nis largely drawn from the Senior Community Service Employment Program \n\nremedies provision found at 20 CFR 641.470. This section gives the \n\nGrant Officer discretion to ensure that project beneficiaries (i.e., an \n\nentity awarded financial assistance) will not be unduly negatively \n\nimpacted by the implementation of remedies resulting from a grant \n\nselection appeal.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) state that upon receipt of an \n\nALJ finding the application review process must be corrected or that an \n\nappealing entity should have been awarded funding, the Grant Officer \n\nwill be required to take certain steps to determine whether the funding \n\nmust be awarded to that entity. In determining whether the funds will \n\nbe awarded to the appealing entity, the Grant Officer must take into \n\naccount whether such a move would be in the interest of project \n\nbeneficiaries and whether it would cause undue disruption to the \n\nparticipants and the program. In the event the Grant Officer determines \n\nthat the appealing entity will not receive the funds, entities without \n\nan approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) will \n\nreceive reasonable application preparation costs (under 2 CFR 200.460, \n\nfor entities with an approved NICRA, application preparation costs may \n\nbe included in their indirect cost pool and therefore are recouped from \n\ntheir indirect costs to other Federal grant awards). In the event that \n\nthe Grant Officer determines that the appealing entity will receive the \n\nfunds, that entity will only receive funds that have not yet been \n\nobligated by the current grantee.\n\n    Finally, the Grant Officer will provide notification to the current \n\ngrantee within 10 days of its decision, and that the current grantee \n\nmay appeal the Grant Officer's determination using the appeal \n\nprocedures described in 20 CFR 683.800.\n\nSection 683.830 When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a \n\ndecision?\n\n    This section describes the timeframe in which an ALJ must make a \n\ndecision to avoid any unnecessary delays. It also describes the \n\nparties' appeal rights, as stated in WIOA sec. 186(b).\n\nSection 683.840 Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that \n\nmay be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law Judges hearing?\n\n\n\n    This section describes the available alternative an entity may use \n\nto seek resolution other than a hearing process. The outcome of this \n\nprocess is considered the equivalent of the final decision of an ALJ. \n\nThe purpose of this provision is to offer entities a less formal, less \n\nburdensome, and more interactive appeal process.\n\nSection 683.850 Is there judicial review of a final order of the \n\nSecretary issued under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    This section outlines the steps a party to a final order must take \n\nto obtain judicial review in a United States Circuit Court of Appeals \n\nof any decision made by the Secretary under WIOA sec. 184 or 186, as \n\nwell as the deadlines for seeking review. This provision summarizes the \n\nrequirements of WIOA sec. 187.\n\nH. Part 684--Indian and Native American Programs Under Title I of the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    Because sec. 166 of WIOA retains many of the requirements of sec. \n\n166 of WIA, the Department has drawn on the WIA regulations, found at \n\n20 CFR part 668, in drafting the regulations for sec. 166 of WIOA. \n\nConsequently, many of the sections in this part retain the requirements \n\nfound in their parallel sections of the WIA regulations. This preamble \n\ndetails the Department's reasons for changing any of the previous \n\nrequirements under the WIA regulations on a paragraph by paragraph \n\nbasis. However, some changes to the requirements under the WIA \n\nregulations affect so many paragraphs that they are noted in the \n\nintroduction to the preamble instead of noting them every time that \n\nthey occur.\n\n    First, proposed part 684 seeks to streamline the competitive \n\nprocess for awarding the Indian and Native American (INA) program \n\ngrants. Section 166 of WIOA is unusual in that it requires both that \n\ngrants be awarded through a competitive process and that grantees \n\nsubmit a 4-year plan (WIOA secs. 166(c) and 166(e)). Under the WIA \n\nregulations, the competition was separate from the plan. These WIOA \n\nregulations propose to streamline the grant award process to ease the \n\nadministrative redundancy inherent in the WIA regulations. The \n\nDepartment will no longer designate grantees or require a notice of \n\nintent. Moreover, the proposed WIOA regulations have incorporated the \n\n4-year plan into the competitive grant award process. The Department \n\nanticipates that these changes will help streamline the process for \n\nawarding grants. These proposed changes should result in less of an \n\nadministrative burden on both applicants and the Department.\n\n    Additionally, although WIA had a 2-year grant cycle for grantees \n\n\n\nunder sec. 166, WIOA has established a 4-year grant cycle (WIOA secs. \n\n166(c) and 166(e)). Consequently, all references to the grant cycle or \n\nplan in the proposed WIOA regulations refer to a 4-year cycle or 4-year \n\nplan.\n\n    Finally, to ensure that the terms used to discuss the populations \n\nand entities that will be served, as described in sec. 166(d) of WIOA, \n\nare consistent throughout the proposed regulation, the Department \n\nproposes to define the term ``INA'' to mean American Indian, Native \n\nAmerican, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian in proposed Sec.  684.130. \n\nThis term provides an efficient way to ensure inclusivity and \n\nconsistency in this part.\n\n2. Subpart A--Purposes and Policies\n\nSection 684.100 What is the purpose of the programs established to \n\nserve Indians and Native Americans under the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.100 describes the purpose of WIOA for the INA \n\nprograms authorized by WIOA sec. 166.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.100(a) retains the same requirements found in \n\nthe WIA regulations at 20 CFR 684.100(a) except that Sec.  \n\n684.100(a)(2) includes entrepreneurial skills as part of the purpose of \n\nthe program in order to implement and carry out the entrepreneurial \n\nskills requirement in sec. 166(a)(1)(B) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.100(b) describes the principle means of \n\naccomplishing the purpose described in Sec.  684.100. Because the \n\nDepartment has determined that no substantial changes were necessary to \n\nimplement WIOA, the proposed regulation retains the same requirements \n\nfound in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.100(b) with the exception \n\nthat it references the principles of the Indian Self-Determination and \n\nEducation Assistance Act (ISDEAA). This reference to the principles of \n\nthe ISDEAA directly aligns with sec. 166(a)(2) of WIOA.\n\n[[Page 20759]]\n\nSection 684.110 How must Indian and Native American programs be \n\nadministered?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.110(a) describes how the Department will \n\nadminister the INA program. Because no changes were necessary to this \n\nsection to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements as the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.120.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.110(b) states that the Department will follow \n\nthe Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-\n\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), at 25 U.S.C. 450a, \n\n\n\nas well as the Department of Labor's American Indian and Alaska Native \n\npolicies in administering these programs. These policies include DOL's \n\n``American Indian and Alaska Native Policy,'' dated July 29, 1998 and \n\nthe ``Tribal Consultation Policy'' published in the Federal Register on \n\nDecember 4, 2012 (77 FR 71833). This is consistent with WIOA because \n\nWIOA sec. 166(a)(2) incorporates the principles of the ISDEAA and the \n\nother two policies are important works of guidance on consultation and \n\ncoordination with INA parties.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.110(c) and (d) describe the trust \n\nresponsibilities of the Federal government and the designation of the \n\nDivision of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within ETA. \n\nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \n\nthese regulations to implement WIOA, these proposed regulations retain \n\nthe same requirements at 20 CFR 668.120(c) and (d).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  668.120(e) describes the establishment of \n\nadministrative procedures of the INA programs. 20 CFR 668.120(e) \n\nrequired that the Department utilize staff with a particular competence \n\nin this field for administration of the program. Although the \n\nDepartment is still committed to the utilization of competent staff, \n\nthe proposed regulation does not retain this requirement as this \n\nlanguage was not included in WIOA. The rest of the proposed regulation \n\nretains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.120(e) because the \n\nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to implement \n\nWIOA.\n\nSection 684.120 What obligation does the Department have to consult \n\nwith the Indian and Native American grantee community in developing \n\nrules, regulations, and standards of accountability for Indian and \n\nNative American programs?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.120 describes the obligation the Department has \n\nin consulting with the INA grantee community in developing rules, \n\nregulations, and standards of accountability for INA programs. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 668.130, except that it adds new language \n\nreferencing the Department's tribal consultation policy, which was \n\npublished in the Federal Register on December 4, 2012, and Executive \n\nOrder (E.O.) 13175 of November 6, 2000, which requires Federal agencies \n\nto engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with \n\ntribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have \n\ntribal implications and are responsible for strengthening the \n\ngovernment-to-government relationship between the United States and \n\nIndian tribes. Section 166(i)(2) of WIOA states that the Secretary must \n\nconsult with Indian tribes, tribal organizations, Alaska Native \n\nentities, Indian-controlled organizations serving Indians, and Native \n\n\n\nHawaiian organizations in establishing regulations to carry out WIOA \n\nsec. 166 and develop a funding distribution plan for the INA program. \n\nIn addition, sec. 166(i)(4)(A) of WIOA states that the Secretary must \n\nestablish a Native American Employment and Training Council to \n\nfacilitate consultation and provide advice on the operation and \n\nadministration of the WIOA INA programs, including the selection of the \n\nindividual appointed as the head of DINAP. While it is not specified in \n\nWIOA, by referencing the tribal consultation policy in this proposed \n\nsection, the Department proposes that the consultation requirements \n\nreferenced in WIOA must be coordinated with the Department's tribal \n\nconsultation policy published in the Federal Register on December 4, \n\n2012 and E.O. 13175 of November 6, 2000. However, the Department notes \n\nthat although these consultation policies must be coordinated, they are \n\nalso separate. The Native American Employment and Training Council \n\nrepresents all of the INA grantee community but it does not necessarily \n\nserve as the primary vehicle through which the Federal government \n\nfulfills its obligation to consult with tribes.\n\nSection 684.130 What definitions apply to terms used in the regulations \n\nin this part?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.130 provides definitions to terms used in \n\nproposed part 684 that have not been defined in secs. 3 or 166 of WIOA \n\nor Sec.  675.300 of these proposed regulations. Because the Department \n\nhas determined that no changes were necessary to the definitions used \n\nin 20 CFR 668.150, we have retained those definitions as included in \n\nthe WIA regulations without change. These include the definitions for \n\nthe terms ``DINAP,'' ``Governing body,'' ``Grant Officer,'' and \n\n``Underemployed.'' The Department has not retained the term ``NEW'' \n\nbecause it is not used in this proposed subpart. However, to provide \n\nadditional clarity in these proposed regulations, the Department has \n\nincluded definitions for nine additional terms.\n\n    Alaska Native-Controlled Organization--This definition clarifies \n\nthat an entity applying for WIOA sec. 166 funds as an Alaska Native-\n\nControlled Organization must have a governing board in which 51 percent \n\nof the members are Alaska Natives, to ensure that entities that receive \n\nWIOA sec. 166 funds as an Alaska Native-Controlled Organization are \n\ncomprised of representatives from the communities they serve.\n\n    Carry-In--The Department is providing a definition of carry-in to \n\nclarify our process at Sec.  684.254(d) for reallocating funds unspent \n\nat the end of a PY. This definition is consistent with current practice \n\nand the process for reallocating funds is explained in more detail in \n\nthe preamble for Sec.  684.270(d).\n\n    High-Poverty Area--A definition of ``high-poverty area'' has been \n\nincluded to reflect the inclusion of the phrase in WIOA. Section \n\n\n\n129(a)(2) of WIOA provides a special rule for the youth program that \n\nincludes the term ``high-poverty area'' but does not define that term. \n\nThis proposed part references sec. 129 of WIOA in implementing the \n\nyouth INA program. Therefore the Department proposes to provide a \n\ndefinition for high-poverty area in these regulations. The Department \n\nhas chosen to employ the American Community Survey 5-Year Data because \n\nit is the only source data that uniformly collects the income level of \n\nindividuals across all geographic service areas in the United States.\n\n    Incumbent Grantee--This term is used in several places in the \n\nregulations including the regulations that define which entities are \n\neligible to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant. Therefore the Department \n\nis providing a definition to\n\n[[Page 20760]]\n\nmake clear which entities are considered incumbent grantees as referred \n\nto in the regulations.\n\n    INA--Throughout proposed part 684, the Department refers to \n\nAmerican Indians, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native \n\nHawaiians. To ensure consistency and inclusiveness the Department \n\ndecided to use a single term, INA, when referencing all four groups.\n\n    Indian-Controlled Organization--This definition clarifies the \n\nqualifications for an organization to be an Indian-Controlled \n\nOrganization and is intended to ensure that entities that receive WIOA \n\nsec. 166 funds as Indian-controlled entities are comprised of \n\nrepresentatives from the communities they serve.\n\n    Native Hawaiian-Controlled Organization--This definition clarifies \n\nthat an entity applying for WIOA sec. 166 funds as a Native Hawaiian-\n\ncontrolled organization must have a governing board in which 51 percent \n\nof the members are Native Hawaiians. The purpose is to ensure that \n\nentities that receive WIOA sec. 166 funds as a Native Hawaiian entity \n\nare comprised of representatives from the communities they serve.\n\n    Total Funds Available--This term is used in the definition of \n\ncarry-in. The Department is providing a definition to clarify what is \n\nmeant by total funds available as it affects the amount of carry-in a \n\ngrantee may have and whether such carry-in is considered excessive. \n\nAvailable funds do not include carry-in funds. This definition is \n\nconsistent with current practice and the process for reallocating funds \n\nis explained in more detail in the preamble for Sec.  684.270(d).\n\n3. Subpart B--Service Delivery Systems Applicable to Section 166 \n\nPrograms\n\nSection 684.200 What are the requirements to apply for a Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.200(a)(1) establishes the eligibility \n\nrequirements to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant. Because the Department \n\nhas determined that no changes were necessary to this section to \n\nimplement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nfound at the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.200(a)(1), except that we \n\nhave required that all members of a consortium must be one of the \n\nlisted entities to insure the input, authority, and autonomy of the INA \n\nentities listed in sec. 166(c) of WIOA. To be eligible, entities must \n\nalso meet the requirements of Sec.  684.200(c); Sec.  684.200(a) just \n\nprovides further detail about the legal shape eligible entities might \n\ntake. For example, the application for a tribe might be submitted by \n\nthe tribal government. Additionally, a non-profit might be an Indian-\n\ncontrolled organization.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.200(a)(2) describes a $100,000 minimum funding \n\naward amount that is required in order to receive a WIOA sec. 166 \n\ngrant. There is an exception for INA grantees participating in the \n\ndemonstration program under Public Law 102-477; under this exception, \n\nif all resources to be consolidated under Public Law 102-477 total \n\n$100,000, only $20,000 must be derived from sec. 166 funds. Under \n\nproposed Sec.  684.200(a)(2), there is no exception to the requirement \n\nthat at least $20,000 of all resources to be consolidated under Public \n\nLaw 102-477 must be derived from WIOA sec. 166 funds. Awards for less \n\nthan $20,000 do not provide sufficient funds to effectively operate an \n\nemployment and training grant. Therefore, under WIOA, all sec. 166 \n\nfunding awards must be equal to or greater than $20,000 in order to \n\napply for a grant under Public Law 102-477 except for incumbent Public \n\nLaw 102-477 grantees that are receiving WIA funding as of the date of \n\nimplementation of WIOA. These grantees will be grandfathered into the \n\nprogram because the advantage of requiring these grantees to meet the \n\n$20,000 minimum does not outweigh the advantages of allowing these \n\ngrantees to continue with programs that have already been approved.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  668.200(b) describes the types of entities that may \n\nmake up a consortium. The proposed section requires that each member of \n\na consortium meets the requirements. To ensure that all INA grantees \n\nsufficiently represent the interests of the INA community, the \n\nDepartment has decided to require that every member of a consortium \n\nmust meet the requirements at proposed Sec.  668.200(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.200(b)(1) through (3) describe the requirements \n\nfor entities to apply for WIOA sec. 166 funds as a consortium. Because \n\nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this \n\nsection to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 668.200(b)(1) through (3).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.200(c) describes the entities that are \n\n\n\npotentially eligible to receive WIOA sec. 166 funds. Because the \n\nDepartment has determined that no changes were necessary to this \n\nsection to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 668.200(c).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.200(d) explains that State-recognized tribal \n\norganizations will be considered to be ``Indian-controlled'' \n\norganizations for WIOA sec. 166 purposes, assuming they meet the \n\ndefinition of an Indian-controlled organization as defined at Sec.  \n\n684.130. The proposed section also states that State-recognized tribes \n\nthat do not meet this definition but are grantees under WIA will be \n\ngrandfathered into WIOA as Indian-controlled organizations. State-\n\nrecognized tribal organizations that meet the definition of an Indian-\n\ncontrolled organization can apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant because \n\nthey otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for an Indian-\n\ncontrolled organization, which ensures that they are comprised of \n\nrepresentatives of the community they serve. State-recognized tribes \n\nthat are grantees under WIA may be grandfathered in because allowing \n\ngrantees that have successfully provided services to continue providing \n\nthose services is consistent with the objectives of WIOA sec. 166.\n\nSection 684.210 What priority for awarding grants is given to eligible \n\norganizations?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.210(a) states that Federally-recognized Indian \n\ntribes, Alaska Native entities, or a consortium of such entities will \n\nhave the highest priority to receive grants for those geographic \n\nservice areas in which the Indian Tribe, Alaska Native entity, or a \n\nconsortium of such entities has legal jurisdiction, such as an Indian \n\nreservation, Oklahoma Tribal Service Area (OTSA) or Alaska Native \n\nVillage Service Area (ANVSA). The Department recognizes that Federally-\n\nrecognized tribes are sovereign governments that often have reservation \n\nareas over which they have legal jurisdiction. Accordingly, consistent \n\nwith current practice, it is the Department's position that when a \n\ntribe has legal jurisdiction over a geographic service area such as an \n\nIndian reservation or OTSA, the Department will award sec. 166 grants \n\nto serve such areas to that tribe if it meets the requirements for \n\nreceiving a grant.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.210(b) states that if the Department decides not \n\nto make an award to an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity that has \n\nlegal jurisdiction over a service area--for example if a Federally-\n\nrecognized tribe is not eligible to apply for a WIOA grant or does not \n\nhave the ability to administer Federal funds--the Department will \n\nconsult with that tribe or Alaska Native entity before selecting an \n\n\n\nentity to serve the tribe's legal jurisdictional area. As described in \n\nthe preamble to Sec.  684.120,\n\n[[Page 20761]]\n\nconsultation with tribes and Alaska Native entities about the service \n\nareas over which they have legal jurisdiction is integral to the \n\nprinciples of Indian self-determination. However, to ensure that the \n\nINA individuals residing in this service area receive services, Sec.  \n\n684.210(b) does not require prior approval of the entity with legal \n\njurisdiction.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.210(c) clarifies that the priority described in \n\nparagraphs (a) and (b) does not apply to service areas outside the \n\nlegal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity. The \n\nDepartment does not believe that the same priority is warranted outside \n\nthe legal jurisdiction of Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities.\n\nSection 684.220 What is the process for applying for a Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.220(a) describes when the competitive grant \n\napplication process takes place. The process described aligns this \n\nproposed section with the requirements at secs. 166(c) and (e) of WIOA \n\nand with the streamlining of the application process, which is \n\ndiscussed in further detail in the introduction to this proposed part.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.220(b) provides clarification on which \n\napplicants are required to submit a 4-year plan, as described at \n\nproposed Sec.  684.710. The Department has decided to exclude entities \n\nthat have been granted approval to transfer their WIOA funds pursuant \n\nto Public Law 102-477 from this requirement because the intent of \n\nPublic Law 102-477 is to allow Federally-recognized tribes and Alaska \n\nNative entities to combine formula-funded Federal grant funds, which \n\nare employment and training-related, into a single plan with a single \n\nbudget and a single reporting system.\n\nSection 684.230 What appeal rights are available to entities that are \n\ndenied a grant award?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.230 describes the appeal rights for entities \n\nthat are denied a grant award in whole or in part. There is no appeal \n\nprocess specifically for sec. 166 grants; however, the Department \n\nproposes to follow the appeal process described at proposed Sec. Sec.  \n\n683.800 and 683.840, which allow entities that are denied a grant award \n\nan opportunity to appeal the denial to the Office of the Administrative \n\nLaw Judges. Because the Department has determined that no changes were \n\nnecessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.270.\n\nSection 684.240 Are there any other ways in which an entity may be \n\n\n\nawarded a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.240 describes other ways in which an entity may \n\nbe granted an award under this proposed subpart if areas would \n\notherwise go unserved.\n\nSection 684.250 Can an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award \n\nbe terminated?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.250(a) states that a grant award can be \n\nterminated for cause, or due to emergency circumstances under the \n\nSecretary's authority at sec. 184(e) of WIOA. This proposed section \n\nretains substantively the same requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 668.290(a). The Department notes that if a grant \n\nis terminated under sec. 184(e) of WIOA, the grantee must be given \n\nprompt notice and opportunity for a hearing within 30 days after the \n\ntermination.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.250(b) describes the circumstances under which \n\nan award may be terminated for cause. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 \n\nCFR 668.290(b).\n\nSection 684.260 Does the Department have to award a grant for every \n\npart of the country?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.260 states that the Department is not required \n\nto provide grant funds to every part of the country. This proposed \n\nsection retains similar requirements in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n668.294, with the exception that the Department clarified that funds \n\nnot allocated to a service area will be distributed to existing INA \n\ngrantees consistent with current practice.\n\nSection 684.270 How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds \n\nallocated to Indian and Native American program grantees?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684. 270(a) through (c) describe how funds will be \n\nallocated to INA grantees. Because the Department has determined that \n\nno substantial changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 \n\nCFR 668.296.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684. 270(d) states that the Department may \n\nreallocate funds under certain circumstances. This language clarifies \n\nthat excess carry-in will result in the funding formula being adjusted \n\nin future years to reflect the excess. Additionally, there is no \n\nexception for carry-in amounts in excess of 20 percent because these \n\nfunds must be fully expended.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.270(e) describes the funding resources the \n\nDepartment may draw on for TAT purposes. The proposed paragraph \n\n\n\nclarifies that the 1 percent of funding reserved under this section is \n\nnot the only source funding for providing TAT for the INA program \n\ngrantees. This language is consistent with current practice and is \n\nintended to make clear that INA program grantees may also access \n\nresources available to other Department programs as needed.\n\n4. Subpart C--Services to Customers\n\nSection 684.300 Who is eligible to receive services under the Indian \n\nand Native American program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.300(a) describes who is eligible to receive \n\nservices under an INA program. Because the Department has determined \n\nthat no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n668.300(a), with the exception that the language in Sec.  684.300(a)(2) \n\nreferences the definition of Alaska Native in sec. 166(b)(1) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a)(1) leaves the definition of ``Indian'' to \n\nthe tribes and local American Indian organizations that receive grant \n\nfunds to determine, since WIOA does not define who is eligible to \n\nreceive services under sec. 166, and there are different opinions on \n\nwho is considered an Indian when determining eligibility for employment \n\nand training services. For instance some grantees consider members of \n\nState-recognized tribes as eligible individuals while other grantees do \n\nnot. Therefore, the Department has left the decision of defining who is \n\nan Indian to tribes and organizations at the local level. However, the \n\nDepartment requires that a grantee's definition must at least include \n\nanyone who is a member of a Federally-recognized tribe.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.300(b) and (c) describe additional eligibility \n\nrequirements for participants to receive services from the INA program. \n\nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \n\nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the \n\nsame requirements in the WIA regulations found at 20 CFR 668.300(b).\n\nSection 684.310 What are Indian and Native American program grantee \n\nallowable activities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(a) describes what types of opportunities INA \n\nprogram grantees must attempt to develop and provide. This section \n\nincorporates the\n\n[[Page 20762]]\n\nbroad objectives referenced in sec. 194(1) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(b) further defines the employment and \n\ntraining services that are allowable under sec. 166 of WIOA. Because \n\nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to this \n\nsection to implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 668.340(a).\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(c) references a non-exhaustive list of \n\ncareer services listed in WIOA. This language reflects WIOA's unified \n\napproach to the provision of services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(d) defines follow-up services. The \n\nDepartment chose to define follow-up services as including counseling \n\nand supportive services for up to 12 months after the date of exit for \n\nconsistency with current practice. Unlike the follow-up services \n\navailable under sec. 134 of WIOA, the follow-up services available \n\nunder Sec.  684.310 are available for up to 12 months because of the \n\nlimited employment opportunities available to participants in the sec. \n\n166 program.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(e) references the non-exhaustive list of \n\ntraining services available at WIOA sec. 134(c)(3). The Department has \n\nreferenced sec. 134(c)(3) because this section includes good examples \n\nof services that are allowable activities for INA program grantees.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(f) lists examples of allowable activities \n\nspecifically designed for youth. The Department references the program \n\nrequirements for the WIOA youth program because these activities serve \n\nas good examples of allowable activities for INA programs targeting INA \n\nyouth.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(g) provides examples of allowable activities \n\nfor job development and employment outreach. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements found in the \n\nWIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.340(f).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(h) describes whether services can be \n\noverlapping and/or sequential. Because the Department has determined \n\nthat no changes were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n668.340(g).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.310(i) states that services may be provided to a \n\nparticipant in any sequence based on the particular needs of the \n\nparticipant. This clarification is consistent with the description of \n\ncareer services in proposed Sec.  678.425(b), which states that \n\nservices are provided to individuals based on individual needs, \n\nincluding the seamless delivery of multiple services to individual \n\ncustomers. There is no required sequence of services. Section \n\n134(c)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA similarly clarifies that an individual is not \n\nrequired to receive career services prior to receiving training \n\nservices.\n\nSection 684.320 Are there any restrictions on allowable activities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.320(a) and (b) describe geographical \n\nrestrictions on training activities and restrictions on OJT services. \n\n\n\nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \n\nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the \n\nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 668.350(a) and (b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.320(c) prohibits OJT where an employer has \n\nexhibited a pattern of certain conduct. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no substantial changes were necessary to these section \n\nto implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 668.350(c). However, to align Sec.  684.320(c) with the \n\nlanguage found at sec. 194(4) of WIOA, the phrase ``including health \n\nbenefits'' has been included in Sec.  684.320(c)(1), and Sec.  \n\n684.320(c)(2) targets patterns of violation instead of single \n\nviolations.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.320(d) through (g) describe restrictions on the \n\nuse of INA grant funds. Because the Department has determined that no \n\nchanges were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these \n\nproposed sections retain the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n668.350(d) through (g), with citations and references updated to be \n\nconsistent with WIOA.\n\nSection 684.330 What is the role of Indian and Native American grantees \n\nin the one-stop system?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.330(a) describes the required collaboration \n\nbetween INA grantees and the one-stop system. The Department recognizes \n\nthat there are areas in the U.S. where the Native American population \n\nis so sparse that it is not practical for WIOA grantees to be actively \n\ninvolved in the local one-stop system. Accordingly, WIOA only requires \n\ngrantees to be involved in those local workforce investment areas where \n\nan INA grantee conducts field operations or provides substantial \n\nservices. In these areas, the INA grantee must execute an MOU with the \n\nLocal Board or, at a minimum, be able to demonstrate that it has made a \n\ngood faith effort to enter into such agreement. Regardless of how \n\nsparse the Native American community is in an area, and regardless of \n\nan executed MOU, it is expected that, at a minimum, both the INA \n\ngrantee and the local one-stop operator are familiar with each other's \n\nservices and that information is available at each other's location, \n\nand referrals, coordination, and co-enrollment are encouraged. INA \n\ngrantees will be required to provide details of their relationship with \n\nthe local one-stop operators as part of the 4-year plan.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.330(b) describes the minimum provisions \n\nnecessary in an MOU between the INA grantee and a local one-stop \n\ndelivery system. Proposed paragraph (b) lists information required \n\nunder WIOA sec. 121(c) and includes additional requirements that \n\nimplement current policy.\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.330(c) describes when an INA grantee is required \n\nto describe its efforts to negotiate a MOU. This information is \n\nnecessary for determining why the INA grantee has not been able to \n\nnegotiate an MOU and for alerting the Department about what steps might \n\nbe taken to facilitate the negotiation of an MOU.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.330(d) describes the application of the one-stop \n\ninfrastructure in the context of INA programs. Proposed paragraph (d) \n\nimplements the statutory requirements found at WIOA sec. \n\n121(h)(2)(D)(iv).\n\nSection 684.340 What policies govern payments to participants, \n\nincluding wages, training allowances or stipends, or direct payments \n\nfor supportive services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.340(a) through (e) describe the policies that \n\ngovern payments to participants. Because the Department has determined \n\nthat no changes are necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, \n\nthese proposed sections retain the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n668.370.\n\nSection 684.350 What will the Department do to strengthen the capacity \n\nof Indnian and Native American grantees to deliver effective services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.350 describes what the Department will do to \n\nstrengthen the capacity of INA program grantees to deliver effective \n\nservices. This proposed section retains the same commitment to provide \n\nnecessary technical assistance and training to INA program grantees as \n\nfound in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.380.\n\n[[Page 20763]]\n\n5. Subpart D--Supplemental Youth Services\n\nSection 684.400 What is the purpose of the supplemental youth services \n\nprogram?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.400 describes the purpose of the supplemental \n\nyouth services program.\n\n    Because the Department has determined that no substantial changes \n\nwere necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 668.400.\n\nSection 684.410 What entities are eligible to receive supplemental \n\nyouth services funding?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.410 describes the entities that are eligible to \n\nreceive supplemental youth services funding. The amount of funding \n\nreserved for the supplemental program makes it impractical to fund all \n\nservice areas in the United States. Therefore the Department proposes \n\nto limit funding awards to eligible entities that serve low-income \n\nyouth residing on or near their respective reservations, OTSAs or \n\n\n\nANVSAs or other legal jurisdictional areas, or to eligible \n\norganizations that are providing services on behalf of entities with \n\nlegal jurisdiction.\n\nSection 684.420 What are the planning requirements for receiving \n\nsupplemental youth services funding?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.420 describes the planning requirements for \n\nreceiving supplemental youth services funding. Because youth funding is \n\nconsidered a supplement to the adult funding, the Department envisions \n\nthat the strategy for youth will not be extensive. This proposed \n\nsection also aligns the planning requirements for the youth \n\nsupplemental services with the streamlined application process, which \n\nis described in more detail in the introduction to this part.\n\n    Finally, the Department also recognizes that awareness of one's \n\nculture and history is important to having a healthy self-identity and \n\nself-esteem. Therefore, the Department supports youth activities that \n\nteach INA to incorporate culture and traditional values since it is not \n\nfully explored in the public school system and because it plays a role \n\nin transitioning INA youth to become successful adults.\n\nSection 684.430 What individuals are eligible to receive supplemental \n\nyouth services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.430(a)(1) through (3) provide the eligibility \n\nrequirements for individuals to receive supplemental youth services. \n\nIndividuals must be low-income, except that 5 percent of individuals \n\nenrolled in a grantee's youth program during a PY need not meet the \n\ndefinition of low-income. Individuals included under this 5 percent \n\nexception do not need to meet any requirements other than those listed \n\nunder proposed Sec.  684.430(a)(1) and (2) because the Department \n\nrecognizes that the funding amounts for the majority of INA program \n\ngrantees are so small (and therefore the number of youth served are \n\nalso so small) that the number of youth served under the 5 percent \n\nexception is numerically insignificant and that the effort and cost of \n\ncollecting information on the additional barriers is not justified. \n\nFurthermore, the poverty level on or near Indian reservations (which \n\nare the areas to be served with youth funds) is so high that the vast \n\nmajority of youth served under WIA met the low-income requirement and \n\nthose that do not are only slightly over the poverty level.\n\n    Additionally, the INA youth program differs significantly from the \n\nState youth formula program in that it does not distinguish between \n\n``in-school'' youth and ``out-of-school'' youth and there are no \n\npercentage requirements for ISY and OSY as required by the State youth \n\nformula program. The Department recognizes that given the small funding \n\namount for the INA youth program, most INA grantees are primarily \n\n\n\nlimited to operating summer employment programs for ISY. However, the \n\nDepartment encourages the few grantees that receive significant amounts \n\nof youth funding to provide year-round youth programs and incorporate \n\neducational and training components in their youth program.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.430(b) provides additional information about the \n\ndefinition of ``low-income.'' This proposed section helps implement and \n\ncarry out the definition of low-income provided in WIOA sec. 129(a)(2).\n\nSection 684.440 How is funding for supplemental youth services \n\ndetermined?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.440(a) specifies how funding will be allocated. \n\nBecause the Department has determined that WIOA did not require any \n\nsubstantive changes to 20 CFR 668.440(a), we have retained the same \n\nessential requirements. Although this proposed section specifies that \n\nthe Department will allocate youth funding based on the number of youth \n\nin poverty, the inclusion of the term ``in poverty'' merely implements \n\ncurrent practices and does not change our requirements.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.440(b) through (e) describe what data the \n\nDepartment will use in calculating the youth funding allocation, how \n\nthe hold harmless factor described in Sec.  684.270(c) will apply, how \n\nthe reallocation provisions apply, and how supplemental youth services \n\nfunds not allotted may be used. Because the Department has determined \n\nthat no substantial changes were necessary to these sections to \n\nimplement WIOA, these proposed sections retains the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 668.350(b) through (e).\n\nSection 684.450 How will supplemental youth services be provided?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.450(a) through (c) describe how supplemental \n\nyouth services will be provided. Because the Department has determined \n\nthat no substantial changes were necessary to these sections to \n\nimplement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 668.450(a) through (c).\n\nSection 684.460 What performance measures are applicable to the \n\nsupplemental youth services program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.460(a) describes the performance measures and \n\nstandards applicable to the supplemental youth services program. These \n\nmeasures and standards of performance are the same as the primary \n\nindicators discussed in proposed Sec.  677.155. Though the indicators \n\nof performance are identified in various places throughout the WIOA \n\nproposed regulations, the indicators are the same and do not vary \n\nacross the regulations. Section 166(e)(5) of WIOA specifies that \n\nperformance indicators for the Native American program ``shall'' \n\n\n\ninclude the primary indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. \n\n116(b)(2)(A). Consequently, the Department has listed the youth \n\nperformance indicators at WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) to implement and \n\ncarry out statutory requirements.\n\n    The Department acknowledges that some of the performance indicators \n\nfor youth programs are targeted to capture data related to participants \n\nwho are either in their senior year of high school or are no longer a \n\nhigh school student (Sec.  684.460(a)(1) and (2)). Because of limited \n\nfunding, many of the INA youth programs are summer employment programs \n\nserving younger high school students, these performance indicators \n\nmight not accurately capture the success of such programs.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.460(b) describes the Secretary's role in the \n\ncreation of additional performance measures to the ones listed in Sec.  \n\n684.460(a). Section\n\n[[Page 20764]]\n\n684.460 implements the statutory language in WIOA sec. 166(h)(2).\n\n6. Subpart E--Services to Communities\n\nSection 684.500 What services may Indian and Native American program \n\ngrantees provide to or for employers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.500(a) and (b) describe other services that INA \n\nprogram grantees may provide to or for employers under sec. 166. \n\nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \n\nthese sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the \n\nsame requirements as 20 CFR 668.500.\n\nSection 684.510 What services may Indian and Native American program \n\ngrantees provide to the community at large?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.510(a) and (b) describe services that INA \n\nprogram grantees may provide to INA communities. Because the Department \n\nhas determined that no changes were necessary to these sections to \n\nimplement WIOA, these proposed sections retain the same requirements at \n\n20 CFR 668.510(a) and (b).\n\nSection 684.520 Must Indian and Native American program grantees give \n\npreference to Indian and Native American entities in the selection of \n\ncontractors or service providers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.520 discusses the requirement to give preference \n\nto Indian/Native American entities in the selection of contractors or \n\nservice providers. Because the Department has determined that no \n\nchanges were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.520.\n\nSection 684.530 What rules govern the issuance of contracts and/or \n\nsubgrants?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.530 describes the rules that govern the issuance \n\nof contracts and/or subgrants. In general, INA program grantees must \n\nfollow the uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and \n\naudit requirements for Federal awards at 2 CFR part 200 subpart E \n\npublished in the Federal Register on December 26, 2013, except that \n\nthese rules do not apply to OJT contract awards. This section \n\nessentially retains the same language as provided under WIA at 20 CFR \n\n668.530, except that the references to OMB Circulars A-102, A-110 have \n\nbeen replaced with references to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E.\n\n7. Subpart F--Accountability for Services and Expenditures\n\nSection 684.600 To whom is the Indian and Native American program \n\ngrantee accountable for the provision of services and the expenditure \n\nof INA funds?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.600(a) and (b) describe who INA program grantees \n\nare accountable to for the provision of services and the expenditure of \n\nINA funds. Because the Department has determined that no changes were \n\nnecessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections \n\nretain the same requirements as 20 CFR 668.600.\n\nSection 684.610 How is this accountability documented and fulfilled?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.610(a) and (b) require INA program grantees to \n\nestablish internal policies and procedures to ensure accountability to \n\nits governing body and describe how accountability to the Department is \n\naccomplished. Because the Department has determined that no changes \n\nwere necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed \n\nsections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.610(a) and (b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.610(c) describes how accountability to the \n\nDepartment is documented and fulfilled. The Department proposes to \n\nrequire compliance with the reporting items listed in Sec.  684.610(c) \n\nbecause these are the best ways to ensure accountability and they \n\ncomply with our current practices.\n\nSection 684.620 What performance measures are in place for the Indian \n\nand Native American program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.620(a) describes the performance measures that \n\nare required under WIOA for the INA program. These measures of \n\nperformance are the same as the primary indicators discussed in \n\nproposed Sec.  677.155. Though the indicators of performance are \n\nidentified in various places throughout the WIOA proposed regulations, \n\nthe indicators are the same and do not vary across the regulations. \n\nSection 166(e)(5) of WIOA specifies that performance indicators for the \n\nNative American program ``shall'' include the primary indicators of \n\nperformance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A). Proposed Sec.  \n\n684.620(a) lists the applicable performance indicators described in \n\nWIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), thus implementing and carrying out the \n\n\n\nstatutory requirements of sec. 166(e)(5) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.620(b) describes the Secretary's role in the \n\ncreation of additional performance measures to the ones listed in Sec.  \n\n684.620(a). Section 684.620 implements the statutory language in WIOA \n\nsec. 166(h)(2).\n\nSection 684.630 What are the requirements for preventing fraud and \n\nabuse?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.630(a) requires INA program grantees to \n\nestablish fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. This section \n\nimplements the language in WIOA sec. 184 to the INA program.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.630(b) and (c) include requirements related to \n\nconflicts of interest gifts. Because the Department has determined that \n\nno changes were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these \n\nproposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.630(b) and \n\n(c).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.630(d) describes certain restrictions on \n\nselecting family members as participants. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no substantial changes were necessary to this section \n\nto implement WIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nat 20 CFR 668.610(d), except that it clarifies our current practice of \n\ncounting all INA individuals in a community to determine if the \n\nexception is met.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.630(e) through (h) describe kickback, political \n\nactivities, lobbying, and embezzlement restrictions that apply to this \n\nsection. Because the Department has determined that no substantial \n\nchanges were necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these \n\nproposed sections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.630(e) \n\nthrough (h) with changes to update citations.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.630(i) prohibits discriminatory practices by \n\nrecipients of WIOA funds. This section clarifies for the benefit of \n\npotential applicants the effect of WIOA sec. 188 on the INA programs. \n\nThe language in this section also addresses a long-standing \n\nmisconception among INA grantees that individuals outside of a \n\ngrantee's geographic service area cannot be served without the consent \n\nof the grantee whose service area the individual resides. The \n\nDepartment recognizes that INA program grantees receive funding based \n\non specified geographic boundaries such as a county, reservation, \n\nAlaska Native village etc., and therefore we agree that grantees are \n\nnot required to serve individuals outside their geographic areas since \n\nanother grantee is receiving funding to serve such individuals. \n\nHowever, this\n\n[[Page 20765]]\n\n\n\ndoes not mean that grantees cannot serve individuals outside their \n\nspecified boundaries if they choose to do so.\n\nSection 684.640 What grievance systems must an Indian and Native \n\nAmerican program grantee provide?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.640 requires INA program grantees establish \n\ngrievance procedure. Because the Department has determined that no \n\nchanges were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.640.\n\nSection 684.650 Can Indian and Native American program grantees exclude \n\nsegments of the eligible population?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.650(a) and (b) inform INA program grantees \n\nwhether they can exclude segments of the eligible population. Because \n\nthe Department has determined that no changes were necessary to these \n\nsections to implement WIOA, this proposed sections retain the same \n\nrequirements at 20 CFR 668.650.\n\n8. Subpart G--Section 166 Planning/Funding Process\n\nSection 684.700 What is the process for submitting a 4-year plan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.700 describes the process for submitting a 4-\n\nyear plan, as required by sec. 166(e) of WIOA. Specific requirements \n\nfor the submission of a 4-year plan will be provided in a Funding \n\nOpportunity Announcement (FOA). This section facilitates the \n\nstreamlining of the application process as is described in detail in \n\nthe introduction of this part.\n\nSection 684.710 What information must be included in the 4-year plans \n\nas part of the competitive application?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.710 describes the information that must be \n\nincluded in the 4-year plan. The Department intends to seek economic \n\nand workforce responsive 4-year plans under WIOA. Under WIOA, the \n\nDepartment proposes that a plan contains only the four information \n\nrequirements set out in WIOA sec. 166(e), which will leave the \n\nDepartment flexibility to ask for different kinds of information in a \n\nrequest for additional information during the FOA process. The \n\nDepartment recognizes that the workforce system must be able to change \n\nand adapt to the changes required by employers who are, in turn, \n\nchanging and adapting to forces in the economy and advancements in \n\ntechnology which require different skill sets for American workers. \n\nThis new approach to planning will provide the flexibility necessary to \n\naddress the current workforce needs at the time plans are written.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.710(a) describes the information that must be \n\nincluded in the 4-year plan, required by WIOA secs. 166(e)(2) through \n\n(5).\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.710(b) states that the 4-year plan must include \n\na projection of participants to be served and expenditures during a PY \n\nand any additional information requested in a FOA. Again, this section \n\nhas been added under WIOA to convey that additional information will be \n\nrequired in the 4-year plan, as determined by current labor market \n\ntrends and skills requirements, and what information must be in plans \n\nwill be requested in a FOA as part of the competitive process.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.710(c) requires INA program grantees receiving \n\nsupplemental youth funds to provide additional information in the 4-\n\nyear plan that describes a strategy for serving low-income, INA youth. \n\nThe Department supports youth activities that preserve Native American \n\nculture and values. Because the Department has determined that no \n\nchanges were necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.720(b), with the \n\nexception that it is framed to reflect the streamlined application \n\nprocess described in more detail in the introduction to this part.\n\nSection 684.720 When must the 4-year plan be submitted?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.720 describes when the 4-year plan must be \n\nsubmitted. The due date for the submission of the 4-year plan will be \n\nspecified in the FOA. This approach implements and carries out the \n\nrequirements of WIOA secs. 166(c) and 166(e) in the context of the \n\nstreamlined application process that is described in more detail in the \n\nintroduction to this part. The Department envisions that the first 4-\n\nyear plan will be for PY 2016-2020 which will cover the period from \n\nJuly 1, 2016 through June 30, 2020.\n\nSection 684.730 How will the Department review and approve such plans?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.730 describes how the Department will review and \n\napprove 4-year plans. The Department will make every effort to approve \n\nplans that are fully complete prior to the beginning of the first PY of \n\nthe 4-year plan and funds will be obligated to grantees for that year \n\nthrough a grant award. After the first year of a 4 -year plan, funds \n\nwill automatically be added each year for the following 3 years through \n\na grant modification, assuming the grantee continues to be in good \n\nstanding with the Department.\n\n    Incomplete plans that do not fully meet the requirements provided \n\nin the FOA will not be approved. It is possible for entities to be \n\nselected through the competitive process and also have an incomplete \n\n\n\nplan. Therefore, after competitive grant selections have been made, the \n\nDINAP office may assist INA program grantees with incomplete plans on \n\ntasks such as submitting required documents and other unresolved issues \n\nthat render the 4-year plan incomplete. However, the Department may \n\ndelay funding to grantees until all issues with the 4-year plan have \n\nbeen resolved.\n\n    While it is unlikely that a grantee will fail to submit an \n\nacceptable 4-year plan, the Department will reallocate funds from an \n\nINA program grantee that fails to submit a 4-year plan to other \n\nincumbent INA program grantees that have an approved 4-year plan. The \n\nGrant Officer may also delay executing a grant agreement and obligating \n\nfunds to an entity selected through the competitive process until all \n\nthe required documents--including the 4-year plan--are in place.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.730(a) states that it is the Department's intent \n\nto approve a grantee's 4-year strategic plan before the date on which \n\nfunds for the program become available. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary under WIOA, this section \n\nretains the same language as provided under WIA at 20 CFR 668.740(a), \n\nsave for the addition of language specifically addressing the \n\nstreamlined, 4-year grant application process as described in more \n\ndetail in the introduction to this part.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.730(b) describes the extent to which the DINAP \n\noffice will assist INA program grantees in resolving any outstanding \n\nissues that may exist with the 4-year plan. Again, while the Department \n\nexpects that it is unlikely that a grantee will fail to submit an \n\nacceptable 4-year plan, we need a mechanism to reallocate funds when \n\nsuch an event occurs in order to ensure that funds are spent providing \n\nservices to eligible program participants.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.730(c) notes that the Department may approve \n\nportions of a plan while disapproving others. Because the Department \n\nhas determined that no changes were necessary to implement WIOA, the \n\nproposed regulation retains the same requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 668.740(b).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.730(d) references appeal rights in nonselection \n\ncases or in the case of a decision by the Department to deny or \n\nreallocate funds based on unresolved issues with the applicant's\n\n[[Page 20766]]\n\napplication or 4-year plan. There are no appeal rights in addition to \n\nthe ones listed in the cited regulations because the Department has \n\ndetermined that consistency of appeal rights amongst WIOA programs is \n\n\n\ndesirable.\n\nSection 684.740 Under what circumstances can the Department or the \n\nIndian and Native American program grantee modify the terms of the \n\ngrantee's plan(s)?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.740(a) describes when the Department may \n\nunilaterally modify an INA program grantee's plan to add or reduce \n\nfunds to the grant. Because the Department has determined that no \n\nchanges were necessary to implement WIOA, the proposed regulation \n\nretains the same requirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n668.750(a).\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.740(b) describes when an INA program grantee may \n\nrequest approval to modify their plan to add, expand, delete, or \n\ndiminish any service allowable under the regulations in this part. \n\nBecause the Department has determined that no changes were necessary to \n\nimplement WIOA, the proposed regulation retains the same requirements \n\nfound in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 668.750(b). Generally, it is the \n\nDepartment's intent to pursue grant modifications only when there are \n\nsignificant increases or decreases in the grantee's funding that \n\nresults in significant changes in the employment and training services \n\nstated in the 4-year plan or when the grantee wishes to make a \n\nsignificant change in its service strategy. As a general rule, a \n\nsignificant change is when the number of participants to be served in \n\nthe original plan changes by 25 percent or by 25 actual participants, \n\nwhichever is larger.\n\n9. Subpart H--Administrative Requirements\n\nSection 684.800 What systems must an Indian and Native American program \n\ngrantee have in place to administer an Indian and Native American \n\nprogram?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.800(a) and (b) describe the systems that must be \n\nin place in order for INA grantees to administer a WIOA sec. 166 grant \n\nINA program. Because the Department has determined that no changes were \n\nnecessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed sections \n\nretain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.800.\n\nSection 684.810 What types of costs are allowable expenditures under \n\nthe Indian and Native American program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.810 describes where the rules relating to \n\nallowable costs under WIOA are located. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR \n\n668.810.\n\nSection 684.820 What rules apply to administrative costs under the \n\nIndian and Native American program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.820 describes where the definition and treatment \n\n\n\nof administrative costs can be found. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR \n\n668.820.\n\nSection 684.830 Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nadministrative cost limit for States and local areas apply to grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.830 informs INA program grantees about whether \n\nthe WIOA administrative cost limit for States and local areas applies \n\nto INA grants. Because the Department has determined that no changes \n\nwere necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.825.\n\nSection 684.840 How should Indian and Native American program grantees \n\nclassify costs?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.840 describes how INA program grantees must \n\nclassify costs. Because the Department has determined that no changes \n\nwere necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.830.\n\nSection 684.850 What cost principles apply to Indian and Native \n\nAmerican funds?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.850 requires INA program grantee to follow the \n\ncost principles at 2 CFR part 200 subpart E of the Uniform \n\nAdministrative Requirements published in the Federal Register on \n\nDecember 26, 2013. This section retains the same language as provided \n\nunder WIA at 20 CFR 668.840, except that the references to OMB \n\nCirculars A-87, A-122, A-21 have been updated with references to 2 CFR \n\npart 200 subpart E, Cost Principles, & Audit Requirements for Federal \n\nAwards.\n\nSection 684.860 What audit requirements apply to Indian and Native \n\nAmerican grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.860 requires INA program grantee to follow the \n\naudit requirements at 2 CFR 200 subpart F of the Uniform Administrative \n\nRequirements, Cost Principles, & Audit Requirements for Federal Awards \n\npublished in the Federal Register on December 26, 2013. This section \n\nretains the same language as provided under WIA at 20 CFR 668.850, \n\nexcept that the references to OMB Circular A-133 and 29 CFR part 99 \n\nhave been updated with references to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E, Cost \n\nPrinciples, & Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n\n    Additionally, Sec.  684.860(b) implements the language at WIOA sec. \n\n166(j) relating to single audit requirements.\n\nSection 684.870 What is ``program income'' and how is it regulated in \n\nthe Indian and Native American program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.870(a) through (c) provide descriptions of what \n\nqualifies as program income for work experience participants and OJT \n\n\n\nparticipants. Because the Department has determined that no changes \n\nwere necessary to these sections to implement WIOA, these proposed \n\nsections retain the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.870(a) through (c).\n\n10. Subpart I--Miscellaneous Program Provisions\n\nSection 684.900 Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nprovide regulatory and/or statutory waiver authority?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.900 describes the regulatory and/or statutory \n\nwaiver authority for the INA program. Because the Department has \n\ndetermined that no changes were necessary to this section to implement \n\nWIOA, this proposed section retains the same requirements at 20 CFR \n\n668.900, except that we have clarified, in accordance with WIOA sec. \n\n166(i)(3), that only requirements related to title I of WIOA may be \n\nwaived.\n\nSection 684.910 What information is required in a waiver request?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.910(a) describes what information an INA program \n\ngrantee must include when it requests a waiver. This section implements \n\nthe requirements in WIOA sec. 166(i)(3)(B) and saves INA grantees from \n\nhaving to reference additional departmental guidance on how to request \n\na waiver.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.910(b) states that a waiver may be requested at \n\nthe beginning of a 4-year grant award cycle or anytime during a 4-year \n\naward cycle. However, all waivers expire at the end of the 4-year award \n\ncycle. The Department envisions that waivers will be requested for \n\nunique situations that were not expected in the normal course of \n\noperating an INA grant. Therefore, Department proposes that waivers \n\ncannot be provided indefinitely and\n\n[[Page 20767]]\n\nmust be renewed at the beginning of a new 4-year grant cycle.\n\nSection 684.920 What provisions of law or regulations may not be \n\nwaived?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.920 describes the laws and regulations that may \n\nnot be waived. Because the Department has determined that no changes \n\nwere necessary to this section to implement WIOA, this proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements at 20 CFR 668.920.\n\nSection 684.930 May Indian and Native American grantees combine or \n\nconsolidate their employment and training funds?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.930 provides a description of when INA program \n\ngrantees can consolidate their funds under Public Law 102-477 (477). In \n\naddition to generally allowing the consolidation of funds as required \n\nunder Public Law 102-477, Sec.  684.930 describes the extent to which \n\nthe Department will review 477 plans. The Department will not review \n\n\n\nthe renewal of 477 plans after the initial plan has been approved by \n\nDOL, accepted by the Department of the Interior, and all other \n\napplicable Departmental programmatic and financial obligations have \n\nbeen met prior to transfer. This policy aligns with the requirements of \n\nPublic Law 102-477 which allows Federally-recognized tribes and Alaska \n\nNative entities to combine formula-funded Federal grant funds, which \n\nare employment and training-related, into a single plan with a single \n\nbudget and a single reporting system. The Department recognizes that \n\nwhen Federal funds from various agencies are combined under one unified \n\nplan, there must be one lead agency that administers and manages the \n\nunified plan. According to Public Law 102-477 the lead agency is the \n\nDOI.\n\nSection 684.940 What is the role of the Native American Employment and \n\nTraining Council?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.940 describes the role of the Native American \n\nEmployment and Training Council. The language in proposed Sec.  684.940 \n\nrepeats the requirements at WIOA sec. 166(i)(4)(C) and explains that \n\nWIOA sec. 166(4) has not made any major changes to the council.\n\nSection 684.950 Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nprovide any additional assistance to unique populations in Alaska and \n\nHawaii?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  684.950 address the additional assistance that WIOA \n\nprovides for unique populations in Alaska and Hawaii. This proposed \n\nsection implements and carries out the requirements in WIOA sec. \n\n166(k).\n\nI. Part 685--National Farmworker Jobs Program Under Title I of the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    The purpose of part 685 is to implement WIOA sec. 167, which \n\nauthorizes MSFW programs. In drafting these regulations, the Department \n\nconsulted with States and MSFW groups during stakeholder consultation \n\nsessions conducted in August and September 2014, as required by WIOA \n\nsec. 167(f). MSFW programs include career services and training, \n\nhousing assistance, youth services, and related assistance. In drafting \n\nthe proposed regulations for this part the Department seeks to \n\nencourage strategic alignment across other workforce development \n\nprograms such as Wagner-Peyser and WIOA title I adult, dislocated \n\nworker, and youth programs; encourage the delivery of training for in-\n\ndemand occupations; provide comprehensive youth workforce activities; \n\nand provide a detailed description of housing services available to \n\neligible MSFWs. As required by WIOA sec. 167(e), when making grants and \n\nentering into contracts under this section, the Department will consult \n\n\n\nwith the Governors and Local Boards of the States in which grantees \n\nwill carry out the activities described in WIOA sec. 167(d) during the \n\nFOA process described in Sec.  685.210.\n\n    The regulations in this section support strategic alignment across \n\nworkforce development programs by: Aligning the definition of \n\n``farmwork'' found in this section with that used in the Wagner-Peyser \n\nprogram; adjusting the upper and lower age ranges of eligible MSFW \n\nyouth to conform to those established in WIOA sec. 129 for OSY and ISY; \n\nand requiring that grantees coordinate services, particularly outreach \n\nto MSFWs, with the State Workforce Agency (SWA) in their service area \n\nand the State's monitor advocate. These changes are intended to support \n\ncoordination between MSFW programs and other workforce programs such as \n\nthe Wagner-Peyser program, and facilitate MSFW youth co-enrollments \n\nwith other WIOA title I programs.\n\n    The Department proposes language in Sec.  685.350 regarding \n\ntraining services that reinforces that training must be directly linked \n\nto an in-demand industry or occupation that leads to economic self-\n\nsufficiency and encourages the attainment of recognized post-secondary \n\ncredentials when appropriate.\n\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  685.330 and 685.510 establish that grantees \n\nfunded under WIOA sec. 167 can serve eligible MSFW youth participants. \n\nThe Department also has proposed that a percentage of the total funds \n\nappropriated each year for WIOA sec. 167 activities will be used for \n\nhousing grants, and described specific housing assistance activities in \n\nSec.  685.360, to better articulate the types of services that can be \n\ndelivered to eligible MSFWs.\n\n2. Subpart A--Purpose and Definitions\n\n    This subpart describes the general purpose and definitions relevant \n\nto MSFW programs authorized under WIOA sec. 167, the role of the \n\nDepartment in providing technical assistance and training to grantees, \n\nand the regulations applicable to grantees.\n\nSection 685.100 What is the purpose of the National Farmworker Jobs \n\nProgram and the other services and activities established under \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.100 identifies achieving economic self-\n\nsufficiency as the goal of the services and activities that are \n\nauthorized in WIOA sec. 167 for eligible MSFWs which includes their \n\ndependents. This section emphasizes the importance of obtaining, \n\nretaining, and stabilizing the unsubsidized employment of MSFWs, \n\nincluding obtaining upgraded agricultural employment, in achieving the \n\ngoal of the program.\n\nSection 685.110 What definitions apply to this program?\n\n\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.110 provides definitions of terms relevant to \n\nthe implementation and operation of workforce investment activities \n\nauthorized for MSFWs and their dependents under WIOA sec. 167.\n\n    A definition of allowances has been provided that means direct \n\npayments made to participants to support participation specific career \n\nservices and training.\n\n    Dependents of eligible MSFWs may receive services under WIOA secs. \n\n167(i)(2)(B) and 167(i)(3)(B), and the Department has provided a \n\ndefinition of the family member relationships of an eligible MSFW who \n\nqualify for MSFW program services.\n\n    Eligibility determination period is defined as ``any consecutive \n\n12-month period within the 24-month period immediately preceding the \n\ndate of application for the MSFW program by the applicant MSFW.'' The \n\ndefinition was adopted from the first clause of\n\n[[Page 20768]]\n\nWIOA sec. 167(i)(3)(A)(i), which defines ``eligible seasonal \n\nfarmworker.''\n\n    The definition of eligible migrant farmworker is taken from WIOA \n\nsec. 167(i)(2).\n\n    The definition of eligible seasonal farmworker is taken from WIOA \n\nsec. 167(i)(3).\n\n    A definition of eligible migrant and seasonal farmworker has been \n\nprovided, meaning an eligible migrant farmworker or an eligible \n\nseasonal farmworker as defined in WIOA sec. 167(i).\n\n    A definition of eligible MSFW youth has been provided, and it is \n\ndefined as eligible MSFWs aged 14-24 who are individually eligible or \n\nare dependents of eligible MSFWs. The upper age range (age 24) and \n\nlower age range (age 14) for eligible MSFW youth have been put in \n\nalignment with the upper and lower age ranges provided in WIOA secs. \n\n129 ((a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C). Eligible MSFW youth is a subset of \n\neligible MSFWs as defined in this section. This alignment will \n\nfacilitate co-enrollment with other WIOA youth programs that serve 14-\n\n24 year old youth participants, where appropriate.\n\n    A definition of emergency assistance had been provided that \n\nestablishes that emergency assistance is a form of related assistance, \n\nand means assistance that addresses immediate needs of eligible MSFWs \n\nand their dependents, provided by grantees. To facilitate the delivery \n\nof emergency services in a timely manner the applicant's self-\n\ncertification is accepted as sufficient documentation of eligibility \n\nfor emergency assistance.\n\n\n\n    A definition of family, is provided that means an eligible MSFW and \n\nall the individuals identified under the definition of dependent in \n\nthis section who are living together in one physical residence. The \n\ndefinition has been proposed for the purpose of reporting housing \n\nassistance grantee indicators of performance as described in Sec.  \n\n685.400.\n\n    A definition of farmwork is provided that means work while employed \n\nin the occupations described in 20 CFR 651.10. The specific occupations \n\nand industries within agricultural production and agricultural services \n\nwill be provided through Departmental guidance, and will be updated \n\nwhen government-wide standard industry and occupation codes undergo \n\nperiodic review and revision. Providing a definition of farmwork that \n\nis aligned with the Wagner-Peyser ES system will facilitate the \n\nprovision of services to MSFWs under both programs.\n\n    A definition of grantee has been provided, meaning an entity to \n\nwhich the Department directly awards a WIOA grant to carry out programs \n\nto serve eligible MSFWs in a service area, with funds made available \n\nunder WIOA sec. 167 or 127(a)(1).\n\n    A definition of housing assistance is provided and means housing-\n\nrelated services provided to eligible MSFWs. Examples of specific \n\nauthorized housing activities are provided in proposed Sec.  685.360.\n\n    The definition of lower living standard income level from WIOA sec. \n\n3(36)(B) has been referenced without change.\n\n    The definition of low-income individual from WIOA sec. 3(36)(A) has \n\nbeen referenced without change.\n\n    A definition of MOU has been provided, meaning ``Memorandum of \n\nUnderstanding.''\n\n    A definition of National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) has been \n\nprovided and is the Department-administered workforce investment \n\nprogram for MSFWs established by WIOA sec. 167 as a required partner of \n\nthe one-stop system and includes career services, training grants, and \n\nhousing grants. The term NFJP was initially developed in 1999 by the \n\nSecretary's MSFW Advisory Committee to distinguish the NFJP from the \n\nother workforce investment grants and activities funded under WIA sec. \n\n167, such as the farmworker housing assistance grants; however, since \n\nthat time the NFJP has come to be the accepted term for both employment \n\nand training grants and housing grants, and this definition reflects \n\nthat understanding.\n\n    The definition of recognized post-secondary credential from WIOA \n\nsec. 3(52) has been referenced without change.\n\n\n\n    A definition of related assistance, which is authorized under WIOA \n\nsec. 167(d), has been provided meaning short-term forms of direct \n\nassistance designed to assist eligible MSFWs retain or stabilize their \n\nagricultural employment.\n\n    A definition of self-certification has been provided meaning an \n\neligible MSFW's signed attestation that the information he/she submits \n\nto demonstrate eligibility for the NFJP is true and accurate.\n\n    A definition of service area has been provided meaning the \n\ngeographical jurisdiction, which may be comprised of one or more \n\ndesignated States or sub-State areas, in which a WIOA sec. 167 grantee \n\nis designated to operate.\n\n    A definition of technical assistance has been provided meaning the \n\nguidance provided to grantees and grantee staff by the Department to \n\nimprove the quality of the program and the delivery of program services \n\nto eligible MSFWs. This definition was adapted from and replaces the 20 \n\nCFR part 685 definition of capacity enhancement under WIA to reflect \n\nthe term more commonly used by the Department.\n\nSection 685.120 How does the Department administer the National \n\nFarmworker Jobs Program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.120 clarifies that the Department's ETA \n\nadministers NFJP activities authorized under WIOA sec. 167 for eligible \n\nMSFWs, and as described in Sec.  685.210, the Department designates \n\ngrantees in a manner consistent with standard Federal government \n\ncompetitive procedures.\n\nSection 685.130 How does the Department assist grantees to serve \n\neligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.130 establishes that the Department will provide \n\nguidance, administrative support, technical assistance, and training to \n\nsupport MSFW programs and promote employment outcomes for eligible \n\nMSFWs.\n\nSection 685.140 What regulations apply to the programs authorized under \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.140 specifies the regulations that are \n\napplicable to MSFW programs authorized under WIOA sec. 167, including \n\nproposed part 685. Applicable regulations include the general \n\nadministrative requirements found in 20 CFR part 683, including the \n\nregulations regarding the Complaints, Investigations and Hearings found \n\nat 20 CFR part 683, subpart D through subpart H; Uniform Guidance at 2 \n\nCFR part 200 and the Department's exceptions at 2 CFR part 2900 \n\npursuant to the effective dates in 2 CFR part 200 and 2 CFR part 2900; \n\n\n\nthe regulations on partnership responsibilities contained in 20 CFR \n\nparts 679 (Statewide and Local Governance) and 678 (the one-stop \n\nsystem); the Department's regulations at 29 CFR part 37, which \n\nimplement the nondiscrimination provisions of WIOA sec. 188.\n\n3. Subpart B--The Service Delivery System for the National Farmworker \n\nProgram\n\n    This subpart describes the service delivery system for the MSFW \n\nprograms authorized by WIOA sec. 167 including who is eligible to \n\nreceive grants and the role of the NFJP in the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem. Termination of grantee designation is explained. This subpart \n\nalso discusses the appropriation of WIOA sec. 167 funds and establishes\n\n[[Page 20769]]\n\nthat a percentage of the total funds appropriated each year for WIOA \n\nsec. 167 activities will be used for housing assistance grants.\n\nSection 685.200 Who is eligible to receive a National Farmworker Jobs \n\nProgram grant?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.200 describes the entities that are eligible to \n\nreceive NFJP grants. The entity must have an understanding of the \n\nproblems of eligible MSFWs, a familiarity with the agricultural \n\nindustries and the labor market needs of the proposed service area, and \n\nthe ability to demonstrate a capacity to administer and deliver \n\neffectively a diversified program of workforce investment activities, \n\nincluding youth workforce investment activities, and related assistance \n\nfor eligible MSFWs.\n\nSection 685.210 How does an eligible entity become a grantee?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.210 establishes that grantees will be selected \n\nthrough a FOA using standard Federal government competitive procedures. \n\nThe entity's proposal must describe a 4-year strategy for meeting the \n\nneeds of eligible MSFWs in the proposed service area and a description \n\nof the entity's experience working with the broader workforce delivery \n\nsystem. This is in alignment with the requirement in WIOA sec. 167(a) \n\nthat the Department make grants or enter into contracts on a \n\ncompetitive basis every 4 years. Unless specified otherwise in the FOA, \n\ngrantees may serve eligible MSFWs, including eligible MSFW youth, under \n\nthe grant. An applicant whose application for funding as a grantee \n\nunder part 685 is denied in whole or in part may request an \n\nadministrative review under 20 CFR 683.800.\n\nSection 685.220 What is the role of the grantee in the one-stop \n\ndelivery system?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.220 describes that in those local workforce \n\n\n\ndevelopment areas where the grantee operates its NFJP, as described in \n\nits grant agreement, the grantee is a required one-stop partner, and is \n\nsubject to the provisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR \n\npart 678. Consistent with those provisions, the grantee and Local \n\nWorkforce Development Board must develop and enter into an MOU which \n\nmeets the requirements of 20 CFR 678.500 and sets forth their \n\nrespective responsibilities for providing access to the full range of \n\nNFJP services through the one-stop system to eligible MSFWs.\n\nSection 685.230 Can a grantee's designation be terminated?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.230 explains the circumstance in which a grantee \n\nmay be terminated by the Department for cause, including emergency \n\ncircumstances when such action is necessary to protect the integrity of \n\nFederal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program, or by the \n\nDepartment's Grant Officer, if the recipient materially fails to comply \n\nwith the terms and conditions of the award. The Department has changed \n\nthe standard for Grant Officer termination from ``substantial or \n\npersistent violation'' as used in the WIA regulations in order to be \n\nconsistent with the standards used for all other Department WIOA grants \n\nunder the common administrative requirements for grants.\n\nSection 685.240 How does the Department use funds appropriated under \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act for the National Farmworker \n\nJobs Program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.240 establishes that in accordance with WIOA \n\nsec. 167(h), at least 99 percent of the funds appropriated each year \n\nfor WIOA sec. 167 activities must be allocated to service areas, based \n\non the distribution of the eligible MSFW population determined under a \n\nformula which has been published in the Federal Register. The grants \n\nwill be awarded under Sec.  685.210. The Department has added language \n\nthat clarifies that of this amount, a percentage of funds will be set \n\naside for housing grants and will be specified in an FOA issued by the \n\nDepartment. The balance, up to 1 percent of the appropriated funds, \n\nwill be used for discretionary purposes, such as providing technical \n\nassistance to eligible entities, and other activities prescribed by the \n\nSecretary to eligible entities. This differs from the up to 4 percent \n\nreserved in the prior regulations so as to comply with the funding \n\nrequirements of WIOA sec. 167(h).\n\n4. Subpart C--The National Farmworker Jobs Program Customers and \n\nAvailable Program Services\n\n    This subpart describes the responsibilities of grantees, and \n\nworkforce investment activities available to eligible MSFWs, including \n\ncareer services and training, housing assistance, youth services, and \n\n\n\nrelated assistance.\n\nSection 685.300 What are the general responsibilities of grantees?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.300 establishes the general responsibilities of \n\ngrantees, including that: eligible entities receive grants through the \n\nFOA process described in Sec.  685.210; career services and training \n\ngrantees are responsible for providing appropriate career services, \n\ntraining, and related assistance to eligible MSFWs and eligible MSFW \n\nyouth; and housing grantees are responsible for providing housing \n\nassistance to eligible MSFWs. Grantees will provide these services in \n\naccordance with the service delivery strategy described in the approved \n\nprogram plan described in Sec.  685.420. These services must reflect \n\nthe needs of the MSFW population in the service area and include the \n\nservices that are necessary to achieve each participant's employment \n\ngoals or housing needs. Grantees also are responsible for coordinating \n\nservices, particularly outreach to MSFWs, with the SWA, as defined in \n\n20 CFR part 651, and the State's monitor advocate and fulfilling the \n\nresponsibilities of one-stop partners described in proposed Sec.  \n\n678.420.\n\nSection 685.310 What are the basic components of an National Farmworker \n\nJobs Program service delivery strategy?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.310 describes the basic components of the NFJP \n\ndelivery strategy that must include: A customer-focused case management \n\napproach; the provision of workforce investment activities, which \n\ninclude career services and training, as described in WIOA secs. 167(d) \n\nand 134 and 20 CFR part 680, and youth workforce investment activities \n\ndescribed in WIOA sec. 129 and 20 CFR part 681; the arrangements under \n\nthe MOU's with the applicable Local Workforce Development Boards for \n\nthe delivery of the services available through the one-stop system to \n\nMSFWs; and related assistance services.\n\nSection 685.320 Who is eligible to receive services under the National \n\nFarmworker Jobs Program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.320 establishes that MSFWs as defined in Sec.  \n\n685.110 are eligible for services funded by the NFJP. As provided in \n\nWIOA sec. 167(d)(1), NFJP grants are used to provide adult and youth \n\nservices, thus the NFJP may use funds available to serve youth even \n\nwhen the service area is not being served with supplemental youth funds \n\nauthorized in WIOA sec. 127(a)(1). In addition, NFJP services can be \n\nprovided to eligible MSFW youth who demonstrate a need for and ability \n\nto benefit from career services. For example, some older youth may \n\nbenefit more from the array of career services available under NFJP \n\nthan from the youth services offered under subpart E.\n\n\n\n[[Page 20770]]\n\nSection 685.330 How are services delivered to eligible migrant and \n\nseasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.330 emphasizes that services to eligible MSFWs \n\nwill be focused on the customer's needs and provided through a case-\n\nmanagement approach emphasizing customer choice, and may include \n\nappropriate career services and training, and related assistance, which \n\nincludes emergency assistance; and supportive services, which includes \n\nallowance payments. The basic services and delivery of case-management \n\nactivities are further described in Sec. Sec.  685.340 through 685.390.\n\nSection 685.340 What career services must grantees provide to eligible \n\nmigrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.340 establishes that eligible MSFWs must be \n\nprovided the career services described in WIOA secs. 167(d) and \n\n134(c)(2), and 20 CFR part 680. Other career services may be provided \n\nas identified in the grantee's approved program plan. The Department \n\nalso has included language to clarify that while career services must \n\nbe made available through the one-stop delivery system, grantees also \n\nmay provide these types of services through other sources outside the \n\none-stop system. Examples include non-profit organizations or \n\neducational institutions. The delivery of career services to eligible \n\nMSFWs by the grantee and through the one-stop system must be discussed \n\nin the required MOU between the Local Workforce Development Board and \n\nthe grantee.\n\nSection 685.350 What training services must grantees provide to \n\neligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.350 establishes that the training activities in \n\nWIOA secs. 167(d) and 134(c)(3)(D), and 20 CFR part 680, must be \n\nprovided to eligible MSFWs. These activities include, but are not \n\nlimited to, occupational-skills training and OJT. The Department also \n\nemphasizes that eligible MSFWs are not required to receive career \n\nservices prior to receiving training services, as described in WIOA \n\nsec. 134(c)(3)(iii). This section also reinforces the intent of WIOA \n\nthat training services be directly linked to an in-demand industry \n\nsector or occupation in the service area, or in another area to which \n\nan eligible MSFW receiving such services is willing to relocate, \n\nconsistent with WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(G)(iii). The Department also \n\nestablishes that training activities must encourage the attainment of \n\nrecognized post-secondary credentials as defined in Sec.  685.110 \n\n(which refers to WIOA sec. 3(52)), when appropriate for an eligible \n\nMSFW. This requirement is in alignment with WIOA secs. \n\n116(b)(2)(A)(i)(IV) and 116(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III), which include ``the \n\n\n\npercentage of program participants who obtain a recognized post-\n\nsecondary credential, or a secondary school diploma,'' as a primary \n\nindicator of performance for both the adult and youth programs.\n\nSection 685.360 What housing services must grantees provide to eligible \n\nmigrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.360 requires that housing grantees must provide \n\nhousing services to eligible MSFWs and that career services and \n\ntraining grantees may provide housing services to eligible MSFWs as \n\ndescribed in their program plan. The proposed section establishes the \n\ndefinitions of permanent housing and temporary housing services that \n\nare available to eligible MSFWs. The Department establishes that \n\npermanent housing is owner-occupied, or occupied on a permanent, year-\n\nround basis (notwithstanding ownership) as the MSFW's primary residence \n\nto which he/she typically returns at the end of the work or training \n\nday and temporary housing is non-owner-occupied housing used by MSFWs \n\nwhose employment requires occasional travel outside their normal \n\ncommuting area. Permanent housing may include rental units, single \n\nfamily, duplexes, and other multi-family structures, dormitory, group \n\nhomes, and other housing types that provide short-term, seasonal, or \n\nyear-round housing opportunities in permanent structures. Modular \n\nstructures, manufactured housing, or mobile units placed on permanent \n\nfoundations and supplied with appropriate utilities and other \n\ninfrastructure are also considered permanent housing. Temporary housing \n\nmay include: Units intended for temporary occupancy located in \n\npermanent structures, such as rental units in an apartment complex or \n\nin mobile structures, tents, and yurts that provide short-term, \n\nseasonal housing opportunities; temporary structures that may be moved \n\nfrom site to site, dismantled and re-erected when needed for farmworker \n\noccupancy; and off-farm housing operated independently of employer \n\ninterest in, or control of, the housing, or on-farm housing operated by \n\na nonprofit, including faith-based or community non-profit \n\norganizations, but located on property owned by an agricultural \n\nemployer. Specific examples of permanent housing services and \n\nactivities associated with the provision of permanent housing services, \n\nand specific examples of temporary housing activities associated with \n\nthe provision of temporary housing services, including emergency \n\nassistance such as emergency housing payments, vouchers, and cash \n\npayments for rent/lease and utilities are provided. The Department \n\nestablishes that housing services are intended to meet the needs of \n\neligible MSFWs to occupy a unit of housing for reasons related to \n\nseeking employment, retaining employment, or engaging in training. The \n\ndefinitions of permanent housing and temporary housing assistance and \n\n\n\nthe specific examples of permanent and temporary housing services \n\ndescribed in the proposed Sec.  685.360 are adapted from the 2011 \n\nDepartment Notice of Availability of Funds and Solicitation for Grant \n\nApplications for the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) Housing \n\nAssistance Program (Funding Opportunity Number: SGA-DFA-PY-10-08) which \n\nprovided specific requirements and guidelines for housing grant \n\napplicants.\n\nSection 685.370 What services may grantees provide to eligible migrant \n\nand seasonal farmworker youth participants aged 14-24?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.370 describes the services that grantees may \n\nprovide to eligible MSFW youth participants aged 14-24 based on an \n\nevaluation and assessment of their needs. These services include the \n\ncareer and training services described in Sec. Sec.  685.340 through \n\n685.350; youth workforce investment activities described in WIOA sec. \n\n129; life skills activities that encourage development of self and \n\ninterpersonal skills development; community service projects; and other \n\nactivities that conform to the use of funds for youth activities \n\ndescribed in 20 CFR part 681. Grantees may provide these services to \n\nany eligible MSFW youth, regardless of the participant's eligibility \n\nfor WIOA title I youth activities as described in WIOA sec. 129(a).\n\nSection 685.380 What related assistance services may be provided to \n\neligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.380 describes the types of services that may be \n\nprovided to eligible MSFWs as ``related assistance,'' and establishes \n\nthat these services are short-term, direct services. Examples include \n\nemergency assistance, as defined in Sec.  685.110, and those activities \n\nidentified in WIOA sec. 167(d), such as English language and literacy \n\ninstruction, pesticide and worker safety training, housing (including \n\npermanent housing), as\n\n[[Page 20771]]\n\ndescribed in Sec.  685.360, and school dropout prevention and recovery \n\nactivities. Related assistance is distinct from ``supportive services'' \n\nas defined in WIOA sec. 3, which ``means services such as \n\ntransportation, child care, dependent care, housing, and needs-related \n\npayments, that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in \n\nactivities authorized under this Act,'' because related assistance may \n\nbe provided to eligible MSFWs who are not otherwise participating in \n\nactivities authorized under this Act such as career services, youth \n\nservices, or training services.\n\nSection 685.390 When may eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers \n\nreceive related assistance?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.390 establishes that eligible MSFWs may receive \n\n\n\nrelated assistance services when the need for the related assistance is \n\nidentified and documented by the grantee. A statement by the eligible \n\nMSFW may be included as documentation.\n\n5. Subpart D--Performance Accountability, Planning, and Waiver \n\nProvisions\n\n    This subpart describes indicators of performance for grantees, \n\nrequired planning documents, and the information required in program \n\nplans required under WIOA sec. 167. The subpart also explains waiver \n\nprovisions and clarifies how grant costs are classified under WIOA sec. \n\n167.\n\nSection 685.400 What are the indicators of performance that apply to \n\nthe National Farmworker Jobs Program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.400 describes the indicators of performance that \n\napply to grantees. Grantees providing career services and training will \n\nuse the indicators of performance common to the adult and youth \n\nprograms, described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), as required by WIOA sec. \n\n167(c)(2)(C). These measures of performance are the same as the primary \n\nindicators discussed in proposed Sec.  677.155. Though the indicators \n\nof performance are identified in various places throughout the WIOA \n\nproposed regulations, the indicators are the same and do not vary \n\nacross the regulations.\n\n    For grantees providing career services and training, the Department \n\nwill reach agreement on the levels of performance for each of the \n\nprimary indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A), \n\ntaking into account economic conditions, characteristics of the \n\nindividuals served, and other appropriate factors, and using, to the \n\nextent practicable, the statistical adjustment model under WIOA sec. \n\n116(b)(3)(A)(viii). The levels agreed to will be the adjusted levels of \n\nperformance and will be incorporated in the program plan, as required \n\nin WIOA sec. 167(c)(3). For grantees providing housing services only, \n\ngrantees will use the total number of eligible MSFWs served and the \n\ntotal number of eligible MSFW families served as indicators of \n\nperformance. Performance indicators for NFJP housing grantees are not \n\nspecified in WIA or WIOA statute, and the measures proposed here are \n\nadapted from the Department's TEGL, Number 15-13, Program Year 2014 \n\nPlanning Guidance for National Farmworker Jobs Program Housing \n\nGrantees, released March 25, 2014. As described in proposed Sec.  \n\n685.400(d), the Department may develop additional performance \n\nindicators with appropriate levels of performance for evaluating \n\nprograms that serve eligible MSFWs and which reflect the State service \n\narea economy, local demographics of eligible MSFWs, and other \n\n\n\nappropriate factors. In accordance with Sec.  685.400(d), the \n\nDepartment may develop additional indicators of performance for housing \n\ngrantees in addition to the indicators specified in proposed Sec.  \n\n685.400(c). If additional performance indicators are developed, the \n\nlevels of performance for these additional indicators must be \n\nnegotiated with the grantee and included in the approved program plan. \n\nGrantees also may develop additional performance indicators and include \n\nthem in the program plan or in periodic performance reports.\n\nSection 685.410 What planning documents must a grantee submit?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.410 describes the planning documents that a \n\ngrantee must submit, including a comprehensive program plan, further \n\ndescribed in proposed Sec.  685.420, and a projection of participant \n\nservices and expenditures covering the 4-year grant cycle.\n\nSection 685.420 What information is required in the grantee program \n\nplan?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.420 describes the information required for \n\ninclusion in program plans. Paragraph (a) asks for a description of the \n\nservice area that the applicant proposes to serve, in accordance with \n\nWIOA sec. 167(c). Paragraphs (b) through (g) incorporate the elements \n\ndescribed in WIOA sec. 167(c)(2). Paragraphs (h) and (i) specify \n\nadditional information required in program plans which include: The \n\nmethods the grantee will use to target its services on specific \n\nsegments of the eligible population, as appropriate, and the response \n\nto any other requirements set forth in the FOA issued under Sec.  \n\n685.210.\n\nSection 685.430 Under what circumstances are the terms of the grantee's \n\nprogram plan modified by the grantee or the Department?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.430 describes the circumstances when the terms \n\nof the grantee's program plan can be modified by the grantee or the \n\nDepartment. Program plans must be modified to reflect the funding level \n\nfor each year of the grant, and the Department will provide \n\ninstructions annually on when to submit modifications for each year of \n\nfunding, which will generally be no later than June 1, prior to the \n\nstart of the subsequent year of the grant cycle. Grantees must submit a \n\nrequest to the Department for any proposed modifications to the plan to \n\nadd, delete, expand, or reduce any part of the program plan or \n\nallowable activities, and the Department will consider the cost \n\nprinciples, uniform administrative requirements, and terms and \n\nconditions of award when reviewing modifications to program plans. The \n\npurpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Department has \n\nreviewed and approved any proposed programmatic changes as part of a \n\n\n\ngrant award to ensure the changes are allowable, programmatically and \n\nfiscally sound, and do not negatively affect performance outcomes. If \n\nthe grantee is approved for a regulatory waiver under proposed Sec.  \n\n685.560 and Sec.  685.570, it must submit a modification of the grant \n\nplan to reflect the effect of the waiver.\n\nSection 685.440 How are costs classified under the National Farmworker \n\nJobs Program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.440 describes how costs are classified under the \n\nNFJP. Costs are classified as administrative costs, as defined in 20 \n\nCFR 683.215, and program costs are all other costs not defined as \n\nadministrative. The Department further specifies that program costs \n\nmust be classified and reported in the categories of related assistance \n\n(including emergency assistance), supportive services, and all other \n\nprogram services.\n\nSection 685.450 What is the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nadministrative cost limit for National Farmworker Jobs Program grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.450 describes the administrative cost limit for \n\nNFJP grants which, under 20 CFR 683.205(b), will be identified in the \n\ngrant or contract award document, and will not exceed 15 percent of \n\ntotal grantee funding. The administrative cost limit established in\n\n[[Page 20772]]\n\nthis section is consistent with the administrative cost limit under \n\nwhich the program is currently operating.\n\nSection 685.460 Are there regulatory and/or statutory waiver provisions \n\nthat apply to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.460 describes the regulatory and/or statutory \n\nwaiver provisions that apply to WIOA sec. 167. The statutory waiver \n\nprovision at WIOA sec. 189(i) and discussed in 20 CFR 679.600 does not \n\napply to WIOA sec. 167. Paragraph (b) establishes that grantees may \n\nrequest a waiver of any regulatory provisions only when such regulatory \n\nprovisions are (1) not required by WIOA; (2) not related to wage and \n\nlabor standards, non-displacement protection, worker rights, \n\nparticipation and protection of workers and participants, and \n\neligibility of participants, grievance procedures, judicial review, \n\nnondiscrimination, allocation of funds, procedures for review and \n\napproval of plans; and (3) not related to the basic purposes of WIOA, \n\ndescribed in 20 CFR 675.100.\n\nSection 685.470 How can grantees request a waiver?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.570 describes the information that grantees must \n\nsubmit to the Department in a waiver plan to document a requested \n\nwaiver. The waiver request must include: A description of the goals of \n\n\n\nthe waiver; the expected programmatic outcomes and how the waiver will \n\nimprove the provision of program activities; how the waiver is \n\nconsistent with guidelines the Department establishes; the data that \n\nwill be collected to track the impact of the waiver; and the modified \n\nprogram plan reflecting the effect of the requested waiver.\n\n6. Subpart E--Supplemental Youth Workforce Investment Activity Funding \n\nUnder Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Sec. 127(a)(1)\n\n    This subpart describes the purpose of supplemental youth workforce \n\ninvestment activity funding that may become available under WIOA sec. \n\n127(a)(1). Included is a description of how the funds may become \n\navailable, and what requirements apply to grants funded by WIOA sec. \n\n127(a)(1). Significantly, these funds may be used only for workforce \n\ninvestment activities for eligible MSFW youth, as defined in Sec.  \n\n685.110. The Department will issue a separate FOA for grants funded by \n\nWIOA sec. 127(a)(1), and the selection will be made in accordance with \n\nthe procedures described in Sec.  685.210, giving priority to \n\napplicants that are WIOA sec. 167 grantees. Planning documents required \n\nfor grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) will be described in the FOA; \n\nand allocation of WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) funds will be based on the \n\ncomparative merits of the applications in accordance with criteria set \n\nforth in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.500 What is supplemental youth workforce investment \n\nactivity funding?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.500 describes that if Congress appropriates more \n\nthan $925 million for WIOA youth workforce investment activities in a \n\nfiscal year, 4 percent of the excess amount must be used to provide \n\nworkforce investment activities for eligible MSFW youth under WIOA sec. \n\n167.\n\nSection 685.510 What requirements apply to grants funded by the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.510 specifies that the requirements in subparts \n\nA through D of Sec.  685 apply to grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1), \n\nexcept that grants described in this subpart must be used only for \n\nworkforce investment activities for eligible MSFW youth, as described \n\nin Sec.  685.370 and WIOA sec. 167(d) (including related assistance and \n\nsupportive services).\n\nSection 685.520 What is the application process for obtaining a grant \n\nfunded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.520 specifies that the Department will issue a \n\n\n\nseparate FOA for grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1). The selection \n\nwill be made in accordance with the procedures described in Sec.  \n\n685.210, except that the Department reserves the right to provide \n\npriority to applicants that are WIOA sec. 167 grantees.\n\nSection 685.530 What planning documents are required for grants funded \n\nby the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.530 specifies that planning documents required \n\nfor grants funded by WIOA sec. 127(a)(1) will be described in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.540 How are funds allocated to grants funded by the \n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.540 describes that the allocation of WIOA sec. \n\n127(a)(1) funds will be based on the comparative merits of the \n\napplications, in accordance with criteria set forth in the FOA.\n\nSection 685.550 Who is eligible to receive services through grants \n\nfunded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  685.550 describes that eligible MSFW youth as \n\ndefined in Sec.  685.110 may receive services through grants funded by \n\nWIOA sec. 127(a)(1).\n\nJ. Part 686--The Job Corps Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    This part provides proposed regulations for the Job Corps program, \n\nauthorized in title I, subtitle C of WIOA. The regulations address the \n\nscope and purpose of the Job Corps program and provide requirements \n\nrelating to site selection, protection, and maintenance of Job Corps \n\nfacilities; funding and selection of center operators and service \n\nproviders; recruitment, eligibility, screening, selection and \n\nassignment, and enrollment of Job Corps students; Job Corps program \n\nactivities and center operations; student support; career transition \n\nservices and graduate services; community connections; and \n\nadministrative and management requirements. The Department's intent in \n\nthe regulations is to incorporate the requirements of title I, subtitle \n\nC of the Act and to describe how the Job Corps program is operated in \n\norder to deliver relevant academic and career technical training (CTT) \n\nthat leads to meaningful employment or post-secondary education. The \n\nregulations also serve to explain clearly the requirements necessitated \n\nby the unique residential environment of a Job Corps center. The major \n\nchanges from the existing regulations reflect WIOA's effort to enhance \n\nthe Job Corps program, provide access to high quality training and \n\neducation, create incentives for strong contractor performance, and \n\npromote accountability and transparency.\n\n2. Subpart A--Scope and Purpose\n\n\n\n    This proposed subpart contains regulatory provisions that describe \n\nthe Job Corps program, its purpose, the role of its Director, and \n\napplicable definitions. In describing the role of the Job Corps \n\nDirector, this subpart provides that the Secretary has delegated the \n\nauthority to carry out his or her responsibilities under this part to \n\nthe National Director of Job Corps; therefore, all references to the \n\nSecretary issuing guidelines, procedures or standards means that they \n\nwill be issued by the National Job Corps Director. This subpart also \n\ndescribes the Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), which provides \n\nthe operating policies and\n\n[[Page 20773]]\n\nprocedures governing day-to-day activities of the Job Corps program. \n\nThe subpart describes the scope and purpose of the program, along with \n\nthe responsibilities of its National Director. It promotes \n\naccountability and transparency by making readers aware of exactly what \n\nthe Job Corps program plans to achieve and the procedures for doing so, \n\nas well as the role its leadership plays in its operation.\n\nSection 686.100 What is the scope of this part?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.100 contains the regulatory provisions governing \n\nthe Job Corps program. It explains that procedures guiding day-to-day \n\noperations are proposed to be provided in the PRH and clarifies that \n\nthroughout this part, phrases that refer to instructions or procedures \n\nissued by the Secretary refer to the PRH and other Job Corps \n\nDirectives. Because this section of WIOA is so similar to the \n\ncorresponding section in WIA, this proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 686.100.\n\nSection 686.110 What is the Job Corps program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.110 describes the Job Corps program. Job Corps \n\nis a national program that operates in partnership with States, \n\ncommunities, local Workforce Development Boards, youth councils, one-\n\nstop centers and partners, and other youth programs to provide social, \n\nacademic, career and technical education, and service-learning \n\nopportunities, primarily in a residential setting, for low-income young \n\npeople. Proposed Sec.  686.110 reflects the increased focus in sec. 141 \n\nof WIOA on connecting young people to the labor force by providing them \n\nwith intensive social, academic, career and technical education in \n\norder to obtain secondary school diplomas or recognized credentials \n\nleading to successful careers in in-demand industries or occupations, \n\nthe Armed Forces, or enrollment in post-secondary education. The \n\nprogram's goals for students are economic self-sufficiency, \n\nopportunities for advancement, and responsible citizenship.\n\n\n\nSection 686.120 What definitions apply to this part?\n\n    The definitions that are listed in this section are specific to \n\nthis proposed part, which governs the Job Corps program. Other \n\ndefinitions that apply to the Job Corps program are defined under secs. \n\n3 and 142 of WIOA. Proposed Sec.  686.120 describes definitions in four \n\ncategories.\n\n    The first category is made up of proposed definitions that are the \n\nsame as those included in the regulations at 20 CFR 686.120 that \n\ngoverned the Job Corps program under WIA. These are ``Absent Without \n\nOfficial Leave (AWOL),'' ``Capital improvement,'' ``Contract center,'' \n\n``Enrollee,'' ``Enrollment,'' ``Individual with a disability,'' \n\n``Interagency agreement,'' ``Job Corps Director,'' ``National Office,'' \n\n``Placement,'' ``Regional appeal board,'' ``Regional Director,'' \n\n``Regional Office,'' ``Regional Solicitor,'' ``Separation,'' \n\n``Student,'' and ``Unauthorized goods.'' Because these definitions are \n\nthe same as those in the WIA regulations, the Department has not \n\nincluded further explanation of them below.\n\n    The second category is made up of proposed definitions that are \n\nsimilar to definitions included in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n670.120, but they have been modified slightly due to differences in the \n\ndefinitions contained in WIOA. These are ``Applicable Local Board,'' \n\n``Civilian Conservation Center (CCC), ``Contracting Officer,'' \n\n``Graduate,'' ``Job Corps,'' ``Job Corps center,'' ``Low-income \n\nindividual,'' ``National training contractor,'' ``Operational support \n\nservices,'' ``Operator,'' and ``Outreach and admissions provider.''\n\n    The third category is made up of proposed definitions that were not \n\nincluded in the WIA regulations, but they are defined in sec. 142 of \n\nWIOA. These are ``Applicable one-stop center,'' ``Former Enrollee,'' \n\nand ``Service Provider.''\n\n    The fourth category is made up of proposed definitions that apply \n\nto the Job Corps program and are commonly used in these regulations, \n\nbut do not appear in the WIA regulations or in WIOA. These are ``Career \n\nTechnical Training,'' ``Career Transition Service Provider,'' and \n\n``Participant.''\n\n    Aside from the terms in the first category, the definitions are \n\nexplained as the terms appear in this proposed section in alphabetical \n\norder, as follows:\n\n    Applicable Local Board--The proposed definition of this term \n\nimplements the definition of ``applicable Local Board'' contained in \n\nsec. 142 of WIOA. It is similar to the definition of ``Workforce \n\nInvestment Board'' in the WIA regulations.\n\n    Applicable one-stop center--The proposed definition of this term \n\nimplements the definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\n\n\n    Career Technical Training--The proposed definition of this term \n\nmeans career and technical education and training, which is the term \n\nmost often used by WIOA rather than ``vocational training,'' as used in \n\nWIA.\n\n    Career Transition Service Provider--The proposed definition of this \n\nterm means an organization acting under a contract or other agreement \n\nwith Job Corps to provide career transition services for graduates and, \n\nto the extent possible, for former students. WIOA uses both the term \n\n``Career Transition Service Provider'' and ``Placement Provider'' \n\ninterchangeably. Career transition services are further explained in \n\nsubpart G of the proposed rule.\n\n    Contracting officer--The proposed definition of this term is \n\nsimilar to the definition of ``contracting officer'' in the WIA \n\nregulations, but it does not include ``Regional Director,'' because \n\ncontracting officers are most often not Regional Directors.\n\n    Former Enrollee--The proposed definition of this term implements \n\nthe definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\n    Graduate--The proposed definition of this term implements the \n\ndefinition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\n    Job Corps--The proposed definition of this term is similar to the \n\ndefinition of ``Job Corps'' in the WIA regulations, but it clarifies \n\nthat the Job Corps is established within the Department and cites the \n\napplicable section of WIOA.\n\n    Job Corps center--The proposed definition of this term is the same \n\nas the definition in the WIA regulations, except that this definition \n\ncites the applicable section of WIOA.\n\n    Low-income individual--The proposed definition of this term is the \n\nsame as the definition in the WIA regulations, except that this \n\ndefinition cites the applicable section of WIOA.\n\n    National training contractor--The proposed definition of this term \n\nis slightly different from the definition in the WIA regulations, \n\nbecause the term ``career and technical training'' is used rather than \n\n``vocational training.'' However, the meaning remains unchanged.\n\n    Operational support services--The proposed definition of this term \n\nis slightly different from the definition in the WIA regulations, \n\nbecause the term ``career and technical training'' is used instead of \n\n``vocational training.'' However, the meaning remains unchanged.\n\n    Operator--The proposed definition of this term implements the \n\ndefinition of ``operator'' contained in sec. 142 of WIOA. It is similar \n\nto the definition of ``center operator'' in the WIA regulations.\n\n    Outreach and admissions provider - The proposed definition of this \n\n\n\nterm is similar to the definition of ``outreach\n\n[[Page 20774]]\n\nand admissions agency'' in the WIA regulations, but it clarifies that \n\nthe entity performs recruitment in addition to outreach and enrollment \n\nactivities, consistent with the definition in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\n    Participant--The proposed definition of this term clarifies which \n\nindividuals are considered participants for performance reporting \n\npurposes under proposed Sec.  686.1010. The definition of participant \n\nincludes graduates and those enrollees and former enrollees who have \n\ncompleted the career preparation period. It also includes enrollees and \n\nformer enrollees who have remained in the program for 60 days or more, \n\nregardless of whether they have completed their career preparation \n\nperiod. During the career preparation period, the student learns, \n\ndemonstrates, and practices personal responsibility and skills required \n\nin the workplace; learns, demonstrates, and practices job search \n\nskills; visits and learns about one-stop centers; and creates a \n\npersonal career development plan with the help of staff. In most cases, \n\nthe career preparation period culminates with the commitment to the \n\nPersonal Career Development Plan. The Department proposes this \n\nlimitation because students are not assigned to trades and are not \n\ngenerally receiving the services described subpart E of this part until \n\nthe career preparation period is completed. The career preparation \n\nperiod is described in Job Corps' Policy and Requirements Handbook.\n\n    Service Provider--The proposed definition of this term implements \n\nthe definition contained in sec. 142 of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.130 What is the role of the Job Corps Director?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.130 describes the role of the Job Corps \n\nDirector, noting that he/she has been delegated authority to carry out \n\nthe responsibility of the Secretary under title I, subtitle C of WIOA \n\nrelated to the operation of the Job Corps program. Proposed Sec.  \n\n686.130 also clarifies that references in this part referring to \n\n``guidelines'' or ``procedures issued by the Secretary'' mean that the \n\nJob Corps Director issues such guidelines. This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 686.130.\n\n3. Subpart B--Site Selection and Protection and Maintenance of \n\nFacilities\n\n    This proposed subpart describes how sites for Job Corps centers are \n\nselected, the handling of capital improvements and new construction on \n\nJob Corps centers, and responsibilities for facility protection and \n\nmaintenance. The requirements in this subpart are not significantly \n\ndifferent from the corresponding requirements in the WIA Job Corps \n\n\n\nregulations at 20 CFR part 686 subpart B. The Secretary, through \n\ndelegation of authority to the National Director of Job Corps, must \n\napprove the location and size of all Job Corps centers, and establish \n\nprocedures for requesting, approving, and initiating capital \n\nimprovement and new construction on Job Corps centers, which serves to \n\nstrengthen and enhance the program as a whole.\n\nSection 686.200 How are Job Corps center locations and sizes \n\ndetermined?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.200 explains that the Secretary must approve the \n\nlocation and size of all Job Corps centers, including both contract \n\ncenters and CCCs. The Secretary also establishes procedures for making \n\ndecisions concerning the establishment, relocation, expansion, or \n\nclosing of contract centers.\n\nSection 686.210 How are center facilities improvements and new \n\nconstruction handled?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.210 states that the Secretary establishes \n\nprocedures for requesting, approving, and initiating capital \n\nimprovements and new construction on Job Corps centers.\n\nSection 686.220 Who is responsible for the protection and maintenance \n\nof center facilities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.220 states that the Secretary establishes \n\nprocedures for the protection and maintenance of contract center \n\nfacilities owned or leased by the Department. The proposed section also \n\nstates that when the Department of Agriculture operates CCCs on public \n\nland, it will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of CCC \n\nfacilities. The Secretary issues procedures for conducting periodic \n\nfacility surveys of centers to determine their condition and to \n\nidentify additional physical needs. This proposed section retains the \n\nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 670.220.\n\n4. Subpart C--Funding and Selection of Center Operators and Service \n\nProviders\n\n    In this proposed subpart the Department implements new requirements \n\nof WIOA with regard to the operators of high-performing centers, the \n\nlength of contractual agreements to operate Job Corps centers, and how \n\nentities are selected to receive funding to operate Job Corps centers \n\nand to provide outreach, admissions, and career transition support \n\nservices. In addition to adding to the list of considerations currently \n\nused in selecting Job Corps center operators and service providers, \n\nWIOA emphasizes competition to increase the performance and quality of \n\nthe Job Corps program. WIOA also provides that an entity, in its role \n\nas incumbent operator of a center deemed to be high performing, may \n\ncompete in any competitive selection process carried out for an award \n\nto operate that center, even in cases where the selection of the \n\n\n\noperator is set aside for small businesses as required by the Federal \n\nAcquisition Regulation. This serves to ensure continued access to high \n\nquality training and education for Job Corps students, since a high \n\nperforming incumbent operator has an established and proven record of \n\nproviding it. WIOA also provides that a center operations contracts \n\ncannot exceed 2 years, with three 1-year options to renew. This \n\ncodifies current Job Corps practice. Furthermore, WIOA precludes the \n\nSecretary from exercising an option to renew a center operations \n\ncontract for an additional 1-year period if certain criteria are not \n\nmet, with limited exceptions. All of these new and expanded provisions \n\nfollow WIOA's theme of enhancing the Job Corps program and providing \n\naccess to high quality training and education by ensuring Job Corps \n\ncenters are staffed with high quality service providers.\n\nSection 686.300 What entities are eligible to receive funds to operate \n\ncenters and provide training and operational support services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.300 implements secs. 147(a)(1), 147(e), and \n\n145(a)(3) of WIOA, establishing the entities eligible to receive funds \n\nto operate Job Corps centers, and to provide outreach and admissions, \n\ncareer transition, and other operational support services.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4) reflect the entities \n\neligible to operate Job Corps centers listed in WIOA sec. 147(a)(1)(A). \n\nProposed paragraph (a)(3) includes ``Indian tribes and organizations'' \n\nas eligible center operators, consistent with sec. 147(e) of WIOA. For \n\npurposes of this section, the Department interprets ``Indian tribes and \n\norganizations'' consistent with sec. 147(e)(2) of WIOA, which provides \n\nthat the terms ``Indian'' and ``Indian tribe'' have the meanings given \n\nthem in sec. 4 of the ISDEAA (codified at 25 U.S.C. 450b(d) and (e)), \n\nwhich says that ``Indian tribe'' means any Indian tribe, band, nation, \n\nor other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native \n\nvillage or regional or village corporation as defined in or established \n\npursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (codified at 43 \n\nU.S.C. 1601 et seq.), which is recognized as\n\n[[Page 20775]]\n\neligible for the special programs and services provided by the United \n\nStates to Indians because of their status as Indians.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) lists the entities eligible to receive funds \n\nto provide necessary services to Job Corps centers, including outreach \n\nand admissions, career transition, and other operational support \n\nservices. Generally, as provided in WIOA sec. 147(a)(1)(B), local or \n\nother entities with the necessary capacity to provide activities \n\ndescribed in this part are considered eligible entities. Paragraphs \n\n(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) reflect the entities listed in sec. \n\n\n\n145(a)(3) of WIOA. Currently Job Corps also allows private for-profit \n\nand non-profit corporations to act as eligible service providers; \n\nparagraph (b)(2) clarifies that private for-profit and non-profit \n\ncorporations continue to be included as business organizations eligible \n\nto receive funds as service providers.\n\nSection 686.310 How are entities selected to receive funding to operate \n\ncenters?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.310 implements secs. 147(a)(2) and (a)(3) of \n\nWIOA, which contain new provisions to strengthen the Job Corps \n\ncontracting process by requiring specific criteria that emphasize \n\nquality, performance, and accountability to be addressed as part of the \n\nselection process for center operators. The proposed section adopts \n\nthese criteria to improve the effectiveness of the program in helping \n\nyoung people become responsible citizens by providing them with the \n\nskills they need for successful careers in in-demand industry sectors, \n\noccupations, or the Armed Forces, or for enrollment in post-secondary \n\neducation. The Department welcomes comments on how best to embed a \n\nfocus on quality, performance, and accountability into the procurement \n\nprocess.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.310(a) implements sec. 147(a)(2)(A) of WIOA, \n\nstating that the Secretary selects eligible entities to operate \n\ncontract centers on a competitive basis in accordance with applicable \n\nstatutes and regulations. This paragraph also explains that in \n\nselecting an entity, ETA issues requests for proposals (RFPs) for the \n\noperation of all contact centers according to the Federal Acquisition \n\nRegulation (48 chapter 1) and the Department's Acquisition Regulation \n\n(48 chapter 29). ETA develops RFPs for center operators in consultation \n\nwith the Governor, the center workforce council (if established), and \n\nthe Local Board for the workforce development area in which the center \n\nis located.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) requires that the RFPs for each contract \n\ncenter describe uniform specifications and standards, as well as \n\nspecifications and requirements that are unique to the operation of the \n\nspecific center.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) implements the factors for selection of an \n\nentity to operate a Job Corps center established in sec. \n\n147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, by specifying that the selection criteria will \n\nbe established by the Secretary and set forth in the RFP. Proposed \n\nparagraphs (c)(1) through (5) set forth the specific criteria that must \n\nbe included in the RFP, as listed in sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA. \n\nParagraph (c)(1) retains the language found in the WIA regulations at \n\n20 CFR 670.310(c)(1), requiring that the offeror demonstrate its \n\nability to coordinate the activities carried out through the Job Corps \n\n\n\ncenter with activities carried out under the appropriate State and \n\nlocal workforce investment plans. This supports the overall goal of \n\nbetter connecting and aligning Job Corps with the workforce system.\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) implement the criteria at \n\nWIOA secs. 147(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) through 147(a)(2)(B)(i)(IV). These \n\nprovisions support the goal of better alignment with the workforce \n\nsystem and the increased focus on past performance and student outcomes \n\nagainst the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth and \n\nthe Job Corps program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c)(5) is a new element in the selection process \n\nestablished in sec. 147(a)(2)(B)(i)(V) of WIOA, requiring that the \n\ncriteria include the offeror's ability to demonstrate a record of \n\nsuccessfully assisting at-risk youth to connect to the workforce, \n\nincluding providing them with intensive academics and career and \n\ntechnical training. This aligns with the increased focus on student \n\noutcomes and emphasizes the purpose of the program, which is to provide \n\nstudents with the skills they need for successful careers in in-demand \n\nindustries, occupations, or the Armed Forces, or to continue on to \n\npost-secondary education. The Department welcomes comments on how to \n\nassess potential offerors' past records in assisting at-risk youth to \n\nconnect to the workforce.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) implements the additional factors for \n\nselection of an entity to operate a Job Corps center that are specified \n\nin sec. 147(a)(3) of WIOA. These provisions support the goals of better \n\nalignment with the workforce system and increased focus on past \n\nperformance and student outcomes against the primary indicators of \n\nperformance for eligible youth and the Job Corps program. In addition, \n\nparagraph (d) specifies that the information described in paragraphs \n\n(d)(1) through (11) must be submitted at such time in the procurement \n\nprocess, and in such form, as the Secretary determines is appropriate.\n\nSection 686.320 What if a current center operator is deemed to be an \n\noperator of a high-performing center?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.320(a) implements sec. 147(b)(1) of WIOA, \n\nallowing an entity that, in its role as the incumbent operator of a \n\ncenter, meets the requirements of this section to be considered an \n\noperator of a high-performing center. If the entity is considered an \n\noperator of a high-performing center, the entity must be allowed to \n\ncompete in any competitive selection process carried out for an award \n\nto operate that center. This means that in cases where the selection of \n\nthe operator of a particular center is set aside for small businesses \n\nas required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the incumbent \n\noperator may participate in the subsequent competition for the center \n\noperations contract even if the operator would be otherwise ineligible \n\n\n\nto compete as a result of the set-aside.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) implements sec. 147(b)(2) of WIOA, which \n\nprovides the criteria an operator must meet to be considered an \n\noperator of a high-performing center for the purposes of paragraph (a). \n\nFirst, under paragraph (b)(1), the center must be ranked among the top \n\n20 percent of Job Corps centers for the most recent preceding PY \n\naccording to the ranking described in proposed Sec.  686.1070. Second, \n\nunder paragraph (b)(2), the center must meet the expected levels of \n\nperformance established with respect to each of the primary indicators \n\nof performance for eligible youth found in proposed Sec.  686.1000. A \n\ncenter will be determined to have met the expected measures of \n\nperformance if, per proposed Sec.  686.320(b)(2)(i) and (ii), it \n\nachieved an average of at least 100 percent of the expected level of \n\nperformance for the indicator over the most recent preceding 3 PYs, \n\nand, for the most recent preceding PY for which information is \n\navailable at the time the determination is made, the center achieved at \n\nleast 100 percent of the expected level of performance established for \n\nthe indicator. This provision emphasizes the importance of meeting the \n\nexpected levels of performance related to the primary indicators, by \n\nproviding an opportunity for the most successful incumbent contractors \n\nto compete to operate a high-performing center even if\n\n[[Page 20776]]\n\nthe competition for that center is a small business set-aside and the \n\nincumbent would not normally meet the criteria to compete in a small \n\nbusiness set-aside competition. The Department anticipates going \n\nthrough the market research phase of the competition before determining \n\nwhether the competition will be set aside for small businesses; a \n\ndetermination as to whether the incumbent contractor meets the criteria \n\nin proposed paragraph (b) will likely be made after the market research \n\nphase is completed and before the issuance of the solicitation.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) implements the transition procedures in sec. \n\n147(b)(3) of WIOA, and describes the criteria that must be met for an \n\noperator to be considered to be an operator of a high-performing center \n\nif any of the PYs described in paragraph (b) precede the implementation \n\nof the establishment of the expected levels of performance and the \n\napplication of the primary indicators of performance for eligible \n\nyouth.\n\nSection 686.330 What is the length of an agreement entered into by the \n\nSecretary for operation of a Job Corps center and what are the \n\nconditions for renewal of such an agreement?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.330 implements secs. 147(f)-(g) of WIOA, which \n\n\n\ncontain new provisions to strengthen the Job Corps contracting process \n\nby enacting new requirements for the length of center operations \n\ncontracts and the conditions under which they may be renewed. These \n\nprovisions emphasize quality and integrity in center operators and \n\ndirect the Secretary not to exercise option years for contracts where \n\nminimum standards of performance related to the primary indicators of \n\nperformance for eligible youth are not met. These provisions further \n\nsupport the overall vision of improved performance and accountability \n\nfor the Job Corps program.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.330(a) implements sec. 147(f) of WIOA, which \n\nprovides that contracts to operate a Job Corps center cannot exceed 2 \n\nyears, but that the Secretary can exercise any contractual option to \n\nrenew the agreement in 1-year increments for not more than 3 additional \n\nyears. This proposed paragraph reflects current Job Corps contracting \n\npractice.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) explains that the Secretary will establish \n\nprocedures for evaluating the option to renew an agreement that include \n\nan assessment of the factors described in proposed paragraph (c), a \n\nreview of contract performance and financial reporting compliance, a \n\nreview of the program management and performance data described in \n\nproposed Sec. Sec.  686.975 and 686.980, and an evaluation of the \n\nfactors described in proposed paragraph (d).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) implements sec. 147(g)(4) of WIOA, which \n\nestablishes conditions that must be met for the Secretary to exercise a \n\ncontractual option to renew an agreement for an entity to operate a Job \n\nCorps center.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) implements sec. 147(g)(1) of WIOA, which \n\nprohibits the Secretary from renewing an agreement for an entity to \n\noperate a Job Corps center for any 1-year additional period if, for \n\nboth of the 2 most recent preceding PYs for which information is \n\navailable at the time the determination to exercise an option is made, \n\nthe center both has been ranked in the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps \n\ncenters according to the ranking described in proposed Sec.  686.1070 \n\nand has failed to achieve an average of 50 percent or higher of the \n\nexpected level of performance with respect to each of the primary \n\nindicators of performance for eligible youth (as described in proposed \n\nSec.  686.1000). If a second year of program data is unavailable at the \n\ntime the determination regarding the contractual option is made, \n\nproposed paragraph (d) requires the use of data from the preceding year \n\nfrom which performance information is available. This provision \n\nemphasizes the center operator's accountability for meeting the \n\nexpected levels of performance related to the primary indicators by \n\n\n\nestablishing minimum performance standards that must be met for the \n\nSecretary to exercise an option year.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) addresses the availability of information \n\nand data necessary to make the determination required by proposed \n\nparagraph (d). The availability of sufficient information to make this \n\ndetermination is a particular concern in situations where there is a \n\nchange of operators at the beginning of an agreement, and there is a \n\nperiod of time during which student outcome data, and thus the primary \n\nindicators of performance, reflect the performance of the previous \n\noperator rather than the operator upon whose contract the determination \n\nis being made.\n\n    In order to prevent an entity from being penalized for the poor \n\nperformance of the previous operator, proposed paragraph (e)(1) states \n\nthat information will only be considered to be available for a PY for \n\npurposes of paragraph (d) if for each of the primary indicators of \n\nperformance, all of the students included in the cohort being measured \n\neither began their participation under the current center operator or, \n\nif they began their participation under the previous center operator, \n\nwere on center for at least 6 months under the current operator. Six \n\nmonths represents a sufficient length of time for the efforts of the \n\ncurrent operator to influence the outcomes achieved by a student. \n\nProposed paragraph (e)(2) further provides that if complete information \n\nfor any of the indicators of performance described in paragraph (d)(2) \n\nis not available for either of the 2 PYs described in paragraph (d), \n\nthe Secretary will review partial PY data from the most recent PY for \n\nthose indicators, if at least 2 quarters of data are available, when \n\nmaking the determination required under paragraph (d)(2). The \n\nDepartment recognizes that data for some of the primary indicators of \n\nperformance do not become mature for an extended period of time. For \n\nexample, employment in the fourth quarter after exit and credential \n\nattainment are measured more than a year after the student exits the \n\nprogram and then are reported in a subsequent quarter. Because the \n\nSecretary's decision on whether to exercise the first option year is \n\nnormally made about 18 months after the contract begins, in many cases \n\ncomplete information on employment in the fourth quarter after exit and \n\ncredential attainment will not be available at the time the first \n\noption year decision is made. The Department invites comments on the \n\nissue of information availability, including the threshold for the \n\npoint at which the performance of the center reflects the performance \n\nof the current operator.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) provides a transition provision for \n\n\n\nestablishing the criteria that must be met for an operator to meet the \n\nrequirements of proposed paragraph (d). The transition provisions apply \n\nif any of the PYs described in paragraph (d) precede the implementation \n\nof the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth and \n\nestablishment of the expected levels of performance. While the WIOA \n\nstatute does not include a transition provision, it is necessary to add \n\nsuch a provision because although the WIOA contracting provisions, \n\nincluding this section, go into effect on July 1, 2015, the WIOA \n\nperformance reporting requirements do not go into effect until July 1, \n\n2016. In addition, there will be a gap in time during which initial \n\ndata on the primary indicators of performance is being collected and \n\nbaselines are being established when the expected levels of performance \n\nwill not have been established and therefore, the data described in \n\nparagraph (d)(2) will not yet be available. ETA has modeled the \n\ntransition language in proposed\n\n[[Page 20777]]\n\nparagraph (f) on the transition provision in WIOA sec. 147(b)(3), which \n\nis used to determine whether a center is a high performing center, and \n\nbased on criteria similar to the criteria in proposed paragraph (d). \n\nThe transition bases the determination on similar data points using the \n\nperformance of the Job Corps center regarding the national goals or \n\ntargets established by the Office of the Job Corps under the previous \n\nperformance accountability system, which is the available data that \n\nmost closely aligns with the requirement in paragraph (d). Therefore, \n\nthe Department chose this as the best proxy data available. The \n\nDepartment invites comments on the approach to transitioning from the \n\nWIA to WIOA performance management systems.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (g), implements sec. 147(g)(2) of WIOA, which \n\nprovides an exception to the prohibition against exercising an option \n\nyear for an operator of a low-performing center as determined under \n\nproposed paragraph (d).\n\n    As required in sec. 147(g)(3) of WIOA, if the Secretary exercises a \n\ncontractual option by applying the exception described in proposed \n\nparagraph (g), proposed paragraph (h) requires the Secretary to provide \n\na detailed explanation of the rationale for exercising the option to \n\nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of \n\nRepresentatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n\nPensions of the Senate.\n\nSection 686.340 How are entities selected to receive funding to provide \n\noutreach and admission, career transition and other operational support \n\n\n\nservices?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.340(a) implements sec. 147(a)(2)(A) of WIOA, \n\ngenerally describing the process by which eligible entities are \n\nselected to provide outreach and admissions, career transition, and \n\nother operational support services to the Job Corps program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) requires that the RFP for each support \n\nservice contract describes uniform specifications and standards, as \n\nwell as specifications and requirements that are unique to the \n\noperation of the specific center.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) implements the factors for selection of an \n\nentity to provide operational support services, as established in sec. \n\n147(a)(2)(B)(i) of WIOA, by specifying that the selection criteria will \n\nbe established by the Secretary and set forth in the RFP. The criteria \n\nlisted in proposed paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) are the same as those \n\nin proposed Sec.  686.310(c)(1) through (5). Proposed paragraph (c)(6) \n\nprovides that the Secretary may require additional information or \n\nselection factors in the RFP.\n\nSection 686.350 What conditions apply to the operation of a Civilian \n\nConservation Center?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.350 is a new section that implements sec. 147(d) \n\nof WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a) implements sec. 147(d)(1) of WIOA, \n\nestablishing that the Secretary of Labor may enter into an agreement \n\nwith the Secretary of Agriculture to operate Job Corps centers called \n\nCCCs. Paragraph (a) also contains the description of the \n\ncharacteristics of CCCs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) retains the language in the WIA regulations \n\nat 20 CFR 670.310(e) that when the Secretary of Labor enters into an \n\nagreement with the Secretary of Agriculture for the funding, \n\nestablishment, and operation of CCCs, provisions are included to ensure \n\nthat the Department of Agriculture complies with the regulations under \n\nthis part.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c), implementing sec. 147(d)(2) of WIOA, \n\npermits enrollees in CCCs to provide assistance in addressing national, \n\nState, and local disasters, consistent with relevant child labor laws. \n\nThis proposed paragraph further requires that the Secretary of \n\nAgriculture ensure that enrollees are properly trained, equipped, \n\nsupervised, and dispatched consistent with the standards for the \n\nconservation and rehabilitation of wildlife established under the Fish \n\nand Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) requires the Secretary of Agriculture to \n\ndesignate a Job Corps National Liaison to support the agreement between \n\nthe Departments of Labor and Agriculture to operate CCCs, as required \n\nby sec. 147(d)(3) of WIOA.\n\n\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) permits the Secretary, in consultation with \n\nthe Secretary of Agriculture, to select a private entity to operate a \n\nCCC using the process and requirements described at Sec.  686.310.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) permits the Secretary to close a CCC as part \n\nof the Department's administration of the Job Corps program if it \n\ndetermines that such action would be appropriate.\n\nSection 686.360 What are the requirements for award of contracts and \n\npayments to Federal agencies?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.360 states the requirements and authorities that \n\napply to the award of contracts and payments to Federal agencies. This \n\nsection retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations \n\nat 20 CFR 670.320.\n\n5. Subpart D--Recruitment, Eligibility, Screening, Selection and \n\nAssignment, Enrollment\n\n    This proposed subpart describes who is eligible for Job Corps under \n\nWIOA and provides additional factors that are considered in selecting \n\neligible applicants for enrollment. Also described is how applicants \n\nwho meet eligibility and selection requirements are assigned to \n\ncenters, which implements WIOA's new requirements that the assignment \n\nplan consider the size and enrollment level of a center, including the \n\neducation, training, and supportive services provided, and the \n\nperformance of the Job Corps center related to the newly established \n\nexpected levels of performance. WIOA also amends the assignment plan to \n\nprovide for assignments at the center closest to home that offers the \n\ntype of career and technical training selected by the individual rather \n\nthan just the center closest to home, which improves access to high \n\nquality training for Job Corps students. These proposed regulations \n\nserve to enhance the Job Corps program overall by ensuring that the \n\nindividual training and education needs of applicants and enrollees are \n\nmet in accordance with the requirements of WIOA. They also ensure that \n\napplicants and enrollees are provided accurate information about the \n\nstandards and expectations of the Job Corps program and are fully \n\nprepared to be successful.\n\nSection 686.400 Who is eligible to participate in the Job Corps \n\nprogram?\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) implements the eligibility requirements in \n\nsec. 144(a) of WIOA. According to WIOA, to be eligible to participate \n\nin the Job Corps, an individual must be at least 16 and not more than \n\n24 years old at the time of enrollment, except that: Under proposed \n\nparagraph (a)(1)(i), the Job Corps Director may waive the maximum age \n\nlimitation described in paragraph (a)(1) and the requirement in \n\nparagraph (a)(1)(ii) for an individual with a disability who is \n\notherwise eligible according to the requirements listed in Sec. Sec.  \n\n\n\n686.400 and 686.410. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii) states that not more \n\nthan 20 percent of individuals enrolled nationwide can be aged 22 to 24 \n\nat the time of enrollment. The regulatory language in paragraph \n\n(a)(1)(i) differs from the language in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n670.400(a)(1). The proposed language is intended to enable the Job \n\nCorps Director to admit individuals with disabilities even if they \n\nexceed the age limitations in paragraph\n\n[[Page 20778]]\n\n(a) as long as the Director determines that the individual meets all \n\nthe other eligibility requirements listed in proposed Sec.  686.410.\n\n    In addition to satisfying the age requirements above, proposed \n\nSec.  686.410 lists the additional requirements for a person to be \n\neligible to participate in Job Corps. An individual must also be a low-\n\nincome individual and be facing one or more of the following barriers \n\nto education and employment: Be basic skills deficient, as defined in \n\nWIOA sec. 144(a)(3)(A); be a high school dropout; be homeless, as \n\ndefined in sec. 41043(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 \n\nU.S.C. 14043e-2(6)); be a homeless child or youth, as defined in sec. \n\n725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n\n1143a(2)); a runaway, an individual in foster care, or an individual \n\nwho was in foster care and has aged out of the system; be a parent; or \n\nrequire additional education, career, and technical training, or \n\nworkforce preparation skills in order to obtain and retain employment \n\nthat leads to economic self-sufficiency.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) implements the special eligibility rule for \n\nveterans in sec. 144(b) of WIOA. That rule states that an otherwise \n\neligible veteran may still enroll in Job Corps if they do not meet the \n\nincome requirement at Sec.  686.400(a)(2) as a result of military \n\nincome earned within the 6-month period prior to the individual's \n\napplication for Job Corps, per 38 U.S.C. 4213.\n\nSection 686.410 Are there additional factors which are considered in \n\nselecting an eligible applicant for enrollment?\n\n    In addition to the basic eligibility requirements identified above, \n\nproposed Sec.  686.410 lists several additional criteria that must be \n\nmet before an otherwise eligible applicant may be enrolled in Job \n\nCorps.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) provides, pursuant to sec. 145(a)(2)(C) of \n\nWIOA, that an otherwise eligible applicant can be selected for \n\nenrollment in Job Corps only if a determination is made, based on \n\ninformation relating to the background, needs and interests of the \n\napplicant, that the applicant's education and career and technical \n\nneeds can best be met through the Job Corps program.\n\n\n\n    An additional determination, as described in proposed paragraph \n\n(b), implementing sec. 145(b)(1)(A) of WIOA, must also be made that \n\nthere is a reasonable expectation that the applicant can participate \n\nsuccessfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to: \n\nEngage in actions that would potentially prevent other students from \n\nreceiving the benefit of the program; be incompatible with the \n\nmaintenance of sound discipline; or impede satisfactory relationships \n\nbetween the center to which the student is assigned and the surrounding \n\nlocal communities. These requirements support the vision of Job Corps \n\ncenters as safe environments with a culture that is conducive to \n\nstudent learning and achievement of the academic, technical, and social \n\nskills needed to obtain employment or enter post-secondary education.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) requires that an applicant must also be made \n\naware of and understand the center's rules, the consequences for \n\nfailing to observe the rules, and agree to comply with the rules.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) provides that no one will be denied \n\nenrollment in Job Corps solely on the basis of contact with the \n\ncriminal justice system, except if the individual has been convicted of \n\na felony consisting of murder, child abuse, or a crime involving rape \n\nor sexual assault, in accordance with secs. 145(b)(2) and (3) of WIOA. \n\nAll applicants must also submit to a background check conducted \n\naccording to procedures established by the Secretary and with \n\napplicable State and local laws. If the background check finds that the \n\napplicant is on probation, parole, under a suspended sentence, or under \n\nthe supervision of any agency as a result of court action or \n\ninstitutionalization, the court or appropriate supervising agency may \n\ncertify in writing that it will approve of the applicant's \n\nparticipation in Job Corps, and provide full release from its \n\nsupervision, and that the applicant's participation and release does \n\nnot violate applicable laws and regulations. However, the Department \n\nnotes that although these individuals are eligible, the final admission \n\ndecision remains with the Job Corps.\n\n    Finally, proposed paragraph (e) requires that suitable arrangements \n\nbe made for the care of any dependent children for the proposed period \n\nof enrollment.\n\nSection 686.420 Are there any special requirements for enrollment \n\nrelated to the Military Selective Service Act?\n\n    As required by WIOA sec. 146(a), this proposed section requires \n\neach male applicant 18 years of age or older, or a male student who \n\nturns 18 years of age, to present evidence that he has complied with \n\nsec. 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 451 et \n\nseq.). These requirements are the same as those found at 20 CFR \n\n\n\n670.420.\n\nSection 686.430 What entities conduct outreach and admissions \n\nactivities for the Job Corps program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.430 states that the Secretary makes arrangements \n\nwith outreach and admission agencies to perform Job Corps recruitment, \n\nscreening and admissions functions according to standards and \n\nprocedures issued by the Secretary. Entities eligible to receive funds \n\nto provide outreach and admissions service are identified in Sec.  \n\n686.300(b).\n\nSection 686.440 What are the responsibilities of outreach and \n\nadmissions providers?\n\n    Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section require outreach \n\nand admission providers to perform a number of tasks to recruit and \n\nenroll students, including completing all Job Corps application forms \n\nand determining whether the applicants meet the eligibility and \n\nselection criteria outlined for participation in the program as \n\nprovided in proposed Sec. Sec.  686.400 and 686.410.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) clarifies that the Secretary may require \n\nthat the National Director or his or her designee make determinations \n\nwith regard to one or more of the eligibility criteria.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements as those found \n\nat 20 CFR 670.450.\n\nSection 686.450 How are applicants who meet eligibility and selection \n\ncriteria assigned to centers?\n\n    In accordance with WIOA secs. 145(c) and (d), proposed Sec.  \n\n686.450 describes the process for assigning applicants to Job Corps \n\ncenters.\n\n    Applicants who meet the eligibility and selection requirements of \n\nproposed Sec. Sec.  686.400 and 686.410 are assigned to a center based \n\non an assignment plan developed by the Secretary based on an analysis \n\nof the factors described in proposed paragraph (a). These factors are \n\nspecified in secs. 145(c) and (d) of WIOA. They are similar to the \n\nfactors for the assignment plan required to be developed under WIA, \n\nexcept that sec. 145(c)(2)(D) of WIOA also requires the Secretary to \n\nconsider the performance of the center, as described in proposed Sec.  \n\n686.450(a).\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) describes the general rules for assignment \n\nof individual enrollees, consistent with sec. 145(d) of WIOA.\n\n    In accordance with sec. 145(d)(2) of WIOA, and similar to the same \n\nrequirement in WIA, proposed paragraph (c) mandates that if a parent or \n\nguardian objects to the assignment of\n\n[[Page 20779]]\n\n\n\na student under the age of 18 to a center other than the center closest \n\nto home that offers the desired career and technical training, the \n\nSecretary must not make such an assignment.\n\nSection 686.460 What restrictions are there on the assignment of \n\neligible applicants for nonresidential enrollment in Job Corps?\n\n    In accordance with WIOA sec. 147(c), this proposed section requires \n\nthat no more than 20 percent of students enrolled in Job Corps \n\nnationwide may be nonresidential students.\n\nSection 686.470 May an individual who is determined to be ineligible or \n\nan individual who is denied enrollment appeal that decision?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.470(a) describes the process for an applicant to \n\nappeal a denial of their application.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that if an applicant believes that he \n\nor she has been determined ineligible or not selected for enrollment in \n\nviolation of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions \n\ncontained in sec. 188 of WIOA and at 29 CFR part 37, the individual may \n\nfile a complaint as described by the nondiscrimination regulations at \n\n29 CFR part 37. Finally, proposed paragraph (c) requires that an \n\napplicant denied enrollment be referred to the appropriate one-stop \n\ncenter or other service provider as appropriate.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements as those found \n\nat 20 CFR 670.470.\n\nSection 686.480 At what point is an applicant considered to be enrolled \n\nin Job Corps?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.480 delineates when an applicant is considered \n\nto be enrolled in Job Corps and requires that, based on procedures \n\nissued by the Secretary, center operators must document the enrollment \n\nof new students.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements as those found \n\nat 20 CFR 670.480.\n\nSection 686.490 How long may a student be enrolled in Job Corps?\n\n    This proposed section implements the requirements in sec. 146(b) of \n\nWIOA. Proposed paragraph (a) states the general rule that a student may \n\nremain enrolled in Job Corps for no more than 2 years.\n\n    However, proposed paragraph (b) implements four exceptions to this \n\nrule, consistent with sec. 146(b) of WIOA, which permit the 2 years to \n\nbe extended in specific cases. Paragraph (b)(1) permits the Secretary \n\nto extend the 2 year enrollment period in special cases, according to \n\nprocedures issued by the Secretary. Paragraph (b)(2) permits up to a 1 \n\nyear extension of a student's enrollment in an advanced career training \n\nprogram in order to complete the program. Paragraph (b)(3) permits an \n\nextension for a student with a disability who would reasonably be \n\n\n\nexpected to meet the standards for a Job Corps graduate if allowed to \n\nparticipate in the Job Corps for up to an additional year. Finally, \n\nproposed paragraph (b)(4) permits a student who participates in \n\nnational service authorized by a CCC to have his or her enrollment \n\nextended for the amount of time equal to the period of national \n\nservice. This paragraph (b)(4) implements sec. 146(a)(3) of WIOA. WIOA \n\nalso states that students enrolled in CCCs may provide assistance in \n\naddressing national, State, and local disasters (sec. 147(d)(2) of \n\nWIOA; see proposed Sec.  686.610(a)). Both of these provisions are new \n\nin WIOA. Taken together, these provisions show WIOA's added attention \n\nto ensuring that Job Corps students in CCCs have the flexibility to \n\nprovide assistance, such as fire-fighting, for example, when needed in \n\na disaster. The Department notes that similar to the provision in \n\nproposed Sec.  686.490(b)(4) that addresses national service, the \n\nSecretary is authorized to extend the enrollment period for students \n\nwho perform service to address State and local disasters or other needs \n\nunder proposed Sec.  686.490(b)(1).\n\n6. Subpart E--Program Activities and Center Operations\n\n    This proposed subpart describes the services and training that a \n\nJob Corps center must provide. Job Corps distinguishes itself from \n\nother training programs by providing students with residential services \n\nin combination with hands-on training and experience aligned with \n\nindustry standards. While education, training, and job placement are \n\ncore components of what the program offers, this section of the \n\nregulations describes how Job Corps provides a comprehensive service \n\nmodel that also includes life skills, emotional development, personal \n\nmanagement, and responsibility. New regulations addressing advanced \n\ncareer training programs are included; such programs provide broader \n\nopportunities for higher wages and career advancement.\n\n    This proposed subpart also establishes the requirements for a \n\nstudent accountability system and behavior management system. Job \n\nCorps' policy for violence, drugs, and unauthorized goods is described. \n\nRequirements to ensure students are provided due process in \n\ndisciplinary actions, to include center fact-finding and review board \n\nand appeal procedures are outlined. These systems and requirements \n\nserve to enhance the Job Corps program by ensuring that Job Corps \n\ncenters are safe and secure environments that promote the education and \n\ntraining of students. Approved experimental, research and demonstration \n\nprojects related to the Job Corps program are authorized in this \n\nproposed subpart, which also serves to enhance the program.\n\nSection 686.500 What services must Job Corps centers provide?\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) specifies that Job Corps centers must \n\nprovide an intensive, well-organized and fully supervised program, \n\n\n\nincluding training activities, work-based learning and experience, \n\nresidential support services, and other services as required by the \n\nSecretary.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a)(1) describes training activities to include \n\ncareer and technical training, academic education, and employability \n\nand independent learning and living skills development. Job Corps is \n\nfirst and foremost a career training program, and an essential part of \n\npreparing enrollees for success upon exit necessitates providing \n\nemployability, social, and independent-living skills.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) provides that students must be provided with \n\naccess to career services as described in WIOA secs. 134(c)(2)(A)(i) \n\nthrough (xi).\n\nSection 686.505 What types of training must Job Corps centers provide?\n\n    In order to provide enrollees with the intensive program of \n\nactivities required by WIOA, several types of training must be provided \n\nby Job Corps centers.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) requires that centers provide students with \n\na CTT program that is aligned with industry-recognized standards and \n\ncredentials. Ensuring that training programs are aligned with industry \n\nstandards and credentials better prepares students to attain in-demand, \n\nlong-term employment; further career enhancement along a career \n\npathway; or advanced education, including apprenticeships.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) requires that centers provide an education \n\nprogram, including English language acquisition programs, as required \n\nby sec. 148(a)(1) of WIOA, as well as high school diploma (HSD) or high \n\nschool equivalency certification programs, and academic skills \n\ntraining. These skills are necessary for students to master\n\n[[Page 20780]]\n\ntechnical skills in their chosen CTT programs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) states that centers must provide programs \n\nfor students to learn and practice employability and independent \n\nlearning and living skills. These skills include: Job search and career \n\ndevelopment, interpersonal relations, driver's education (as required \n\nby sec. 148(a)(1) of WIOA), study and critical thinking skills, \n\nfinancial literacy and other skills specified in program guidance \n\nissued by the Secretary. Learning these skills will enable long-term \n\nlabor market attachment and are critical to the continuing success of \n\nenrollees after leaving the Job Corps program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d) requires all Job Corps training programs to \n\nbe based on industry and academic skills standards leading to \n\nrecognized industry and academic credentials, applying evidence-based \n\ninstructional approaches, with the goal of placing students in \n\n\n\nunsubsidized employment in in-demand jobs with career advancement \n\nopportunities; enrollment in advanced education and training programs \n\nor apprenticeships; or enlistment in the Armed Forces. Responsiveness \n\nto employers' and industries' needs for employees who are prepared with \n\nthe academic, technical, and employability skills necessary for career \n\nsuccess is required in order to effectively place students and to \n\nsustain Job Corps' relationships with employers.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (e) requires that specific career and technical \n\ntraining programs offered by individual centers must be approved by the \n\nRegional Director. Approval is necessary to ensure that the training \n\nprovided by Job Corps meets industry workforce needs.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (f) states the responsibilities of the center \n\nworkforce council in shaping a center's career and technical training \n\nprogram, as described in Sec.  686.800.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (g) retains the same requirements as those in \n\nthe WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.505(c), requiring that each center \n\nmust implement a system to evaluate and track the progress and \n\nachievement of each student at regular intervals.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (h) states that each center must develop a \n\ntraining plan that must be available for review and approval by the \n\nappropriate Regional Director. It retains the same requirements as \n\nthose in 20 CFR 670.505(d).\n\nSection 686.510 Are entities other than Job Corps center operators \n\npermitted to provide academic and career and technical training?\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) implements sec. 148(b) of WIOA, which lists \n\nthe entities that the Secretary may use to provide career technical and \n\nacademic education of Job Corps students, as long as the entity can \n\nprovide education and training substantially equivalent in cost and \n\nquality to that which the Secretary could provide through other means.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that these entities will be selected \n\nin accordance with the requirements of Sec.  686.310.\n\nSection 686.515 What are advanced career training programs?\n\n    Advanced career training provides students an opportunity to \n\nreceive advanced education or training while still receiving the \n\nbenefits and services provided by Job Corps. In order to be eligible, \n\nstudents must have a HSD or its equivalent and have completed a Job \n\nCorps CTT program. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) restate the \n\nrequirements for advanced career training programs in secs. 148(c)(1)-\n\n(2) of WIOA.\n\n    Advanced career training programs are authorized by the Secretary \n\nbased on the relationship between on board strength and training slot \n\n\n\navailability. Proposed paragraph (c), which restates the requirements \n\nfound in WIOA sec. 148(c)(3), permits a center operator to enroll more \n\nstudents than otherwise authorized by the Secretary in an advanced \n\ncareer training program if, in accordance with standards developed by \n\nthe Secretary, the operator demonstrates that participants in the \n\nprogram have achieved a satisfactory rate of training and placement in \n\ntraining-related jobs, and for the most recently preceding 2 PYs, the \n\noperator has, on average, met or exceeded the primary indicators for \n\neligible youth described in Sec.  686.980.\n\nSection 686.520 What responsibilities do the center operators have in \n\nmanaging work-based learning?\n\n    This section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.515. Proposed Sec.  686.520(a) requires that \n\ncenter operators emphasize and implement work-based learning programs \n\nfor students through center program activities, including career and \n\ntechnical skills training, and through arrangements with employers. \n\nThis paragraph further requires that work-based learning must be under \n\nactual working conditions and be designed to enhance the employability, \n\nresponsibility, and confidence of the students. Work-based learning \n\nusually occurs in tandem with students' career and technical training, \n\nand is intended to develop a further understanding of career \n\nopportunities, employer expectations, and the impact of post-secondary \n\neducation in the workplace. Work-based learning can include structured, \n\nhands-on experiences, as well as workplace tours, employer \n\npresentations, and job shadowing to help students refine their career \n\nobjectives.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b), in accordance with sec. 159(g)(2) of WIOA, \n\nstates that the center operator must ensure that the students are \n\nassigned only to workplaces that meet the safety standards described in \n\nSec.  686.920.\n\nSection 686.525 Are students permitted to hold jobs other than work-\n\nbased learning opportunities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.525 states that a center operator may authorize \n\na student to participate in gainful leisure time employment, as long as \n\nthe employment does not interfere with required scheduled academic and \n\nCTT activities. This section retains the same requirements as those in \n\nthe WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.520.\n\nSection 686.530 What residential support services must Job Corps center \n\n\n\noperators provide?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.530 states that Job Corps center operators must \n\nprovide residential support services according to procedures issued by \n\nthe Secretary. Residential support services are critical for the \n\nsuccess of the Job Corps programs because they are central to creating \n\nand maintaining environments that allow enrollees to learn, practice \n\nindependent and community living skills, promote personal \n\nresponsibility, and reinforce social and employability skills, such as \n\na positive attitude, dependability, and teamwork. This proposed section \n\nretains largely the same requirements as those contained in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.525.\n\n    The Department notes that one of the requirements is that a student \n\nleadership program and an elected student government is supported by \n\nthe center operator. The goals of student leadership programs are to \n\nprovide opportunities for interested students to develop leadership \n\nskills through participation in student governance, representing Job \n\nCorps in the community at large, planning and leading Job Corps events, \n\nand providing input and feedback for center\n\n[[Page 20781]]\n\nmanagement decisions that impact student services and/or residential \n\nliving.\n\nSection 686.535 Are Job Corps centers required to maintain a student \n\naccountability system?\n\n    Job Corps centers are required to maintain a student accountability \n\nsystem, as described at proposed Sec.  686.535. This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements as those contained in the WIA regulations \n\nat 20 CFR 670.530. An accountability system is important to ensure the \n\nsafety and security of Job Corps students and to track participation in \n\nvarious activities in order to evaluate program delivery.\n\nSection 686.540 Are Job Corps centers required to establish behavior \n\nmanagement systems?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.540 states that each Job Corps center must \n\nestablish and maintain a behavior management system, based on a \n\nbehavior management plan, consistent with the standards of conduct and \n\nprocedures established by the Secretary. The behavior management plan \n\nmust be approved by the Job Corps regional office and reviewed \n\nannually. The system must include Job Corps' zero tolerance policy for \n\nviolence and drugs as described in Sec.  686.545.\n\nSection 686.545 What is Job Corps' zero tolerance policy?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.545(a) requires all center operators to comply \n\nwith Job Corps' zero tolerance policy as established by the Secretary. \n\nInfractions addressed in the zero tolerance policy must include, but \n\n\n\nare not limited to: Actions of violence, as defined by the Secretary; \n\nuse, sale, or possession of a controlled substance, as defined at 21 \n\nU.S.C. 802; abuse of alcohol; possession of unauthorized goods; or \n\nother illegal or disruptive activity.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) implements secs. 145(a)(2)(A) and 152(b)(2) \n\nof WIOA, providing that all students must be tested for drugs as a \n\ncondition of enrollment.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) provides that the zero tolerance policy \n\nestablished by the Secretary specifies the offenses that will result in \n\nthe separation of students from the Job Corps. This paragraph further \n\nprovides that the center director is expressly responsible for \n\ndetermining when such an offense has occurred.\n\nSection 686.550 How does Job Corps ensure that students receive due \n\nprocess in disciplinary actions?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.550 provides that a center operator must ensure \n\nthat all students receive due process in disciplinary proceedings \n\naccording to procedures developed by the Secretary. This proposed \n\nsection retains the same requirements as those contained in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.545.\n\nSection 686.555 What responsibilities do Job Corps centers have in \n\nassisting students with child care needs?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.555 implements the requirement in sec. 148(e) of \n\nWIOA that the Secretary provide for child care to the extent \n\npracticable. Proposed paragraph (a) encourages Job Corps centers to \n\ncoordinate with outreach and admissions agencies to assist applicants, \n\nwhenever feasible, with making arrangements for child care. This \n\nparagraph also requires that, prior to enrollment, a program applicant \n\nwith dependent children who provides primary or custodial care must \n\ncertify that suitable arrangements for child care have been established \n\nfor the proposed period of enrollment. This is necessary to ensure full \n\nprogram participation once a student is enrolled.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that a child development program may \n\nbe located at a Job Corps center with the approval of the Secretary.\n\nSection 686.560 What are the center's responsibilities in ensuring that \n\nstudents' religious rights are respected?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.560 retains the same requirements found in the \n\nWIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.555.\n\nSection 686.565 Is Job Corps authorized to conduct pilot and \n\ndemonstration projects?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.565(a) establishes that the Secretary may \n\nundertake experimental, research and demonstration projects related to \n\nthe Job Corps program as long as the projects are developed, approved, \n\nand conducted in accordance with the policies and procedures developed \n\n\n\nby the Secretary, in accordance with sec. 156(a) of WIOA.\n\n7. Subpart F--Student Support\n\n    Proposed subpart F discusses the support services provided to Job \n\nCorps enrollees, including transportation to and from Job Corps \n\ncenters, authorized student leave, allowances and performance bonuses, \n\nand student clothing. In addition to being eligible to receive \n\ntransportation to and from Job Corps centers, students are eligible for \n\nother benefits, including basic living allowances to cover personal \n\nexpenses, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary. Students \n\nare also provided with a modest clothing allowance to enable them to \n\npurchase clothes that are appropriate for the classroom and the \n\nworkplace. These proposed regulations again work to strengthen the Job \n\nCorps program and provide access to high quality training by ensuring \n\nthat Job Corps students are placed in the best possible position to \n\nprepare them for learning, and that they are rewarded for their success \n\nin the program.\n\nSection 686.600 Are students provided with government-paid \n\ntransportation to and from Job Corps centers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.600 states that Job Corps provides students with \n\ntransportation to and from Job Corps centers, according to policies and \n\nprocedures established by the Secretary. This section retains the same \n\nrequirements as those in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.600.\n\nSection 686.610 When are students authorized to take leaves of absence \n\nfrom their Job Corps centers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.610 provides that Job Corps students are \n\neligible for annual leave, emergency leave, and other types of leaves \n\nof absence from their assigned centers. Procedures for requesting, \n\napproving, and recording student leave will be based on criteria and \n\nrequirements issued by the Secretary. This section retains the same \n\nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.610. \n\nAdditionally, proposed Sec.  686.600(a) states that in accordance with \n\nsec. 147(d)(2) of WIOA, enrollees in CCCs may take leave to provide \n\nassistance in addressing national, State, and local disasters.\n\nSection 686.620 Are Job Corps students eligible to receive cash \n\nallowances and performance bonuses?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.620(a) allows, based on criteria and rates \n\nestablished by the Secretary, Job Corps students to receive cash living \n\nallowances, performance bonuses, and allotments for care of dependents. \n\nAlso, graduates receive post-separation transition allowances according \n\nto proposed Sec.  686.750. This paragraph largely retains the same \n\nrequirements in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.620(a), but revises \n\nthe description of the payments to align with sec. 150(b) of WIOA.\n\n\n\n    Under proposed paragraph (b), in the case of a student's death, any \n\namount due is to be paid according to 5 U.S.C. 5582, governing issues \n\nincluding designation of a beneficiary, order of precedent, and related \n\nmatters. This paragraph retains the same requirements as those found at \n\n20 CFR 670.620(b).\n\n[[Page 20782]]\n\nSection 686.630 Are student allowances subject to Federal payroll \n\ntaxes?\n\n    As required by sec. 157(a)(2) of WIOA, proposed Sec.  686.630 \n\nrequires that Job Corps student allowances be subject to Federal \n\npayroll tax withholding and Social Security taxes. For purposes of the \n\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 and title II of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 401 et \n\nseq.), enrollees are deemed to be employees of the United States.\n\nSection 686.640 Are students provided with clothing?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.640 provides that, according to rates, criteria, \n\nand procedures issued by the Secretary, center operators and other \n\nservice providers must provide Job Corps students with a clothing \n\nallowance and/or articles of clothing as needed to facilitate their \n\nparticipation in Job Corps and successful entry into the workforce. \n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.640.\n\n8. Subpart G--Career Transition and Graduate Services\n\n    This proposed subpart discusses career transition and graduate \n\nservices for Job Corps enrollees. Job Corps focuses on placing program \n\ngraduates in full time jobs, post-secondary education, advanced \n\ntraining programs, including apprenticeship programs, or the Armed \n\nForces. In an effort to further integrate the Job Corps program with \n\nthe greater workforce system and align it with the core programs, \n\nproposed Sec.  686.820 specifically focuses on how Job Corps will \n\ncoordinate with other agencies, where emphasis is placed on utilizing \n\nthe one-stop delivery system to the maximum extent practicable. This \n\nproposed subpart also outlines a center's responsibilities in preparing \n\nstudents for career transition services; the career transition services \n\nthat are provided for enrollees; who m6ay provide career transition and \n\ngraduate services, in addition to one-stop centers; and services \n\nprovided for graduates and former enrollees.\n\nSection 686.700 What are a Job Corps center's responsibilities in \n\npreparing students for career transition services?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.700 implements sec. 149(a) of WIOA, providing \n\nthat Job Corps centers assess and counsel enrollees to determine their \n\ncompetencies and capabilities and readiness for career transition \n\nservices prior to their scheduled graduation. The purpose of counseling \n\n\n\nand assessment is to determine students' capabilities to allow them to \n\neither be placed into employment leading to self-sufficiency based on \n\ntheir training, or to assist the student in participating in further \n\nactivities leading to the capabilities necessary for placement.\n\nSection 686.710 What career transition services are provided for Job \n\nCorps enrollees?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.710 implements sec. 149(b) of WIOA, requiring \n\nthat career transition services focus on placing program graduates in \n\nfull time jobs that are related to their career and technical training \n\nand that lead to economic self-sufficiency; higher education; advanced \n\ntraining programs, including apprenticeship programs; or the Armed \n\nForces.\n\nSection 686.720 Who provides career transition services?\n\n    As required by sec. 149(b) of WIOA, proposed Sec.  686.720 states \n\nthat the one-stop delivery system must be used to the maximum extent \n\npracticable in placing graduates and former enrollees in jobs. Multiple \n\nother resources can also provide post-program services, including, but \n\nnot limited to, Job Corps career transition service providers and State \n\nVR agencies for individuals with disabilities.\n\nSection 686.730 What are the responsibilities of career transition \n\nservice providers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.730 contains the responsibilities of career \n\ntransition service providers. The section largely retains the same \n\nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.730.\n\nSection 686.740 What services are provided for program graduates?\n\n    As required by sec. 148(d) of WIOA, proposed Sec.  686.740 states \n\nthat career transition and support services must be provided to program \n\ngraduates for up to 12 months after graduation, according to procedures \n\nissued by the Secretary.\n\nSection 686.750 Are graduates provided with transition allowances?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.750 states that Job Corps graduates receive \n\npost-separation transition allowances. As required by sec. 150(b) of \n\nWIOA, the transition allowance must be incentive-based to reflect a \n\ngraduate's completion of academic, career, and technical education or \n\ntraining, and attainment of recognized post-secondary credentials.\n\nSection 686.760 What services are provided to former enrollees?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.760(a) implements sec. 150(c) of WIOA, allowing \n\nfor the provision of 3 months of ESs to former enrollees.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that Job Corps centers may provide \n\nother assessment, counseling, or career transition services to help \n\nformer enrollees find and retain employment, if determined appropriate, \n\naccording to procedures issued by the Secretary.\n\n9. Subpart H--Community Connections\n\n\n\n    This proposed subpart highlights WIOA's focus on community \n\nrelationships and further integration with the workforce system. In \n\nboth the new contracting provisions in proposed subpart C and in this \n\nsubpart, there is more emphasis on connections with one-stops, Local \n\nBoards, and State and local plans. While WIA's requirement for a \n\nBusiness and Community Liaison has been eliminated, the responsibility \n\nfor establishing beneficial business and community relationships and \n\nnetworks now lies with the director of each Job Corps center. Moreover, \n\nWIOA contains a new requirement that in a single-State local area, a \n\nrepresentative of the State Board must be included on the workforce \n\ncouncil. Proposed Sec.  686.810 also states, consistent with sec. \n\n154(b)(2) of WIOA, that the workforce council may include employers \n\nfrom outside the local area that are likely to hire center graduates. \n\nThe new requirements for the workforce council seek to provide greater \n\naccess to high quality training for Job Corps students, in part by \n\nensuring that Job Corps is providing training in in-demand industry \n\nsectors and occupations.\n\nSection 686.800 How do Job Corps centers and service providers become \n\ninvolved in their local communities?\n\n    While WIA's requirement for a Business and Community Liaison \n\ndesignated by the director of each center has been eliminated, the \n\ndirector of each Job Corps center must still ensure that mutually \n\nbeneficial business and community relationships and networks are \n\nestablished and developed. As required by sec. 153 of WIOA, proposed \n\nSec.  686.800(a) states that each Job Corps center director must \n\nestablish relationships with local and distant employers; applicable \n\none-stop centers and Local Boards; entities carrying out relevant \n\napprenticeship programs and youth programs; labor-management \n\norganizations and local labor organizations; employers and contractors \n\nthat support national training programs and initiatives; and CBOs, non-\n\nprofit organizations, and intermediaries providing workforce \n\ndevelopment and support services. Through these relationships, Job \n\nCorps\n\n[[Page 20783]]\n\nhopes to improve the quality of the training programs that it offers \n\nand create meaningful associations with other entities with which it \n\ninteracts and shares similar goals.\n\n    Under proposed paragraph (b), each Job Corps center must also \n\nestablish and develop relationships with members of the community in \n\nwhich it is located. This paragraph further proposes that members of \n\n\n\nthe community be informed of projects of the center and changes in the \n\nrules, procedures, or activities of the center that may affect the \n\ncommunity. Through these efforts, Job Corps aims to garner the support \n\nand endorsement of the local community.\n\nSection 686.810 What is the makeup of a workforce council and what are \n\nits responsibilities?\n\n    Section 154 of WIOA requires each center to establish a workforce \n\ncouncil according to procedures established by the Secretary. Proposed \n\nSec.  686.810 implements this provision. It specifies that the council \n\nmust include: non-governmental and private sector employers; \n\nrepresentatives of labor organizations and employees; Job Corps \n\nenrollees and graduates; and, in the case of a single State local area, \n\na representative of the State Board.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) describes the composition of the workforce \n\ncouncil, consistent with the requirements of sec. 154(b) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) states that the workforce council may also \n\ninclude, or otherwise provide for consultation with, employers from \n\noutside the local area who are likely to hire a significant number of \n\nenrollees from the Job Corps center.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (d)(1) implements sec. 154(c)(1) of WIOA by \n\nidentifying that the first responsibility of the workforce council is \n\nto work with all applicable Local Boards and review labor market \n\ninformation to determine and provide recommendations to the Secretary \n\nregarding the center's career and technical training offerings, \n\nincluding identifying the emerging occupations suitable for training. \n\nIn doing so, Job Corps hopes to remain current in its CTT offerings, \n\nadjusting and supplementing its training offerings based on the needs \n\nof industry in the surrounding communities.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.810(d)(2) and (3) state the remaining duties of \n\nthe workforce council, in accordance with secs. 154(c)(2)-(3) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.820 How will Job Corps coordinate with other agencies?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.820 describes how Job Corps coordinates with \n\nother agencies. This section retains the same requirements found in the \n\nWIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.760 and 20 CFR 670.800(g). Paragraph (b) \n\nof this section describes the linkages required between Job Corps and \n\nthe one-stop service system and paragraph (c) indicates that Job Corps \n\nis identified as a required one-stop partner. The Department notes that \n\nin addition to these linkages, similar to the requirement in WIA, \n\nproposed Sec.  678.400 identifies Job Corps as a required one-stop \n\npartner, as required by sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) of WIOA. Additionally, \n\nsimilar to the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.800(g), proposed Sec.  \n\n\n\n678.415 specifies that the Job Corps center is the Job Corps ``entity'' \n\nthat is required to serve as the one-stop partner in any local area \n\nwhere a center exists. Job Corps centers are encouraged to review the \n\nrequirements of one-stop partners described in subpart B of part 678 of \n\nthese proposed regulations.\n\n10. Subpart I--Administrative and Management Provisions\n\n    The proposed subpart provides requirements relating to tort claims, \n\nFederal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) benefits for students, safety \n\nand health, and law enforcement jurisdiction on Job Corps center \n\nproperty. It also addresses whether Job Corp operators and service \n\nproviders are authorized to pay State or local taxes on gross receipts, \n\nand details the financial management responsibilities of center \n\noperators and other service providers. The management of student \n\nrecords, as well as procedures applicable to the disclosure of \n\ninformation about Job Corps students and program activities are \n\noutlined. Finally, procedures available to resolve complaints and \n\ndisputes, and how Job Corps ensures that complaints or disputes are \n\nresolved in a timely fashion, are addressed. The entirety of this \n\nproposed subpart addressing administrative and management principles \n\nthat apply to the operation of the Job Corps program serves to promote \n\nits accountability and transparency.\n\nSection 686.900 Are damages caused by the acts or omissions of students \n\neligible for payment under the Federal Tort Claims Act?\n\n    In accordance with sec. 157(a)(4) of WIOA, proposed Sec.  686.900 \n\nstates that students are considered Federal employees for purposes of \n\nthe FTCA (28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq.) and that claims for such damage must \n\nbe filed pursuant to the procedures found in 29 CFR part 15, subpart D. \n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements as those found in \n\nthe WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.900.\n\nSection 686.905 Are loss and damages that occur to persons or personal \n\nproperty of students at Job Corps centers eligible for reimbursement?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.905 states that the Job Corps program may pay \n\nstudents for valid claims under the procedures found in 29 CFR part 15, \n\nsubpart D. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at \n\n20 CFR 670.905.\n\nSection 686.910 If a student is injured in the performance of duty as a \n\nJob Corps student, what benefits may the student receive?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.910 implements sec. 157(a)(3) of WIOA. Paragraph \n\n(a) states that Job Corps students are considered Federal employees for \n\npurposes of the FECA, as specified in sec. 157(a)(3) of WIOA (29 U.S.C. \n\n2897). Proposed paragraphs (b) through (d) outline the requirements for \n\nJob Corps students' eligibility for FECA benefits and the procedures by \n\nwhich the benefits are paid. These paragraphs contain the same \n\n\n\nrequirements as those in Sec.  670.910 of the WIA regulations.\n\nSection 686.915 When is a Job Corps student considered to be in the \n\nperformance of duty?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.915 outlines when a Job Corps student is \n\nconsidered to be in the performance of duty. This proposed section \n\nretains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.915.\n\nSection 686.920 How are students protected from unsafe or unhealthy \n\nsituations?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.920(a) states that the Secretary will establish \n\nprocedures to ensure that students are not required or permitted to \n\nwork, be trained, reside in, or receive services in buildings or \n\nsurroundings or under conditions that are unsanitary or hazardous. This \n\nsection further states, consistent with sec. 159(g)(2) of WIOA, that \n\nwhenever students are employed or in training for jobs, they must be \n\nassigned only to jobs or training which observe applicable Federal, \n\nState, and local health and safety standards. This proposed paragraph \n\nretains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 670.935.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that the Secretary will develop \n\nprocedures to ensure compliance with applicable DOL Occupational Safety \n\nand Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and Wage and Hour Division \n\n(WHD) regulations.\n\n[[Page 20784]]\n\nSection 686.925 What are the requirements for criminal law enforcement \n\njurisdiction on center property?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.925 provides information about criminal law \n\nenforcement jurisdiction on Job Corps center property.

This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR \n\n670.960.\n\nSection 686.950 What procedures apply to disclosure of information \n\nabout Job Corps students and program activities?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.950 discusses the procedures that apply to \n\ndisclosure of information about Job Corps students and program \n\nactivities.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements as those found \n\nat 20 CFR 670.965.\n\nSection 686.955 What are the reporting requirements for center \n\noperators and operational support service providers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.955 states that the Secretary will establish \n\nprocedures to ensure the timely and complete reporting of necessary \n\nfinancial and program information to maintain accountability. Under \n\nthis section, center operators and operational support service \n\nproviders are responsible for the accuracy and integrity of all reports \n\nand data they provide. This proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.970.\n\nSection 686.960 What procedures are available to resolve complaints and \n\ndisputes?\n\n    In support of the Department's commitment to ensuring that students \n\nare entitled to a fair process, proposed Sec.  686.960 outlines the \n\nprocedures that are available to resolve student complaints and \n\ndisputes. This section retains the same requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.991.\n\nSection 686.965 How does Job Corps ensure that complaints or disputes \n\nare resolved in a timely fashion?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.965 outlines the procedures that are available \n\n\n\nto ensure timely resolution of a complaint or dispute. This section \n\nretains the same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.991.\n\nSection 686.970 How does Job Corps ensure that centers or other service \n\nproviders comply with the Act and the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act regulations?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.970 explains the procedures Job Corps will use \n\nto ensure Job Corps center operators and other service providers comply \n\nwith WIOA and this part. This proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 670.992.\n\nSection 686.975 How does Job Corps ensure that contract disputes will \n\nbe resolved?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.975 states that a dispute between the Department \n\nand a Job Corps contractor will be handled according to the Contract \n\nDisputes Act and applicable regulations. This proposed section retains \n\nthe same requirements as those found at 20 CFR 670.993.\n\nSection 686.980 How does Job Corps resolve disputes between the U.S. \n\nDepartment of Labor and the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding \n\nthe operation of Civilian Conservation Centers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.980 states that disputes between the Department \n\nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding operating a center \n\nwill be handled according to the interagency agreement between the two \n\nagencies. This proposed section retains the same requirements as those \n\nfound at 20 CFR 670.994.\n\nSection 686.985 What Department of Labor equal opportunity and \n\nnondiscrimination regulations apply to Job Corps?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.985 states that nondiscrimination requirements, \n\nprocedures, complaint processing, and compliance reviews would be \n\ngoverned by provisions of the Department's regulations, as applicable. \n\nThis proposed section retains the same requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 670.995.\n\n11. Subpart J--Performance\n\n    Proposed subpart J incorporates WIOA-specific requirements related \n\nto performance assessment and accountability, as well as requirements \n\nfor performance improvement plans for Job Corps center operators who \n\nfail to meet expected levels of performance. The Job Corps program is \n\nnow required to report on the performance indicators common to all WIOA \n\nprograms that provide key employment information on how many students \n\nentered and retained employment, their median wages, whether they \n\nattained credentials, their measurable skills gains, and effectiveness \n\nof services to employers. The entirety of this proposed subpart serves \n\nto promote the accountability, performance, and transparency of the Job \n\n\n\nCorps program.\n\nSection 686.1000 How is the performance of the Job Corps program \n\nassessed?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1000 describes the performance management system \n\nthe Secretary will establish to meet the requirements for management \n\ninformation in sec. 159 of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) indicates that the performance of the Job \n\nCorps program as a whole, and the performance of individual centers, \n\noutreach and admission providers, and career transition service \n\nproviders, will be assessed in accordance with required procedures and \n\nstandards issued by the Secretary, through a national\n\n[[Page 20785]]\n\nperformance management system described in proposed paragraph (b) that \n\nincludes the Outcome Measurement System (OMS). The Department proposes \n\nto continue its use of a national performance management system that \n\nincludes the OMS because such a system is needed to track and report \n\nall of the management information required in sec. 159 of WIOA. The \n\nmanagement information requirements include establishing expected \n\nlevels of performance and collecting and reporting data on each \n\ncenter's performance relating to the primary indicators of performance \n\nfor eligible youth, the performance indicators for outreach and \n\nadmission providers, and the performance indicators for career \n\ntransition service providers required under WIOA sec. 159(c); \n\ncollecting and reporting data on each center's performance relating to \n\nthe additional information required to be submitted in the annual \n\nreport to Congress under sec. 159(d) of WIOA; collecting and reporting \n\ninformation regarding the state of Job Corps buildings and facilities \n\nunder sec. 159(h) of WIOA; and collecting and reporting information \n\nregarding national and community service activities of enrollees under \n\nsec. 159(i) of WIOA.\n\n    Consistent with current practice, proposed paragraph (b) states \n\nthat the performance management system will include measures that \n\nreflect not only the primary indicators of performance described in \n\nproposed Sec.  686.1010, but also the information needed to complete \n\nthe Annual Report described in proposed Sec.  686.1040, as well as any \n\nother information the Secretary determines is necessary to manage and \n\nevaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps program.\n\n    Job Corps' performance management system, which includes the OMS, \n\nis a well-established measurement system within the Job Corps community \n\nthat has been used to track performance of centers and service \n\n\n\nproviders for many years. It will be updated to reflect the new \n\nrequirements of WIOA, including the new primary indicators of \n\nperformance. The performance management system is designed to provide \n\nthe Secretary with the information necessary to manage and evaluate the \n\neffectiveness of the Job Corps program. It currently includes data on \n\nthe WIA common measures, each center's success in filling student slots \n\nor on-board strength (OBS), information on the results of Regional \n\nOffice Center Assessments, and the OMS.\n\n    The OMS currently includes the following 15 measures: HSD or \n\nGeneral Educational Development (GED) Attainment Rate, CTT Completion \n\nRate, Combination HSD or GED, and CTT Attainment Rate, Average Literacy \n\nGain, Average Numeracy Gain, CTT Industry-Recognized Credential \n\nAttainment Rate, CTT Completer Job-Training Match/Post-secondary Credit \n\nPlacement Rate, Former Enrollee Initial Placement Rate, Graduate \n\nInitial Placement Rate, Graduate Average Hourly Wage at Placement, \n\nGraduate Full-Time Job Placement Rate, Graduate 6-Month Follow-up \n\nPlacement Rate, Graduate 6-Month Average Weekly Earnings, Graduate 12-\n\nMonth Follow-up Placement Rate, and Graduate 12-Month Follow-up Weekly \n\nEarnings. These measures are based on the current performance \n\nrequirements under WIA, and in some cases break down an overarching \n\nmeasure to provide a more detailed look at elements that make up the \n\noverarching measures. For example, one of the WIA common measures is \n\nthe percent of students who achieve literacy or numeracy gains. In the \n\nOMS, literacy gains and numeracy gains are broken into two separate \n\nmeasures that provide program managers with an additional level of \n\ndetail. A center may be achieving a high level of literacy gains but \n\nlagging in numeracy gains. In the combined measure that distinction \n\nwould be hidden, but with the broken out measure, program managers can \n\nmore specifically identify where to target interventions to support \n\nachievement of the overall common measure. Similarly, the OMS will be \n\nupdated to reflect the primary indicators, but may also include \n\nbreakouts of data that will help program managers target interventions \n\nin order to achieve the primary indicators.\n\n    Four of the new primary indicators of performance under WIOA are \n\nlong-term measures, meaning that the point of measurement is as much as \n\na year after a student exits the Job Corps program. These measures are \n\nvaluable in assessing the performance of the program, but additional \n\nshorter-term measures are needed to supplement the primary indicators \n\nand provide program managers with information on a quicker cycle that \n\ncan be used to make adjustments in the program on a faster timeframe. \n\nThis includes measures such as the CTT completion rate, which provides \n\n\n\nuseful information about the quality of the training programs at a \n\ncenter without waiting for the student outcome data to become fully \n\navailable. When updating the OMS, the Department will begin to \n\nincorporate the primary indicators and other measures that will drive \n\nthe system towards attainment of the WIOA primary indicators, while \n\nstill maintaining other shorter-term measures that will provide \n\nadditional information that the Secretary believes is necessary to \n\nmanage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps program. The \n\nDepartment welcomes comments on this approach, and specifically on \n\nwhich short-term measures should be maintained in the new OMS system.\n\n    Over the years as program reporting requirements have changed from \n\nthe Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Program \n\nAssessment and Rating Tool (PART), and Common Measures, the OMS has \n\nproven to be flexible and through its mix of measures, goals, and \n\nweights, and successful in driving the system towards meeting changing \n\npriorities. For example, when additional emphasis was placed on longer \n\nterm attachment to the workforce, Job Corps added 12-month placement \n\nand 12-month earnings to the existing line-up of measures included on \n\nthe OMS as a clear indication to program operators of the new priority. \n\nSimilarly, beginning in PY 2016, the OMS will be updated to reflect the \n\nnew primary indicators of performance under WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) also indicates that the Secretary will issue \n\nannual guidance describing the performance management system and OMS. \n\nThis guidance will describe any changes or updates to the overall \n\nperformance management system or the OMS and also communicate the \n\nexpected levels of performance for each indicator for each center, \n\noutreach and admission provider, and career transition service provider \n\ndescribed in Sec.  686.1030 to the system.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1000(c), implementing sec. 159(f)(1) of WIOA, \n\nindicates that annual performance assessments based on the measures \n\nreferenced in proposed paragraph (b) will be done for each center \n\noperator and other service providers, including outreach and admission \n\nproviders and career transition providers. These annual assessments \n\nwill include a review of the data in the OMS, a calculation of the \n\nannual performance ranking as described in proposed Sec.  686.1070, and \n\nan analysis of the operator or service provider's success at meeting \n\nthe expected levels of performance, including consideration of any \n\nfactors influencing the performance outcomes such as disruption in the \n\noperations of the center, economic conditions, or other factors.\n\n\n\n[[Page 20786]]\n\nSection 686.1010 What are the primary indicators of performance for Job \n\nCorps centers and the Job Corps program?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1010 implements WIOA sec. 159(c)(1), which \n\nrequires the use of the primary indicators of performance for eligible \n\nyouth as described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA for the Job Corps \n\nprogram and each center. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (f) are the \n\nprimary indicators of performance for eligible youth as described in \n\nsec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA. These measures of performance are the \n\nsame as the primary indicators discussed in proposed Sec.  677.155. \n\nThough the indicators of performance are identified in various places \n\nthroughout the WIOA proposed regulations, the indicators are the same \n\nand do not vary across the regulations.\n\nSection 686.1020 What are the indicators of performance for Job Corps \n\noutreach and admissions providers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1020 implements sec. 159(c)(2) of WIOA, which \n\nrequires that the Secretary establish performance indicators and \n\nexpected levels of performance on those indicators for recruitment \n\nservice providers serving the Job Corps program. The performance \n\nmanagement system and OMS will be updated to reflect the new \n\nperformance measures for Job Corps outreach and admissions providers. \n\nProposed paragraphs (a) through (d) are the indicators of performance \n\nas provided in sec. 159(c)(2) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.1030 What are the indicators of performance for Job Corps \n\ncareer transition service providers?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1030 implements sec. 159(c)(3) of WIOA, which \n\nrequires that the Secretary establish performance indicators and \n\nexpected levels of performance on those indicators for career \n\ntransition service providers serving the Job Corps program. The \n\nperformance management system and OMS will be updated to reflect the \n\nnew performance measures for Job Corps Career Transition Service \n\nproviders. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (g) are the indicators of \n\nperformance as provided in sec. 159(c)(3) of WIOA.\n\nSection 686.1040 What information will be collected for use in the \n\nAnnual Report?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1040 implements sec. 159(c)(4) of WIOA, which \n\nrequires the Secretary to collect information and submit an Annual \n\nReport on the performance of each Job Corps center and the Job Corps \n\nprogram. The Department is including this proposed section so that the \n\nJob Corps community is made aware of the information that will be \n\ncollected. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (p) specify the information \n\n\n\nrequired to be included by secs. 159(c)(4)(A)-(B) and 159(d)(1)(A)-(N) \n\nof WIOA. Proposed paragraph (q) reflects the information required to be \n\nincluded by sec. 159(h) of WIOA, and proposed paragraph (r) reflects \n\nthe information required by sec. 159(i) of WIOA.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (s) states that the Secretary may collect and \n\ninclude additional information in the Annual Report that the Secretary \n\ndetermines is necessary. Any such information would be collected as \n\npart of the performance management system and identified in the annual \n\nguidance described in Sec.  686.1000.\n\nSection 686.1050 How are the expected levels of performance for Job \n\nCorps centers, outreach and admission providers and career transition \n\nservice providers established?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1050(a) implements secs. 159(c)(1)-(3) of WIOA, \n\nwhich require that the Secretary establish expected levels of \n\nperformance for Job Corps centers, outreach and admission providers, \n\nand career transition service providers, and the Job Corps program \n\nrelating to each of the primary indicators of performance described in \n\nSec. Sec.  686.1010, 686.1020 and 686.1030. In order to develop \n\nexpected levels of performance for the primary indicators, the \n\nDepartment will first examine past performance specific to the new \n\nmeasures. Since several of the employment-related indicators are \n\nintended to utilize State wage records, this will involve a process of \n\ndeveloping quarterly earnings specifications as well as developing an \n\ninfrastructure to align WRIS data with Job Corps survey data at the \n\ncenter level. Expected levels of performance can more readily be \n\ndeveloped for the credential attainment and skill gains indicators \n\nusing past performance aligned to the timeframes required by WIOA. Job \n\nCorps will also continue to use a regression model to statistically \n\nadjust for local economic conditions and participant characteristics at \n\nthe center level similar to regression models used for other programs \n\nunder WIOA. The Department anticipates that after implementation of the \n\nnew primary indicators, there will be a period of at least 1 PY where \n\nbaseline data are collected on each of the primary indicators and there \n\nis no expected level of performance in place. Once baseline data has \n\nbeen collected, the Department will begin to establish expected levels \n\nof performance.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) states that as provided in Sec.  686.1000, \n\nthe Secretary will issue annual guidance describing the national \n\nperformance management system. This guidance will also communicate the \n\n\n\nexpected levels of performance for each center and each indicator of \n\nperformance for each outreach and admissions provider and each career \n\ntransition service provider. This guidance will also describe how the \n\nexpected levels of performance were calculated.\n\nSection 686.1070 How are center rankings established?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1070(a) states that the Secretary will calculate \n\nthe annual rankings of center performance based on the performance \n\nmanagement system described in proposed Sec.  686.1000. As described \n\nabove in the explanation of proposed Sec.  686.1000, Job Corps' OMS is \n\na well-established measurement system within the Job Corps community \n\nthat has been used to track performance of centers and service \n\nproviders for many years, and it will be updated to reflect the new \n\nrequirements of WIOA, including the new primary indicators of \n\nperformance. It is designed to drive the system to meet programmatic \n\ngoals, which under WIOA will be established through the primary \n\nindicators of performance. As described above, the OMS will be updated \n\nto reflect the primary indicators of performance and may also include \n\nother measures that will drive the system towards attainment of the \n\nprimary indicators or that provide more detailed information about \n\nelements that make up the primary indictors that the Secretary believes \n\nare necessary to manage and evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps \n\nprogram.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1070(b) states that the Secretary will issue \n\nannual guidance that communicates the methodology for calculating the \n\nperformance rankings for the year. This guidance will include any \n\nchanges in the weighting of individual measures in the calculation. The \n\nDepartment expects to weigh measures reflecting the attainment of the \n\nprimary indicators most heavily. However, the Department anticipates \n\nthat there could be changes in weighting from year to year to address \n\nareas of concentration in the program. For example, if the Department's \n\nanalysis of past years' data regarding the system's results on the \n\nprimary indicator related to measurable skills gains indicates that \n\nstudents are achieving high levels of literacy gains but lagging on \n\nnumeracy gains, the Department may increase the weighting of the OMS \n\nmeasure on numeracy gains to signal to operators that they need to put \n\nmore emphasis on improving numeracy. The expected result would\n\n[[Page 20787]]\n\nbe that the increased focus on numeracy would lead to improved numeracy \n\n\n\ngains and a commensurate increase in the primary indicator related to \n\nmeasurable skills gains. The center rankings will reflect these efforts \n\nto push the system to continuous improvement of outcomes.\n\nSection 686.1070 How and when will the Secretary use Performance \n\nImprovement Plans?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  686.1070 implements sec. 159(f)(2) of WIOA, which \n\nsets out requirements for the circumstances under which the Secretary \n\nwill use Performance Improvement Plans.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) provides that the Secretary will establish \n\nstandards and procedures for developing and implementing performance \n\nimprovement plans. Paragraph (a)(1) implements the requirement in sec. \n\n159(f)(2) of WIOA, that when a center fails to meet expected levels of \n\nperformance, the Secretary must develop and implement a performance \n\nimprovement plan designed to help the center improve its performance \n\noutcomes. Paragraph (a)(1)(i) establishes standards for when the \n\nSecretary will consider a center to have failed to meet the expected \n\nlevels of performance on the primary indicators. The proposed paragraph \n\nstates that a center will have failed to meet the expected levels of \n\nperformance if the center is ranked among the lowest 10 percent of Job \n\nCorps centers and the center fails to achieve an average of 90 percent \n\nof the expected level of performance for all of the primary indicators. \n\nThis is consistent with the methodology used to determine whether \n\nStates have failed to meet the expected levels of performance on other \n\nprograms under WIOA. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii) establishes \n\nstandards for when the Secretary will consider a center to have failed \n\nto meet the expected levels of performance on the primary indicators \n\nfor PYs that occur prior to the implementation of the expected levels \n\nof performance on the primary indicators. The paragraph states that a \n\ncenter will have failed to meet the expected levels of performance if \n\nit is ranked among the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers and the \n\ncenter's composite OMS score for the PY is 88 percent or less of the \n\nyear's OMS national average. This proposal is consistent with the Job \n\nCorps Performance Improvement Plan system planned for implementation in \n\nearly 2015.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a)(2) implements sec. 159(f)(3) of WIOA, which \n\nstates that the Secretary may also develop and implement additional \n\nperformance improvement plans that will require improvements for a Job \n\nCorps center that fails to meet criteria established by the Secretary \n\nother than the expected levels of performance. The Department expects \n\n\n\nto outline requirements for any such plans through subsequent guidance.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) implements the requirement in sec. 159(f)(2) \n\nof WIOA that the performance improvement plan require that action under \n\nthe plan must be taken within 1 year of its implementation to address \n\nthe issues that led to the center's failure to meet its expected levels \n\nof performance. The paragraph states that the plan will identify \n\ncriteria that must be met for the center to complete the performance \n\nimprovement plan. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) provides that the \n\ncenter operator must implement the actions outlined in the performance \n\nimprovement plan. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) provides that if the center \n\nfails to take the steps outlined in the performance improvement plan or \n\nfails to meet the criteria established to complete the performance \n\nimprovement plan after 1 year, the center will be considered to have \n\nfailed to improve performance under a performance improvement plan \n\ndetailed in paragraph (a). In that case, the center will remain on a \n\nperformance improvement plan and the Secretary will take action as \n\ndescribed in proposed paragraph (c). Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) implements \n\nsec. 159(f)(4) of WIOA, which provides that if a CCC fails to meet \n\nexpected levels of performance relating to the primary indicators of \n\nperformance specified in proposed Sec.  686.1010, or fails to improve \n\nperformance under a performance improvement plan detailed in paragraph \n\n(a) after 3 PYs, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of \n\nAgriculture, must select an entity to operate the CCC on a competitive \n\nbasis. Such competition will be held in accordance with the \n\nrequirements at proposed Sec.  686.310.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (c) implements secs. 159(f)(2)(A) through \n\n159(f)(2)(G) of WIOA, which permit the Secretary to take specific \n\nactions to improve the performance of a center, as necessary. These \n\nrequirements are taken directly from the statute and this proposed \n\nparagraph retains the same requirements as those in the WIA regulations \n\nat 20 CFR 670.985. The Department notes that nothing in the statute or \n\nin these proposed regulations requires that the performance improvement \n\nactions be taken in any particular order or on a progressive basis. The \n\nSecretary will take any of the measures listed in sec. 159(f)(2) of \n\nWIOA that will lead to improving performance of a center. Among these \n\nmeasures, the Secretary also reserves the right to close low-performing \n\ncenters, pursuant to WIOA sec. 159(f)(2)(G).\n\nK. Part 687--National Dislocated Worker Grants\n\n    Proposed part 687 implements provisions in sec. 170 of WIOA that \n\n\n\nauthorize the Secretary to award discretionary funds to serve \n\ndislocated workers and other eligible individuals affected by major \n\neconomic dislocations, emergencies, or disasters. The proposed \n\nregulations set forth the key elements and requirements for the \n\nstatute's NDWGs. Additional guidance on NDWGs and the application \n\nrequirements for these grants will be published separately.\n\n    The proposed regulations establish a framework that will enable \n\neligible applicants to apply quickly for grants to relieve the impact \n\nof layoffs, emergencies, and disasters on employment in the impacted \n\narea and to meet the training and reemployment needs of affected \n\nworkers and to enable them to obtain new jobs as quickly as possible. \n\nThe proposed regulations call for early assessment of the needs and \n\ninterests of the affected workers, through either rapid response \n\nactivities, or other means, as well as an indication of the other \n\nresources available to meet these needs, to aid in the creation of a \n\ncustomer-centered service proposal. The early collection of information \n\nabout affected workers will allow applicants to have an understanding \n\nof the needs and interests of the impacted workers to enable a prompt \n\napplication for the appropriate level of NDWG funds. Early collection \n\nof information also will facilitate the receipt of NDWG funds when the \n\nSecretary determines that there are insufficient State and local \n\nformula funds available. Early intervention to assist workers being \n\ndislocated is critical to enable them to access work-based learning \n\nopportunities and other types of training that lead to industry-\n\nrecognized credentials, as appropriate, to help them find new \n\nemployment in in-demand industries and occupations as soon as possible \n\nafter their dislocation occurs.\n\nSection 687.100 What are the types and purposes of national disclosed \n\nworker grants the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.100 describes the purpose of NDWGs, expanding \n\nupon the description provided in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.100. \n\nRegular NDWGs provide career services for dislocated workers and other \n\neligible\n\n[[Page 20788]]\n\npopulations where demand is unable to be met with formula funds or \n\nother sources. Disaster NDWGs, which were originally authorized under \n\nWIA to conduct clean-up and humanitarian assistance, are still \n\nauthorized under WIOA; however, WIOA expands their availability by \n\nadding new qualifying events for Disaster NDWGs, such as serving \n\n\n\nworkers who have relocated from an area in which a disaster has been \n\ndeclared, as discussed in Sec. Sec.  687.110(b) and 687.180(b).\n\nSection 687.110 What are major economic dislocations or other events \n\nwhich may qualify for a national dislocated worker grant?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.110 describes the events that qualify for NDWG \n\nfunding. Proposed Sec.  687.110(a)(1) through (3) include substantially \n\nsimilar provisions to those that were contained in the WIA regulations; \n\nhowever, the terms ``single site of employment'' and ``in a single \n\nlocal community,'' which had been used to qualify the types of eligible \n\nlayoff events, are not included in the proposed section. Experience \n\nunder WIA has shown that a company's total number of layoffs affects \n\nthe local and regional economy in the same way without regard to \n\nwhether the layoffs occur at a single facility or at multiple \n\nlocations. Proposed Sec.  687.110(a)(4) describes a qualifying event \n\nadded by sec. 170(b)(1)(D)(i) of WIOA, permitting the award of a NDWG \n\nwhen a higher than average demand for employment and training \n\nactivities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces, dislocated \n\nspouses of members of the Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in 10 \n\nU.S.C. 101(d)(1)), or members of the Armed Forces described in proposed \n\nSec.  687.170(a)(1)(iii), exceeds State and local resources. Section \n\n170(b)(1)(D)(i) of WIOA specifically limits the military spouses \n\nincluded in this analysis to ``spouses described in sec. 3(15)(E) [of \n\nWIOA].'' Under sec. 3(15)(E) of WIOA, these are spouses of members of \n\nthe Armed Forces on active duty who are dislocated specifically because \n\nthey have experienced a loss of employment as a direct result of \n\nrelocation to accommodate a permanent change in duty station of the \n\nmember of the military, or are unemployed or underemployed and \n\nexperiencing difficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment. \n\nImplementing this exactly as stated in the statute would require \n\napplicants for these NDWGs to determine whether a specific subset of \n\ndislocated military spouses is driving the higher than average demand \n\nfor services in an area. This would cause an unnecessary burden on the \n\nNDWG applicants, and instead proposed Sec.  687.110(a)(4) would only \n\nrequire applicants for these NDWGs to assess whether military spouses \n\nwho are dislocated under any of the factors in sec. 3(15) of WIOA are \n\ncontributing to the higher than average demand for services. The \n\nproposed provision also specifies that these spouses must be spouses of \n\nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty, which implements the intent \n\nof this provision of WIOA while avoiding the unnecessary administrative \n\nhardship. The Department intends to provide additional guidance about \n\nhow higher than average demand will be defined for purposes of this \n\nsection. The Department is exploring definitions that may include \n\nveterans' unemployment in excess of the State's unemployment rate, \n\n\n\nUnemployment Compensation for Ex-service members (UCX) data, and other \n\nsimilar administrative data sources. The Department invites comments \n\nabout the usefulness of relying on these and other data sources in \n\ndetermining how higher than average demand should be defined. Proposed \n\nSec.  687.110(a)(5) maintains the prerogative of the Secretary of Labor \n\nto provide NDWG funding for other events.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.110(b) describes qualifying events for Disaster \n\nNDWGs. Proposed Sec.  687.110(b)(1) provides, similar to the WIA \n\nregulation at 20 CFR 671.110(e), that disasters declared eligible for \n\npublic assistance under the Stafford Act are qualifying events for \n\nDisaster NDWGs. The proposed paragraph also makes clear that outlying \n\nareas and tribal areas that receive a public assistance declaration \n\nalso are eligible to apply for a Disaster NDWG. This is consistent with \n\nthe intent and purpose of sec. 170 of WIOA, because these entities are \n\nboth eligible for dislocated worker grants under WIOA and are eligible \n\nfor public assistance under the Stafford Act. Therefore, it is logical \n\nthat they would be eligible for Disaster NDWGs.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.110(b)(2) and (3) describe the new events that \n\nWIOA establishes are qualifying events for Disaster NDWGs. As stated in \n\nsec. 170(a)(1)(B) of WIOA, eligible events for Disaster NDWGs now \n\ninclude an emergency or disaster situation of national significance \n\nthat could result in a potentially large loss of employment, as \n\nrecognized by the chief official of a Federal agency that has authority \n\nor jurisdiction over the Federal response for the emergency or disaster \n\nsituation. Although such an event might not meet the requirements to \n\nreceive a public assistance declaration from the FEMA, it still may be \n\nan event where NDWG funding may be needed. NDWGs may be provided in \n\nthis instance for activities that are determined to be appropriate by \n\nthe Secretary. Proposed paragraph (b)(3) addresses situations where a \n\nsubstantial number of workers from a State, tribal area, or outlying \n\narea in which an emergency or disaster has occurred relocate to another \n\nState, tribal area, or outlying area. This would also be a qualifying \n\nevent for a Disaster NDWG, according to secs. 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and \n\n(d)(4) of WIOA. The addition of this type of event was informed by the \n\nmass evacuations that took place as a result of Hurricane Katrina, \n\nwhich caused massive flooding and damage along the Gulf Coast in 2005, \n\nresulting in evacuees settling in high concentrations in some other \n\ncommunities.\n\nSection 687.120 Who is eligible to apply for national dislocated worker \n\ngrants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.120 identifies which entities are eligible to \n\napply for NDWGs. Proposed Sec.  687.120(a) and (b) retain essentially \n\nthe same requirements as in Sec.  671.120 of the WIA regulations, but \n\n\n\nthese proposed regulations clearly identify which entities may apply \n\nfor Regular NDWGs and which may apply for Disaster NDWGs. Unlike Sec.  \n\n671.120(b), proposed Sec.  687.120 does not include a statement \n\nconcerning the ability of private entities to apply for NDWGs for \n\ninterstate projects, because sec. 170(c)(1)(B) of WIOA and proposed \n\nSec.  687.120(a)(5) provide for such applications. The proposed \n\nlanguage, in contrast to its WIA counterpart, does not distinguish \n\nbetween interstate and intrastate projects, because from the \n\nDepartment's perspective the grantee/grantor relationship is between \n\nthe Department and a single entity. In proposed Sec.  687.120(a), the \n\nDepartment has specified that outlying areas, in addition to States, \n\nmay apply for Regular NDWGs. In proposed Sec.  687.120(b), the \n\nDepartment has specified that outlying areas and Indian tribal \n\ngovernments as defined by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n\nEmergency Assistance Act, in addition to States, may apply for Disaster \n\nNDWGs.\n\nSection 687.130 When should applications for national dislocated worker \n\ngrants be submitted to the Department?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.130 describes when applications for NDWGs may be \n\nsubmitted and retains many of the requirements found in the WIA \n\nregulations at 20 CFR 671.130. However, there are some key differences \n\nin the proposed regulations. Proposed Sec.  687.130(a) identifies the \n\nconditions\n\n[[Page 20789]]\n\napplicable to Regular NDWGs and underscores the importance that \n\napplications for Regular NDWGs must be submitted as soon as possible \n\nafter the eligibility criteria are met and the necessary information to \n\napply is available to the applicant. Timely submissions that comply \n\nwith the requirements will help ensure that the needed resources are \n\nprovided expediently.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.130(b) identifies the conditions applicable to \n\nDisaster NDWGs and underscores the importance that applications for \n\nDisaster NDWGs must be submitted as soon as possible. Proposed Sec.  \n\n687.130(b)(1) through (3) identify the events that trigger applications \n\nfor Disaster NDWGs, and also emphasize the importance of submitting \n\napplications as soon as possible after the appropriate declarations or \n\ndeterminations have been made.\n\nSection 687.140 What activities are applicants expected to conduct \n\nbefore a national dislocated worker grant application is submitted?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.140 describes the activities to be conducted \n\nbefore an application for a NDWG is submitted. Proposed Sec.  \n\n687.140(a) expands on the requirements found in the WIA regulations at \n\n\n\n20 CFR 671.160. The proposed language, based in part on the \n\nDepartment's experience under WIA, requires applicants to identify the \n\nneeds of the affected workers, and their interest in receiving \n\nservices, either through Rapid Response activities or other means. \n\nUnder WIA, the Department learned that some individuals who could have \n\nbenefited from receiving ESs under a National Emergency Grant (NEG) \n\nended up not being interested in receiving them. For example, some \n\nindividuals chose to opt out of receiving services because they \n\nbelieved their previous employer was going to call them back to work, \n\nwhile others chose to forgo receiving employment and training services \n\nin order to find new employment on their own. The Department has found \n\nthat the lack of information on needs and interest of affected workers \n\nhave significantly impacted participant enrollment rates in the past, \n\nand in some cases, resulted in the return of funds outside the \n\ntimeframe allowed for the funds to be obligated for other grants. \n\nFurther, the proposed language expands the allowable data gathering \n\nmethods that may be used, so that applicants are no longer limited to \n\nusing only data obtained via Rapid Response interventions. This change \n\nallows for greater flexibility in obtaining this critical data.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.140(b)(1) makes it clear that applicants for \n\nDisaster NDWGs must conduct a preliminary assessment of the clean-up \n\nand humanitarian needs in the affected areas. Proposed Sec.  \n\n687.140(b)(2) requires applicants to have a mechanism in place to \n\nascertain reasonably that there is a sufficient population of eligible \n\nindividuals in the area and, if needed, eligible individuals outside \n\nthe area to conduct the planned clean-up and humanitarian work. Under \n\nWIA, there were a few instances where after NEGs were issued, a State \n\nwas unable to conduct the work it had planned because it was unable to \n\nfind eligible individuals to do the work. The Department recognizes \n\nthat in the immediate aftermath of a disaster it is difficult to \n\nconduct a thorough assessment of the number of individuals that could \n\nbe eligible to conduct the planned work. While the Department's \n\nproposed approach allows flexibility, it also ensures there is a \n\nprocess in place so that reasonable estimates of potential participant \n\navailability are made prior to submitting the application, so that the \n\nproper amount of funding may be provided.\n\nSection 687.150 What are the requirements for submitting applications \n\nfor national dislocated worker grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.150 explains that the Department will publish \n\nadditional guidance on the requirements for submitting NDWG \n\n\n\napplications. A similar approach was taken in the WIA regulations. \n\nUnlike the WIA regulations, however, the proposed section requires that \n\na project implementation plan, which is currently required for all \n\nNEGs, be submitted post NDWG award. Under WIA, this requirement is \n\nincluded only in guidance. The project implementation plan includes \n\nmore detailed information about project operations than is required for \n\nthe initial application. This information allows the Department to \n\nprovide grantees with targeted technical assistance, and to exercise \n\nappropriate oversight and monitoring over the NDWG award. Additional \n\ninformation on what must be included in the project implementation \n\nplan, and the process for submitting it, will be included in future \n\nguidance.\n\nSection 687.160 What is the timeframe for the Department to issue \n\ndecisions on national dislocated worker grant applications?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.160 implements sec. 170(b)(2) of WIOA, which \n\nestablishes a 45-day timeframe for issuing determinations on NDWG \n\napplications. The proposed paragraph makes it clear that final \n\ndecisions on NDWG applications will be issued within 45 calendar days \n\nof receiving an application that meets the requirements. Applicants are \n\nencouraged to engage the appropriate Regional Office so that timely \n\ntechnical assistance can be provided when developing NDWG applications \n\nto help ensure that the information provided in the application is \n\nsufficient.\n\nSec.  687.170  Who is eligible to be served under national dislocated \nworker grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.170 provides information on participant \n\neligibility for NDWGs, distinguishing between individuals who may be \n\nserved under Regular NDWGs and those who may be served under Disaster \n\nNDWGs. In the WIA regulations at Sec.  671.140, participant eligibility \n\nand allowable activities were included in the same section; these two \n\ntopics are being addressed separately in proposed Sec. Sec.  687.170 \n\nand 687.180 for clarity. Proposed Sec.  687.170(a) lists the specific \n\npopulations that are eligible to be served under Regular NDWGs. This \n\nparagraph retains the provision from the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n671.140(a) that dislocated workers may be served. However, as discussed \n\nbelow, the definition of a dislocated worker was expanded under WIOA, \n\nthereby expanding the population that can be served with NDWGs.\n\n    Section 3(15)(E)(i)-(ii) of WIOA includes certain spouses of \n\nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty in the definition of \n\n``dislocated worker.'' These spouses are considered dislocated workers, \n\nand therefore eligible for services under NDWGs, if they: (1) Have \n\n\n\nexperienced a loss of employment as a direct result of relocation to \n\naccommodate a permanent change in duty station of the member of the \n\nArmed Forces; or, (2) are unemployed or underemployed and experiencing \n\ndifficulty obtaining or upgrading employment.\n\n    WIOA also expanded upon the definition of a ``displaced \n\nhomemaker,'' recognized under both WIA and WIOA as a type of dislocated \n\nworker. Under sec. 3(16)(A)(ii) of WIOA, the definition of a displaced \n\nhomemaker now explicitly includes a person who is a dependent spouse of \n\na member of the\n\n[[Page 20790]]\n\nArmed Forces on active duty whose family income is significantly \n\nreduced because of a deployment, a call or order to active duty, a \n\npermanent change of station, or the service-connected death or \n\ndisability of the member, and who is unemployed or underemployed and is \n\nexperiencing difficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment. In \n\naddition to the expanded dislocated worker definition covering \n\nadditional military spouses, dislocated members of the Armed Forces and \n\nother dislocated military spouses continue to be included in the \n\ndefinition of ``dislocated workers'' and therefore continue to be \n\neligible for services under NDWGs, just as they were under WIA NEGs. \n\nFinally, sec. 170(c)(2)(A)(iv) of WIOA retains the eligibility \n\nprovision found at sec. 173(c)(2)(iv) of WIA that members of the Armed \n\nForces who were on active duty or full-time National Guard duty who \n\nmeet other specific requirements are an eligible population. These \n\nmembers of the Armed Forces and the requirements are specifically \n\ndescribed in proposed Sec.  687.170(a)(1)(iii).\n\n    As discussed earlier in this preamble, WIOA states that dislocated \n\nmembers of the Armed Forces, members of the Armed Forces described in \n\nproposed Sec.  687.170(a)(1)(iii), and dislocated spouses of members of \n\nthe Armed Forces on active duty may be served with NDWGs when there is \n\na higher than average demand for employment and training activities \n\nfrom this population that exceeds State and local resources to provide \n\nthem.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.170(b)(1) retains many of the participant \n\neligibility requirements for Disaster NEGs found in the WIA regulations \n\nat Sec.  671.140(d), and also includes a new population authorized \n\nunder sec. 170(d)(2)(D) of WIOA--individuals who were self-employed, \n\nbut become unemployed or significantly underemployed as a result of the \n\nemergency or disaster. Proposed Sec.  687.170(b)(2) implements sec. \n\n170(b)(1)(B)(ii) of WIOA, discussed in proposed Sec.  687.110(b)(3), \n\nwhich authorizes NDWG assistance for individuals who have relocated to \n\nanother State, tribal area, or outlying area as a result of the \n\n\n\ndisaster. This paragraph lists the relocated individuals who are \n\neligible for assistance under these type of NDWGs, and also notes that \n\nin rare instances, humanitarian-related temporary employment will be \n\navailable in the relocation areas. This is further discussed in \n\nproposed Sec.  687.180(b)(2) and the corresponding preamble language. \n\nIn those cases, the relocated individuals listed in proposed Sec.  \n\n687.170(b)(2) would be eligible for that work.\n\nSection 687.180 What are the allowable activities under national \n\ndislocated worker grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180 provides information on allowable \n\nactivities; first, those allowable under Regular NDWGs; second, those \n\nallowable under Disaster NDWGs. Proposed Sec.  687.180(a) lists the \n\nallowable activities for Regular NDWGs. These activities are \n\nessentially the same as those reflected in the WIA regulations at 20 \n\nCFR 671.140; however, consistent with WIOA, references to core, \n\nintensive, and training services have been changed to refer to career \n\nservices. Additionally, the reference to trade-impacted workers under \n\nthe NAFTA-TAA program contained in 20 CFR 671.140(c)(2) is not included \n\nin the proposed paragraph, since the NAFTA-TAA program no longer \n\nexists.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180(b) lists the allowable activities for \n\nDisaster NDWGs. Proposed Sec.  687.180(b)(1) uses the same language as \n\nin the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.140(e), which authorizes temporary \n\nemployment for humanitarian assistance and clean-up and repair of \n\nfacilities and lands within the disaster area for which a Disaster NDWG \n\nis issued. This proposed paragraph also implements sec. 170(d)(1)(A) of \n\nWIOA, which requires coordination with FEMA and permits these \n\nactivities to be performed in offshore areas related to the emergency \n\nor disaster. The addition of the language on offshore areas was \n\ninformed by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill; the proposed paragraph \n\nallows clean-up and humanitarian assistance activities to take place \n\nbeyond the land surface of the disaster area.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180(b)(1) implements sec. 170(d)(3) of WIOA; \n\nthis paragraph allows employment of up to 12 months in the temporary \n\njobs created under Disaster NDWGs, with the potential for an additional \n\n12 months with Secretarial approval. Under sec. 173(d)(3) of WIA, only \n\n6 months of disaster relief employment was allowed. Proposed Sec.  \n\n687.180(b)(1) identifies employment and training activities as \n\nallowable under Disaster NDWGs. While the WIA regulations contained a \n\ncomparable provision, individuals were only allowed to participate in \n\nemployment and training services after they had completed the disaster \n\nrelief employment component of the project. The proposed paragraph \n\n\n\nallows individuals enrolled in disaster relief employment under \n\nDisaster NDWGs to receive concurrent career and training services, as \n\nwell as upon completion. Feedback received from grantees over the years \n\ndemonstrates that individuals involved in clean-up and humanitarian \n\nassistance benefit from the opportunity to receive employment and \n\ntraining services. These services will help to improve the skills of \n\nthese individuals and enhance their chances of obtaining employment \n\nonce the temporary disaster relief employment is completed. However, \n\nbecause the primary purpose of Disaster NDWGs is to perform clean-up \n\nand humanitarian assistance, the Department will issue further guidance \n\nabout the specific requirements regarding concurrent participation in \n\ncareer services.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180(b)(2) implements sec. 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) of \n\nWIOA, discussed in proposed Sec.  687.110(b)(3), which makes \n\nindividuals who have relocated to another State, tribal area, or \n\noutlying area as a result of a disaster eligible to receive services. \n\nProposed Sec.  687.180(b)(2) recognizes that although these individuals \n\nare eligible for temporary disaster relief employment, their \n\nemployment, by virtue of their relocation, will most likely be limited \n\nto humanitarian work (if those services are warranted). If individuals \n\nrelocate outside of the disaster area, they will most likely not be in \n\nthe impacted geographic area to conduct clean-up work. It is the \n\nDepartment's expectation that, except in rare circumstances, the \n\nservices provided to relocated individuals will be limited to career \n\nservices.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180(b)(3), consistent with secs. 170(a)(1)(A)-\n\n(B) of WIOA, authorizes career services and/or disaster relief \n\nemployment both where recognized by FEMA, or by another Federal agency. \n\nUnder sec. 173(a)(2) of WIA and the WIA regulations at 20 CFR \n\n671.110(e) and 671.130(c), NEGs were only available where FEMA declared \n\nan area eligible for disaster-related public assistance.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.180(b)(4) implements sec. 170(d)(1)(B) of WIOA, \n\nwhich states that disaster NDWG funds may be expended through public \n\nand private agencies and organizations that are engaged in disaster \n\nrelief and humanitarian assistance projects.\n\nSection 687.190 How do statutory and regulatory waivers apply to \n\nnational dislocated worker grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.190 describes how statutory and regulatory \n\nwaivers apply to NDWGs. To improve a grantee's ability to serve \n\nparticipants, or increase the effectiveness of NDWG projects, the \n\n\n\nDepartment may grant waivers to many statutory and regulatory \n\nrequirements. See WIOA sec. 189(i)(3)(A), which identifies some \n\nlimitations on the Secretary's waiver authority. Proposed\n\n[[Page 20791]]\n\nSec.  687.190(a) and (b) retain essentially the same requirements found \n\nin the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.150. A grantee requesting a waiver \n\nof the statutory or regulatory requirements in connection with an NDWG \n\nmust submit its request either in the initial application for an NDWG, \n\nor in a subsequent modification request. A waiver issued under other \n\nWIOA provisions does not supplant this requirement.\n\nSection 687.200 What are the program and administrative requirements \n\nthat apply to national dislocated worker grants?\n\n    Proposed Sec.  687.200 describes program and administrative \n\nrequirements for NDWGs. It retains essentially the same language \n\nincluded in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 671.170. Proposed Sec.  \n\n687.200(b) authorizes the use of funds for temporary job creation in \n\nareas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA or in areas \n\nimpacted by a situation of national significance as designated by a \n\nFederal agency other than FEMA, subject to the limitations of sec. \n\n170(d) of WIOA, and any additional guidance issued by the Department. \n\nProposed Sec.  687.200(b)(2) authorizes any remaining Disaster NDWG \n\nfunds awarded under this part to be used by a grantee in the same PY \n\nthe funds were awarded, in limited instances as determined by the \n\nSecretary or the Secretary's designee, for additional disasters or \n\nsituations of national significance subject to the limitations of sec. \n\n170(d) of WIOA. This flexibility will allow States, tribal areas, and \n\noutlying areas that experience a quick succession of disasters (such as \n\nthose experienced by several Gulf States in 2005 that were devastated \n\nby the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and approximately 1 month later, \n\nwere devastated by Hurricane Rita) to be able to modify their existing \n\ngrant and quickly access existing funding.\n\nL. Part 688--Provisions Governing the YouthBuild Program\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    The Department wants to emphasize the connections across all of our \n\nyouth-serving programs under WIOA including the WIOA youth formula \n\nprogram including boards and youth committees, connections to pre-\n\napprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs, and Job Corps \n\ncenters across the country. WIOA is an opportunity to align and \n\ncoordinate service strategies for these ETA youth training programs as \n\nwell as align with our Federal partners that serve these same \n\n\n\ncustomers. WIOA also ensures that these programs are using common \n\nperformance measures and standard definitions, which includes aligning \n\nthe definitions for homeless youth, basic skills deficient, \n\noccupational skills training and supportive services. Additionally, the \n\nYouthBuild regulation aligns six new performance measures with the WIOA \n\nyouth formula program.\n\n    WIOA affirms the Department's commitment to providing high quality \n\neducation, training, and ESs for youth and young adults through \n\nYouthBuild grants by expanding the occupational skills training offered \n\nat local YouthBuild programs. YouthBuild programs can offer \n\noccupational skills training in in-demand occupations, such as health \n\ncare, advanced manufacturing, and IT, as approved by the Secretary and \n\nbased on local labor market information.\n\n    In addition to the changes to the program required by WIOA, the \n\nDepartment proposes several additional changes to the program, \n\nincluding proposed revisions to the duration of the restrictive \n\ncovenant clause (as detailed in the preamble at Sec.  688.730), \n\nclarifying eligibility criteria for participation, and describing \n\nqualifying work sites and minimum criteria for successful exit from the \n\nYouthBuild program. Beyond these regulations, the Department will \n\ndevelop guidance and technical assistance to help grantees and the \n\nworkforce development community operate highly effective YouthBuild \n\nprograms.\n\n2. Subpart A--Purpose and Definitions\n\nSection 688.100 What is YouthBuild?\n\n    This proposed section describes the YouthBuild program. YouthBuild \n\nis a workforce development program that provides employment, education, \n\nleadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged \n\nyouth. The program also benefits the larger community by providing new \n\nand rehabilitated affordable housing, thereby decreasing the incidence \n\nof homelessness in those communities. The program recruits youth \n\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24 who are school dropouts and are either: A \n\nmember of a low-income family, a youth in foster care, a youth who is \n\nhomeless, a youth offender, a youth who is an individual with a \n\ndisability, a child of an incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.\n\nSection 688.110 What are the purposes of the YouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section describes the purposes of the YouthBuild \n\nprogram. The overarching goal of the YouthBuild program is to offer \n\ndisadvantaged youth the opportunity to obtain education and useful \n\nemployment skills to enter the labor market successfully. Construction \n\ntraining provides skills training and hands-on application of those \n\nskills. Youth also receive educational services that lead to a HSD or \n\n\n\nits State-recognized equivalent.\n\n    In addition to describing the Department's vision for the \n\nYouthBuild program, this proposed section describes the purposes of the \n\nYouthBuild program as found at WIOA sec. 171(a).\n\nSection 688.120 What definitions apply to this part?\n\n    This proposed section provides definitions that are specific to the \n\nYouthBuild program in sec. 171(b) of WIOA. Other definitions that apply \n\nto the YouthBuild program are defined under sec. 3 of WIOA and Sec.  \n\n675.300. Where appropriate and applicable the Department has aligned \n\nour definitions with the definitions within the regulations of WIOA \n\nyouth, Job Corps, and WIOA adult and dislocated workers programs.\n\n    These proposed definitions fall into several categories, which are \n\ndescribed below: (1) Definitions that remain unchanged from the WIA \n\nregulation at 20 CFR 672.110; (2) terms that were included in the WIA \n\nregulation but which have been amended; and (3) new definitions added \n\nto implement WIOA.\n\n    Definitions included in 20 CFR 672.110 which have been carried over \n\nto this part unchanged are: ``Community or Other Public Facility,'' \n\n``Core Construction,'' ``Eligible Entity,'' ``Housing Development \n\nAgency,'' ``Income,'' ``Indian; Indian Tribe,'' ``Low-Income Family,'' \n\n``Migrant Youth,'' and ``Youth in Foster Care.''\n\n    Definitions published in the WIA regulations at Sec.  672.110 that \n\nthe Department proposes changing include existing definitions for: \n\n``Homeless Individual'' to include individuals considered homeless as \n\ndefined in sec. 41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and \n\nthe inclusion of ``Homeless Child or Youth'' as defined under the \n\nMcKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act; ``Needs-Based Stipends'' to \n\n``Needs-Based Payments'' in order to be consistent with the term as \n\nused in Sec.  688.320 below and to differentiate the term from the \n\nallowable program stipends described in Sec.  688.320; ``Occupational \n\nSkills Traning'' to align with in-demand industries and an emphasis on \n\npost-secondary credentials; ``Registered Apprenticeship'' to align with \n\nthe WIOA definition; and ``Transitional\n\n[[Page 20792]]\n\nHousing'' to reflect the amended definition under the McKinney-Vento \n\nHomeless Assistance Act as amended by S. 896 The Homeless Emergency \n\nAssistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009.\n\n    Proposed changes to this section also include the addition of new \n\ndefinitions that were not in WIA but are included in either sec. 3 or \n\nsec. 171(b) of WIOA. These are ``Adjusted Income,'' ``Applicant,'' \n\n``Basic Skills Deficient,'' ``In-Demand Industry Sector or \n\nOccupation,'' ``Individual with a Disability,'' ``Offender,'' \n\n\n\n``Qualified National Nonprofit Agency,'' ``Recognized Post-secondary \n\nCredential,'' ``School Dropout,'' ``Secondary School,'' ``Supportive \n\nServices,'' and ``YouthBuild Program.''\n\n    Finally, the Department proposes to include several new definitions \n\nnot defined under WIA YouthBuild regulations Sec.  673.110: \n\n``Construction Plus,'' ``Exit,'' ``Follow-Up Services,'' \n\n``Participant,'' and ``Pre-apprenticeship.''\n\n    In addition, the Department has removed several definitions that \n\nwere included in the WIA regulations: ``Alternative School,'' \n\n``Individuals of Limited English Proficiency (LEP),'' ``Partnership,'' \n\n``Public Housing Agency,'' and ``Youth who is an Individual with a \n\nDisability.''\n\n    The Department proposes to include the following definitions at \n\nSec.  688.120:\n\n    Adjusted Income: The Department proposes that the term ``adjusted \n\nincome'' means that with respect to a family, the amount of the income \n\nof the members of the family residing in a dwelling unit or the persons \n\non a lease, after any allowable income exclusions. Per WIOA sec. \n\n171(b)(1), this definition comes from sec. 3(b) of the United States \n\nHousing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b).\n\n    Applicant: The Department proposes defining this as an entity \n\napplying for YouthBuild funding as described at WIOA sec. 171(b)(2).\n\n    Basic Skills Deficient: This proposed definition comes from WIOA \n\nsec. 3(5) and the Department is adding it for ease of use. In assessing \n\nbasic skills, YouthBuild programs must use assessment instruments that \n\nare valid and appropriate for the target population, and must provide \n\nreasonable accommodation in the assessment process, if necessary, for \n\nparticipants with disabilities.\n\n    Construction Plus: The Department proposes defining this as the \n\ninclusion of occupational skills training for YouthBuild participants \n\nin in-demand occupations other than construction. This definition is \n\nfrom TEGL 7-14 Guidance for Implementing the ``Construction Plus'' \n\nComponent of the YouthBuild Program. The Department is adding this \n\ndefinition to the regulations to stress the importance of correctly \n\nimplementing a high quality Construction Plus program and to refer \n\ngrantees to TEGL 7-14.\n\n    Community Or Other Public Facility: The Department proposes \n\ndefining this as those facilities which are either privately owned by \n\nnon-profit organizations or publicly owned and publicly used for the \n\nbenefit of the community. For publically owned buildings, examples \n\ninclude public use buildings such as recreation centers, libraries, \n\npublic park shelters, or public schools.\n\n\n\n    Core Construction: The Department proposes defining this term to \n\nmean those activities that are directly related to the construction or \n\nrehabilitation of residential, community, or other public facilities. \n\nThese activities include, but are not limited to, job skills that can \n\nbe found under the Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) \n\nmajor group 47, and Construction and Extraction Occupations, in codes \n\n47-1011 through 47-4099. A full list of the SOC's can be found at the \n\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Web site, http://www.bls.gov/soc.\n\n    Eligible Entity: This proposed term describes the entities eligible \n\nto apply for funding under this part. This definition comes from WIOA \n\nsec. 171(b)(3).\n\n    English Language Learner: The Department proposes defining this \n\nterm as a participant who has limited ability in reading, writing, \n\nspeaking, or comprehending the English language, and whose native \n\nlanguage is one other than English; or who lives in a family or \n\ncommunity environment where a language other than English is the \n\ndominant language. This definition comes from WIOA sec. 3(21), which \n\nadopts the definition found at WIOA sec. 203(7).\n\n    Exit: For purposes of measuring performance under the performance \n\nmeasures described in Sec.  688.400, the Department proposes to adopt \n\nthe general definition of exit that is used in Sec.  677.150 in order \n\nto align with the core programs generally and the youth formula program \n\nspecifically. For purposes of this definition, an exit from a \n\nYouthBuild program is either a successful exit under Sec.  688.370 or \n\nan unsuccessful exit, which occurs when a participant leaves the \n\nprogram before completing the program. However, a participant is not \n\nconsidered to have unsuccessfully exited if they leave the program \n\nbecause of a documented death, health or medical reason, family care, \n\nbeing called to active duty in the military, or any other circumstance \n\ndescribed by the Secretary.\n\n    Follow-Up Services: This proposed term describes the services \n\nprovided to youth participants after program exit to ensure success in \n\nestablished outcomes, such as placement into post-secondary education \n\nand training or employment. The definition is based on the Department's \n\nexperience in administering the YouthBuild program, and aligns with the \n\nWIOA youth formula program definition. By adding this definition, the \n\nDepartment intends to strengthen the emphasis on career pathways for \n\nYouthBuild participants. Follow-up services are critical services \n\nprovided following a youth's exit from the program that help ensure the \n\nyouth is successful in employment and/or post-secondary education and \n\ntraining as they progress along their career pathway. The Department \n\nwill issue guidance and provide technical assistance regarding the \n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/soc\n\n\nservices necessary to ensure the success of youth participants.\n\n    Homeless Individual: This proposed term comes from WIOA sec. \n\n171(b)(4), which adopted the definition from sec. 41403(6) of the \n\nViolence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e-2(6)).\n\n    Homeless Child or Youth: This proposed term comes from WIOA sec. \n\n171(b)(4) of WIOA and comes from sec. 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento \n\nHomeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 1134a(2)).\n\n    Housing Development Agency: The Department proposes adopting the \n\nstatutory definition of this term at WIOA sec. 171(b)(5).\n\n    Income: This proposed definition has been adopted from WIOA sec. \n\n171(b)(6), which adopted the definition from the United States Housing \n\nAct of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)).\n\n    In-Demand Industry Sector or Occupation: The Department proposes to \n\ndefine this term as described at WIOA sec. 3(23).\n\n    Indian; Indian Tribe: These proposed terms are found in WIOA sec. \n\n171(b)(7), which incorporated the definitions from sec. 4 of the \n\nISDEAA.\n\n    Individual With a Disability: This proposed definition was taken \n\nfrom sec. 3(25) of WIOA, which adopted the definition from sec. 3 of \n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102).\n\n    Low-Income Family: This proposed definition implements the \n\ndefinition at WIOA sec. 171(b)(8), which adopted the definition of \n\n``low-income family'' from sec. 3(b)(2) of the Housing Act of 1937. \n\nThis definition applies not only to the eligibility of participants but \n\nalso to the\n\n[[Page 20793]]\n\nrequirement that any residential units constructed or rehabilitated \n\nusing YouthBuild funds must house homeless individuals and families or \n\nlow-income families.\n\n    Migrant Youth: The Department proposes using the definition we used \n\nunder the WIA YouthBuild regulation. The definition was adapted from \n\nFarmworker Bulletin 00-02, which relates to eligibility in the Migrant \n\nSeasonal Farmworker Youth program, and expands on the definition of \n\n``migrant seasonal farmworker'' found in WIA.\n\n    Needs-Based Payments: This proposed term describes additional \n\npayments to participants beyond stipends which are necessary for an \n\neligible youth to participate in the program.\n\n    Occupational Skills Training: The Department proposes to define \n\nthis term as a course of study that provides specific vocational \n\nskills.\n\n    Offender: The Department proposes to define this term based on the \n\ndefinition found at WIOA sec. 3(38) and it includes both youth and \n\n\n\nadults who have been subject to any stage of the criminal justice \n\nprocess. The Department is proposing this definition in order to align \n\nYouthBuild's definition of offender with WIOA's formula for adult and \n\nyouth programs.\n\n    Participant: The Department is proposing to define this term as an \n\nindividual who, after an affirmative eligibility determination has been \n\nmade, enrolls and actively participates in the program. Participants \n\nmust be reported in the performance outcome measures. The term \n\n``participant'' is necessary to define because Sec.  688.400 requires \n\ngrantees to report on the performance of participants in the program. \n\nThis definition is designed to be consistent with the definition of \n\nparticipant in Sec.  677.150, and it captures the same type of \n\nindividuals that are considered participants in the core programs.\n\n    Pre-Apprenticeship: This proposed term describes a program or set \n\nof strategies designed to prepare individuals to enter and succeed in a \n\nregistered apprenticeship program. This definition is adopted from TEN \n\n13-12 (http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEN/TEN_13-12_Acc.pdf), \n\nand is being used to ensure consistency with the definition used by the \n\nDepartment's Office of Apprenticeship. Per TEN 13-12, YouthBuild \n\nprograms that receive funding from DOL are considered pre-\n\napprenticeship programs.\n\n    Recognized Post-secondary Credential: This proposed definition \n\nexplains that a recognized post-secondary credential includes an \n\nindustry-recognized certificate or completion of an apprenticeship \n\nprogram, a license recognized by the State involved or Federal \n\ngovernment, or an associate or baccalaureate degree. This definition \n\nhas been adopted from WIOA sec. 3(52). the Department is using this to \n\nterm to align with WIOA's formula adult and youth programs.\n\n    Registered Apprenticeship Program: The Department proposes to adopt \n\nthe definition found at WIOA sec. 171(b)(10).\n\n    School Dropout: This proposed definition, adopted from WIOA sec. \n\n3(54), describes a school dropout as an individual who is no longer \n\nattending any school and who has not received a secondary school \n\ndiploma or its recognized equivalent.\n\n    Secondary School: The Department proposes to define this term as a \n\nnonprofit institutional day or residential school, including a public \n\nsecondary charter school, that provides secondary education, as \n\ndetermined under State law, except that the term does not include any \n\neducation beyond grade 12. This proposed definition adopts the \n\ndefinition at WIOA sec. 3(55), which cites to sec. 9101 of the \n\nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n\n    Section 3: The Department proposes to define this term as Section 3 \n\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEN/TEN_13-12_Acc.pdf\n\n\nof the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended by the \n\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1992. The Department proposes \n\nadding this definition because YouthBuild is specifically identified in \n\nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD's) Section 3 \n\nregulations. In Section 3, contractors are encouraged to work with \n\nYouthBuild programs and participants when working on Federally-funded \n\nHUD projects. Contractors and registered apprenticeship sponsors that \n\nhire YouthBuild graduates will increase the competitiveness of their \n\nproposals when bidding on HUD-funding construction projects.\n\n    Supportive Services: This proposed definition adopts the definition \n\nfrom WIOA sec. 3(59). In this definition, linkages to community \n\nservices include but are not limited to services such as linkages to \n\nfree legal aid to help with the expungement of criminal records, \n\nsecuring government identification, and linkages to organizations that \n\nprovide youth the opportunity to develop their leadership skills \n\nthrough service to their respective community. This proposed definition \n\nidentifies additional services that are necessary for youth to \n\nparticipant in this program. Guidance regarding the provision of \n\nsupportive services will be issued by the Department.\n\n    Transitional Housing: The Department proposes to define this term \n\nas housing provided to ease the movement of individuals and families \n\nexperiencing homelessness to permanent housing within 24 months. This \n\ndefinition, per WIOA sec. 171(b)(11), is adopted from sec. 401(29) of \n\nthe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11360(29)).\n\n    Youth in Foster Care: This term means ``youth currently in foster \n\ncare or youth who have ever been in foster care.'' The Department is \n\nincluding it here as it was in WIA YouthBuild regulations.\n\n    Youthbuild Program: The Department proposes to define this term as \n\nany program that receives assistance under this section and provides \n\ndisadvantaged youth with opportunities for employment, education, \n\nleadership development, and training through the rehabilitation (which \n\nfor purposes of this section, must include energy efficiency \n\nenhancements) or construction of housing for homeless individuals and \n\nlow-income families, and public facilities. This proposed term adopts \n\nthe definition from WIOA sec. 171(b)(12).\n\n3. Subpart B--Funding and Grant Applications\n\nSection 688.200 How are YouthBuild grants funded and administered?\n\n    This proposed section describes how the Secretary uses funds \n\nauthorized for appropriation under WIOA sec. 171(i) to administer \n\nYouthBuild as a national program under title I, subtitle D of WIOA. \n\nThis section also notes that grants to operate YouthBuild programs are \n\n\n\nawarded to eligible entities through a competitive selection process, \n\nas required by WIOA sec. 171(c)(3). This proposed section retains the \n\nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 672.200.\n\nSection 688.210 How does an eligible entity apply for grant funds to \n\noperate a YouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(c)(1), generally \n\ndescribes the application process for the YouthBuild program.\n\nSection 688.220 How are eligible entities selected to receive grant \n\nfunds?\n\n    This proposed section, which implements WIOA sec. 171(c)(4), \n\ndescribes the selection criteria that will be considered by the \n\nSecretary when reviewing an application for funding. In addition to the \n\ncriteria described in the law, the Department has added additional \n\ncriteria in paragraphs (d), (e),\n\n[[Page 20794]]\n\nand (g) and added a new criteria in paragraph (i).\n\n    In paragraph (d), the Department has added ``counseling and case \n\nmanagement'' to the criteria described in sec. 171(c)(4)(D) because \n\nthese are essential to the success of YouthBuild participants.\n\n    In paragraph (e), in addition to the criteria at WIOA sec. \n\n171(c)(4)(E), the Department has clarified that applicants should train \n\nparticipants in sectors or occupations that are in demand locally to \n\nhelp them achieve a positive employment outcome after their exit from \n\nthe program. Paragraph (g) adds to the criteria at WIOA sec. \n\n171(c)(4)(I) by clarifying that the Department will also consider the \n\nextent to which the proposal provides for previously homeless families \n\nas well as individuals.\n\n    The Department has added a new criterion at paragraph (i) which \n\nlooks at the applicant's ability to enter into partnerships with a \n\nvariety of organizations and providers. Inclusion of this criterion is \n\nbeneficial to the grantee and the participant. No single grantee is \n\nable to provide all of the services that a participant will need to \n\nsucceed along her or his chosen career pathway. However, programs that \n\nenter into various types of partnerships are able to provide \n\nparticipants with needed supportive services, increasing the likelihood \n\nthat they will succeed both during and after their participation in the \n\nprogram.\n\n    Finally, paragraph (l) clarifies that the Department will apply \n\nvarying weights to these factors as described in the FOA.\n\nSection 688.230 What are the minimum requirements and elements to apply \n\n\n\nfor YouthBuild funds?\n\n    This proposed section implements WIOA section 171(c)(3)(B) and \n\ndescribes the minimum requirements and elements that must be included \n\nin an application for YouthBuild funds.\n\n    In addition to the requirement at sec. 171(c)(3)(B)(iii), proposed \n\nSec.  688.230(c) requires applicants to describe their experience \n\noperating a program under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban \n\nDevelopment Act of 1968. This requirement was added because the \n\nDepartment wants grantees to be aware that YouthBuild is specifically \n\nidentified in HUD's Section 3 regulations. In Section 3, contractors \n\nare encouraged to work with YouthBuild programs and participants when \n\nworking on Federally-funded HUD projects. The criteria described in \n\nthis proposed section will be included in the FOA.\n\n    The criteria described in this section emphasize strong connections \n\nto registered apprenticeship programs as a key component of the \n\nYouthBuild model, as well as connections to the one-stop system as a \n\nsupport for employer engagement, connecting with the Local Workforce \n\nDevelopment Board youth services, and connecting to the network of \n\nstanding youth committees at the local level. These connections will \n\nnot only strengthen YouthBuild programs, but better enable them to \n\nprovide a comprehensive spectrum of employment and training services to \n\ntheir participants.\n\n    Additionally, Sec.  688.230(l) proposes, consistent with current \n\npractice, that the Department will consider an applicant's past \n\nperformance under an award made by the Secretary of Labor to operate a \n\nYouthBuild program. This consideration will be based on the applicant's \n\npast Quarterly Performance Reports (ETA-9136) and Quarterly Financial \n\nReports (ETA-9130). Our past experience in administering the YouthBuild \n\nprogram has demonstrated that evaluating past performance allows the \n\nDepartment to conduct comprehensive analysis of the program's ability \n\nto meet the complicated requirements of YouthBuild. Additional details \n\nabout this requirement will be included in the FOA.\n\n    Finally, proposed paragraph (v) authorizes the Secretary to include \n\nadditional requirements in the FOA. This provision has been included to \n\nensure that the requirements upon which the Secretary is making its \n\ndetermination are based on adequately and accurately judging the \n\nability of the applicant in order to ensure the effective, efficient \n\nuse of Federal funds and maximum benefit to program participants and \n\nthe communities in which the proposed program will operate.\n\n\n\nSection 688.240 How are eligible entities notified of approval for \n\ngrant funds?\n\n    Consistent with sec. 171(c)(5) of WIOA, this proposed section \n\ndescribes how eligible entities are notified of the status of their \n\nrespective grant application submitted for funding and the time frame \n\nfor notification. This proposed section retains the same requirements \n\nfound at 20 CFR 672.215.\n\n4. Subpart C--Program Requirements\n\nSection 688.300 Who is an eligible participant?\n\n    This proposed section sets out the participant eligibility \n\nrequirements for enrollment in the YouthBuild program. It covers the \n\nrequired ages, education, income level, and other factors as well as \n\nexceptions. This proposed section implements the statutory eligibility \n\nrequirement at WIOA sec. 171(e)(1).\n\n    While the language ``its recognized State equivalent'' in Sec.  \n\n688.300(b)(1) is commonly understood to mean a GED, States can choose \n\nfrom several different equivalency tests that result in the attainment \n\nof a credential similar to the GED. Accordingly, the phrase \n\n``recognized State equivalent'' as used in this section refers to the \n\ncredential attained by passing any of the recognized equivalency tests.\n\n    While WIOA sec. 171(e)(1)(A)(ii) includes ``a youth offender'' as \n\nan eligible participant, proposed Sec.  688.300(a)(3)(iii) permits both \n\nadult and youth offenders to participate in the YouthBuild program. The \n\nreason for the inclusion of adult offenders is twofold. First, some \n\nStates categorize anyone who was convicted of a crime over the age of \n\n16 an adult. Because individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 are \n\neligible to participate in YouthBuild programs, not including adult \n\noffenders as eligible participants would exclude those 16 and 17 year \n\nolds who have been convicted of a crime from participating in the \n\nprogram. Including adult offenders in this list of eligible \n\nparticipants ensures that these youth with a substantial barrier to \n\nemployment will be able to participate in and benefit from the \n\nYouthBuild program.\n\nSection 688.310 Are there special rules that apply to veterans?\n\n    This section identifies the relevant rules for determining income \n\nfor veterans and priority of service for qualified veterans. These \n\nrules can be found in 20 CFR 683.230 and 20 CFR part 1010, \n\nrespectively. This proposed section retains the same requirements found \n\nat 20 CFR 672.305.\n\nSection 688.320 What eligible activities may be funded under the \n\nYouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section, which implements WIOA sec. 171(c)(2), \n\n\n\noutlines the activities that YouthBuild programs funded under this \n\nsection may provide to program participants, including the allowable \n\neducation and workforce training activities. Of note, sec. \n\n171(c)(2)(a)(i) of WIOA codified the Department's decision to allow \n\ntraining in in-demand industries with the approval of the Secretary.\n\n    In addition to the activities allowed by the statute, the \n\nDepartment, in Sec.  688.320, proposes to allow grantees to provide \n\nreferrals to mental health\n\n[[Page 20795]]\n\nservices and victim services, such as referrals to domestic violence \n\nservices or services to victims of gang violence. The Department has \n\ndecided to add this because it is not uncommon for our participants to \n\nenroll in our programs while at the same time dealing with the adverse \n\neffects of violence.\n\n    Finally, Sec.  688.320(a)(7)(ii) specifies that in order to provide \n\nneeds-based payments, a grantee must have a written policy which \n\nincludes the information described to sure that such payments are \n\nproper and fairly distributed.\n\nSection 688.330 What level of training qualifies a construction project \n\nas a qualifying work site under the YouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section provides requirements for YouthBuild grant \n\nprograms on what is considered a qualifying work site for purposes of \n\nallowable construction activities under the YouthBuild program.\n\n    While the YouthBuild program model requires hands-on construction \n\ntraining that supports the outcome of increasing the supply of \n\naffordable housing within the communities that YouthBuild serves, some \n\ngrant programs struggle to secure work sites that will offer the youth \n\nthe hands-on construction skills training obtained from either building \n\nhousing from scratch or through extensive rehabilitation of existing \n\nhousing stock.\n\n    Determining whether a work site meets the criteria for providing \n\nsubstantial hands-on experience is complex. As referenced in TEGL 35-\n\n12, ``Definition and Guidance on Allowable Construction Credentials for \n\nYouthBuild Programs,'' participants must study and pass testing in a \n\nnumber of modules, or skill areas, before one of the industry-\n\nrecognized construction certification programs will accredit them. \n\nThese modules include, for example, brick masonry, carpentry, painting, \n\nplumbing, and weatherization.\n\n    Per paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, several criteria \n\n\n\nmust be met in order for a work site to qualify as appropriate for \n\nconstruction skills training for YouthBuild participants. The first is \n\nwhether the worksite will provide the opportunity for hands-on training \n\nin at least two modules in a construction skills training program \n\noffering an industry-recognized credential. The second is whether the \n\ncompleted work site will be used by a family or individual that meets \n\nthe low-income threshold, as defined by the United States Housing Act \n\nof 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)). The third is whether the site provides \n\nsubstantial hands-on experience for youth. This means that the work \n\nsite must include from-the-ground-up building experience (e.g., \n\nfoundation, framing, roofing, dry wall installation, finishing, etc.) \n\nor a substantial level of rehabilitation (i.e., ``a gut job''). Fourth, \n\nper Sec.  688.730, all YouthBuild work sites must be built or renovated \n\nfor low-income individuals or families and are required to have a \n\nrestrictive covenant in place that only allows for rental or resale to \n\nlow-income participants for a particular period of time. Last, all work \n\nsites must adhere to the allowable construction and other capital asset \n\ncosts, as defined in TEGL 05-10, ``Match and Allowable Construction and \n\nOther Capital Asset Costs for the YouthBuild Program,'' or subsequent \n\nor similar guidance issued by the Department related to allowable \n\ncosts.\n\n    All grantees must use the required Work Site Description form (ETA-\n\n9143) in submitting proposed work sites for review and approval to and \n\nby the Department at the time of applying for grant funds. If after \n\napproval the grantee can no longer work at the approved construction \n\nsite, the grantee must submit another ETA-9143 for the proposed new \n\nwork site. The Work Site Description form requests specific information \n\non the property for building or rehabilitation, the participants' \n\nconstruction activities, the funding source for the construction, and \n\ndemonstration of ownership or access to the site.\n\n    By tying approved work sites with hands on training, the Department \n\ncan ensure youth have the necessary hands-on training and experience in \n\ntwo or more of these modules or skill areas in order to qualify for \n\nindustry-recognized credentials. The Department will issue guidance on \n\nthe types of work sites that are acceptable for construction training \n\nfor YouthBuild participants, and describe the minimum construction \n\nactivities that define work site training.\n\n\n\nSection 688.340 What timeframes apply to participation?\n\n    This proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(e)(2), provides \n\nthat the period of participation for YouthBuild participants while \n\nenrolled in the program is not less than 6 months and not more than 24 \n\nmonths. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 \n\nCFR 672.315.\n\nSection 688.350 What timeframes must be devoted to education and \n\nworkforce investment or other activities?\n\n    Implementing WIOA sec. 171(e)(3), this proposed section outlines \n\nthe requirements for the minimum amount of time that participants must \n\nengage in workforce and educational training activities. This section \n\nalso permits program participants to spend up to 10 percent of their \n\ntime engaged in leadership development and community service \n\nactivities, such as youth serving as crew leaders, participating on \n\npolicy councils, organizing community clean-up projects, leading youth \n\nvoter registration drives and organizing and hosting community anti-\n\nviolence conferences.\n\nSection 688.360 What timeframes apply to follow-up services?\n\n    This proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to provide \n\nfollow-up services for a period of 12 months after exit. These services \n\nare provided to program participants that have successfully exited the \n\nprogram to help them transition successfully into a post-secondary \n\neducation program or employment.\n\n    The Department proposes to require 12 months of follow-up services \n\nto align the length of services with the youth formula program and the \n\nnew performance measure requiring grantees to measure outcomes up to \n\nfour quarters after exit. The types of services provided and the \n\nduration of services must be determined based on the needs of the \n\nindividual and therefore, the type and intensity of follow-up services \n\nmay differ for each participant.\n\n    Consistent with the youth formula program, a participant that is \n\nreceiving follow-up services is considered to have exited the program, \n\nand therefore would be counted as having exited the program for the \n\npurpose of the performance measures described in Sec.  688.400.\n\nSection 688.370 What are the requirements for exit from the YouthBuild \n\nprogram?\n\n    This proposed section outlines the minimum criteria for successful \n\nexit from the YouthBuild program. One purpose of the YouthBuild program \n\nis for participants to receive practical skills and training that will \n\nallow them to successfully transition to employment or further \n\neducation. As used in this section, a successful exit occurs when a \n\nparticipant has completed his/her training and is ready to transition \n\n\n\nout of the program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (a) requires hands-on training because, based on \n\nour experience, participants that do not receive this training are less \n\nlikely to transition out of the program successfully, thereby \n\nundermining one of the primary purposes of the program.\n\n    Proposed paragraph (b) requires each YouthBuild program to create \n\nexit\n\n[[Page 20796]]\n\npolicies that establish any additional minimum requirements that youth \n\nmust meet in order to be considered to have successfully completed the \n\nprogram.\n\n    In the past, grantees have deemed participants to have exited the \n\nprogram, simultaneously upon graduation, before all program services \n\nhave been completed or delivered. This can result in lower performance \n\noutcome measures for the grantee and a lower post program success rate \n\nfor participants. Participants do not have to exit at the moment of \n\ngraduation. Exits can and should be based on the individual ongoing \n\nneeds of the participant. Transition services can be provided until the \n\nparticipant is ready for exit and may include college experience, \n\nsubsidized summer jobs, internships, or other activities that will help \n\nthe youth focus on post-program goals (for further details, please see \n\nSec.  688.320). It may also be best to have the youth already connected \n\nto a post-program placement before exit to ensure successful outcomes \n\nfor the youth and successful performance outcome measures for the \n\nprogram. In addition, because follow-up services are only available to \n\nparticipants that have successfully completed the program, adding this \n\nsection clarifies which participants are eligible to receive follow-up \n\nservices\n\nSection 688.380 What is the role of the YouthBuild grantee in the one-\n\nstop system?\n\n    WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) includes all of the programs authorized \n\nunder title I of WIOA as a required partner in the local one-stop \n\nsystem. This proposed section implements that provision by requiring \n\nYouthBuild grantees to take all actions required of required partners \n\ndescribed in sec. 121 of WIOA and 20 CFR part 678. The Department \n\nencourages its YouthBuild grantees to actively participate as a partner \n\nwith the one-stop system. Because of the positive role that a local \n\none-stop center can have on the operation of a local YouthBuild program \n\nand on the outcomes for YouthBuild participants, the local YouthBuild \n\ngrantee should serve as the required partner of the one-stop system as \n\nrequired by sec. 121 of WIOA.\n\n5. Subpart D--Performance Indicators\n\n\n\nSection 688.400 What are the performance indicators for YouthBuild \n\ngrants?\n\n    This proposed section describes performance indicators for the \n\nYouthBuild program, as required by WIOA sec. 171(f). Proposed Sec.  \n\n688.400(a) through (f) are the six primary indicators as required by \n\nsec. 116 (b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA. These measures of performance are the \n\nsame as the primary indicators discussed in proposed Sec.  677.155. \n\nThough the indicators of performance are identified in various places \n\nthroughout the WIOA proposed regulations, the indicators are the same \n\nand do not vary across the regulations. In addition to the six primary \n\nindicators, the Secretary may require YouthBuild programs to collect \n\nadditional information on performance. If additional performance \n\ninformation becomes a requirement for YouthBuild grantees, they will be \n\ninformed through a formal memorandum from the Department.\n\n    In calculating a program's performance, grantees must consider all \n\nof the participants that have exited the program, as that term is \n\ndefined in Sec.  688.120, not just those that have successfully exited \n\nthe program under the policy described in Sec.  688.370.\n\nSection 688.410 What are the required levels of performance for the \n\nperformance indicators?\n\n    This proposed section, implementing sec. 171(f) of the statute, \n\nprovides a description of how levels of performance are developed for \n\nYouthBuild programs.\n\nSection 688.420 What are the reporting requirements for YouthBuild \n\ngrantees?\n\n    This section outlines the performance, narrative, and financial \n\nreporting requirements for YouthBuild grantees and explains that any \n\nadditional information on the reporting requirements will be included \n\nin guidance issued by the Secretary. This proposed section retains the \n\nsame requirements found at 20 CFR 672.410.\n\nSection 688.430 What are the due dates for quarterly reporting?\n\n    This section provides due dates for quarterly performance reporting \n\nunder the YouthBuild program. This proposed section retains the same \n\nrequirements found at 20 CFR 672.415.\n\n6. Subpart E--Administrative Rules, Costs, and Limitations\n\nSection 688.500 What administrative regulations apply to the YouthBuild \n\nprogram?\n\n    This proposed section applies the relevant administrative \n\nrequirements and regulations applicable to all WIOA ETA programs to the \n\nYouthBuild program. This section requires each YouthBuild grantee to \n\ncomply with the general administrative requirements found in 20 CFR \n\npart 683, except those that apply only to the WIOA title I-B program, \n\n\n\nthe Uniform Administrative Requirements at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, 29 \n\nCFR parts 93, 94, and 98, and the nondiscrimination regulations at 29 \n\nCFR part 37.\n\n    The nondiscrimination regulations incorporated by this section at \n\nSec.  688.500(c)(2), 29 CFR part 37, broadly prohibit all forms of \n\ndiscrimination for WIOA title I programs, which include YouthBuild. In \n\nparticular, 29 CFR 37.5 states that ``[n]o individual in the United \n\nStates may, on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national \n\norigin, age, disability, political affiliation or belief, and for \n\nbeneficiaries only, citizenship or participation in any WIOA title I-\n\nfinancially assisted program or activity, be excluded from \n\nparticipation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination \n\nunder, or denied employment in the administration of or in connection \n\nwith any WIOA title I-funded program or activity.''\n\n    The regulations also require that grantees provide reasonable \n\naccommodations to youth who are individuals with disabilities, as found \n\nin 29 CFR 37.8. For grantees unsure of how to best accommodate youth \n\nwho are individuals with disabilities in their program, the Department \n\nrecommends that the grantees consult with the Job Accommodation Network \n\n[https://askjan.org/] or call (800) 526-7234 (Voice) (877) 781-9403 \n\n(TTY], a free service of the Department's Office of Disability \n\nEmployment Policy that provides employers with technical assistance on \n\naccommodating different disabilities.\n\n    In addition to prohibiting discrimination, YouthBuild grantees have \n\npositive requirements to ensure equal opportunity and prevent \n\ndiscrimination in their programs. YouthBuild grantees are required by \n\n29 CFR 37.29 through 37.32 to disseminate an equal opportunity policy. \n\nYouthBuild grantees also must ensure that they provide universal access \n\nto their programs, including advertising the program in a manner that \n\ntargets various populations, sending notices about openings in programs \n\nto community service groups that serve various populations, and \n\nconsulting with community service groups on ways to improve outreach \n\nand service to various populations, as required by 29 CFR 39.42.\n\n    YouthBuild grantees also are required to comply with all generally \n\napplicable laws and implementing regulations that apply to the grantees \n\nor their participants. For example, for participants who are youth with \n\ndisabilities and participate in secondary\n\n[[Page 20797]]\n\neducation programs, grantees must adhere to the administrative \n\nprovisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act at 34 \n\nCFR 300.320 through 300.324, which require that grantees provide youth \n\n\nwho are individuals with disabilities who enter the program with an \n\nappropriate transition plan corresponding to their individual needs.\n\n    Finally, proposed Sec.  688.500(d), implementing sec. 171(e)(5) of \n\nWIOA, requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with relevant State and \n\nlocal education standards for their programs and activities that award \n\nacademic credit or certify educational attainment.\n\nSection 688.510 How may grantees provide services under the YouthBuild \n\nprogram?\n\n    This proposed section, implementing WIOA sec. 171(h), authorizes \n\ngrantees to provide services directly or to enter into subgrants, \n\ncontracts, or other arrangements with various public and private \n\nentities. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at \n\n20 CFR 672.505.\n\nSection 688.520 What cost limits apply to the use of YouthBuild program \n\nfunds?\n\n    This proposed section implements WIOA secs. 171(c)(2)(C)(i) and \n\n(c)(2)(D), describing the limitations on the percentage of grant funds \n\nthat a YouthBuild grantee can spend on administrative costs and the \n\nrehabilitation or construction of a community or public facility. The \n\ndefinition of administrative costs can be found in 20 CFR 683.215.\n\nSection 688.530 What are the cost-sharing or matching requirements of \n\nthe YouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section provides that the cost-sharing or matching \n\nrequirements applicable to a YouthBuild grant generally will be \n\naddressed in the grant agreement, and also describes the requirements \n\nfor several specific costs.\n\n    Regarding the use of Federal funds, this section explains that \n\ngrantees must follow the requirements of 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900 in \n\nthe accounting, valuation, and reporting of the required non-Federal \n\nshare. Additionally, because inquiries about the allowability of using \n\nFederal funds as part of the cost-sharing or match amount is frequently \n\nasked by applicants, the regulations restate the prohibition on the use \n\nof such funds.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n672.515.\n\nSection 688.540 What are considered to be leveraged funds?\n\n    This proposed section addresses the use of additional money, known \n\nas leveraged funds, to support grant activities. It explains that \n\nleveraged funds include costs that could be an allowable match but are \n\nin excess of the match requirement or costs that do not meet the cost-\n\nsharing and match requirements set forth in the Uniform Administrative \n\nRequirements. To be considered leveraged funds, they must be otherwise \n\nallowable costs under the cost principles which have been used by the \n\n\n\ngrantee to support grant activity. For example, the Department would \n\nnot allow a grantee to count toward the match requirement another \n\nFederal grant used by the grantee or subgrantee to support otherwise \n\nallowable activities under the YouthBuild program. However, the \n\nDepartment would consider such a grant a leveraged fund.\n\n    The amount, commitment, nature and quality of the leveraged funds \n\ndescribed in the grant application will be considered as factors in \n\nevaluating grants in the FOA. The Department also will require grantees \n\nto report the use of such funds through their financial report and \n\nquarterly narrative report.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n672.520.\n\nSection 688.550 How are the costs associated with real property treated \n\nin the YouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section specifies which costs associated with real \n\nproperty are allowable and unallowable under the YouthBuild program. It \n\nexplains that the costs associated with the acquisition of buildings to \n\nbe rehabilitated for training purposes are allowable under the same \n\nproportionate share conditions that apply under the match provision at \n\nSec.  688.530, but only with prior grant officer approval. Costs \n\nrelated to construction and/or rehabilitation associated with the \n\ntraining of participants are allowed; however, costs associated with \n\nthe acquisition of land are not.\n\nSection 688.560 What participant costs are allowable under the \n\nYouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section permits payments to participants for work-\n\nrelated and non-work-related YouthBuild activities, supportive \n\nservices, needs-based payments, and additional benefits as allowable \n\nparticipant costs.\n\nSection 688.570 Does the Department allow incentive payments in the \n\nYouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section allows incentive payments to youth \n\nparticipants for recognition and achievement directly tied to training \n\nactivities and work experiences. Grantees must outline in writing how \n\nthey will use incentive payments. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) \n\nrequire that incentive payments be provided in accordance with the \n\norganization's general policies governing incentives and be related to \n\nthe goals of the specific YouthBuild program. All incentive payments \n\nmust be provided in accordance with the requirements in 2 CFR 200.\n\nSection 688.580 What effect do payments to YouthBuild participants have \n\n\n\non eligibility for other Federal needs-based benefits?\n\n    This proposed section explains the effect that payments to \n\nYouthBuild participants have on eligibility for other Federal needs \n\nbased benefits. Under WIOA regulations at 20 CFR 683.275(c), \n\nallowances, earnings, and payments to individuals participating in \n\nprograms under title I of WIOA are not considered as income for \n\npurposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of income \n\ntransfer and in-kind aid furnished under any Federal or Federally-\n\nassisted program based on need other than as provided under the SSA (42 \n\nU.S.C. 301).\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n672.535.\n\nSection 688.590 What program income requirements apply to the \n\nYouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section provides that the program income provisions \n\nof the Uniform Administrative Requirements at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900 \n\napply to the YouthBuild program. This section specifies that the \n\nrevenue from the sale or rental of buildings rehabilitated or \n\nconstructed under the YouthBuild program to homeless individuals and \n\nfamilies or low-income families, as specified in Sec.  688.730, is not \n\nconsidered program income. The Department encourages grantees to use \n\nsuch revenue for the long-term sustainability of the YouthBuild effort.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n672.540.\n\nSection 688.600 Are YouthBuild programs subject to the Davis-Bacon Act \n\nlabor standards?\n\n    This proposed section requires that when a YouthBuild participant \n\nworks\n\n[[Page 20798]]\n\non a project subject to Davis-Bacon labor standards, the Davis-Bacon \n\nlabor standards, including prevailing wage requirements, apply to the \n\nhours worked on the site of the work.\n\n    The regulations implementing the Davis-Bacon Act contain a \n\nprovision that allows for Department-certified training programs to pay \n\nless than the applicable prevailing wage rate to trainees when work is \n\nbeing performed on Federally-funded projects. As stipulated by 29 CFR \n\n5.5(a)(4)(ii), ``trainees'' are not permitted to be paid less than the \n\npredetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed \n\nunder an individual registered in a program which has received prior \n\napproval, evidenced by a formal certification by DOL. However, \n\n\n\nYouthBuild program participants are not considered ``trainees'' and \n\ntherefore must be paid the prevailing wage rate when they are \n\nperforming work on Federally-funded projects.\n\n    This proposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR \n\n672.545.\n\nSection 688.610 What are the recordkeeping requirements for YouthBuild \n\nprograms?\n\n    This section sets forth that grantees must follow the recordkeeping \n\nrequirements specified in the Uniform Administrative Requirements at 2 \n\nCFR parts 200 and 2900, and any additional requirements included in \n\nsubsequently issued guidance or the grantee's grant agreement. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.550.\n\n7. Subpart F--Additional Requirements\n\nSection 688.700 What are the safety requirements for the YouthBuild \n\nprogram?\n\n    This proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with \n\n20 CFR 683.280, which applies Federal and State health and safety \n\nstandards to the working conditions under WIOA-funded projects safety \n\nrequirements for YouthBuild programs, and the relevant child labor laws \n\nat 29 CFR part 570, governing the employment of children in hazardous \n\noccupations under the Fair Labor Standards Act. This proposed section \n\nis meant to protect the health and safety of YouthBuild participants on \n\nYouthBuild work sites, and to ensure that YouthBuild grantees comply \n\nwith relevant child labor laws.\n\nSection 688.710 What are the reporting requirements for youth safety?\n\n    This proposed section requires YouthBuild grantees to comply with \n\nthe OSHA reporting requirements in 29 CFR part 1904 if a participant \n\nsuffers a reportable injury while participating in the YouthBuild \n\nprogram. This proposed section retains the same requirements found at \n\n20 CFR 672.605.\n\nSection 688.720 What environmental protection laws apply to the \n\nYouthBuild program?\n\n    This proposed section requires grantees to comply with all \n\nenvironmental protection statutes and regulations, if applicable. This \n\nproposed section retains the same requirements found at 20 CFR 672.610.\n\nSection 688.730 What requirements apply to YouthBuild housing?\n\n    In order to effectively ensure that one of the primary purposes of \n\nthe YouthBuild program--to increase the stock of housing for homeless \n\nand low-income individuals and families--is met, this proposed section \n\nprovides additional requirements, including a series of restrictions on \n\nthe sale and use of units of housing built or renovated by a YouthBuild \n\n\n\ngrantee.\n\n    This proposed section also requires a YouthBuild grantee to ensure \n\nthat the owner of the property records a restrictive covenant on the \n\nproperty. The covenant must include the use restrictions in this \n\nsection and must be for a term of 5 years. The Department requires the \n\nrecordation of a restrictive covenant to ensure that YouthBuild funds \n\nare spent on projects that will benefit the intended beneficiaries of \n\nthe program beyond the life of the grant.\n\n    Under the WIA regulations, grantees were required to ensure that \n\nthe restrictive covenant was for a 10-year term. However, grantees have \n\nidentified the 10-year restrictive covenant as a barrier to recruiting \n\nand maintaining construction partners. The current requirement of a 10-\n\nyear covenant strictly binds partner organizations that may serve low-\n\nincome populations but also desire flexibility regarding to whom they \n\nmay sell the property in the future.\n\n    The term of the covenant was shortened in this proposed section in \n\norder to accommodate the difficulties faced by grantees while also \n\nensuring that the purpose of the program continues to be met. Reducing \n\nthe covenant period supports grantees in securing worksites where \n\ncommunity-based housing partners and private property owners are \n\nreluctant to agree to a 10-year covenant requirement. At the same time, \n\na 5-year term ensures that housing built or renovated using YouthBuild \n\nfunding remains available solely for the use of low-income and/or \n\nhomeless individuals and families for a period beyond the grantee's 3-\n\nyear period of performance. The Department specifically requests \n\ncomments on the restrictive covenant requirement and our proposal to \n\nshorten the length of the covenant.\n\nM. Part 651--General Provisions Governing the Federal-State Employment \n\nService System\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    In this proposed rule, the Department proposes to revise the ES \n\nregulations that implement the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. These include \n\nthe provision of ESs to all job seekers with a particular emphasis on \n\nMSFWs. The proposed rule will update the language and content of the \n\nregulations to, among other things, implement amendments made by title \n\nIII of WIOA to the Wagner-Peyser Act. In some areas, these regulations \n\nestablish entirely new responsibilities and procedures; in other areas, \n\nthe regulations clarify and update requirements already established. \n\nThe regulations make important changes to the following components of \n\nthe ES system: definitions, data submission, and ETA standards for \n\nagricultural housing, among others.\n\n\n\n2. Background\n\n    The Wagner-Peyser Act (Wagner-Peyser) of 1933 provided the \n\nDepartment the authority to establish a national ES system. The ES \n\nsystem provides labor exchange services to its participants and has \n\nundergone numerous changes to align its activities with broader \n\nnational workforce development policies and statutory requirements. \n\nWIOA expands upon the previous workforce reforms in the WIA and, among \n\nother provisions, identifies the ES system as a core program in the \n\none-stop system, embeds ES State planning requirements into a combined \n\nplanning approach, and increases requirements for the colocation of ES \n\noffices into the one-stop centers.\n\n    In 1974, the case National Association for the Advancement of \n\nColored People (NAACP), Western Region, et al. v. Brennan et al, No. \n\n2010-72, 1974 WL 229 (D.D.C. Aug. 13, 1974) resulted in a detailed \n\ncourt order mandating various Federal and State actions (referred to as \n\nthe Judge Richey Court Order (Richey Order) in the remainder of this \n\npreamble). The Richey Order required the Department to implement and \n\nmaintain a Federal and State monitoring and advocacy system and set \n\nforth requirements to ensure the delivery of ES services, benefits, and \n\nprotections to MSFWs on a non-discriminatory basis, and to provide such \n\nservices in a manner that is\n\n[[Page 20799]]\n\nqualitatively equivalent and quantitatively proportionate to those \n\nprovided to non-farmworkers. In 1980, the Department published \n\nregulations at 20 CFR parts 651, 653, and 658 to implement the \n\nrequirements of the Richey Order. Part 653 sets forth standards and \n\nprocedures for providing services to MSFWs and provides regulations \n\ngoverning the Agricultural Recruitment System (ARS), a system for \n\ninterstate and intrastate agricultural job recruitment. Part 658 sets \n\nforth standards and procedures for the administrative handling of \n\ncomplaints alleging violations of ES regulations and of employment-\n\nrelated laws, the discontinuation of services to employers by the ES \n\nsystem, the review and assessment of State agency compliance with ES \n\nregulations, and the Federal application of remedial action to State \n\nagencies. Also in 1980, the Department separately published amended \n\nregulations at 20 CFR part 654 providing agricultural housing standards \n\nfor MSFWs.\n\n    In 1983, the Department published the regulations at 20 CFR part \n\n652 that set forth standards and procedures regarding the establishment \n\nand functioning of State ES operations. Part 652 was amended in 1999 \n\nand 2000 to reflect provisions of WIA. The proposed rule aligns part \n\n652 with the WIOA amendments to the ES program, and with the WIOA \n\n\n\nreforms to the workforce system that affect the ES program.\n\n3. Discussion of Proposed 20 CFR Part 651\n\n    20 CFR part 651 sets forth definitions for 20 CFR parts 652, 653, \n\n654, and 658. The Department proposes to revise and update the \n\ndefinitions by eliminating outdated or obsolete definitions and by \n\nadding new definitions as needed. Throughout these parts it is \n\ngenerally proposed that the term ``State MSFW monitor advocate'' be \n\nreplaced with the term ``State monitor advocate'' (SMA) because MSFW-\n\nrelated responsibilities are inherent parts of the SMA position and \n\n``State monitor advocate'' is the commonly used term for the position. \n\nIt also is proposed that the term ``local office'' be replaced with \n\n``employment service office'' or ``one-stop center'' depending on the \n\ncontext. The Department also proposes that the definitions for \n\nfarmwork, farmworker, and agricultural worker be streamlined through \n\nreference to the same base line definition--farmwork. Also, the \n\ndefinition of farmwork is proposed to be revised by drawing language \n\nfrom definitions used in other Department regulations and eliminating \n\nreferences to the North American Industry Classification System \n\n(NAICS). Additionally, it is proposed that the definitions found at 20 \n\nCFR 652.1 be moved to 20 CFR 651.10 because it is the intention of part \n\n651 to include Wagner-Peyser ES program definitions. It is proposed \n\nthat the following definitions be added as they are provided in sec. 2 \n\nof the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by sec. 302 of WIOA, and pertain \n\nto the scope of definitions covered by Sec.  651.10: Local Workforce \n\nDevelopment Board, one-stop center, one-stop delivery system, one-stop \n\npartner, training services, and workforce development activity. All of \n\nthese adhere strictly to WIOA and Wagner-Peyser definitions. The \n\nDepartment notes that the WIOA amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act also \n\nadd the definitions of CEO, institutions of higher education, and \n\nworkplace learning advisor, but these definitions are not proposed to \n\nbe added to the regulatory text of Sec.  651.10 because the terms are \n\nnot used in parts 652, 653, 654, or 658. Finally, sec. 134 of WIOA \n\nmerges the categories of core services and intensive services under WIA \n\ninto career services. Since WIOA includes responsibilities for the \n\nWagner-Peyser ES in the provision of career services, a definition for \n\ncareer services has been proposed to be added.\n\n    The definition of act is proposed to be added to Sec.  651.10, \n\nmoved from 20 CFR 652.1.\n\n    The definition of agricultural worker is proposed to be eliminated \n\nbecause the term is synonymous with the definition of farmworker \n\ndescribed in this section. The proposed regulatory text directs the \n\nreader to the definition of farmworker.\n\n    The definition of applicant is proposed to be eliminated because \n\n\n\nthe Department proposes to replace the term with participant as defined \n\nin this section. This change is proposed to align with the language in \n\nWIOA and conform to reporting requirements which include all MSFWs who \n\napply for and/or receive Wagner-Peyser Act services.\n\n    The definitions for Applicant Holding Office, Applicant Holding \n\nState, and Order Holding Office are proposed to be added because the \n\nterms are used throughout 20 CFR part 658 and adding the definitions \n\nclarifies the process for stakeholders. The proposed language in each \n\ndefinition derives from the purpose and scope defined in Sec.  653.500. \n\nThe inclusion of ``U.S. workers'' in these definitions helps to clarify \n\nthat ARS is intended for the recruitment of U.S.-based workers only.\n\n    The definition of application card is proposed to be deleted as the \n\ndocument is generally no longer used as part of Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nservices. ES offices have moved from a paper-based system to an online \n\nsystem and participants register for services in a variety of ways \n\nelectronically.\n\n    The definition of career services is proposed to be added, as \n\ndiscussed above.\n\n    A definition of clearance order is proposed to be added to \n\ndistinguish it from a job order.\n\n    The definition of clearance is proposed to be revised to clearance \n\nsystem and reflect secs. 3 and 7 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as well as \n\n20 CFR 652.3, which describes the basic labor exchange system as ``a \n\nsystem for clearing labor between States.'' The updated language \n\nclarifies that this clearance system moves job seekers through an ES \n\noffice or more than one such office, depending on the needs of the \n\nindividual and the available job or jobs.\n\n    A revised definition of complaint is proposed to align with \n\nlanguage in sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA sec. \n\n302, to refer to ``employment service'' offices rather than ``job \n\nservice'' (JS) offices. The revised definition specifies that \n\ncomplaints are representations or referrals of alleged violations of ES \n\nregulations, Federal laws enforced by the Department's WHD or OSHA, or \n\nState or local employment-related laws. The Department proposes to add \n\nlanguage in the definition clarifying that the complaints filed are \n\nalleging a violation occurred, rather than confirming that a complaint \n\nrepresents an actual violation--which may be determined after the \n\ncomplaint is under investigation pursuant to 658 subpart F.\n\n    The definition of day haul is proposed to be deleted as the term is \n\nno longer relevant with the proposed deletion of 20 CFR 653.105 and \n\n653.106.\n\n    A revised definition of Employment and Training Administration \n\n(ETA) is proposed to conform to the description of ETA that is \n\n\n\ncurrently used.\n\n    A definition of employment-related laws is proposed to be added to \n\nconform to the proposed complaint procedures in 20 CFR part 658.\n\n    A definition of the term Employment Service (ES) is proposed to \n\nreplace the definition for the term Job Service (JS) in order to \n\nconform to the terminology used in the Wagner-Peyser Act as amended by \n\nWIOA. For this reason, throughout these proposed regulations, the term \n\nEmployment Service (ES) replaces the term JS.\n\n    A definition of Employment Service regulations (ES regulations) is \n\nproposed to replace the definition of JS regulations. The purpose of \n\nthis change\n\n[[Page 20800]]\n\nis to conform to language in the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA, \n\nand to include only relevant regulations. The proposed definition now \n\nincludes Federal regulations at 20 CFR parts 651, 652, 653, 654, and \n\n658 and at 29 CFR part 75, and removes references to 20 CFR parts 620 \n\nand 621 because they are reserved, the reference to 29 CFR part 8 \n\nbecause Employment Service is not referenced in that part, and 29 CFR \n\npart 26 because it does not exist.\n\n    The proposed definition of farmwork will eliminate references to \n\nNAICS codes and include language aligning it with pertinent definitions \n\nin other Department regulations at 29 CFR 500.20 and 20 CFR 655.103(c). \n\nDrawing language from those definitions clarifies what is covered by \n\nthe term farmwork and slightly expands the term to include certain \n\noccupations and activities covered by the Department's Office of \n\nForeign Labor Certification (OFLC) and/or WHD. It is also proposed that \n\nthe revised definition of farmwork fold in food ``processing'' work to \n\nalign Sec.  651.10 with OFLC regulations at 20 CFR 655.103(c)(1) which \n\ninclude food processing worker in the definition for agricultural labor \n\nor services. Including food processing work in the revised definition \n\nexpands the scope of those who would be considered farmworkers. It also \n\nallows the Department to streamline the regulations by eliminating the \n\nseparate definition of migrant food processing worker without reducing \n\nES coverage or protections of such workers. The addition of food \n\nprocessing work to the revised definition of farmwork also expands the \n\ncapability of Wagner-Peyser staff to provide services to more MSFWs. \n\nThe Department will provide guidance to clarify what is considered food \n\n``processing.'' Fish farming is added to conform to sec. 167 of WIOA.\n\n    The reference to ``. . . the cultivation and tillage of the soil, \n\n\n\ndairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any \n\nagricultural or horticultural commodities'' and ``[t]his includes the \n\nraising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry, the \n\nfarming of fish, and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering \n\noperations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in \n\nconjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for \n\nmarket, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for \n\ntransportation to market'' is adapted from 20 CFR 655.103(c)(2) which \n\nreferences 29 U.S.C. 203(f), as amended (sec. 3(f) of the FLSA, as \n\ncodified). The language ``the handling, planting, drying, packing, \n\npackaging, processing, freezing, or grading prior to delivery for \n\nstorage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its \n\nunmanufactured state,'' is adapted from 20 CFR 655.103 which references \n\nsec. 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 3121(g)). \n\nThe language ``agricultural commodities means all commodities produced \n\non a farm including, but not limited to, crude gum (oleoresin) from a \n\nliving tree, and the following products as processed by the original \n\nproducer of the crude gum (oleoresin) from which derived: gum spirits \n\nof turpentine and gum rosin'' is taken from OFLC 20 CFR 655.103 and \n\naligns with WHD 29 CFR 500.20. Under the proposed definition, the \n\nactivities and services currently included by reference to NAICS codes \n\n111, 112, 115 will still be included whether explicit in the definition \n\nor through Department guidance, and those activities and services \n\ncurrently excluded by reference to NAICS codes 1152 and 1153 will still \n\nbe excluded, excepting the proposed addition of fish farming. The NAICS \n\nreference to code 1125 will be covered through Department guidance as \n\nit relates to fish farming.\n\n    The Department anticipates the following impact of expanding the \n\ndefinition of farmworker and aligning it with the WHD and OFLC \n\ndefinitions: (1) State agency employees will more easily distinguish \n\nMSFWs for reporting purposes; (2) the proposed definition will also \n\nalign with that of the proposed updated definition under 20 CFR part \n\n685 for the NFJP; (3) more farmworkers will be served as such under \n\nWagner-Peyser because fewer people would be excluded under the expanded \n\ndefinition; (4) the Department will maintain consistency with the \n\nintent of the Richey Order to update data gathering systems to \n\naccurately reflect services delivered; and (5) the Department's data \n\nreporting will improve because under the different regulations, the \n\nDepartment's agencies will utilize basically the same definition for \n\n\n\nfarmworker and therefore will accurately reflect the number of MSFWs \n\nidentified across all programs. At the end of the proposed definition, \n\nthe Department proposes to add a sentence to include any service or \n\nactivity covered under 20 CFR 655.103(c) (definition of agricultural \n\nlabor or services) and/or under 29 CFR 500.20(e) (agricultural \n\nemployment) and/or through official published Department guidance, such \n\nas a TEGL, to allow for other current or future types of farmwork to be \n\nincluded.\n\n    A revised definition of farmworker is proposed to conform to the \n\nproposed definition of farmwork in this section.\n\n    A definition of field checks is proposed to be added to Sec.  \n\n651.10 because the term is referenced in 20 CFR 653.503 but was \n\npreviously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the meaning for \n\nthose who conduct or receive field checks.\n\n    A definition of field visits is proposed to be added to Sec.  \n\n651.10 because the term is referenced in 20 CFR 653.108 but was \n\npreviously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the meaning for \n\nthose who conduct or receive field visits.\n\n    The definition of full application is proposed to be deleted \n\nbecause State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) generally do not utilize the \n\nfull or partial application process. Instead, participants submit \n\nresumes or other information to register in the SWA network.\n\n    The definition of Governor is proposed to be added to Sec.  651.10, \n\nmoved from 20 CFR 652.1. Additionally, the Department proposes to add \n\nreference to the outlying areas in the definition to be clear that \n\ntheir chief executives are included when this part references a \n\nGovernor.\n\n    The definition of identification card is proposed to be deleted as \n\nthe document is no longer utilized as part of Wagner-Peyser services. \n\nSWAs have moved from paper-based to electronic-based systems and \n\nparticipants often log in using whatever information is required for \n\nthat particular system.\n\n    A definition of interstate job order is proposed to be added to \n\nSec.  651.10 because it is referenced in the ES regulations but was \n\npreviously undefined. Adding the definition clarifies the difference \n\nbetween interstate and intrastate job orders.\n\n    A revised definition of intrastate clearance order is proposed to \n\nconform to the ``employment service'' terminology used in the Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act as amended by WIOA. Interstate or intrastate clearance order \n\nmeans an agricultural job order for temporary employment describing one \n\nor more hard-to-fill job openings, which an ES office uses to request \n\n\n\nrecruitment assistance from other ES offices.\n\n    The definition of job bank is proposed to be deleted because the \n\nsystem, as it was previously defined, no longer exists. Now, most job \n\nopenings are posted on internet-based systems.\n\n    The definition of job development is proposed to be slightly \n\nrevised to refer to an ``employment service office'' rather than a \n\n``local office.''\n\n    The definition of Job Information Service (JIS) is proposed to be \n\ndeleted as resource centers replace JIS areas inside one-stop centers.\n\n[[Page 20801]]\n\n    In the definition of job opening, it is proposed that the term \n\napplicants be replaced with the term participants to be consistent with \n\nthe replacement term applicant in this section.\n\n    A definition of job order is proposed to be added to clarify the \n\ndifference between a job order and a clearance order. The language for \n\nthis definition is derived from 20 CFR 655.5.\n\n    The definition of job referral is proposed to be revised to include \n\n``or for a potential job'' because the current definition is limited to \n\nthe availability of a specific job and this revision opens job \n\nreferrals to include situations that are responding to the possibility \n\nof employment.\n\n    A revised definition of labor market area is proposed to be revised \n\nto conform to the definition in sec. 3 of WIOA.\n\n    The definition of Local Office Manager is proposed to be revised to \n\nconform to the ``employment service'' terminology used in the Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act as amended by WIOA.\n\n    The definition of Local Workforce Development Board is proposed to \n\nbe added to conform with sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by \n\nWIOA.\n\n    The definition of migrant farmworker is proposed to be revised to \n\nconform to the updated definition of farmworker.\n\n    The definition of migrant food processing worker is proposed to be \n\nsynonymous with the proposed definition of migrant farmworker.\n\n    Within the definition of MSFW it is proposed that ``migrant food \n\nprocessing worker'' be deleted to conform to the above proposed \n\ndefinition of migrant food processing worker. No reduction in coverage \n\nis intended by this change.\n\n    The definitions of one-stop center, one-stop delivery system, and \n\none-stop partner are proposed to be added to Sec.  651.10 to conform \n\nwith sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA.\n\n    The definition of O*NET-SOC is proposed to be revised to clarify \n\nthat O*NET SOC codes are based on, but more detailed than, Standard \n\n\n\nOccupation Codes used across Federal statistical agencies.\n\n    The definition of Order Holding Office is proposed to be added for \n\nreasons explained above.\n\n    The definition of onsite review is proposed to be added because \n\nthese reviews are mandated under the Richey Order and are found \n\nthroughout the regulations at 20 CFR parts 653 and 658. The language \n\nfor the proposed definition is taken from 20 CFR 653.108(g).\n\n    It is proposed that the definition of outreach contact be added to \n\nSec.  651.10 for clarification. The language for the definition is \n\ntaken from Sec.  653.107.\n\n    The definition of partial application is proposed to be deleted \n\nbecause it is generally no longer used by ES offices or SWAs. Instead, \n\nparticipants submit resumes or other information to register in the SWA \n\nnetwork.\n\n    The definition of participant is proposed to be added to replace \n\nthe definition of applicant, as discussed above. This definition only \n\napplies to the Wagner-Peyser regulations at parts 651, 652, 653, and \n\n658. Proposed Sec.  677.150(a) includes a separate, narrower definition \n\nof ``participant'' for purposes of performance accountability under \n\nsec. 116 of WIOA and 20 CFR part 677. Therefore, an individual who is \n\nconsidered a participant for the purpose of these Wagner-Peryser \n\nregulations would not necessarily be considered a participant for \n\nperformance accountability purposes.\n\n    The definition of Program Budget Plan (PBP) is proposed to be \n\ndeleted because the PBP is obsolete and the amendment to sec. 8 of \n\nWagner-Peyser now calls for States to submit Unified or Combined State \n\nPlans.\n\n    The definition of RA is proposed to be deleted because the \n\ndefinition for Regional Administrator with the appropriate acronym is \n\nalready described in this section.\n\n    The definition for rural area is proposed to be eliminated because \n\nthe term is not used at 20 CFR parts 652, 653, 654, or 658 and is \n\ntherefore not necessary to define in this section.\n\n    The definition of seasonal farmworker is proposed to be revised to \n\nmean an individual who, over the past 12 months, has been employed in \n\nfarmwork of a seasonal or other temporary nature. This proposed \n\ndefinition seeks to simplify and clarify the meaning of seasonal \n\nfarmworker, and conform to the definitions used by the Department's WHD \n\nfor seasonal agricultural workers under 29 CFR part 500, and the OFLC \n\nunder 20 CFR part 655. Additionally, the Department proposes to retain \n\nthe 12-month period originally used in the definition of seasonal \n\nfarmworker at 20 CFR 651.10 to minimize the time period that an \n\n\n\nindividual could assert that he/she is a seasonal farmworker. The \n\nDepartment anticipates that this updated definition will more \n\naccurately reflect the total number of seasonal farmworkers that \n\nparticipate in the ES system. The Department also anticipates that ES \n\nstaff will more easily be able to identify seasonal farmworkers for \n\nreporting purposes.\n\n    In the definitions of Significant MSFW Local Offices and \n\nSignificant Bilingual MSFW Local Offices, the references to ``local \n\noffices'' are proposed to be replaced with ``one-stop centers'' because \n\nthe WIOA amendment to the Wagner-Peyser Act requires colocation of \n\nWagner-Peyser ESs in a one-stop center. Additionally, expanding the \n\nscope of the term will help States determine not only at which one-stop \n\ncenters ESs must be sufficiently staffed to meet the needs of MSFWs, \n\nbut also will identify one-stop centers that need to consider the needs \n\nof a significant number of MSFWs who do not speak English, in order to \n\nmeet the requirements for making services accessible, as described in \n\nSec.  678.800. This also helps the Department conform to the intent of \n\nthe Richey Order to serve MSFWs on a qualitatively equivalent and \n\nquantitatively proportionate basis. The term bilingual is proposed to \n\nbe replaced with multilingual in the latter title to conform to the \n\ncurrent trend of MSFWs speaking additional languages other than English \n\nand/or Spanish. Also, the references to ``applicants'' are proposed to \n\nbe replaced with ``participants,'' to conform to the proposed changes \n\nin these definitions.\n\n    The definition of Significant MSFW States remains unchanged; \n\nhowever, the reference to the Department organizational unit ETA has \n\nbeen replaced with the Department to be consistent with other \n\nreferences throughout the section.\n\n    The definition of State Administrator is proposed to be revised to \n\nchange ``State Employment Security Agency'' to ``State Workforce \n\nAgency'' to reflect language used in WIOA title I.\n\n    The definition of State Workforce Agency (SWA) is proposed to be \n\nrevised to conform to sec. 2 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by \n\ntitle III of WIOA. The language ``formerly State Employment Security \n\nAgency or SESA'' is proposed to be deleted because the SESA terminology \n\nis outdated and no longer needs reference.\n\n    The definition of State Workforce Development Board (State Board) \n\nis proposed to be added to Sec.  651.10, moved from 20 CFR 652.1 and \n\nupdated from the former text, which defined State Workforce Investment \n\nBoard.\n\n    The definition of Supply State(s) is proposed to be added to \n\n\n\nclarify its meaning under the ARS.\n\n    The definition of supportive services is proposed to be revised to \n\nconform to the definition for ``supportive services'' in sec. 3 of WIOA \n\nand to make clear that supportive services are also available to\n\n[[Page 20802]]\n\nindividuals participating in activities funded by the Wagner-Peyser \n\nAct.\n\n    The definition of tests is proposed to be deleted because the \n\nDepartment does not offer tests to ES participants.\n\n    The definition of training services is proposed to replace the \n\ndefinition of training, and the proposed definition references the \n\nservices provided under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3).\n\n    The definition of transaction is proposed to be deleted because the \n\nterm is not used in the relevant sections under this chapter.\n\n    A definition of unemployment insurance claimant is proposed to be \n\nadded in this section to conform to the emphasis on serving this \n\npopulation in the WIOA amendments to secs. 7(a)(1) and (3) of the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act.\n\n    The definition of vocational plan is proposed to be deleted because \n\nthe Wagner-Peyser Act does not require the establishment of such plans \n\nfor job seekers in the ES system.\n\n    The definition of WIOA is proposed to be added to Sec.  651.10, \n\nmoved from 20 CFR 652.1 and updated. Section 652.1 defines WIA.\n\n    The definitions of Workforce and Labor Market Information (WLMI) \n\nand Workforce Labor Market Information System (WLMIS) are proposed to \n\nconform to the provisions in sec. 308 of the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\n    The definition for working days is proposed to be added to 20 CFR \n\n651 because it is originally located in 20 CFR 653.501 and fits more \n\nappropriately under part 651.\n\n    A definition of work test is proposed to be added in this section \n\nto ensure that individuals who are eligible for UI benefits meet \n\ncontinued eligibility requirements with respect to work search. The \n\nWagner-Peyser Act's requirements for administering the work test are \n\nfurther discussed in 20 CFR 652.210.\n\nN. Part 652--Establishment and Functioning of State Employment Services\n\nSection 1. Introduction\n\n    The Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 established the one Act ES, which is \n\na nationwide system of public employment offices amended in 1998 to \n\nmake ES part of the one-stop delivery system established under WIA. ES \n\n\n\nseeks to improve the functioning of the nation's labor markets by \n\nbringing together individuals seeking employment with employers seeking \n\nworkers.\n\n    The amended Wagner-Peyser Act furthers longstanding goals of closer \n\ncollaboration with other employment and training programs by mandating \n\ncolocation of ES offices with one-stop centers; aligning service \n\ndelivery in the one-stop delivery system; and ensuring alignment of \n\nState planning and performance measures in the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem. Other new provisions are consistent with long-term Departmental \n\npolicies, including increased emphasis on reemployment services for UI \n\nclaimants (sec. 7(a)); promoting robust WLMI; the development of \n\nnational electronic tools for jobseekers and businesses (sec. 3(e)); \n\ndissemination of information on best practices (sec. 3(c)(2)); and \n\nprofessional development for ES staff (secs. 3(c)(4) and 7(b)(3)).\n\n2. Subpart A--Employment Service Operations\n\n    This subpart includes an explanation of the scope and purpose of \n\nthe ES system, the rules governing allotments and grant agreements, \n\nauthorized services, administrative provisions, and rules governing \n\nlabor disputes. The proposed rule makes few changes in subpart A.\n\nSection 652.1 Introduction\n\n    This section introduces the Wagner-Peyser Act regulations, as \n\namended by WIOA. Therefore, the Department proposes to delete paragraph \n\n(b) of Sec.  652.1 and change the title of the section from \n\n``Introduction and definitions'' to ``Introduction.''\n\nSection 652.2 Scope and Purpose of the Employment Service System\n\n    The Department proposes no changes in this section, which briefly \n\ndescribes the public labor exchange system.\n\nSection 652.3 Public Labor Exchange Services System\n\n    This section explains the minimum services that must be offered by \n\nthe public labor exchange system. The Department proposes adding \n\nparagraph (f) to align the title to the changes in WIOA and cite to \n\nsec. 134(c)(2)(A)(iv) of WIOA.\n\n    The Department proposes to align the Wagner-Peyser definitions of \n\nlabor exchange services with those described under WIOA. The Department \n\nis seeking public comments on any issues or challenges in aligning \n\nlabor exchange services described under WIOA with the labor exchange \n\nservices provided by the ES.\n\n    Finally, the Department proposes to add to Sec.  652.3(a) a clause \n\nto implement the emphasis the Act, as amended, places on national \n\nelectronic tools (WIOA sec. 303(c), amending sec. 3(e) of Wagner-\n\nPeyser). The proposed clause, which would clarify that each State's \n\nobligation to assist jobseekers includes promoting their familiarity \n\nwith the Department's electronic tools, is designed to improve customer \n\n\n\naccess to labor exchange and workforce information.\n\n    The statutory provision recognizes the Department's longstanding \n\nefforts in this area. Since the 1990s, the Department has greatly \n\nexpanded its national electronic tools to enhance short-term labor \n\nexchanges and support longer-term career aspirations for multiple \n\naudiences: Jobseekers; employers; students; employment and training \n\nstaff; educators and guidance counselors; Federal, State and local \n\npolicy-makers and planners; CBOs; librarians; and other individuals and \n\nentities that assist with the job search and career needs of Americans. \n\nThe Department offers electronic tools through such Web portals as \n\nCareerOneStop (www.careeronestop.org); O*NET OnLine \n\n(           www.onetonline.org) and O*NET's My Next Move (           www.mynextmove.org); and \n\nthe WLMI provided through the BLS (           www.bls.gov) and the U.S. ETA's \n\nLabor Market Information Community of Practice (           https://winwin.workforce3one.org/page/home).\n\nSection 652.4 Allotment of Funds and Grant Agreement\n\n    The Department proposes no changes in this section, which ensures \n\nthat allotment information is publicly available with sufficient notice \n\nto allow public comment and to resolve complaints, and that grant \n\nagreements with the States meet all applicable statutes and \n\nregulations.\n\nSection 652.5 Services Authorized\n\n    The Department proposes only minor changes conforming to WIOA in \n\nthis section, State expenditures. Specifically, the proposed \n\nregulations substitutes ``funds'' with ``sums'' and substitutes ``basic \n\nlabor exchange elements'' with ``minimum labor exchange elements.'' \n\nBoth changes were made to align with the Act as amended.\n\nSection 652.8 Administrative Provisions\n\n    This section covers administrative matters, including financial and \n\nprogram management information systems, recordkeeping and retention of \n\nrecords, required reports, monitoring and audits, costs, disclosure of \n\ninformation, and sanctions. The Department proposes to eliminate \n\nparagraph (d)(6) of this section which addressed amortization payments \n\nto\n\n[[Page 20803]]\n\nStates which had independent retirement plans in their State ES \n\nagencies prior to 1980. This paragraph is no longer applicable to any \n\nState and no State may revert back to a retirement system where these \n\nprovisions apply. The Department is also proposing to change the record \n\nretention requirements for work applications and job orders from 1 year \n\nhttp://www.careeronestop.org/\nhttp://www.onetonline.org/\nhttp://www.mynextmove.org/\nhttp://www.bls.gov/\n\nto 3 years in order to align with other Wagner-Peyser record retention \n\nrequirements. Finally, the Department proposes to amend paragraph (f) \n\nto require that financial audits be conducted under the same \n\nrequirements that apply to audits under WIOA at 20 CFR 683.210.\n\nSection 652.9 Labor Disputes.\n\n    This section is designed to preserve the neutrality of the ES in \n\nthe event of a labor dispute, such as a strike. The Department proposes \n\nno changes in this section, as WIOA made no amendments to the Wagner-\n\nPeyser Act relevant to this section.\n\n3. Subpart B--Services for Veterans\n\n    This subpart merely refers the reader to the relevant regulatory \n\nsection governing services to veterans.\n\nSection 652.100 Services for Veterans\n\n    The Department proposes to amend this section to clarify that \n\nveterans receive priority of service for all Department-funded \n\nemployment and training programs, as described in 20 CFR part 1010. The \n\nproposed amendment also clarifies that the Department's Veterans' \n\nEmployment and Training Service (VETS) administers the Jobs for \n\nVeterans State Grants (JVSG) program and other activities and training \n\nprograms which provide services to specific populations of eligible \n\nveterans.\n\n4. Subpart C--Wagner-Peyser Act Services in a One-Stop Delivery System \n\nEnvironment\n\n    This subpart discusses State agency roles and responsibilities, \n\nrules governing ES offices, the relationship between the ES and the \n\none-stop system, required and allowable Wagner-Peyser services, \n\nuniversal service access requirements, provision of services and work \n\ntest requirements for UI claimants, State planning, and State merit \n\nstaffing requirements.\n\n    WIOA ensures the ES's key role in the one-stop delivery system by \n\nmaking it one of the core workforce programs. The ES must be a part of \n\nthe State planning process, collocated with the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem, and must align its service delivery and performance measures \n\nwith the rest of the one-stop system. This subpart addresses how the ES \n\nis to fulfill its mission of providing labor exchange services to job \n\nseekers and businesses in the one-stop delivery system.\n\nSection 652.200 What is the Purpose of This Subpart?\n\n    The general purpose of this subpart is to provide guidance for \n\nimplementing Wagner-Peyser services within the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem.\n\nSection 652.201 What is the role of the State agency in the one-stop \n\ndelivery system?\n\n    This section emphasizes the leadership role played by the State in \n\n\n\nthe one-stop system, including the delivery of Wagner-Peyser services. \n\nThe Department proposes changing ``Workforce Investment Board'' to \n\n``Workforce Development Board,'' to be consistent with WIOA's \n\nterminology.\n\nSection 652.202 May local Employment Service Offices exist outside of \n\nthe one-stop service delivery system?\n\n    The Department is proposing to delete paragraph (b) of this section \n\nto align with WIOA's approach to colocation of services and prohibition \n\nagainst stand-alone employment service offices. Additionally, the \n\nDepartment proposes to change the text of what was paragraph (a) to \n\nprovide a clear statement that ES offices must be collocated in one-\n\nstop centers, as required by WIOA. WIA strongly encouraged the \n\ncolocation of ES and one-stop offices, but allowed some stand-alone ES \n\noffices under limited circumstances. Section 303(d) of WIOA modified \n\nsec. 3(d) of Wagner-Peyser to eliminate these exceptions and made \n\ncolocation mandatory. Therefore, stand-alone ES offices are no longer \n\npermissible, as explained in Sec. Sec.  678.310-678.315.\n\n    Colocation is intended to achieve several purposes: improved \n\nservice delivery and coordination, less duplication of services, and \n\ngreater access to services in underserved areas.\n\nSection 652.203 Who is responsible for funds authorized under the Act \n\nin the workforce investment system?\n\n    The Department proposes no changes in this regulation, which \n\nstipulates that the State agency is responsible for all Wagner-Peyser \n\nfunds.\n\nSection 652.204 Must funds authorized under the Act (the Governor's \n\nreserve) flow through the one-stop delivery system?\n\n    This section clarifies that the Governor's reserve funds may or may \n\nnot be delivered through the one-stop system. The Department proposes \n\nto identify the services in sec. 7(b) of the Act that these funds must \n\nbe used to provide. WIOA does not change these services; however, it is \n\nhelpful to list the services in this section. As required by sec. 7(b) \n\nof the Act, the services are: performance incentives, supporting \n\nexemplary models of service delivery, and services for groups with \n\nspecial needs.\n\nSection 652.205 May funds authorized under the Act be used to \n\nsupplement funding for labor exchange programs authorized under \n\nseparate legislation?\n\n    The Department proposes only minor nomenclature changes in this \n\nsection, which explains under what conditions funds under secs. 7(a) or \n\n7(b) of Wagner-Peyser may be used to provide additional funds to other \n\nprograms.\n\nSection 652.206 May a State use funds authorized under the Act to \n\n\n\nprovide applicable ``career services,'' as defined in the Workforce \n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    The Department is proposing in this section to align Wagner-Peyser \n\nservice delivery with the service delivery changes in WIOA. Under WIA, \n\nnon-training services were generally identified as either ``core'' or \n\n``intensive'' services. WIOA has removed the terms ``core'' and \n\n``intensive'' and these services are now called ``career services.'' \n\nThe primary goal of the change to ``career services'' was to eliminate \n\nany sequencing of service requirements and to ensure participants had a \n\nbroad array of services available to them based on a participant's \n\nemployment needs.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  678.430 organizes the WIOA career services into \n\nthree categories: (1) Career services that must be made available to \n\nall participants; (2) career services that must be made available if \n\ndeemed appropriate and needed for an individual to obtain or retain \n\nemployment; and (3) follow-up activities. The proposed regulation \n\nrespectively designates these categories as basic career services \n\n(Sec.  678.430(a)), individualized career services (Sec.  678.430(b)), \n\nand follow-up services (Sec.  678.430(c)).\n\n    Labor exchange services, which are the primary services provided by \n\nthe ES, fall under the ``basic career services''\n\n[[Page 20804]]\n\nidentified in proposed Sec.  678.430(a) and listed in sec. 134(c)(2)(A) \n\nof WIOA. This section is designed to provide that Wagner-Peyser staff \n\nmust use funds authorized by sec. 7(a) of the Act to provide the basic \n\ncareer services.\n\n    Individualized career services are identified in proposed Sec.  \n\n678.430(b) and listed in sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) of WIOA. These services \n\ninvolve more dedicated staff time to provide. These services are \n\nsimilar to intensive services and they may be provided as appropriate. \n\nThe primary services the ES provides are labor exchange services, which \n\nare identified by the Department as basic career services. The \n\nDepartment proposes that the ES staff may also provide individualized \n\ncareer services, paid for from funds authorized under sec. 7(a) of the \n\nAct, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Wagner-Peyser \n\nAct. Additionally, the Department wishes to clarify that the funds can \n\nbe used to provide any of the individualized services defined in \n\nproposed Sec.  678.430(b) and sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) of WIOA; there is \n\nno limit that the funds can only be used for particular individualized \n\nservices. However, these Wagner-Peyser funds may not be used to provide \n\ntraining services.\n\n    The Department is seeking comments on how services provided by the \n\n\n\nES can be more aligned with other services in the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem and ensure participants can receive seamless services from the \n\nES to other programs under WIOA.\n\nSection 652.207 How does a State meet the requirement for universal \n\naccess to services provided under the Act?\n\n    This section provides States discretion in meeting universal access \n\nto service requirements, and explains the requirements, including how \n\nthose services must be delivered. The section specifies that labor \n\nexchange services may be provided through self-service, facilitated \n\nself-help service, and staff-assisted services. The Department is \n\nproposing to include ``virtual services'' as a type of self-service. \n\nThe Department recognizes the valuable virtual and online services that \n\nStates provide through the ES, and seeks to include these services as \n\nself-services.\n\n    The Department also proposes changes in this section to tie it to \n\nthe mandatory services described in Sec.  652.206. The revised \n\nprovision would replace the reference to core and intensive services \n\nwith reference to career services made mandatory by an amended Sec.  \n\n652.206.\n\nSection 652.208 How are applicable career services related to the \n\nmethods of service delivery described in this part?\n\n    This section explains how career services may be delivered to meet \n\nthe requirements for access described in proposed Sec.  652.207(b)(2). \n\nThe Department proposes to include ``virtual services'' as a type of \n\nself-service provided by the ES, recognizing these important services \n\nprovided by States. The Department is also proposing to replace the \n\nreference to ``core services and intensive services'' with a reference \n\nto ``career services'' per WIOA.\n\nSection 652.209 What are the requirements under the Act for providing \n\nreemployment services and other activities to referred unemployment \n\ninsurance claimants?\n\n    The Wagner-Peyser Act authorizes funding for States to deliver a \n\nwide array of labor exchange services to jobseekers. This regulation \n\nclarifies the required and allowable Wagner-Peyser services to UI \n\nclaimants, as a subset of the broader ES beneficiary population.\n\n    WIOA added language to sec. 7(a) of the Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nreemphasizing the use of funds to support reemployment and related \n\nservices to UI claimants. These changes strengthen the connectivity \n\nbetween the ES and the UI systems, and broaden opportunities for these \n\nsystems to help UI claimants return to employment as quickly as \n\npossible. Coordination of labor exchange services and UI claimant \n\nservices is essential to ensure an integrated approach to reemployment \n\nstrategies. Wagner-Peyser funds may also be used to administer the work \n\n\n\ntest for the State unemployment system for UI eligibility assessments. \n\nAdditionally, the ES may provide UI claimants with referrals to, and \n\napplication assistance for, education and training resources and \n\nprograms as appropriate. Such resources include those provided through \n\nthe Higher Education Act and State-specific educational assistance \n\nprograms, veterans' educational assistance programs, WIOA education and \n\ntraining programs, and VR services.\n\n    The Department proposes two types of changes in Sec.  652.209: one \n\nto clearly require services to UI claimants, and the other to implement \n\nnew statutory provisions. The proposed text deletes the existing Sec.  \n\n652.209(a) language that services must be provided ``to the extent \n\nfunding is available,'' because it is implied and the Department \n\nencourages reemployment assistance to UI claimants.\n\n    The proposed text includes in Sec.  652.209(b)(2) a reference to \n\n``conducting eligibility assessments'' to conform with sec. 7(a)(3)(F) \n\nof the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA, and includes a \n\nrequirement that where applicable, UI claimants must be registered for \n\nESs in accordance with the UC law of the State with which they file \n\ntheir claim. The States may use Wagner-Peyser funds to pay for \n\neligibility assessments, which is a required activity that must be made \n\navailable when appropriate.\n\n    Additionally, in Sec.  652.209(b)(3) the Department proposes to \n\nrequire that States provide referrals and application assistance to UI \n\nclaimants, consistent with the new statutory language in sec. \n\n7(a)(3)(G) of the Wagner-Peyser Act and includes a reference to the \n\nPost-9/11 GI Bill which staff may also refer participants to as well as \n\nother veterans educational assistance.\n\nSection 652.210 What are the Act's requirements for administration of \n\nthe work test, including eligibility assessments, as appropriate, and \n\nassistance to unemployment insurance claimants?\n\n    This section clarifies the requirement for administration of the \n\nwork test to UI claimants. The proposed changes provide more \n\nspecificity about required services.\n\n    The Department proposes to include a reference to ``conducting \n\neligibility assessments'' to conform with sec. 7(a)(3)(F) of the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act. The States may use Wagner-Peyser funds to pay for \n\neligibility assessments, which are a required reemployment activity \n\nthat must be made available when appropriate. Proposed new language was \n\nalso added to Sec.  652.210(b)(3) to ensure that ES staff provide \n\ninformation about UI claimants' ability or availability for work, or \n\nthe suitability of work offered to them, to UI staff. Sharing such \n\n\n\ninformation with UI staff will help accelerate claimants' return to \n\nemployment.\n\nSection 652.211 What are State planning requirements under the Act?\n\n    The Department is proposing to remove the planning provisions of \n\nthis part of the regulation, including the text in Sec. Sec.  652.211 \n\nthrough 652.214, because the ES is a core program under WIOA and falls \n\nunder both the unified and combined planning requirements. This section \n\nhas been amended to simply provide a citation to the State planning \n\nrequirements under WIOA.\n\n[[Page 20805]]\n\nSection 652.215 Do any provisions in the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act change the requirement that State merit staff employees \n\nmust deliver services provided under the Act?\n\n    This section stipulates that only State merit staff may provide \n\nWagner-Peyser services. The only change proposed in this section is to \n\nchange ``WIA'' to ``WIOA'' in the section question; the remainder of \n\nthe text has not changed from the existing regulation. The Department \n\nhas followed this policy since the earliest years of the ES, in order \n\nto ensure minimum standards for the quality of the services provided. A \n\n1998 U.S. District Court decision, Michigan v. Herman, 81 F. Supp. 2nd \n\n840 (http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/) upheld this policy. State merit staff \nemployees are directly \n\naccountable to State government entities, and the standards for their \n\nperformance and their determinations on the use of public funds require \n\nthat decisions be made in the best interest of the public and of the \n\npopulation to be served. State merit staff meet objective professional \n\nqualifications and provide impartial, transparent information and \n\nservices to all customers while complying with established government \n\nstandards.\n\nSection 652.216 May the one-stop operator provide guidance to State \n\nmerit staff employees in accordance with the Act?\n\n    This section clarifies that ES staff may receive guidance from a \n\none-stop operator about the provision of labor exchange services, but \n\nthat all personnel matters remain under the authority of the State \n\nagency. The only change proposed in this section is to add a reference \n\nto proposed Sec.  678.500, which provides the requirements for the \n\nlocal MOU. The Department seeks comment on whether any other changes \n\nare needed to allow the one-stop operator to ensure the efficient and \n\neffective operation of the one-stop center.\n\n5. Subpart D--Workforce and Labor Market Information\n\n    Secretary of Labor's role concerning the Workforce and Labor Market \n\nInformation System (WLMIS). The Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by and \n\nhttp://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/\n\n\nintegrated with WIOA, envisions a robust WLMIS that is a critical \n\nunderpinning for a wide array of workforce functions, including: (1) \n\nSupporting State and regional planning of workforce strategies that \n\nprovide a pipeline of workers with in-demand skills and drive economic \n\ngrowth and development; (2) delivery of quality labor market and career \n\ninformation that enables workforce professionals to provide quality \n\ncareer counseling; and (3) enabling the workforce system's customers to \n\nmake informed career and service delivery choices. New provisions in \n\nWagner-Peyser provide for a collaborative process, led by the Secretary \n\nof Labor in partnership with Federal agencies, the newly created \n\nWorkforce Information Advisory Council (WIAC), and States, to develop \n\nand implement a strategic plan that continuously improves the labor \n\nmarket and workforce information available through the workforce \n\nsystem. The Act describes certain key components of the WLMIS and \n\ncommits the Secretary of Labor to oversee and ensure the competent \n\nmanagement of the system.\n\n    Wage records are a critical data source for WLMIS. When combined \n\nwith data from other sources, wage records produce a wide array of \n\nlabor market information used to inform economic development, support \n\ncareer counseling, identify training needs, inform industry sector \n\nworkforce strategies, and assist with other facets of a job-driven \n\nworkforce system.\n\n    For example, through agreements with States, wage records are used \n\nto produce the following aggregate reports and data that support the \n\nobjectives listed above:\n\n     The United States Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-\n\nHousehold Dynamics Program including the:\n\n    [cir] Quarterly Workforce Explorer, that provides worker residence \n\nand work place location data and critical employment and business \n\nrelated data including hiring, worker separations, and turnover rates, \n\nat State, county, metro and Workforce Development Board areas;\n\n    [cir] OnTheMap, that provides geographic information system (GIS) \n\ncapabilities to map worker origin and destination information on detail \n\nmap overlays in customized geographic areas at a Census block level; \n\nand\n\n    [cir] OnTheMap for Emergency Management tools, that provides GIS \n\ncapabilities to map natural disasters including fire, flood, and storm \n\nand the impact on workers and businesses in customized geographic areas \n\nat the Census block level area.\n\n     The DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of \n\nEmployment and Wages, which provides a complete count of employment and \n\n\n\nwages, classified by industry and based on quarterly reports filed by \n\nemployers for over 9 million establishments subject to unemployment \n\ninsurance laws.\n\n    Continuous improvement, in part through consultation. The Act \n\nrequires the Secretary of Labor to oversee, and the States to pursue \n\nactively, the ``continuous improvement'' of the WLMIS.\\3\\ The Act, \n\nthroughout, describes components of the system and ways in which the \n\nSecretary and the States must act to discharge their duties under the \n\nAct, including their duties related to ``continuous improvement.'' \n\nProposed Sec.  652.300(a) is a general statement implementing this \n\nrequirement. It provides, as does the Act, that the Secretary must \n\noversee the development, maintenance, and continuous improvement of the \n\nWLMIS. The reference to Wagner-Peyser sec. 15 simply signals the \n\nsection where the WLMIS is defined; the provision does not mean to \n\nstate that sec. 15 is the only section where the duty of continuous \n\nimprovement is created.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Based on internal Department of Labor data. This figure \n\nincludes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, \n\nGuam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin \n\nIslands.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Sec.  652.300(b) implements the Secretary's more specific \n\nduties with regard to the WLMIS, as they are described in Wagner-Peyser \n\nsec. 15(b)(2). The proposed regulation closely tracks the statute with \n\nrespect to duties related to collection, analysis, and dissemination of \n\nworkforce and labor market information. These include, for example, the \n\nduty to eliminate gaps and duplication in statistical undertakings. The \n\nAct also identifies certain activities that should be considered to \n\nimprove data sources. For example, sec. 15(b)(2) requires the \n\nSecretary, to ensure that data collected is consistent with appropriate \n\nBureau of Labor Statistics standards and definitions and understandable \n\nto users of such data; and to develop consistent procedures and \n\ndefinitions for use by States in the collection of data. Earlier, in \n\nsec. 15(a)(1)(E), the Act requires that the WLMIS include ``procedures \n\nto support standardization and aggregation of data from administrative \n\nreporting systems.''\n\n    Recognizing the breadth of these and other requirements it imposes \n\non the Secretary, the statute--at sec. 15(b)(2)--establishes an \n\nexpectation that the Secretary will discuss and fulfill the \n\nrequirements in active collaboration with the WIAC, Federal agencies, \n\n\n\nand States. Proposed Sec.  652.302(b) incorporates this consultation \n\nrequirement, while reserving our authority to consult with other \n\nstakeholders. To the extent that the data\n\n[[Page 20806]]\n\nand tools used in the context of the WLMIS are owned by other Federal \n\nagencies, such as LEHD data which is owned by the Census Bureau subject \n\nto the authority of title 13 of the U.S. Code, the Secretary of Labor \n\nwill work collaboratively with the owners of such data or data tools to \n\ncoordinate the use of those tools with the WLMIS and to identify \n\npotential enhancements, but the Secretary of Labor has no direct \n\nauthority with regard to those tools.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  652.300 works in conjunction with certain amendments \n\nto 20 CFR part 651. In order to clarify the Secretary's jurisdiction \n\nwith respect to the Employment Service and related workforce systems--\n\nin particular, with respect to responsibilities related to ``continuous \n\nimprovement,'' performance assessment, and collection and management of \n\ninformation--the Department proposes new regulatory definitions for \n\n``Workforce and Labor Market Information'' (WLMI) and ``Workforce and \n\nLabor Market Information System'' (WLMIS). Those proposed definitions \n\nappear in part 651.\n\n    Definition of ``wage record.'' The proposed definition of WLMI that \n\nappears in part 651 lists numerous components, including ``wage \n\nrecords.'' The Wagner-Peyser Act does not define ``wage records.'' To \n\nclarify the Secretary's responsibilities with respect to that component \n\nof WLMI, however, the Department proposes to define ``wage records'' in \n\na new section under part 652, Sec.  652.301.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  652.301 defines ``wage records'' for purposes of the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act, including amendments to Wagner-Peyser relating to \n\nthe WLMIS. The Department proposes to define ``wage record,'' for these \n\npurposes, as records that contain ``wage information'' as defined in \n\nthe Department regulations at 20 CFR part 603. Part 603, among other \n\nthings, implements the requirements of the Social Security Act \n\ngoverning the now-established Income and Eligibility Verification \n\nSystem (IEVS). Federal law requires each State participating in the \n\nFederal-State unemployment compensation (UC) program to have in place \n\nan IEVS through which it exchanges information with certain Federal \n\nagencies to help determine applicants' eligibility and amount of \n\nbenefits for UC and several Federal financial assistance programs. \n\n(Social Security Act (SSA) secs. 303(f), 1137; 20 CFR 603.20-603.23.)\n\n    As part of its IEVS, every State must collect certain information--\n\nincluding ``wage information'' as defined in 20 CFR 603.2(k) and \n\n\n\nreferred to here as ``wage records''--from applicants for these \n\nprograms, employers in the State, or relevant State or Federal \n\nagencies. (SSA sec. 1137.) In the context of establishing \n\nconfidentiality requirements for State UC data, the Federal regulation \n\nat 20 CFR 603.2(k) defines ``wage information'' to mean information in \n\nthe records of a State UC agency, and information reported under \n\nprovisions of State law that meets the requirements of an IEVS, that \n\nmay fall into any one of three categories: (1) ``wages paid to an \n\nindividual''; (2) the individual's SSN(s); and (3) the name, address, \n\nState, and FEIN of the employer that paid the wages. (20 CFR 603(k)) \n\nNormally, a State collects this information through the quarterly \n\n``wage reports'' employers file with the State (referred to in 20 CFR \n\n603.2(j) and SSA sec. 1137(a)(3)). States may, based on their need, \n\nrequire employers to report additional data--beyond these three \n\ncategories--in their wage reports, whether for unemployment insurance \n\npurposes or for other purposes. It is the combination of these data \n\ncollections that are referred to, broadly, as ``wage records.''\n\n    The new, proposed definition of ``wage records'' in Sec.  652.301 \n\nhelps meet the legislative intent for consistency by standardizing, the \n\ndefinition of ``wage records'' across regulations governing WIOA \n\nactivities, Wagner-Peyser activities, and disclosure of confidential UC \n\ninformation. Part 603--which uses the term ``wage information'' is the \n\nbasis for the definition of ``wage records'' in proposed Sec.  \n\n652.301--in part serves to allow States to disclose specific \n\nconfidential wage information to help meet Federal reporting \n\nrequirements for certain programs and activities funded under WIOA and \n\nWagner-Peyser. As proposed, the definition in Sec.  652.301 is also \n\nconsistent with the definition of ``quarterly wage record information'' \n\nunder 20 CFR 677.175,\\4\\ which requires States to use essentially the \n\nsame data elements in ``wage records'' to formally assess their \n\nperformance for purposes of performance reporting. (For additional \n\nexplanation of the relationship between these three sections, and the \n\ndistinction between the provisions authorizing State use of certain \n\nwage data and those authorizing States to disclose essentially the data \n\nfor purposes of Federally-required performance reporting, see the \n\nDepartment's proposal to amend its regulations at 20 CFR part 603, \n\naccompanying this proposal to amend the Wagner-Peyser regulations.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Ibid.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n    Secretary of Labor's role concerning wage records under WIOA. \n\nProposed Sec.  652.302 explains how the Secretary's responsibilities \n\nconcerning the WLMIS apply to the wage record component of WLMI. That \n\nis, the proposed regulation reflects how the Department would apply the \n\nbroader Wagner-Peyser expectations for improvement of labor market data \n\nsources, including those related to consistency and standardization, to \n\none specific source--wage records.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  652.302(b) would clarify that pursuant to his/her \n\nresponsibility to oversee the development, maintenance, and continuous \n\nimprovement of the WLMIS, including the numerous duties set forth in \n\nthe Act and restated throughout this preamble, the Secretary will seek \n\nto develop standardized definitions of the data elements in wage \n\nrecords, and improved processes and systems for the collection of and \n\nreporting of wage records. As proposed, this provision would authorize \n\nthe Secretary to develop common data definitions and standardized \n\nreporting formats that are consistent across States.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  652.302(a) would work in conjunction with the \n\nproposed definitions of WLMI and WLMIS in part 651 to clarify that wage \n\nrecords are, in fact, included in and source data for WLMI.\n\n    Consistency of wage records. On the matter of wage records, a \n\nnumber of areas have, in recent years, required policy discussions \n\nbetween the Department and States and other stakeholders. Of these \n\ndiscussions, the one on consistency has gained momentum.\n\n    State wage records today, while they are a critical component of \n\nthe WLMIS, suffer from inconsistencies that impede better management of \n\nWLMI, and of the ES more broadly. Wage records have always been a \n\ncritical data source for administration of the UI program as well as \n\nother Federal programs, providing information that supports eligibility \n\ndeterminations and identification and reduction of improper payments. \n\nWage records have increased importance today because States are \n\nrequired to use them to evaluate State performance of the workforce \n\nsystem and education and training providers. Additionally, wage records \n\nplay a key role in Federal evaluations of the workforce system's \n\nprograms. The expanded use of wage records for such a wide range of \n\npurposes requires consistency and quality of the data in order to \n\nmaximize its use.\n\n    Regrettably, such consistency is lacking. The wage data employers \n\nmust report on their quarterly wage reports to their State and the \n\nformats they must use to report it vary, State-by-State. While \n\nemployers filing wage reports described in Federal regulations at 20\n\n\n\n[[Page 20807]]\n\nCFR 603.2(j) must, at a minimum, report the three data elements \n\ndescribed in 20 CFR 603.2(k), State law may require them to report \n\nadditional elements. And because States differ in how they define \n\ncertain data elements--including the three elements listed in Sec.  \n\n603.2(k)--different States may prescribe different reporting formats \n\nfor the same data elements. This means that the same type of data \n\n(employee SSN, employee name, employee address) may look different, \n\nfrom State to State, when placed on the form. For example, some States \n\nonly require the first several numbers of workers' SSN. Such \n\ndifferences in State reporting requirements, and the variation they \n\ngenerate in the type of data and the format of data collected, set up a \n\nsignificant barrier to data quality and data consistency. They make it \n\nhard for data users to effectively match wage records across the \n\nStates. This interferes with the effective and efficient measure of \n\nperformance, program evaluation, income verification under sec. 1137 \n\nSSA, and detection of improper benefits payments in multiple Federal \n\nprograms.\n\n    Consultations with stakeholders over the years, as well as our own, \n\nlongstanding program experience, lead the Department to believe that \n\nadoption of standardized definitions of data elements, and processes \n\nand systems for collecting and reporting wage records across all \n\nStates, could greatly enhance the usability of the wage records and the \n\nability to easily merge the data they contain with other data sets. \n\nStandardized definitions, collection processes, and systems also could \n\nreduce employer burden, given that multi-State employers and their \n\nthird-party administrators now have to report wages to States in many \n\ndifferent formats. With such enhancements, State wage records would \n\ncontain data that have the potential to create more comprehensive and \n\npowerful workforce and labor market information. Such an approach would \n\nalso help implement the statute's requirement for consistency.\n\n    Other Federal statutes support making significant improvements in \n\nwage records as a data source. A number of Federal statutes now place \n\nemphasis on wage records and data standardization. WIOA and the Middle \n\nClass Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2014, for example, require the \n\nDepartment to make the labor market data it oversees or generates, even \n\nmore consistent and meaningful. WIOA emphasizes the use of wage records \n\nfor performance and evaluations of the workforce system. The Job \n\nCreation Act focus on data standardization.\n\n    Section 2104 of the Job Creation Act requires the Secretary to \n\n\n\npromote data exchange standardization through regulation in the \n\ndelivery of the UI program, including as it relates to supporting the \n\nreemployment of unemployed workers. Data exchange standards include use \n\nof interoperable standards; use of widely accepted, non-proprietary, \n\nsearchable, and computer readable formats; and use of existing non-\n\nproprietary standards, such as the eXtensible Markup Language. A key \n\ncomponent of data exchange standardization is ensuring that the data \n\nthe States are sharing is consistent. As addressed above, it is \n\nimpossible to accurately exchange and match data that has different \n\nelements and different requirements for the common elements. The \n\nSecretary cannot achieve data exchange standardization in the UI \n\nprogram if the data elements cannot be accurately exchanged and \n\nmatched. Therefore, the Department interprets the requirement in the \n\nJob Creation Act to standardize data exchange to include the \n\nrequirement that the Secretary consult with the WIAC and develop a set \n\nof common data definitions.\n\n    The Wagner-Peyser Act, especially when read in the context of these \n\ntwo other statutes and the amendments made to it by WIOA, exhibits the \n\nsame focus and expectation. Proposed Sec. Sec.  652.300 through 652.303 \n\nenable all of this work to proceed through a collaborative approach \n\nthat brings in other Federal agencies, States, and the public through \n\nthe newly constituted WIAC.\n\n    Consultations with the WIC and WIAC to improve wage records and the \n\nWLMIS. Of course, consistency is not the only concern or area of \n\nconsultation with stakeholders. There is a long history of interest and \n\ndiscussions among Federal and State agencies and data users about the \n\ndesirability of making a variety of improvements to wage records that \n\nwould increase their value and usability. Among these was an effort in \n\nthe 1990s referred to as the Simplified Tax and Wage Reporting System \n\n(STAWRS).\n\n    More recently, a subgroup of the Workforce Information Council \\5\\ \n\nestablished under WIA has been researching and developing reports on \n\nhow to enhance the content of wage records to support improvements in \n\nlabor market and workforce information. The working group is currently \n\nconsidering possible enhancements, such as adding data elements to the \n\ninformation States collect from employers through the wage reports \n\nunder 20 CFR 603.2(j), and the potential impact of those enhancements, \n\non State workforce agencies and businesses. This work will result in \n\nrecommendations to the WIC in the coming year and will provide strong \n\nfoundational information to support the Secretary's work with the WIAC \n\n\n\nwhen it is established. (See discussion on WIAC elsewhere in this \n\nproposed rule.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ Ibid.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As discussed elsewhere, sec. 15(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nrequires the WIAC to evaluate the WLMIS System and make recommendations \n\nto the Secretary on how to improve the WLMIS. Section 15(b) requires \n\nthe Secretary to receive and evaluate the WIAC's recommendations and \n\nrespond to these recommendations in writing. At the appropriate time, \n\nthe WIAC will make recommendations for improving the WLMIS. These \n\nrecommendations could range from technical improvements to the system, \n\nsuch as improving the technology States use to gather and report data, \n\nto more substantive changes to the system, such as standardizing data \n\nelements to facilitate comparisons and provide job seekers easy to \n\nunderstand information about the labor market.\n\n    To the extent that the Secretary's consultations with the WIAC and, \n\npotentially, other stakeholder groups result in proposals to change, \n\nenhance, or expand wage record data elements, the Secretary will \n\ncarefully consider the potential benefits and costs of these proposals \n\non the workforce system, and work with the Congress, other Federal \n\nagencies, States, the WIAC, and other stakeholders to explore possible \n\nways to implement the recommendations. If appropriate, the Department \n\nwill engage in further rulemaking or seek legislative authority.\n\n    Data elements associated with wage records. Potentially \n\nestablishing new data elements to wage records that employers in all \n\nStates must report could have benefits similar to standardization. For \n\nexample, knowing individuals' occupations, along with the wages they \n\nearned, would be extremely valuable. Such additional information would \n\ngreatly assist in performance reporting and program evaluation under \n\nWIOA, in the identification of skill shortages by detailed geographic \n\narea to inform labor market training programs, and in the analysis of \n\nthe long-term impact of education and training programs on labor market \n\noutcomes. It is likely that the WIAC will explore the value and \n\nviability of adding this and, potentially, other data elements. As \n\ndiscussed above, the current WIC is researching this issue and \n\ndeveloping reports that will provide additional\n\n[[Page 20808]]\n\n\n\ninformation that is likely to be passed on to the WIAC for \n\nconsideration.\n\n    On January 31, 2014, the WIC released its ``Phase One Interim \n\nReport on Current Practices of Unemployment Insurance Wage Record \n\nCollection and Use.'' This report analyzed the results of a State \n\nsurvey on the benefits of and barriers to enhancing labor market \n\ninformation by adding data elements to the quarterly wage reports \n\nemployers submit to States as defined in 20 CFR 603.2(j). Among other \n\nthings, the WIC's survey asked States what additional data elements, \n\naside from Federally-required wage information, States require \n\nemployers to report. The Phase One Interim Report can be found at: \n\nhttp://www.workforceinfocouncil.org/Documents/Wage%20Report%20Final.pdf. While not all States responded, \nAlaska, \n\nIowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, \n\nVermont, the Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming reported already \n\ncollecting additional data elements in the quarterly wage reports. The \n\nadditional elements included the Code, total hours worked in a quarter, \n\ntotal number of weeks worked in a quarter, pay type (salary or hourly), \n\nhourly pay rate, gender, job title, worksite address, zip code, and \n\ntips. Some of the responding States reported that the additional data \n\nelements are extremely helpful for estimating hourly earnings, \n\nunderstanding career progression from occupation to occupation, \n\nassessing the effectiveness of workforce training, and making \n\noccupational projections. One State pointed out that knowing the \n\nemployee worksite information helped with UC claim filing.\n\n    Asking employers to report and States to collect additional data or \n\ndata categories through quarterly wage reports, would expand the data \n\ncollections for many States. The Department is committed to strong \n\nstakeholder consultation as strategies are developed to improve and \n\nenhance wage records and to striking the appropriate balance between \n\nthe burden of any new data collection and the value of any additional \n\ndata elements. In the event the WIAC and/or other stakeholder \n\nconsultations generate recommendations for such enhancements, the \n\nDepartment will consider additional rulemaking or seek legislative \n\nauthority, if appropriate.\n\n    Request for comment. The Department is interested in receiving \n\ncomments from States that responded to the survey, and any other States \n\nthat require additional data elements in quarterly wage reports, on the \n\nchallenges and benefits of requiring additional data elements in the \n\nquarterly wage reports. The Department is also interested in receiving \n\nhttp://www.workforceinfocouncil.org/Documents/Wage%20Report%20Final.pdf\n\n\ncomments from employers and payroll processors who provide occupational \n\ndata for the quarterly wage records.\n\n    Applying 20 CFR part 603 to wage records. Finally, the regulation \n\nproposed for new Sec.  652.303 would clarify that wage records are \n\nsubject to and protected by the Department's regulations at 20 CFR part \n\n603, which govern confidentiality and disclosure for confidential UC \n\ninformation, including the ``wage information'' that make up ``wage \n\nrecords.'' Nothing in Sec. Sec.  652.300 through 652.302 changes the \n\nconfidentiality requirements of 20 CFR part 603. Information contained \n\nin ``wage records'' that is confidential under Sec. Sec.  603.2(b) and \n\n603.4 remains confidential in accordance with those sections of the \n\nconfidentiality and disclosure requirements of subparts A and B of part \n\n603. The Department proposes this provision to further ensure the \n\nconfidentiality of the information in the State UC system.\n\nO. Part 653--Services of the Employment Service System\n\n    In subparts B and F, the Department proposes to implement the WIOA \n\ntitle III amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act and to streamline and \n\nupdate certain sections to eliminate duplicative and obsolete \n\nprovisions. Despite these changes, part 653 will remain consistent with \n\nthe ``Richey Order'', which allows revisions as long as they are \n\nconsistent with the Richey Order. NAACP v. Brennan, 9174 WL 229, at *7.\n\nSection 653.100 Purpose and Scope of Subpart\n\n    Proposed Sec.  653.100 explains that the regulations under part 653 \n\nseek to ensure that all services of the workforce development system be \n\navailable to all job seekers in an equitable fashion. This section \n\nincludes language currently at Sec.  653.101 that explains the purpose \n\nand scope of part 653. This approach is consistent with the \n\nDepartment's current policy and requiring equal access and treatment to \n\nall services available through the workforce development system is also \n\nconsistent with the purpose and terms of the Richey Order.\n\nSection 653.101 Provision of Services to Migrant and Seasonal \n\nFarmworkers\n\n    The Department proposes to delete Sec.  653.101 because its \n\nprovisions have been moved to Sec.  653.100 or concern itinerant or \n\nsatellite offices that have been replaced by one-stop centers that \n\nprovide services to both MSFWs and non-MSFWs.\n\nSection 653.102 Job Information\n\n    The Department proposes to make several changes to Sec.  653.102:\n\n    (1) That State agencies make job order information conspicuous and \n\navailable to MSFWs ``. . . by all reasonable means'' rather than ``in \n\nall local offices'' to reflect the obligation of State agencies to \n\n\n\ncontact MSFWs who are not being reached by the normal intake activities \n\nincluding at their working, living or gathering areas to explain the \n\nservices available at the local one-stop center;\n\n    (2) That the language in Sec.  653.102 referring to ``computer \n\nterminal, microfiche, hard copy, or other equally effective means'' be \n\nreplaced with ``internet labor exchange systems and through the one-\n\nstop centers'' to conform to technological advances and current \n\ntechniques of States' internet-based labor exchange systems;\n\n    (3) That the reference to ``each significant MSFW local office'' be \n\nreplaced with ``employment service offices'' to require each ES office \n\nto provide adequate staff assistance to MSFWs to more fully conform \n\nwith the Richey Order, which requires the Department to ensure that \n\nMSFWs are serviced in a quantitatively proportionate and qualitatively \n\nequivalent way to non-MSFWs;\n\n    (4) That offices designated as significant MSFW multilingual ES \n\noffices must provide services to MSFWs in their native language, \n\nwhenever requested or necessary and to acknowledge that Spanish is not \n\nthe only native language spoken by MSFWs whose first language is not \n\nEnglish.\n\nSection 653.103 Process for Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers To \n\nParticipate in Workforce Development Activities\n\n    The Department proposes to revise the heading in Sec.  653.103 to \n\n``Process for migrant and seasonal farmworkers to participate in \n\nworkforce development activities'' to align it with language used in \n\ntitles I and III of WIOA, which refer to ``workforce development \n\nactivities.''\n\n    Proposed Sec.  653.103(b) includes new language requiring that \n\npersons with LEP receive, free of charge, the language assistance \n\nnecessary to afford them meaningful access to the programs, services, \n\nand information offered by one-stop centers. The Department also \n\nproposes to remove the reference to Sec.  653.105 because we propose to \n\neliminate that section.\n\n    In proposed Sec.  653.103(c), the Department proposes to add the \n\nwords ``or in their native language'' to further\n\n[[Page 20809]]\n\nacknowledge that Spanish is not the only native language spoken by \n\nMSFWs whose first language is not English, and to remove language \n\nregarding checking the accuracy and quality of applications because \n\nsuch actions are part of compliance reviews which are addressed in \n\nSec.  653.108.\n\n    The Department also proposes to remove paragraphs (d) through (h) \n\n\n\nfrom Sec.  653.103, that refer to application cards and an application \n\nprocess that are generally no longer used, having been replaced by \n\nonline resources. Instead, it is proposed in paragraph (d) that local \n\nES offices ``refer and/or register the MSFW in accordance with the \n\nestablished procedures defined in the relevant regulations(s) or \n\nguidance.''\n\n    The Department proposes to remove Sec.  653.104(a) because MSFWs \n\nreceive equitable ESs regardless of family status. The provision of \n\nservices for all Wagner-Peyser participants is not dependent upon \n\nwhether their family members are participating in the ES system. It is \n\nalso proposed that paragraphs (b) and (c) regarding applications from \n\nan individual for employment as a farm labor contractor, and \n\nagricultural job orders submitted by a farm labor contractor or farm \n\nlabor contractor employee, be relocated to Sec.  653.500 because that \n\naddresses the ARS.\n\n    It is proposed that Sec. Sec.  653.105 and 653.106 be deleted as \n\nthey are generally obsolete and because State agencies no longer make \n\nreferrals to or operate day-haul facilities. Additionally, it is not \n\nanticipated that State agencies will make referrals to or operate day-\n\nhaul facilities in the foreseeable future in part because WIOA title I, \n\nsec. 121(e)(3) requires the colocation of Wagner-Peyser services. \n\nShould those activities resume in the future, however, the Department \n\nwill ensure compliance with the requirements of the Richey Order \n\nconcerning any day-haul referrals and day-haul locations operating \n\nunder ES supervision. The Department also proposes to remove paragraph \n\n(c) of Sec.  653.106 as it is unnecessary because it references \n\nSec. Sec.  653.107(j) and 653.108(p) concerning outreach visits to, and \n\nmonitoring of day-haul facilities. Those outreach obligations remain, \n\nas revised, in proposed Sec.  653.107.\n\nSection 653.107 Outreach and Agricultural Outreach Plan\n\n    The Department proposes to restructure and reorganize Sec.  653.107 \n\nto facilitate a better understanding of State agency responsibilities, \n\noutreach worker responsibilities, and ES office responsibilities \n\nrelating to outreach and the Agricultural Outreach Plan (AOP). The \n\nDepartment anticipates that the reorganization will allow the relevant \n\nentities to identify their responsibilities under this section.\n\n    Currently, the AOP is submitted annually as a modification to the \n\nWIA under title I and the Wagner-Peyser Integrated or Unified Workforce \n\nPlan. As required by sec. 8 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, and as amended by \n\nsec. 306 of WIOA, States must now submit their Wagner-Peyser plan as \n\npart of the Unified or Combined State Plan described in WIOA secs. 102 \n\nand 103, respectively. In order to streamline the plan submission \n\n\n\nprocess for States, the Department proposes to require that States \n\ninclude their AOP with their Unified or Combined State Plan. As the \n\nState Plans are required every 4 years, the Department proposes to \n\nrequire that the AOP be submitted every 4 years. The Department notes, \n\nhowever, that the Richey Order requires much of the information \n\nsubmitted through the AOP to be submitted annually. Therefore, in order \n\nto balance the goal of streamlining the State planning process with the \n\nneed to comply with the Richey Order, the Department proposes that the \n\nAnnual Summary required at 20 CFR 653.108(s) include outreach data and \n\nan update on the State's progress toward accomplishing its goals set \n\nforth in the AOP. In proposed paragraph (d), the Department explains \n\nthe basic requirements of the AOP and the Annual Summaries and explain \n\nthat official guidance will be forthcoming. Additionally, terminology \n\nin proposed Sec.  653.107 is revised, when appropriate, to better align \n\nits terms with corresponding terms in WIOA which will be used in the \n\nUnified State Plan.\n\n    The Department also proposes the following changes to Sec.  \n\n653.107:\n\n    (1) The heading is proposed to be replaced with ``Outreach and \n\nAgricultural Outreach Plan (AOP)'' to make clear that information \n\nregarding the AOP can be found in this section;\n\n    (2) The term ``Outreach Program'' used in paragraph (a) is proposed \n\nto be replaced by ``Outreach'' to broaden the scope of the section to \n\naccurately reflect the various requirements regarding outreach and that \n\nthe section is not a formulaic program;\n\n    (3) References in paragraph (a) to the Outreach Plan have been \n\nrelocated, in revised form, to paragraph (d) that concerns the \n\n``Agricultural Outreach Plan (AOP)'' or ``Annual Summaries,'' or \n\nreserved for use in future official Department guidance (the Department \n\nwill include AOP guidance as part of its Unified State Plan guidance);\n\n    (4) A requirement has been added to paragraph (a) for each State \n\nagency to employ outreach workers to conduct outreach in their service \n\nareas (full or part time staff may be hired depending on whether the \n\nState has a significant MSFW population). This addition is proposed to \n\nhelp each State meet its requirement under the current 20 CFR \n\n653.107(a) to locate and contact MSFWs who are not being reached by the \n\nnormal intake activities conducted by the local ES offices. The Richey \n\nOrder influenced the language for this proposed addition, as it states \n\nthat ``each State agency shall employ an adequate number of staff who \n\nshall be assigned to ES offices. . . . ;''\n\n    (5) Paragraph (a)(4) has been revised to clarify that the \n\n\n\nDepartment, through guidance, will identify the 20 States with the \n\nhighest estimated year-round MSFW activity;\n\n    (6) Delete paragraph (b)(2) because all outreach efforts must be \n\nvigorous. This change does not signal a reduction in the required \n\nintensity of outreach activities;\n\n    (7) The language in paragraph (h)(3)(i) be relocated to Sec.  \n\n653.107(a)(4) and be revised to require the ``top 20 States,'' that is \n\nthe 20 States with the highest estimated year-round MSFW activity, to \n\nhire year-round full-time outreach staff to help ensure that more \n\nfarmworkers will be reached on a year-round basis in high activity \n\nareas than are reached at present. The remaining States must hire part-\n\ntime outreach staff year-round and must hire full-time outreach staff \n\nduring periods of peak MSFW activity. These provisions are proposed to \n\nbalance the urgent need for outreach with the reality of limited staff \n\nresources available to the States. Additionally, it is proposed that \n\nthe option for the Regional Administrator to grant a deviation from the \n\nrequirements in this paragraph be deleted to ensure that States have a \n\nmeans to contact MSFWs who are not being reached by the normal intake \n\nactivities conducted by the local ES offices and to encourage them to \n\nstrive for ``the development of strategies for providing effective \n\noutreach to and improve access for individuals and employers who could \n\nbenefit from services provided through the workforce development \n\nsystem,'' as stated at WIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(c);\n\n    (8) The reference to local offices in Sec.  653.107(b)(4)(vi) has \n\nbeen updated to ``one-stop center.'' In this section ``one-stop \n\ncenters'' refers to both comprehensive and affiliate one-stop centers;\n\n    (9) The language in current Sec.  653.107(j)(1)(v) be relocated to \n\nproposed Sec.  653.107(b)(2) and revised by inserting the words \n\n``employer's property or work area'' and changing the words \n\n``permission of the employer'' to\n\n[[Page 20810]]\n\n``permission of the employer, owner or farm labor contractor'' because \n\nthe employer may not always be the appropriate person to grant such \n\npermission;\n\n    (10) The reference to unemployed and employed MSFWs in current \n\nparagraph (j)(2)(ii) be deleted because all MSFWs contacted through \n\noutreach activities must receive information on current and future \n\nemployment opportunities;\n\n    (11) A sentence was added to paragraph (b)(6) requiring outreach \n\n\n\nworkers to document and refer apparent violations that are non-\n\nemployment related; and\n\n    (12) Language was added to paragraph (b)(7) regarding training \n\noutreach workers on protecting farmworkers against sexual harassment in \n\nthe fields. While such abuse is not often considered when contemplating \n\nthe protection of, and advocacy for, MSFWs, it is increasingly \n\nprevalent and the addition is intended to further a concerted effort to \n\ndeter such abuse. To that end, the Department wishes to ensure that \n\noutreach workers are aware of the issue and able to appropriately refer \n\nMSFWs.\n\nSection 653.108 State Workforce Agency and State Monitor Advocate \n\nResponsibilities\n\n    The Department proposes the following changes to Sec.  653.108:\n\n    (1) The heading is proposed to be revised to State Workforce Agency \n\nand State monitor advocate (SMA) responsibilities to better describe \n\nthe contents of this section;\n\n    (2) The requirement in paragraph (c) for SMAs to work in the State \n\ncentral office was removed because there are instances where it may be \n\nmore productive and logical for them to work in an office that is more \n\ncentrally located to the State's MSFW population;\n\n    (3) The language in paragraph (d) allowing an Office of Workforce \n\nInvestment (OWI) Administrator to reallocate SMA positions and approve \n\nthe use of less than full-time work be deleted because the OWI \n\nadministrator does not have authority over these determinations. It is \n\nalso proposed that the last sentence in this paragraph be modified to \n\nclarify that a State agency that deems SMA functions appropriate on a \n\npart-time basis must demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that \n\npart-time staffing will be sufficient for carrying out his/her duties;\n\n    (4) Language has been added to paragraph (g)(1) authorizing SMAs to \n\nrequest a corrective action plan from the ES office to address any \n\ndeficiencies found in their review and allowing the SMAs to advise the \n\nState agency on means to improve the delivery of services to MSFWs;\n\n    (5) That the words ``local office MSFW formal monitoring'' be \n\ndeleted from paragraph (g)(2) because the Department has proposed to \n\ninclude a definition for onsite reviews in 20 CFR 651.10;\n\n    (6) In paragraph (g)(3) the words ``significant MSFW local office'' \n\nare proposed to be replaced with ``significant MSFW one-stop center'' \n\nto conform with the proposed definition in 20 CFR 651.10;\n\n    (7) In paragraph (g)(4) it is proposed that the sentence referring \n\nto applications be deleted because such information can be more \n\n\n\neffectively provided and updated, as necessary, via Department-\n\npublished guidance materials. It is also proposed this paragraph \n\ninclude language requiring the SMA to clear the State's AOP to ensure \n\nthat the SMA reviews, provides necessary input, and supports the final \n\nversion of the State's AOP;\n\n    (8) That paragraph (g)(6) be created to require SMAs to write and \n\nsubmit Annual Summaries to the State Administrator with a copy to the \n\nRegional Administrator because it is a duty originally located in Sec.  \n\n653.108(t) but appropriately falls under Sec.  653.108(g) as one of the \n\nSMA duties;\n\n    (9) In paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) the references to ``reviews'' \n\nbe replaced with ``onsite review(s)'' for clarity, and that the \n\nreference to ``ETA'' in paragraph (h)(3) be replaced with ``the \n\nDepartment;''\n\n    (10) It is proposed that in paragraph (j) the SMAs must ensure that \n\nlocal ES office managers submit copies of the MSFW complaint logs to \n\nthe State agency quarterly pursuant to 20 CFR 658 subpart E instead of \n\nthe regional office, as was originally required. This change is \n\nproposed because the regional office does not need to review each \n\ncomplaint log, rather it reviews the information in aggregate, as is \n\nthe current practice. This helps to avoid overburdening the regional \n\noffices with more detail than is necessary. Additional details \n\nconcerning the submission of complaint logs will be provided and \n\nupdated, as necessary, via Department official guidance;\n\n    (11) Current paragraph (k) has been broken into separate paragraphs \n\n(proposed paragraphs (j), (k), and (l)), to clarify the intent of the \n\nrespective duties under this subpart. Paragraph (j) will require SMAs \n\nto serve as advocates to improve services to MSFWs; paragraph (k) will \n\nstrengthen the requirement for SMAs to liaise with WIOA sec. 167 \n\ngrantees to encourage increased collaboration between SMAs and grantees \n\nthat provide services to MSFWs; paragraph (l) proposes that SMAs meet \n\nat least quarterly and establish an MOU with WIOA sec. 167 grantees and \n\nother organizations serving farmworkers, the Department intends to \n\nfoster a better working relationship between the SMAs, the grantees, \n\nand the other organizations while harmonizing the delivery of services \n\nto MSFWs and minimizing the duplication of services;\n\n    (12) Language to include committees other than DOL Regional Farm \n\nLabor Coordinated Enforcement Committee has been added to paragraph (l) \n\nto broaden the scope of appropriate regional meetings the SMA must \n\nattend.\n\n\n\n    (13) Paragraph (o) has been deleted because affirmative action \n\nstaffing plans are no longer required. In their place, each State \n\nagency must provide an assurance that it is complying with its \n\naffirmative action requirements set forth in 20 CFR 653.111 through the \n\nAOP. Additionally, the requirement under proposed paragraph (g)(1) for \n\nSMAs to conduct an ongoing review of and advise the State agency on its \n\naffirmative action goals will meet the need for SMAs to ensure that \n\ntheir respective States are complying with the affirmative action \n\nstaffing requirements outlined in the Richey Order;\n\n    (14) Paragraph (p) concerning day-haul sites has been deleted for \n\nthe same reasons provided for deleting Sec. Sec.  653.105 and 653.106; \n\nand\n\n    (15) A new paragraph (s) has been added to outline the purpose and \n\nscope of required Annual Summaries, and a list of what the summaries \n\nmust include. The requirements for the Annual Summary have been \n\nexpanded to include information that would be relevant for the \n\nDepartment's review of how the States are providing services to MSFW. \n\nMany of the added requirements are taken from other sections under this \n\nchapter. Specifically, the Annual Summary would include assurances or \n\nsummaries of SMA duties taken from current Sec.  653.108(c), (g)(1), \n\n(h)(2), (j), (k), (q), and (r). This section also requires that the \n\nAnnual Summaries include a summary of the activities conducted over the \n\ncourse of the previous year that relate to meeting the goals of the \n\nAOP. At the end of the AOP, this section would require that the SMA \n\nprovide a synopsis of the State agency's achievements in meetings its \n\ngoals set forth in the AOP. This will help keep each State agency on \n\ntrack toward achieving its AOP goals and help the Department track such \n\nprogress.\n\n    In addition, related to proposed Sec.  653.108(g)(4), the \n\nDepartment notes that the process by which the SMA will receive, \n\nreview, and approve the AOP\n\n[[Page 20811]]\n\nwill be described in the joint planning guidance issued by the \nDepartments of Labor and Education.\nSection 653.109 Data Collection and Performance Accountability Measures\n    For Sec.  653.109, Data collection, the Department proposes to \ninclude the equity indicators and minimum service level indicators \ncurrently at Sec.  653.112 as they are data elements that appropriately \nfit under Sec.  653.109, with the exception of the contents of current \n\nSec.  653.112(c)(3) that will be deleted because ETA does not publish a \nlist of priorities that State agencies can use as a basis for the \nminimum service levels required of significant MSFW States. The \n\n\n\nDepartment also proposes to add ``and performance accountability \nmeasures'' to Sec.  653.109 so the part may appropriately include the \nadditional measures.\n    The Department proposes to make several other changes to Sec.  \n653.109:\n    (1) Paragraph (a) specifies that State agencies must collect career \nservice indicator data for services described in WIOA sec. \n134(c)(2)(A)(xii) because WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) includes several \nof the existing requirements under Sec.  653.109;\n    (2) Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that data collection \n\nwill include the number of non-MSFWs and MSFWs registered for Wagner-\n\nPeyser services and MSFW average earnings, and will remove the \nrequirement to collect data on the number of MSFWs referred to \ntraining, receiving job development, receiving testing, receiving \nemployment counseling, and referred for supportive services or other \nservices, as those are already required data elements under WIOA; and\n    (3) Paragraph (b) also replaces the terms ``wage rates'' and \n``duration of employment'' with the terms ``entered employment rate'' \nand ``employment retention rate,'' respectively to conform with the \nterminology by the Department's data collection mechanism (currently \nthe Labor Exchange Agricultural Reporting System 9002a form).\nSection 653.110 Disclosure of Data\n    Proposed Sec.  653.110 contains minor changes to clarify the \nprovisions and to update terminology.\nSection 653.111 State Agency Staffing Requirements\n    In Sec.  653.111 it is proposed that the requirement for each State \nagency with significant MSFW offices to submit an affirmative action \nplan be replaced with the requirement that each such State agency \nsubmit assurances, as part of its Unified State Plan and as part of its \nAnnual Summaries, that it is implementing an affirmative action \n\nstaffing program. This change is proposed because it will help each \nState agency with significant MSFW offices to streamline implementation \nof its affirmative action program while ensuring that the Department \nremains in compliance with the relevant requirements under the Richey \nOrder. It is proposed that the regulation providing the formula for \ndetermining the racial and ethnic characteristics of the workforce be \n\ndeleted from the regulation because this will be provided in \nsubsequently issued guidance.\n    It is proposed that Sec.  653.112 be deleted because PBPs are \nobsolete as each State agency is required to submit a Unified or \nCombined State Plan pursuant to WIOA title I. The text in paragraphs \n(b) and (c) concerning equity indicators and minimum level service \nrequirements is proposed to be relocated, with minor revisions, to \nSec.  653.109.\n    It is proposed that Sec.  653.113 be deleted and its contents \nrelocated to 20 CFR 658.419 because it relates to the ES and \nEmployment-Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System).\n    In subpart F, the Department proposes the following changes to \nclarify the requirements of this subpart:\n    (1) The paragraphs under the ARS have been reorganized into \n\n\n\nsubcategories based on each stakeholder's respective responsibilities \n(the subcategories are ES Office Responsibilities, State Agency \nResponsibilities, and Processing Job Orders). The proposed \nrestructuring of this subpart is intended to help stakeholders better \n\nunderstand how the system works and more easily identify and comprehend \ntheir respective responsibilities. The reorganizing is also proposed to \n\nhelp clarify the meaning of the regulations;\n    (2) The paragraphs have been revised to state requirements in the \npositive and active voice, versus the negative passive voice from which \nthey were originally drafted;\n    (3) References to information that needs to be provided to MSFWs in \nSpanish be changed to ``native language'' to conform to TEGL 26-02; and\n    (4) The heading for subpart F has been revised and supplemented by \n\nadding the words ``for US Workers'' to clarify that ARS is meant for \nU.S. workers versus foreign workers. It is a common misconception that \n\nthe ARS is for foreign workers who may be hired by U.S. employers \nthrough visa programs such as the H-2A or H-2B visa programs, and the \nDepartment intends the proposed change to help eliminate this \nmisconception. For the same reason, any references to the temporary \nemployment of foreign workers in the United States (that would \notherwise fall under 20 CFR 655) have been deleted.\nSection 653.501 Requirements for Processing Clearance Orders\n    The Department proposes the following changes to Sec.  653.501:\n    (1) In paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(I), currently paragraph (d)(2)(x), it \nis proposed that the sentence regarding the contingency of payments \nmade beyond the period of employment specified in the job order be \ndeleted because such terms are already specified in the job order and \nthe language is duplicative;\n    (2) In paragraph (c)(3)(iv), currently paragraph (d)(2)(xiii), it \nis proposed that the sentence referring to requests for foreign workers \nbe deleted because this section should only cover information regarding \nARS and the requirements for foreign workers are covered under 20 CFR \n655; and\n    (3) In paragraph (j), it is proposed that the Regional \nAdministrator notify the national monitor advocate instead of the OWI \nAdministrator when a potential labor supply State agency rejects a \nclearance order and the Regional Administrator does not concur with the \nreasons for rejection. In this case, the national monitor advocate, in \nconsultation with the OWI Administrator, is the appropriate person to \nmake the final determination because it is the common practice for the \nnational monitor advocate to provide the State agencies with guidance \nregarding ARS.\nSection 653.502 Conditional Access to the Agricultural Recruitment \nSystem\n    The Department proposes to delete current Sec.  653.502 concerning \nchanges in crop and recruitment situations and fold its contents \nwithout change into proposed Sec.  653.501.\n    The Department proposes to add a new Sec.  653.502 which contains \nthe relocated provisions of 20 CFR 654.403. While the housing standards \n\n\n\nat 20 CFR 654 subpart E, including current Sec.  654.403, will expire 1 \nyear after the publication of the final rule, the Department proposes \nmoving current Sec.  654.403 into this new section because those \nrequirements remain necessary and relevant, and because that section is \nrelated to the terms and requirements of this subpart. Accordingly, the \nprovisions of 20 CFR 654.403 have been relocated to proposed 20 CFR \n653.502.\n\n[[Page 20812]]\n\nSection 653.503 Field Checks\n\n    Proposed Sec.  653.503(b) has been revised to clarify that State \n\nagencies must conduct field checks on at least 25 percent of \n\nagricultural worksites to align with common practice. The Department \n\nalso proposes to add language requiring a State agency with fewer than \n\n10 ES placements to conduct field checks on all agricultural worksites \n\nwhere the placements have been made. This change is proposed to ensure \n\nthat all worksites are checked whenever feasible. In paragraph (e), it \n\nis proposed that the word ``shall'' be changed to ``may'' because it is \n\nnot a requirement, rather State agencies may choose to enter into an \n\nagreement with an enforcement agency if they believe it is necessary or \n\nhelpful.\n\nP. Part 654--Special Responsibilities of the Employment Service System\n\n1. Introduction\n\n    The Department proposes to revise the ETA regulations governing \n\nHousing for Agricultural Workers at 20 CFR 654, subpart E, issued under \n\nthe authority of the 1933 Wagner-Peyser Act by updating outdated \n\nterminology and by establishing an expiration date for the ETA \n\nstandards in order to transition housing currently governed by the ETA \n\nstandards to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) \n\nregulations governing temporary labor camps for agricultural workers.\n\n2. Subpart E--Housing for Agricultural Workers\n\nSection 654.401 Applicability\n\n    The Department proposes to amend Sec.  654.401 to require that \n\nhousing covered by the regulations in this subpart be subject to the \n\nrelevant OSHA housing standards for agricultural workers beginning 1 \n\nyear after the publication of the final rule.\n\n    In 1951 the U.S. ES Bureau of Employment Security established the \n\nETA housing standards for farmworkers. These standards were updated in \n\n1959 and again in 1968. However, despite the Department's intention to \n\n``make every effort to ensure that `housing and facilities are hygienic \n\nand adequate to the climatic conditions of the area of employment''' \n\nand that such housing ``conformed to applicable State or local housing \n\ncodes, and in the absence of such codes, that the housing would not \n\n\n\nendanger the health or safety of the workers,'' farmworkers continued \n\nto face inadequate, unsafe, and unsanitary housing. In 1970, Congress \n\npassed the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) which was intended \n\nto assure that every person working in the United States has safe and \n\nhealthful working conditions.'' In this light, OSHA adopted a set of \n\nnational consensus standards for temporary labor camps which was \n\npublished in August 1971. Therefore, since 1971 the Department has had \n\nin effect two sets of agricultural housing standards for farmworkers: \n\nThose under the ETA regulations (originally at 20 CFR part 620, later \n\nat 20 CFR part 654) and those under the OSHA regulations (at 29 CFR \n\n1910.142). The dual set of standards has long resulted in confusion \n\nwith respect to their applicability and enforcement. In view of these \n\nproblems, the Department held hearings in 1976 with stakeholders, \n\ndeveloped several proposals to arrive at a single set of standards, \n\nand, on December 9, 1977, rescinded the ETA regulations and standards.\n\n    While the rescission was effective immediately, employers whose \n\nhousing met the ETA standards on the date of their rescission were \n\ngiven until January 1, 1979 to come into compliance with the OSHA \n\nhousing regulations. Later, the Department received numerous complaints \n\nobjecting to the rescission of the ETA housing regulations, including \n\nthose from employers who had constructed housing to conform to the ETA \n\nstandards and complained that the shift from ETA to OSHA standards \n\nwould require costly modifications to housing which the Department had \n\npreviously approved. In response to these comments, the Department \n\nproposed on September 1, 1978 to revise the December 9, 1977 rescission \n\naction by adding an indefinite extension of time for employers already \n\nfollowing the ETA standards to bring their housing into compliance with \n\nthe OSHA standards and a transitional provision for housing built in \n\nreliance on the ETA regulations.\n\n    On March 4, 1980, the Department issued a final rule providing that \n\nthe OSHA standards and regulations applied to all temporary housing for \n\nfarmworkers except that ``[e]mployers whose housing was constructed in \n\naccordance with the ETA housing standards may continue to follow the \n\nfull set of ETA standards set forth in this subpart only where prior to \n\nApril 3, 1980 the housing was completed or under construction, or where \n\nprior to March 4, 1980 a contract for the construction of the specific \n\nhousing was signed.'' 45 FR 14180, 14182 (Mar. 4, 1980).\n\n    The Department proposes that the remaining housing currently \n\ngoverned under the standards and provisions at 20 CFR part 654 subpart \n\nE (Housing for Agricultural Workers) be subject to the OSHA standards \n\n\n\nand provisions beginning 1 year after the publication of the final \n\nrule, except that mobile range housing for sheepherders and goatherders \n\nmust continue to meet existing Departmental guidelines and/or \n\napplicable regulations. The proposed expiration date will provide \n\nsufficient time for affected employers to transition into compliance \n\nwith the OSHA standards.\n\n    Pursuant to the January 19, 1981 agreement between OSHA, the WHD \n\n(replacing the abolished Employment Standards Administration (ESA)), \n\nand ETA for Inspections of Migrant Agricultural Worker Housing, the \n\nDepartment's WHD will continue to be responsible for enforcing the \n\nprovisions under 29 CFR 1910.142. Beginning 1 year after the \n\npublication of the final rule, the Department will not apply or enforce \n\nthe standards of this subpart, other than in cases relating to events \n\npredating that expiration date.\n\n    Requiring all housing to meet the relevant OSHA standards and \n\neliminating the ETA standards will reduce administrative and \n\nenforcement burdens on employers, workers, State agencies, and the \n\nDepartment because they will need to reference and rely on only one set \n\nof applicable standards located in one place. Enforcement agency staff \n\nand State agency staff that conduct housing inspections will only need \n\nto understand one set of standards which will ease the learning \n\nprocess. Additionally, the change will benefit MSFWs as the regulations \n\nunder 29 CFR 1910.142 conform to more modern housing standards than \n\nthose under 20 CFR part 654 subpart E. The Department acknowledges that \n\nthe change will mean that some employers will need to upgrade their \n\nfarmworker housing to meet the OSHA standards. However, the benefit to \n\nfarmworkers and the administrative benefits to State agencies and the \n\nDepartment outweigh the adjustments employers will need to make to \n\ncomply with the OSHA standards. In order to assist employers, the \n\nDepartment will provide technical assistance to facilitate the \n\ntransition to the OSHA housing standards.\n\n    Having been in place for 34 years, it is the Department's opinion \n\nthat it is appropriate to complete the transition to the OSHA standards \n\nbegun in 1980 and to phase out in full the ETA standards grandfathered \n\nfor 34 years for farmworker housing completed or under construction \n\nprior to March 3, 1980, or under contract for construction prior to \n\n\n\nApril 3, 1980. As in 1980, the Department continues to believe that the \n\nOSHA regulations provide for superior standards of safety and \n\nhabitability for\n\n[[Page 20813]]\n\nMSFWs and do not overly burden employers.\n\n    In addition to the change described above, the Department proposes \n\nto amend the following sections:\n\nSection 654.400 Scope and Purpose\n\n    The Department proposes to amend Sec.  654.400 to update \n\nterminology and explain that housing covered under the standards and \n\nprovisions of subpart E will be subject to different regulations \n\nwithout grandfathering beginning 1 year after the date that this final \n\nregulation is published.\n\n    In addition to the amendment described above, the Department \n\nproposes to revise Sec.  654.401 for clarity, to add a new paragraph \n\n(b), and to shorten the section heading by eliminating unnecessary \n\nlanguage.\n\nSection 654.402 Variances\n\n    The Department proposes to amend Sec.  654.402 to update \n\nterminology and remove the term ``permanent'' because, as proposed, \n\nvariances will expire on the given expiration date for the standards \n\nand provisions of subpart E; therefore, employers will no longer be \n\nentitled to a permanent variance. The deadline of June 2, 1980 is \n\nremoved because the Department proposes to receive applications for \n\ntemporary variances from the ETA standards until the date on which the \n\nstandards and provisions of subpart E will expire. Additionally, \n\nparagraph (f) has been added to state that all variances and requests \n\nfor variances will expire 1 year after the publication of the final \n\nrule requiring this change, and that no applications will be accepted \n\nas of that date. After this change takes effect, the Department will \n\nreturn any pending requests for variances to the appropriate applicant \n\nnoting that all variances and variance requests expired on that date \n\nand are therefore stale.\n\nSection 654.403 [Reserved]\n\n    Finally, the Department proposes that the provisions of Sec.  \n\n654.403 be deleted and relocated to 20 CFR 653.502 because they more \n\ndirectly relate to the governance and operation of the ARS rather than \n\nthe condition of worker housing. Section 654.403 provides for \n\nconditional access to the clearance order system administered by the \n\n\n\nrelevant State workforce agency which is needed to effectively service \n\nemployers whose housing has fallen temporarily out of compliance with \n\nthe applicable housing standards during a period of use in the previous \n\nyear, and where the employer has not had an opportunity to bring the \n\nhousing back into compliance.\n\n    The following sections of part 654 remain unchanged: Sec. Sec.  \n\n654.404, 654.405, 654.406, 654.407, 654.408, 654.409, 654.410, 654.411, \n\n654.412, 654.413, 654.414, 654.415, 654.416, and 654.417.\n\nQ. Part 658--Administrative Provisions Governing the Employment Service \n\nSystem\n\n    20 CFR part 658 sets forth systems and procedures for complaints, \n\nmonitoring for compliance assessment, enforcement and sanctions for \n\nviolations of the ES regulations and employment-related laws, including \n\ndiscontinuation of services to employers and decertification of State \n\nagencies.\n\n    The Department's proposed changes update terminology and \n\nresponsibilities and reorganize various regulations to increase the \n\nclarity and efficiency of the provisions involved. Additionally, \n\nheadings have been revised, when necessary, to reflect proposed changes \n\nto the regulations, and language has been added to permit, where \n\nrelevant, the use of electronic mail and electronic signatures. The \n\ncomplaint system under 20 CFR part 658 does not apply to complaints \n\nfiled under WIOA title I.\n\n    During the 1980 rulemaking, the Department received numerous \n\ncomments about the proposed complaint system at 20 CFR part 658 subpart \n\nE (Complaint System) including comments that focused on the limited \n\nstaff resources available to provide all labor exchange services \n\nincluding the handling of complaints. The Department took those \n\ncomments into account and limited the complaint system to only take in \n\nwriting those complaints that were ``Job Service (JS) related or those \n\nnon-JS related complaints that [were] filed by MSFWs alleging \n\nviolations of laws enforced by ESA or OSHA.'' (Since the dissolution of \n\nESA on Nov. 8, 2009, the WHD has taken on the relevant enforcement \n\nresponsibilities (45 FR 39454, 39456 (June 10, 1980.)) The Department \n\nnow believes it is appropriate and consistent with the Richey Order to \n\nallow most employment-related law complaints by MSFWs to be recorded, \n\nreferred, and tracked to resolution (except those that relate to WIOA \n\ntitle I complaints which follow a different process--see WIOA title I \n\nsec. 181(c)). Technological advances in the workplace since 1980, such \n\nas the widespread use of computer software and systems, have made \n\n\n\nperforming such work feasible with limited staff resources. \n\nAdditionally, recording, referring, and tracking to resolution the \n\nadditional complaints will help, directly or indirectly, to deter the \n\nemployment-related discrimination and abuses that MSFWs continue to \n\nsuffer throughout the United States.\n\n    The Department proposes to revise the heading for 20 CFR part 658 \n\nsubpart E from ``Job Service Complaint System'' to ``Employment Service \n\nand Employment-Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System)'' to \n\naccurately reflect what the Complaint System covers. The Department \n\nproposes to eliminate Sec.  658.401 and fold its revised provisions \n\nthat relate to the purpose and scope of the subpart into Sec.  658.400.\n\n    Regarding provisions concerning the complaint system at the State \n\nlevel, the Department proposes to restructure the previous Sec. Sec.  \n\n658.410 through 658.418 by placing them in Sec.  658.411 and breaking \n\nthem down into subsections for complaints alleging violation(s) of \n\nemployment-related laws and subsections on complaints alleging \n\nviolation(s) of the ES regulations. Those subsections are further \n\nbroken down based on whether the complainant is an MSFW or not. \n\nProposed new Sec. Sec.  658.410 and 658.411 provide an overview of the \n\nComplaint System as it pertains to all persons who submit a complaint \n\nand as it pertains specifically to MSFWs who submit a complaint.\n\nSection 658.410 Establishment of Local and State Complaint Systems\n\n    In Sec.  658.410(c)(2), it is proposed that quarterly complaint \n\nlogs be submitted to the SMA and the State Administrator rather than to \n\nthe Regional Administrator, unless requested. This change is proposed \n\nto increase the efficiency of the Regional Administrator's position \n\nthat does not require the routine review of the multitude of highly \n\ndetailed logs.\n\nSection 658.411 Action on Complaints\n\n    Section 658.411 is expanded to incorporate the majority of the \n\nprovisions currently in Sec. Sec.  658.412 through 658.417 in the \n\ninterest of streamlining and clarity. The Department proposes to \n\neliminate Sec. Sec.  659.412 through 658.417 as separate sections. Not \n\nincluded in Sec.  658.411, however, is the reference currently in Sec.  \n\n658.414(a) to 29 CFR part 42 because the proposed revisions to the \n\ncomplaint system call for coordination with all relevant enforcement \n\nagencies concerning MSFW complaints, and provisions at 29 CFR part 42 \n\ndiscuss such coordination only between WHD, OSHA, and the ETA. This new \n\napproach ensures that State and local officials will consider \n\nforwarding employment-related law complaints to a broader group of \n\nenforcement agencies. Also excluded from proposed Sec.  658.411 is the\n\n\n\n[[Page 20814]]\n\ntext of current Sec.  658.414(c) that has become redundant because \n\nproposed Sec.  658.410 also states that all complaints filed by an MSFW \n\nmust be recorded. The Department proposes to add new Sec.  658.419 that \n\nwill incorporate the relocated provisions of 20 CFR 653.113 (Apparent \n\nViolations) because those provisions set forth the procedures for State \n\nagency employees to follow when they become aware of an apparent \n\nviolation of employment-related law or of the ES regulations which is \n\nmore appropriately located in 20 CFR part 658 subpart E than in 20 CFR \n\npart 653 subpart B that concerns services for MSFWs.\n\n    Proposed Sec.  658.411(d)(6) indicates that complaints alleging \n\nviolations of the ES regulations will be handled to resolution if the \n\ncomplaint was made within 2 years from the date of occurrence, versus \n\nthe 1 year provided currently at Sec.  658.401. A 2-year limitations \n\nperiod would be consistent with the limitations period for non-willful \n\nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a worker protective statute \n\nof general application that applies to employment in agriculture and \n\nfrom which the definition of farmwork in 20 CFR 651.10 is largely \n\ndrawn. Increasing the limitations period to 2 years will provide \n\ngreater protections to those participating in the ES system by \n\naccommodating those individuals that do not feel comfortable filing or \n\nare not able to file complaints within a year from the alleged \n\noccurrence. Increasing the limitations period by 1 year will not \n\nincrease the burden on State agencies or employers because the Uniform \n\nAdministrative Requirements for the Wagner-Peyser grant already \n\nrequires the retention of all financial and programmatic records, \n\nsupporting documents, and statistical records for 3 years, and those \n\nrecords, in many cases, will contain information bearing on complaints \n\nfiled within the 2-year limitations period. Finally, as with complaints \n\nfiled under the FLSA, there is little risk that a complaint will become \n\nstale if it is filed 2 years after an alleged occurrence. The 2-year \n\nlimitations period would not apply to employment-related law complaints \n\nas each enforcement agency has its own respective limitations period \n\nfor which it can process complaints.\n\n    It is proposed that Sec. Sec.  658.420 through 658.426 be \n\nrestructured to conform to the restructured regulations for the \n\nComplaint System at the State level in which the system is broken down \n\ninto employment law-related complaints and complaints relating to the \n\nES regulations.\n\n\n\nSection 658.422 Handling of Employment-Related Law Complaints by the \n\nRegional Administrator\n\n    The Department proposes to revise Sec.  658.422 by replacing in \n\nSec.  658.422(a) the reference to ``ESA or OSHA'' with ``the \n\nappropriate enforcement agency'' to allow for complaints to be referred \n\nto the appropriate agency and not confined to two agencies within the \n\nDepartment. Also proposed is the elimination of Sec.  658.422(d) \n\nbecause its requirement to log all complaints and related \n\ncorrespondence is already set forth in Sec.  658.420(d). The Department \n\nalso proposes to eliminate Sec.  658.423 as a separate section and \n\nincorporate its provisions in Sec.  658.420 that addresses the handling \n\nand other treatment of complaints.\n\nSection 658.424 Proceedings Before the Office of Administrative Law \n\nJudges\n\n    Per Sec.  658.424(b), the Department proposes to clarify that the \n\nrules governing procedures before the Department's OALJ at subpart A of \n\n29 CFR part 18 govern proceedings under Sec.  658.424, except where the \n\nprovisions of Sec. Sec.  658.424 and 658.425 conflict with the \n\nprovisions of that subpart. However, the rules of evidence at subpart B \n\nof 29 CFR part 18 do not apply to this section. This change is proposed \n\nto ensure consistency with other ETA programs.\n\nSection 658.501 Basis for Discontinuation of Services\n\n    In 20 CFR part 658 subpart F, it is proposed that language be added \n\nto Sec.  658.501(c) to clarify the procedures a State agency must \n\nfollow when an employer participating in the ES system has allegedly \n\nnot complied with the terms of the temporary labor certification.\n\n    In 20 CFR part 658 subpart G, it is proposed that the references to \n\nSec. Sec.  658.620 and 658.621 be deleted from Sec.  658.600 because \n\nthose sections are reserved. It is also proposed that under Sec.  \n\n658.601(a)(1)(ii), ``Employment Security Automated Reporting System \n\n(ESARS) tables and Cost Accounting Reports'' be replaced with ``the \n\nDepartment's ETA 9002A report, or any successor report required by the \n\nDepartment'' to conform to what is currently utilized.\n\n    In 20 CFR part 658 subpart H, the Department proposes to replace \n\noutdated or otherwise incorrect terminology. For example, ETA is \n\nreplaced by the Department, State agency is replaced by State Workforce \n\nAgency (SWA), and JS is replaced with ES.\n\n    Finally, recognizing that almost all correspondence, formal filings \n\nand submissions, and other exchanges of documents and information \n\nbetween the public and the Department are conducted electronically, \n\nthese regulations clarify that any required filing or submission of \n\ndocuments, etc. via mail or hard copy may also be accomplished \n\n\n\nelectronically.\n\nV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices\n\nA. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563: Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 directs agencies, in deciding whether \n\nand how to regulate, to assess all costs and benefits of available \n\nregulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating. \n\nE.O. 13563 is supplemental to and reaffirms E.O. 12866. It emphasizes \n\nthe importance of quantifying present and future benefits and costs; \n\ndirects that regulations be adopted with public participation; and \n\nwhere relevant and feasible, directs that regulatory approaches be \n\nconsidered that reduce burdens, harmonize rules across agencies, and \n\nmaintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the public. Costs and \n\nbenefits are to include both quantifiable measures and qualitative \n\nassessments of possible impacts that are difficult to quantify. If \n\nregulation is necessary, agencies should select regulatory approaches \n\nthat maximize net benefits. OMB determines whether a regulatory action \n\nis significant and, therefore, subject to review.\n\n    Section 3(f) of E.O. 12866 defines a ``significant regulatory \n\naction'' as any action that is likely to result in a rule that may:\n\n    (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or \n\nadversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the \n\neconomy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public \n\nhealth or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or \n\ncommunities;\n\n    (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an \n\naction taken or planned by another agency;\n\n    (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, \n\nuser fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients \n\nthereof; or\n\n    (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising from legal mandates, \n\nthe President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866.\n\n    Summary of the analysis. The Department provides the following \n\nsummary of the regulatory impact analysis:\n\n    (1) The proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' under \n\nWIOA sec. 3(f)(4) of E.O. 12866; therefore, OMB has reviewed the \n\nproposed rule.\n\n[[Page 20815]]\n\n    (2) The proposed rule would have no cost impact on small entities.\n\n    (3) The proposed rule would not impose an unfunded mandate on \n\nFederal, State, local, or tribal governments as defined by the Unfunded \n\n\n\nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\n    In total, the Department estimates that this NPRM would have an \n\naverage annual cost of $38,437,779 and a total 10-year cost of \n\n$305,556,353 (with 7-percent discounting). The largest contributor to \n\nthe cost is the requirement related to the development and continuous \n\nimprovement of the workforce development system, followed by the career \n\npathways development and the colocation of Wagner-Peyser services.\n\n    The Department was unable to quantify several important benefits to \n\nsociety due to data limitations or lack of existing data or evaluation \n\nfindings on particular items. Based on a review of empirical studies \n\n(primarily studies published in peer-reviewed academic publications and \n\nstudies sponsored by the Department), we identified a variety of \n\nsocietal benefits: (1) Training services increase job placement rates; \n\n(2) participants in occupational training experience higher \n\nreemployment rates; (3) training is associated with higher earnings; \n\nand (4) State performance accountability measures, in combination with \n\nthe board membership provision requiring employer/business \n\nrepresentation, can be expected to improve the quality of the training \n\nand, ultimately, the number and caliber of job placements. We \n\nidentified several channels through which these benefits might be \n\nachieved: (1) Better information about training providers will enable \n\nworkers to make better informed choices about programs to pursue; (2) \n\nsanctions to under-performing States will serve as an incentive for \n\nboth States and local entities to monitor performance more effectively \n\nand to intervene early; and (3) enhanced services for dislocated \n\nworkers, self-employed individuals, and workers with disabilities will \n\nlead to the benefits discussed above.\n\n    The Department requests comment on the costs and benefits of this \n\nNPRM with the goal of ensuring a thorough consideration and discussion \n\nat the Final Rule stage.\n\n1. Need for Regulation\n\n    Public Law 113-128, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, \n\nenacted on July 22, 2014, statutorily requires publication of proposed \n\nimplementation regulations not later than 180 days after the date of \n\nenactment. The Department has determined that implementing regulations \n\nare necessary in order for the WIOA program to be efficiently and \n\neffectively operated and that such regulations shall provide Congress \n\nand others with uniform information necessary to evaluate the outcomes \n\nof the new workforce law.\n\n2. Alternatives in Light of the Required Publication of Proposed \n\nRegulations\n\n\n\n    OMB Circular A-4, which outlines best practices in regulatory \n\nanalysis, directs agencies to analyze alternatives outside the scope of \n\ntheir current legal authority if such alternatives best satisfy the \n\nphilosophy and principles of E.O. 12866. While the WIOA provides little \n\nregulatory discretion, the Department assessed, to the extent feasible, \n\nalternatives to the proposed regulations.\n\n    In this NPRM, the Department considered significant alternatives to \n\naccomplish the stated objectives of the WIOA while also attempting to \n\nminimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small \n\nentities. This analysis considered the extent to which WIOA's \n\nprescriptive language presented any regulatory options which would also \n\nallow for achieving the Act's articulated program goals. The \n\nDepartment, in many instances, has reiterated the Act's language in the \n\nregulatory text and expansions are offered for clarification and \n\nguidance to the regulated community. The additional regulatory guidance \n\nshould create more efficient administration of the program by reducing \n\nambiguities and subsequent State and local revisions as a result of \n\nunclear statutory language.\n\n    In addition, the Department considered and, where feasible, \n\nproposed to issue sub-regulatory guidance in lieu of additional \n\nregulatory requirements. This policy option has two primary benefits to \n\nsmall entities. First, guidance will be issued following publication of \n\nthe rules, thereby allowing States, local areas, and small entities \n\nadditional time to prepare their compliance efforts. Second, this level \n\nof guidance is more flexible in nature, allowing for faster \n\nmodifications and any subsequent issuances, as necessary.\n\n    The Department considered three possible alternatives:\n\n    (1) To implement the changes prescribed in WIOA, as noted in this \n\nNPRM, thereby satisfying the statutory mandate; or\n\n    (2) To take no action, that is, to attempt to implement the WIOA \n\nutilizing existing Workforce Innovation Act (WIA) regulations; or\n\n    (3) To not publish regulation and rescind existing WIA final \n\nregulations and, thereby ignoring the WIOA statutory requirement to \n\npublish implementing regulations thus forcing the regulated community \n\nto follow statutory language for implementation and compliance \n\npurposes.\n\n    The Department considered these three options in accordance with \n\nthe provisions of E.O. 12866 and chose to publish the WIOA NPRM, that \n\nis, the first alternative. The Department considered the second \n\nalternative, that is, retaining existing WIA regulations as the guide \n\nfor WIOA implementation, but believes that the requirements have \n\nchanged substantially enough that new implementing regulations are \n\n\n\nnecessary for the workforce system to achieve program compliance. The \n\nDepartment considered the third alternative, that is, to not publish an \n\nimplementing regulation and rescind existing WIA final regulations, but \n\nrejected it because the WIOA legislative language in and of itself does \n\nnot provide sufficient detailed guidance to effectively implement WIOA; \n\nthus, regulations are necessary to achieve program compliance.\n\n    In addition to the regulatory alternatives noted above, the \n\nDepartment also considered whether certain aspects of the WIOA could be \n\nphased in over a prescribed period of time (different compliance \n\ndates), thereby allowing States and localities additional time for \n\nplanning and successful implementation. As a policy option, this \n\nalternative appears appealing in a broad theoretical sense and where \n\nfeasible (e.g., Wagner-Peyser colocation of services), the Department \n\nhas recognized and made allowances for different schedules of \n\nimplementation. However, upon further discussion and in order to begin \n\nto achieve the intended legislative benefits of the WIOA, additional \n\nimplementation delays beyond those noted in this NPRM may create \n\npotentially more issues than the benefit of alternative starting dates. \n\nSpecifically, as many critical WIOA elements follow upon the \n\nimplementation of other provisions (e.g., technology and performance \n\nreporting are intrinsically related), discussions around delaying \n\nadditional aspects became quite complicated such that the \n\ninterrelatedness of the WIOA's requirements suggested that the \n\nalternative of delaying additional aspects was not operationally \n\nfeasible.\n\n    Furthermore, the data necessary to fully review this option does \n\nnot yet exist, and will not until local workforce development boards \n\n(WDBs) conduct procurements and announce awards.\n\n[[Page 20816]]\n\nSimilarly, performance standards will be negotiated at a future time \n\nand based upon a variety of factors including State and local economic \n\nconditions, resources, and priorities. Establishing proposed standards \n\nin advance of this statutorily-defined process may not be an efficient \n\nor effective action. The enforcement methods described in the proposed \n\nrule are a reflection of prescribed WIOA requirements and entity size \n\nshould not in and of itself create alternative methods for compliance \n\nor different time periods for achieving compliance. Although the \n\nDepartment has not determined sufficiently valid reasons for altering \n\ncompliance timeframes in addition to those described in the proposed \n\nrule for small entities, we seek comment on this issue.\n\n    The Department's initial impact analysis has concluded that by \n\n\n\nvirtue of WIOA's prescriptive language, particularly the requirement to \n\npublish implementing regulations within 180 days, there are no viable \n\nregulatory alternatives available other than those discussed above.\n\n    The Department requests comment on these or other alternatives, \n\nincluding alternatives on the specific provisions contained in this \n\nNPRM, with the goal of ensuring a thorough consideration and discussion \n\nat the Final Rule stage.\n\n 3. Analysis Considerations\n\n    The Department derives its estimates by comparing the existing \n\nprogram baseline, i.e., the benefits and costs associated with current \n\npractices, which at a minimum, must comply with the 2000 WIA Final Rule \n\n(65 FR 49294, Aug. 11, 2000), against the additional benefits and costs \n\nassociated with implementation of provisions contained in this WIOA-\n\nrequired NPRM.\n\n    For a proper evaluation of the additional benefits and costs of \n\nthis NPRM, the Department explains how the required actions of States, \n\nWDBs, employers and training entities, government agencies, and other \n\nrelated entities are linked to the expected benefits and estimated \n\ncosts. We also considered, where appropriate, the unintended \n\nconsequences of the proposed regulations introduced by this NPRM. The \n\nDepartment makes every effort, when feasible, to quantify and monetize \n\nthe benefits and costs of this NPRM. The Department was unable to \n\nquantify the benefits associated with the proposed rule because of data \n\nlimitations and a lack of operational data or evaluation findings on \n\nthe provisions of the proposed rule or WIOA in general. Therefore, we \n\ndescribe the benefits qualitatively. We followed the same approach when \n\nwe were unable to quantify the costs.\n\n    Throughout the benefit-cost analysis, the Department made every \n\neffort to identify and quantify all potential incremental costs \n\nassociated with the implementation of WIOA as distinct from what \n\nalready exist under WIA, WIOA's predecessor statute. Despite our best \n\nestimation efforts, however, the Department might be double-counting \n\nsome activities that are already happening under WIA. Thus, the costs \n\nitemized below represent an upper bound of the potential cost of \n\nimplementing the statute. The Department requests comment on its cost \n\nestimates, specifically in terms of whether it has accurately captured \n\nthe additional costs associated with the implementation of WIOA.\n\n    In addition to this NPRM, the Departments of Labor and Education \n\nhave proposed a joint NPRM to implement specific requirements of WIOA \n\nthat fall under both Departments' purviews. While we acknowledge that \n\nthese proposed rules and their associated impacts may not be wholly \n\nindependent from one another, we are unaware of any reliable method of \n\nquantifying the effects of this interdependence. Therefore, our \n\n\n\nanalysis does not capture the correlated impacts of the benefits and \n\ncosts of this proposed rule and those associated with the other NPRMs. \n\nWe request comments from the public about the appropriateness of this \n\nassumption.\n\n    In accordance with the regulatory analysis guidance contained in \n\nOMB Circular A-4 and consistent with the Department's practices in \n\nprevious rulemakings, this regulatory analysis focuses on the likely \n\nconsequences (benefits and costs that accrue to citizens and residents \n\nof the United States) of this WIOA-required NPRM. The analysis covers \n\n10 years (2015 through 2024) to ensure it captures major additional \n\nbenefits and costs that accrue over time. The Department expresses all \n\nquantifiable impacts in 2013 dollars and use 3-percent and 7-percent \n\ndiscounting following OMB Circular A-4.\n\n    Exhibit 1 presents the estimated number of entities expected to \n\nexperience an increase in level of effort (workload) due to the \n\nproposed requirements contained in this NPRM. These estimates are \n\nprovided by the Department and are used extensively throughout this \n\nanalysis to calculate the estimated cost of each proposed provision.\n\n             Exhibit 1--Number of Affected Entities by Type\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                              Number of\n\n                        Entity type                            entities\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStates impacted by DOL program requirements................       \\6\\ 56\n\nStates without collocated Wagner-Peyser offices and one-          \\7\\ 10\n\n stops.....................................................\n\nStates without sector strategies...........................       \\2\\ 21\n\nStates that need to create Unified State Plans.............       \\2\\ 14\n\nStates that must pay their share for proportionate use of         \\2\\ 54\n\n one-stop delivery systems.................................\n\nLocal areas without collocated Wagner-Peyser offices and         \\2\\ 100\n\n one-stops.................................................\n\nWorkforce development boards...............................      \\2\\ 580\n\nWorkforce development boards selecting one-stop operators..      \\2\\ 250\n\nLocal Boards performing regional plan modifications........      \\2\\ 300\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTransfer Payments\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ Ibid.\n\n    \\7\\ Department of Labor estimate.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n    In addition, the Department provides an assessment of transfer \n\npayments associated with transitioning the nation's public workforce \n\nsystem from the requirements of WIA to new requirements imposed by \n\nWIOA. In accordance with OMB Circular A-4, we consider transfer \n\npayments as payments from one group to another that do not affect total \n\nresources available to society. For example, under WIOA, partners are \n\nrequired to pay their share for proportionate use of one-stop delivery \n\nsystems. Partners receive sufficient Federal funding to cover these \n\npayments, rendering this payment a transfer rather than a new cost. \n\nUnder-performing States will also receive sanctions under WIOA, which \n\nare similarly classified as transfers as they result in the de-\n\nobligation of funds from the State's set-aside. In accordance with the \n\nState allotment provisions noted in WIOA sec. 127, the interstate \n\nfunding formula methodology is not significantly different than that \n\nutilized for the distribution of WIA funds. Final program year grant \n\nallocations will reflect WIOA requirements and are under development.\n\n    One example of transfer payments is the expectation that available \n\nU.S. workers trained and hired who were previously unemployed will no \n\nlonger need to seek new or continued unemployment insurance benefits. \n\nAssuming other factors remain constant, the Department expects State \n\nunemployment insurance expenditures to decline because of the hiring of \n\nU.S.\n\n[[Page 20817]]\n\nworkers following WIOA implementation. The Department, however, cannot \n\nquantify these transfer payments due to a lack of adequate data.\n\n    In the subject-by-subject analysis, the Department presents the \n\nadditional labor and other costs associated with the implementation of \n\neach of the proposed provisions in this NPRM. Exhibit 2 presents the \n\ncompensation rates for the occupational categories expected to \n\nexperience an increase in level of effort (workload) due to the \n\nproposed rule. We used wage rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' \n\nMean Hourly Wage Rate for private and State employees.\\8\\ For \n\nsimplicity, we applied State-level wages to local employees. We also \n\nused wage rates from the Office of Personnel Management's Salary Table \n\nfor the 2013 General Schedule for Federal employees.\\9\\ We adjusted the \n\nwage rates using a loaded wage factor to reflect total compensation, \n\nwhich includes health and retirement benefits. For the State and local \n\nsectors, we used a loaded wage factor of 1.55, which represents the \n\nratio of total compensation \\10\\ to wages.\\11\\ For Federal employees, \n\nwe used a loaded wage factor of 1.69 based on internal data from DOL. \n\n\n\nWe then multiplied the loaded wage factor by each occupational \n\ncategory's wage rate to calculate an hourly compensation rate.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 2013, National Occupational \n\nEmployment and Wage Estimates, retrieved from: http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm.\n\n    \\9\\ The wage rate for Federal employees is based on Step 5 of \n\nthe General Schedule (source: OPM, 2013, Salary Table for the 2013 \n\nGeneral Schedule, retrieved from:            http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-\nwages/2013/general-schedule/gs_h.pdf).\n\n    \\10\\ BLS Employment Cost Index, 2013 Average Series ID \n\nCMU3010000000000D, CMU3010000000000P (source: Bureau of Labor \n\nStatistics, 2013 Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, retrieved \n\nfrom:            http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/ecec_nr.htm).\n\n    \\11\\ The State and local loaded wage factor was applied to all \n\nnon-Federal employees.

At a minimum, all affected entities are currently required to \n\ncomply with the 2000 WIA Final Rule (65 FR 49294, Aug. 11, 2000); \n\nhowever, some affected entities may already be in compliance with some \n\nprovisions of the proposed rule. This analysis estimates the \n\nincremental costs that would be incurred by affected entities which are \n\nnot yet compliant with the proposed rule. The equation below shows the \n\nmethod by which the Department calculated the incremental total cost \n\nfor each provision over the 10-year analysis period.\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP16AP15.002\n\nWhere,\n\nAl Number of affected entities that would incur labor \n\ncosts,\n\nNi Number of staff of labor type i,\n\nHi Hours required per staff of labor type i,\n\nWi Mean hourly wage of staff of labor type i,\n\nLi Loaded wage factor of staff of labor type i,\n\nAj Number of affected entities incurring non-labor costs \n\nof type j,\n\nCj Non-labor cost of type j,\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999201.htm#15-0000\n\n\ni Staff type,\n\nn Number of staff types,\n\nj Non-labor cost type,\n\nm Number of non-labor cost types,\n\nT Year.\n\n    The total cost of each provision is calculated as the sum of the \n\ntotal labor cost and total non-labor cost incurred each year over the \n\n10-year period (see Exhibit 3 for the 10-year cost of the proposed rule \n\nby provision). The total labor cost is the sum of the labor costs for \n\neach labor type i (e.g., administrative\n\n[[Page 20818]]\n\nstaff, legal counsel staff, and managers) multiplied by the number of \n\naffected entities that will incur labor costs, Al. The labor \n\ncost for each labor type i is calculated by multiplying the number of \n\nstaff required to perform the proposed activity, Ni; the \n\nhours required per staff member to perform the proposed activity, \n\nHi; the mean hourly wage of staff of labor type i, \n\nWi; and the loaded wage factor of staff of labor type i, \n\nLi. The total non-labor cost is the sum of the non-labor \n\ncosts for each non-labor cost type j (e.g., consulting costs) \n\nmultiplied by the number of affected entities that will incur non-labor \n\ncosts, Aj.\n\n4. Subject-by-Subject Analysis\n\n    The Department's analysis below covers the expected impacts of the \n\nfollowing proposed provisions of the WIOA NPRM against the baseline of \n\nthe current practice under WIA: (a) New State Workforce Development \n\nBoard Membership Requirements; (b) Development and Continuous \n\nImprovement of the Workforce Development System; (c) Development of \n\nStatewide Policies Affecting the State's One-stop System; (d) \n\nDevelopment of Strategies for Technological Improvements; (e) State \n\nPlan Modification; (f) Identification of Regions; (g) Appoint New Local \n\nWorkforce Development Board and Appropriate Firewalls; (h) Career \n\nPathways Development; (i) Development of Proven and Promising \n\nPractices; (j) Technology; (k) Selection of the One-stop Operator; (l) \n\nCoordination with Education Providers; (m) Regional Plans; (n) Local \n\nand Regional Plan Modification; (o) Improved Information about \n\nPotential Training Program Providers; (p) Sanctions on Under-performing \n\nStates; (q) Colocation of Wagner-Peyser Services; (r) Partners Required \n\nto Pay their Share for Proportionate Use of One-stop Delivery System; \n\n(s) Establishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including \n\n\n\nAdding Registered Apprenticeship; (t) Determining Eligibility of New \n\nand Previously Eligible Providers; (u) Biennial Review of Eligibility; \n\n(v) Disseminating the Training Provider List with Accompanying \n\nInformation; and (w) Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) Housing.\n\n    The Department emphasizes that many of the proposed provisions in \n\nthis WIOA-required NPRM are also existing requirements under WIA. For \n\nexample, the requirement that States ``prepare annual reports'' is a \n\ncurrent requirement under WIA that States routinely undertake. \n\nAccordingly, our regulatory analysis focuses on ``new'' benefits, \n\ncosts, and transfers that can be attributed exclusively to the \n\nenactment of WIOA, as addressed in this NPRM. Much of WIA's \n\ninfrastructure and operations are carried forward under WIOA and, \n\ntherefore, are not considered ``new'' cost burdens under this NPRM.\n\na. New State Workforce Development Board Membership Requirements\n\n    States must establish State WDBs in accordance with the \n\nrequirements of WIOA sec. 101. Under WIOA sec. 101(b)(1)(C)(i), the \n\nmajority of the State WDB representatives must be from businesses or \n\norganizations in the State. These representatives must be owners or \n\nchief executives or operating officers of the businesses or executives \n\nwith optimum policy-making or hiring authority. WIOA sec. \n\n101(b)(1)(C)(iii)(I) requires the Governor to appoint to the State WDB \n\nrepresentatives of government that include the lead State officials \n\nwith primary responsibility for each core program and two or more Chief \n\nElected Officials (CEOs) that represent both cities and counties, where \n\nappropriate. In accordance with WIOA sec. 101(b)(2), State WDB \n\nmembership must represent the diverse geographic areas of the State.\n\nCosts\n\n    To estimate State WDB costs, the Department multiplied the \n\nestimated average number of managers per State (1) by the time required \n\nto adjust the State WDB membership (20 hours) and by the hourly \n\ncompensation rate. We repeated the calculation for the following \n\noccupational categories: Legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 15 \n\nhours), technical staff (2 staff for 20 hours each), and administrative \n\nstaff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for all \n\nfour personnel categories ($5,597) and multiplied the result by the \n\nnumber of States (56). This would result in a one-time cost of $313,435 \n\nin the first year of the proposed rule, which amounts to an average \n\nannual cost of $31,343.\n\nb. Development and Continuous Improvement of the Workforce Development \n\nSystem\n\n    WIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(A) through (G) require that the State WDB \n\nassist the Governor in the development and continuous improvement of \n\nthe State's workforce development system, including identifying \n\n\n\nbarriers and means for removing barriers to aligning programs and \n\nactivities; developing or expanding sector-based training and career \n\npathways proven to support individuals to seeking to enter and retain \n\nemployment; developing customer outreach strategies; identifying \n\nregions and designating local workforce development areas; developing \n\nand continuously improving the one-stop system; and developing \n\nstrategies to train and inform staff.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the State WDBs' annual labor costs for \n\ndeveloping or expanding sector strategies by multiplying the estimated \n\naverage number of managers per State (1) by the time required to review \n\nthe workforce development system (300 hours) and the hourly \n\ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the technical \n\nstaff (2 staff for 1,260 hours each). We summed the labor cost for both \n\ncategories ($190,516) and multiplied the result by the number of States \n\nthat do not have extensive and systematic sector strategies (21). Over \n\nthe 10-year period, this calculation yields an estimated recurring \n\nannual cost of $4,000,838.\n\n    Similarly, the State WDBs' annual labor cost for expanding career \n\npathways strategies was estimated by multiplying the estimated average \n\nnumber of managers per State (1) by the time required to review the \n\nworkforce development system (300 hours) and the hourly compensation \n\nrate. The Department repeated the calculation for the technical staff \n\n(2 staff for 1,260 hours each). We summed the labor cost for the two \n\noccupational categories ($190,516) and multiplied the result by the \n\nnumber of States that do not have policies for career pathways \n\n(27).\\17\\ Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an estimated \n\nrecurring annual cost of $5,143,934.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ The number of States that have not established career \n\npathways is provided in the ``National Dialogue on Career Pathways \n\nViewing Party Guide.''\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur \n\nto identify regions by multiplying the estimated average number of \n\nmanagers per State (1) by the time required to review the workforce \n\ndevelopment system (40 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We \n\nperformed the same calculation for the following occupational \n\ncategories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), \n\ntechnical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours), and administrative staff \n\n\n\n(1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four \n\npersonnel categories ($11,268) and multiplied the result by the number \n\nof States (56) to estimate this one-time cost of $631,001. Over the 10-\n\nyear period, this calculation\n\n[[Page 20819]]\n\nyields an average annual cost of $63,100.\n\n    The sum of these costs yields a total one-time cost of $631,001 and \n\nan annual cost of $9,144,772, which results in a total average annual \n\ncost of $9,207,872 for individuals from the State level to review the \n\nworkforce development system.\n\nc. Development of Statewide Policies Affecting the State's One-Stop \n\nSystem\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 101(d)(6), State WDBs must assist State Governors \n\nin developing and reviewing statewide policies affecting the \n\ncoordinated provision of services through the State's one-stop delivery \n\nsystem, including policies concerning objective criteria for Local \n\nBoards to assess one-stop centers, guidance for the allocation of one-\n\nstop center infrastructure funds, and policies relating to the roles \n\nand contributions of one-stop partners within the one-stop delivery \n\nsystem.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur \n\nby multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) \n\nby the time required to provide objective criteria and procedures (40 \n\nhours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same \n\ncalculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 40 hours) \n\nand technical staff (2 staff for 120 hours). We summed the labor cost \n\nfor all three personnel categories ($21,469) and multiplied the result \n\nby the number of States (56) to estimate this one-time cost at \n\n$1,202,284, which results in an average annual cost of $120,228.\n\nd. Development of Strategies for Technological Improvements\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 101(d)(7), State WDBs must assist State Governors \n\nin the development of strategies for technological improvements to \n\nfacilitate access and quality of services and activities provided \n\nthrough the one-stop delivery system. These strategies include \n\nimprovements to enhance digital literacy skills, accelerate acquisition \n\nof skills and recognized post-secondary credentials by participants, \n\nstrengthen professional development of providers and workforce \n\nprofessionals, and ensure technology is accessible to individuals with \n\ndisabilities and individuals residing in remote areas.\n\nCosts\n\n\n\n    The Department estimated the labor cost that State WDBs would incur \n\nby multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) \n\nby the time required to develop strategies (20 hours) and the hourly \n\ncompensation rate. We repeated the calculation for the technical staff \n\n(1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the labor cost for both \n\ncategories ($4,094) and multiplied the result by the number of States \n\n(56) to estimate a recurring annual cost of $229,291.\n\ne. State Plan Modification\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3)(B), a Governor may submit a modification \n\nof its Unified State Plan at any time during the 4-year period of the \n\nPlan. Under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3)(A), at a minimum, a State is required \n\nto submit modifications to its Unified State Plan at the end of the \n\nfirst 2-year period of any 4-year plan and also under specific \n\ncircumstances.\n\n    The Department expects that the initial 4-year State Plans would be \n\nhighly speculative. Therefore, we anticipate that some States would \n\nmake substantial modifications to the State Plans based on the \n\nexperiences gained by operating under WIOA for the first two years. \n\nBased on past experience, we do not expect any subsequent modifications \n\nto present a substantial burden.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the labor cost the State WDBs would incur \n\nby multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) \n\nby the time required to review and modify a 4-year State Plan (10 \n\nhours) and the hourly compensation rate. We repeated the calculation \n\nfor the following labor categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member \n\nfor 4 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 10 hours each), and \n\nadministrative staff (1 staff member for 4 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncost for all four personnel categories ($2,411) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of States (56) to estimate this one-time cost as \n\n$135,005, which results in an average annual cost of $13,501.\n\nf. Identification of Regions\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 101(d)(3)(E), State WDBs must assist State \n\nGovernors in the identification of regions, including planning regions, \n\nfor the purposes of WIOA sec. 106(a), and the designation of local \n\nareas under WIOA sec. 106, after consultation with Local Boards and \n\nCEOs. According to WIOA sec. 106(a)(1), identification of regions is \n\npart of the process for developing the State Plan, and is necessary to \n\nreceive an allotment under other provisions of the statute.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated this labor cost for State WDBs by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (2) by \n\nthe time required to identify regions in the State (40 hours) and the \n\n\n\nhourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\nfollowing occupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member \n\nfor 10 hours), technical staff (3 staff for 15 hours each), and \n\nadministrative staff (2 staff for 10 hours each). We summed the labor \n\ncost for all four personnel categories ($9,833) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of States (56) to estimate this cost as $550,633, \n\noccurring in 2016 and 2020 and resulting in an average annual cost of \n\n$110,127.\n\ng. Appoint New Local Workforce Development Board and Appropriate \n\nFirewalls\n\n    The Local WDB is appointed by the CEOs in each local area in \n\naccordance with State criteria established under WIOA sec. 107(b), and \n\nis certified by the Governor every two years, in accordance with WIOA \n\nsec. 107(c)(2). The procedures for sole-source selection of one-stop \n\noperators include requirements about maintaining written documentation \n\nand developing appropriate firewalls and conflict-of-interest policies. \n\nA Local Board can be selected as a one-stop operator through a sole-\n\nsource procurement only if the board establishes sufficient firewalls \n\nand conflict-of-interest policies and procedures that are approved by \n\nthe Governor.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the labor costs incurred by WDBs by \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per WDB (1) by the \n\ntime required to appoint a new Local Board (20 hours) and the hourly \n\ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following \n\noccupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 15 \n\nhours), technical staff (2 staff for 20 hours each), and administrative \n\nstaff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor cost for the \n\nfour occupational categories ($5,597) and multiplied the result by the \n\nnumber of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-time cost as $3,246,289, \n\nwhich results in an average annual cost of $324,629.\n\n    Additionally, the Department estimated the labor cost for WDBs to \n\ndevelop written agreements by multiplying the estimated average number \n\nof managers per WDB (1) by the time required to develop written\n\n[[Page 20820]]\n\nagreements (8 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We repeated the \n\ncalculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 8 hours) \n\nand technical staff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncost for the three occupational categories ($2,411) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-time cost as \n\n$1,398,484, which results in an average annual cost of $139,848.\n\n    In total, these calculations yield a one-time cost of $4,644,773 \n\n\n\nwhich results in an average annual cost of $464,477 for individuals \n\nfrom the local level to appoint new boards and set administrative \n\nfirewalls that avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nh. Career Pathways Development\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 107(d)(5), Local Boards must, with representatives \n\nof secondary and post-secondary education programs, lead efforts to \n\ndevelop and implement career pathways within the local area by aligning \n\nthe employment, training, education, and supportive services that are \n\nneeded by adults and youth, particularly individuals with barriers to \n\nemployment.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the labor cost for WDBs by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per WDB (1) by the \n\ntime required to develop and implement career pathways (80 hours) and \n\nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\nfollowing occupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member \n\nfor 10 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours), and \n\nadministrative staff (1 staff member for 20 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncost for all four personnel categories ($12,186) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this recurring annual \n\ncost of $7,067,938.\n\ni. Development of Proven and Promising Practices\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 107(d)(6), Local Boards must lead efforts in the \n\nlocal area to identify and promote proven and promising strategies and \n\ninitiatives for meeting the needs of employers, workers, and jobseekers \n\n(including individuals with barriers to employment), and identify and \n\ndisseminate information on proven and promising practices carried out \n\nin other local areas for meeting such needs.\n\nCosts\n\n    For State WDBs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) by \n\nthe time required to identify and promote proven strategies (20 hours) \n\nand the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for \n\nthe following occupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff \n\nmember for 10 hours), technical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), \n\nand administrative staff (1 staff member for 15 hours). We summed the \n\nlabor cost for all four personnel categories ($5,143) and multiplied \n\nthe result by the number of States (56) to estimate this recurring \n\nannual cost of $287,985.\n\nj. Technology\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 107(d)(7), Local Boards must develop strategies for \n\n\n\nusing technology to maximize the accessibility and effectiveness of the \n\nlocal workforce development system for employers, workers, and \n\njobseekers by facilitating access to services provided through the one-\n\nstop delivery system, facilitating connections among the intake and \n\ncase-management information systems of the one-stop partner programs, \n\nidentifying strategies for better meeting the needs of individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment, and leveraging resources and capacity within \n\nthe local workforce development system.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the cost for Local WDBs by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per WDB (1) by the \n\ntime required to develop technology strategies (20 hours) and the \n\nhourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\ntechnical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the labor cost \n\nfor these two categories ($4,094) and multiplied the result by the \n\nnumber of WDBs (580) to estimate this recurring annual cost of \n\n$2,374,798.\n\nk. Selection of One-Stop Operators\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(A), consistent with WIOA sec. 121(d), \n\nand with the agreement of the CEO for the local area, Local Boards must \n\ndesignate or certify one-stop operators and may terminate for cause the \n\neligibility of such operators. WIOA sec. 121(d)(2)(A) allows for \n\nselection of a one-stop operator only through a competitive process.\n\nCosts\n\n    The Department estimated the cost for Local WDBs by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per WDB (1) by the \n\ntime required to designate one-stop operators (80 hours) and the hourly \n\ncompensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the following \n\noccupational categories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 40 \n\nhours), technical staff (2 staff for 120 hours each), and \n\nadministrative staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncosts for these four personnel categories ($25,393) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this quadrennial cost of \n\n$6,348,180. Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an average \n\nannual cost of $1,904,454.\n\nl. Coordination With Education Providers\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 107(d)(11), Local Boards must coordinate activities \n\nwith education and training providers in the local area, including \n\nproviders of workforce investment activities, providers of adult \n\neducation and literacy activities under title II of WIOA, certain \n\nproviders of career and technical education, and local agencies \n\nadministering certain plans under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\n\n\nCosts\n\n    For State WDBs, the Department estimated this labor cost by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1) by \n\nthe time required to coordinate activities with local education and \n\ntraining providers (30 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We \n\nperformed the same calculation for the following occupational \n\ncategories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 10 hours), \n\ntechnical staff (1 staff member for 40 hours), and administrative staff \n\n(1 staff member for 10 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four \n\npersonnel categories ($5,706) and multiplied the result by the number \n\nof States (56) to estimate this recurring annual cost of $319,528.\n\nm. Regional Plans\n\n    WIOA sec. 106(c)(2) requires Local Boards and CEOs within a \n\nplanning region to prepare, submit, and obtain approval of a single \n\nregional plan that includes a description of the activities described \n\nin the statute and that incorporates local plans for each of the local \n\nareas in the planning region.\n\nCosts\n\n    For Local WDBs, the Department estimated this cost by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per WDB (2) by the \n\ntime required to prepare, submit, and obtain approval of a single \n\nregional plan (20 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed \n\nthe same calculation for the following occupational categories: legal \n\ncounsel staff (1 staff\n\n[[Page 20821]]\n\nmember for 8 hours), technical staff (2 staff for 40 hours), and \n\nadministrative staff (1 staff member for 8 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncost for the four occupational categories ($8,916) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this cost as $5,171,336, \n\nwhich occurs in 2016 and 2020. This results in an average annual cost \n\nof $1,034,267.\n\nn. Local and Regional Plan Modification\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 108(a), each Local Board, in partnership with the \n\nCEO, must review the local plan every 2 years and submit a modification \n\nas needed, based on significant changes in labor market and economic \n\nconditions and other factors. These factors include changes to local \n\neconomic conditions, changes in the financing available to support WIOA \n\ntitle I and partner-provided WIOA services, changes to the Local Board \n\nstructure, or a need to revise strategies to meet performance goals. If \n\nthe local area is part of a planning region, the Local Board must \n\ncomply with WIOA sec. 106(c) in the preparation and submission of a \n\nregional plan.\n\n\n\nCosts\n\n    For Local WDBs, the Department estimated the local plan \n\nmodification cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \n\nmanagers per WDB (1) by the time required to review and modify the 4-\n\nyear plan (10 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the \n\nsame calculation for the following occupational categories: Legal \n\ncounsel staff (1 staff member for 4 hours), technical staff (2 staff \n\nfor 10 hours), and administrative staff (1 staff member for 4 hours). \n\nWe summed the labor cost for all four personnel categories ($2,411) and \n\nmultiplied the result by the number of WDBs (580) to estimate this one-\n\ntime cost of $1,398,269, occurring in 2018. Over the 10-year period, \n\nthis calculation yields an average annual cost of $139,827.\n\n    Similarly, the Department estimated the regional plan modification \n\ncost for Local WDBs by first multiplying the estimated average number \n\nof managers per regional board (2) by the time required to review and \n\nmodify the 4-year plan (10 hours) and the hourly compensation rate. We \n\nperformed the same calculation for the following occupational \n\ncategories: legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 4 hours), technical \n\nstaff (2 staff for 20 hours each), and administrative staff (1 staff \n\nmember for 5 hours). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel \n\ncategories ($4,486) and multiplied the result by the number of regional \n\nboards (580) to estimate a cost of $1,345,766, occurring once every \n\nfour years. Over the 10-year period, this calculation yields an average \n\nannual cost of $269,153.\n\n    The sum of these costs yields a 10-year cost of $4,089,800, which \n\nresults in an average annual cost of $408,980 for individuals from the \n\nLocal WDBs to review and modify the 4-year plan.\n\no. Improved Information About Potential Training Program Providers\n\n    WIOA sec. 116 establishes performance accountability measures and \n\nperformance reporting requirements to assess the effectiveness of \n\nStates and local areas in achieving positive outcomes for individuals \n\nserved by the core programs. The performance accountability measures \n\nwill provide workers with better information about potential training \n\nprogram providers and enable them to make more informed choices about \n\nprograms to pursue. The information analyzed and published by the \n\nboards about local labor markets also will assist trainees and \n\nproviders in targeting their efforts and developing reasonable \n\nexpectations about outcomes.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this \n\nlabor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \n\n\n\nmanagers per State (1) by the time required to provide additional \n\ninformation about eligible training program providers (32 hours) and \n\nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\ntechnical staff (2 staff for 40 hours each) and administrative staff (1 \n\nstaff member for 80 hours). We summed the labor cost for all three \n\npersonnel categories ($9,854) and multiplied the result by the number \n\nof States (56) to estimate this recurring annual cost of $551,826.\n\np. Sanctions on Under-Performing States\n\n    Section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA requires the Department to assess a \n\nsanction if ``a State fails to submit a report under subsection (d) for \n\nany program year.'' Three reports are required under WIOA sec. 116(d): \n\nThe State annual performance reports, the local area performance \n\nreports, and the ETP performance reports. Of these, only the State \n\nannual performance reports must be submitted by the State to the \n\nSecretary of Labor. Section 116(f)(1) of WIOA requires that sanctions \n\nfor performance failure be based on the primary indicators of \n\nperformance.\n\n    The sanctions will alter Federal transfer payments.\\18\\ Transfer \n\npayments, as defined by OMB Circular A-4, are payments from one group \n\nto another that do not affect total resources available to society. The \n\nDepartment requests comment and data that would allow for estimation of \n\nthe transfer that would result from the sanctions provision.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ The Department transfers funds to each State through a \n\nformal grant process. States may set aside a portion of these funds \n\nfor discretionary use under WIOA. If a State were sanctioned, we \n\nwould de-obligate the funds comprising the penalty from the State's \n\nset-aside, thereby reducing funding without incurring additional \n\ncosts.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated the costs resulting \n\nfrom labor requirements by first multiplying the estimated average \n\nnumber of managers per State (1), the time required to evaluate State \n\nperformance (40 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We performed \n\nthe same calculation for technical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours) \n\nand administrative staff (1 staff member for 40 hours). We summed the \n\nlabor cost for all three personnel categories ($9,302) and multiplied \n\nthe result by the number of States (56) to estimate a recurring annual \n\ntransfer of $520,939.\n\n    The Department estimates that 56 States will be impacted by this \n\n\n\nannual cost because we have determined that 56 States will calculate, \n\nannually, the performance levels of each State's core programs. Each \n\nState will do this on an annual basis in order to determine if the \n\nState is subject to sanctions, as discussed in proposed Sec.  677.190 \n\nof this part, by comparing those levels against the negotiated levels \n\nof performance that the State has provided for in the State Plan.\n\nq. Colocation of Wagner-Peyser Services\n\n    WIOA sec. 121(e)(3) requires colocation of Wagner-Peyser Employment \n\nService offices and one-stop centers established under title I of WIOA. \n\nColocation is intended to improve service delivery, avoid duplication \n\nof services, and enhance coordination of services, including location \n\nof staff to ensure access to services in underserved areas.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this \n\nlabor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \n\nmanagers per State (10), the time required to collocate Wagner-Peyser \n\nServices (40 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We\n\n[[Page 20822]]\n\nperformed the same calculation for the following occupational \n\ncategories: legal counsel staff (10 staff for 10 hours each), technical \n\nstaff (20 staff at 25 hours each), and administrative staff (10 staff \n\nfor 5 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all four personnel \n\ncategories ($69,415) and multiplied the result by the number of States \n\nwithout collocated Wagner-Peyser Services (10) to estimate a one-time \n\ncost of $694,152, which results in an annual cost of $69,415.\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated consultant costs by \n\nmultiplying the estimated consultant costs ($10,000) by the number of \n\nStates without collocated Wagner-Peyser Services (10). This calculation \n\nyields an estimated one-time cost of $100,000, resulting in an average \n\nannual cost of $10,000.\n\n    At the local level, the Department estimated labor costs by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers for all local \n\nentities within a State (100), the time required to collocate Wagner-\n\nPeyser Services (40 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We \n\nperformed the same calculation for the technical staff (200 staff for \n\n25 hours each) and administrative staff (100 staff for 5 hours each). \n\nWe summed the labor cost for all three personnel categories ($631,098) \n\nand multiplied the result by the number of local areas without \n\ncollocated Wagner-Peyser offices and one-stops (100) to estimate a one-\n\ntime cost of $63,109,800, resulting in an annual cost of $6,310,980.\n\n    The sum of these costs yields a one-time cost of $63,903,952, which \n\nresults in an average annual cost of $6,390,395 for individuals from \n\n\n\nthe State and local levels to collocate Wagner-Peyser Services.\n\nr. Partners Required To Pay Their Share for Proportionate Use of One-\n\nstop Delivery System\n\n    An important goal under both the local and State funding mechanisms \n\nis to ensure that each one-stop partner contributes its proportional \n\nshare to the funding of one-stop infrastructure costs, consistent with \n\nFederal cost principles. Under WIOA sec. 121(h), in general, State \n\nGovernors must ensure that costs are appropriately shared by one-stop \n\npartners. Contributions must be based on proportional share of use and \n\nall funds must be spent solely for allowable purposes in a manner \n\nconsistent with the applicable authorizing statute and all other \n\napplicable legal requirements, including Federal cost principles.\n\n    This provision will alter Federal transfer payments, and the \n\nDepartment requests comment and data that would allow for estimation of \n\nthis rule-induced transfer.\\19\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ The Department distributes funds through a combination of \n\nmulti-step formula distributions, Title III (Wagner-Peyser) \n\ndistribution, and national grant competitions that award funds \n\ndirectly to partners. The Department supplies funding to cover \n\npayments for partners proportionate to their use of one-stop \n\ndelivery systems, although partners may instead opt to use pay-in-\n\nkind or other leveraged funds.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated costs related to this \n\nprovision (e.g., the cost of developing memoranda of understanding) by \n\nfirst multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State \n\n(50), the time required for States to comply with payment requirements \n\nproportional to use of one-stop delivery systems (40 hours), and the \n\nhourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\nfollowing occupational categories: Legal counsel staff (50 staff for 1 \n\nhour each), technical staff (100 staff for 40 hours each), and \n\nadministrative staff (50 staff for 5 hours each). We summed these \n\nproducts for all four personnel categories ($419,560) and multiplied \n\nthe result by the number of States that need to pay their proportional \n\nshare (54) to estimate transfer of $22,656,251 occurring once every \n\nthree years, resulting in an average annual transfer of $6,796,875.\n\ns. Establishing Training Provider Eligibility Procedures, Including \n\nAdding Registered Apprenticeship\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 122, the Governor, after consultation with the \n\nState WDB, must establish criteria, information requirements, and \n\n\n\nprocedures regarding the eligibility of providers of training services \n\nto receive funds under WIOA for the provision of training services in \n\nlocal areas in the State. Training providers, including those operating \n\nunder the individual training account exceptions, must qualify as ETPs, \n\nexcept for those engaged in on-the-job and customized training (for \n\nwhich the Governor should establish qualifying procedures). Registered \n\napprenticeship programs are included in the ETPL, provided the program \n\nremains eligible. Only providers that the State determines to be \n\neligible under WIOA sec. 122 may receive training funds under WIOA \n\ntitle I-B.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated this cost by first \n\nmultiplying the estimated average number of managers per State (1), the \n\ntime needed to establish procedures for training provider eligibility \n\n(40 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We performed the same \n\ncalculation for the legal counsel staff (1 staff member for 20 hours) \n\nand technical staff (1 staff member for 80 hours). We summed the labor \n\ncost for all three personnel categories ($9,450) and multiplied the \n\nresult by the number of States that need to pay their proportional \n\nshare (56) to estimate this one-time cost of $529,202, resulting in an \n\nannual cost of $52,920.\n\nt. Determining Eligibility of New and Previously Eligible Providers\n\n    Under the requirements of WIOA sec. 122, the procedures for \n\ndetermining eligibility of providers are established by the Governor, \n\nafter consultation with the State WDB and include application and \n\nrenewal procedures, eligibility criteria, and information requirements.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level for DOL programs, the Department estimated this \n\nlabor cost by first multiplying the estimated average number of \n\nmanagers per State (1), the time needed to determine provider \n\neligibility (40 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We performed \n\nthe same calculation for the technical staff (2 staff for 110 hours \n\neach) and administrative staff (2 staff for 50 hours each). We summed \n\nthe labor cost for all three personnel categories ($20,386) and \n\nmultiplied the result by the number of States (56) to estimate a one-\n\ntime cost of $1,141,628, resulting in an annual cost of $114,163.\n\nu. Biennial Review of Eligibility\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 122(c)(2), training provider eligibility criteria \n\nestablished under this provision must include procedures for biennial \n\nreview and renewal of eligibility for providers of training services.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated this labor cost by \n\nfirst multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State \n\n\n\n(1), the time needed to perform the eligibility review (30 hours), and \n\nthe hourly compensation rate. We performed the same calculation for the \n\ntechnical staff (2 staff for 60 hours each) and administrative staff (2 \n\nstaff for 30 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all three \n\npersonnel categories ($11,846) and multiplied the result by the number \n\nof States (56) to estimate cost of $663,395 that occurs four times over \n\nthe 10-year analysis period, that is, an annual cost of $265,358.\n\n[[Page 20823]]\n\nv. Disseminating the Training Provider List With Accompanying \n\nInformation\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 122(d), the Governor must ensure preparation of an \n\nappropriate list of providers determined to be eligible under this \n\nsection to offer a program in the State (and, as appropriate, in a \n\nlocal area), accompanied by information identifying the recognized \n\npost-secondary credential offered by the provider and other appropriate \n\ninformation. The list must be provided to the Local Boards in the \n\nState, and made available to such participants and to members of the \n\npublic through the one-stop delivery system in the State.\n\nCosts\n\n    At the State level, the Department estimated this labor cost by \n\nfirst multiplying the estimated average number of managers per State \n\n(1), the time needed to disseminate the ETPL with accompanying \n\ninformation (30 hours), and the hourly compensation rate. We performed \n\nthe same calculation for the following occupational categories: \n\nTechnical staff (2 staff for 80 hours each), administrative staff (2 \n\nstaff for 45 hours), and IT reprogramming (database development) staff \n\n(2 staff for 125 hours each). We summed the labor cost for all four \n\npersonnel categories ($30,449) and multiplied the result by the number \n\nof States (56) to estimate a one-time cost of $1,705,125, resulting in \n\nan annual cost of $170,513.\n\nw. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Housing\n\n    While bringing the Department's housing standards at 20 CFR 654 \n\n(ETA Standards) under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n\n(OSHA) provisions set forth in 29 CFR 1910.142 will not completely \n\nremedy many of the inadequate housing conditions common among \n\nagricultural housing facilities, the Department anticipates the change \n\nwill: (1) Update the housing standards as the OSHA provisions conform \n\nto slightly more modern standards; (2) streamline the compliance \n\nprocess for employers who will only need to look to one place to comply \n\nwith housing standards; and (3) ease the administrative burden on State \n\n\n\nand Federal employees who conduct housing inspections as they will only \n\nneed to learn and rely upon one set of housing standards.\n\n    In estimating the impact of the proposed changes to 20 CFR 654, the \n\nDepartment consulted various agencies within DOL to uncover pertinent \n\ndata. Such data includes the number of H-2A employers approved through \n\nthe Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The Department \n\nbelieves that reviewing H-2A employer data is useful as it represents a \n\nsubset of population (and, therefore, a minimum) of the total number of \n\nemployers that may be offering housing to agricultural workers and who \n\nmay be affected by the proposed changes. The Department estimates that \n\nof the approximately 6,400 \\20\\ employers nationally who hire foreign \n\nworkers under the H-2A program and who provide housing, the majority \n\nwill not be affected by the proposed changes because it estimates that, \n\nnationally, OSHA housing standards apply more frequently than the ETA \n\nStandards in the context of housing investigations. Specifically, the \n\nDepartment estimates that every region, except the Northeast and \n\nPacific Northwest, has agricultural housing that predominantly falls \n\nunder the OSHA standards. However, the situation will vary from State \n\nto State. For example, Colorado reported that approximately 84 percent \n\nof the agricultural housing inspected in the State from July 1, 2014 to \n\nJanuary 29, 2015 falls under the ETA standards. Wyoming reported that \n\n64 percent of the housing inspections over the course of a year fell \n\nunder ETA standards.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ This number is derived from OFLC data on employers that \n\nhave submitted H-2A applications. The Department extrapolated the \n\nnumber of unique employers from the full list of applications to \n\navoid duplication and to identify the fewest employers that may be \n\nimpacted by these proposed changes.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    However, the housing data currently available to DOL is limited. \n\nThe Department collects agricultural housing information as it pertains \n\nto employers' compliance with the appropriate standards. The Department \n\ndoes not collect or track the number of agricultural housing units \n\nnationally that fall under the ETA versus the OSHA standards. To better \n\nunderstand the impact of the proposed regulations, the Department would \n\nlike to know: (1) The approximate number of agricultural housing units \n\n\n\nin the United States provided by agricultural employers for \n\nfarmworkers; (2) the approximate percentage of the total farmworker \n\nhousing units that currently fall under the ETA Standards set forth in \n\n20 CFR 654; and (3) the estimated cost of bringing those housing units \n\nfrom the ETA Standards into compliance with the OSHA Standards. The \n\nDepartment would appreciate public feedback on the aforementioned data \n\nelements.\n\n    Specifically, it would be helpful for DOL's analysis if: (1) There \n\nare State Workforce Agencies or States that would share any data on the \n\ntotal number of employer-provided agricultural housing units in the \n\nState and the percentage of those that are subject to the ETA \n\nStandards; and (2) agricultural employers would furnish estimated costs \n\nfor bringing their farmworker housing units from ETA to OSHA Standards. \n\nThe Department appreciates any such information that could assist in \n\nthe development of the overall impact analysis.\n\n5. Summary of Analysis\n\n    Exhibit 3 summarizes the annual and total costs of the proposed \n\nrule. It summarizes the total 10-year total costs and the average \n\nannualized costs for each provision of the proposed rule. The exhibit \n\nalso presents high-level benefits resulting from full WIOA \n\nimplementation for each provision. These qualitative forecasts are \n\npredicated on program experience and are outcomes for which data will \n\nonly become available after implementation. The Department estimates \n\nthe average annual cost of the proposed rule over the 10-year period of \n\nanalysis at $38.4 million. The largest contributor to this cost is the \n\nprovision related to the development and improvement of the workforce \n\ndevelopment system, which amounts to an estimated $9.2 million per \n\nyear. The next largest cost results from career pathways development at \n\n$7.1 million per year, followed by the cost of partners required to pay \n\ntheir share for proportionate use of one-stop delivery system at an \n\nestimated $6.8 million per year.\n\n[[Page 20824]]\n\n                               Exhibit 3--Costs of the Proposed Rule by Provision\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                        Total 10-year    Average annual\n\n              Provision                     cost              cost          Percent of      Qualitative benefit\n\n                                       (undiscounted)    (undiscounted)     total cost          highlights\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) New State Workforce Development           $313,435           $31,343            0.08  Policy implementation\n\n Board Membership Requirements.                                                            efficiencies from\n\n                                                                                           reduced size and\n\n\n\n                                                                                           maneuverability.\n\n(b) Development and Continuous              92,078,720         9,207,872           23.96  Mission clarification\n\n Improvement of the Workforce                                                              and ongoing\n\n Development System.                                                                       commitment should\n\n                                                                                           foster future\n\n                                                                                           envisioned benefits\n\n                                                                                           continuing to accrue.\n\n(c) Development of Statewide                 1,202,284           120,228            0.31  Mission clarification\n\n Policies Affecting the State's One-                                                       for State WDBs and\n\n stop System.                                                                              overall system\n\n                                                                                           building capacity.\n\n(d) Development of Strategies for            2,292,909           229,291            0.60  Recognition of the\n\n Technological Improvements.                                                               efficiencies\n\n                                                                                           generated by\n\n                                                                                           technology and\n\n                                                                                           enhanced management\n\n                                                                                           capabilities\n\n                                                                                           especially utilizing\n\n                                                                                           outcome data.\n\n(e) State Plan Modification.........           135,005            13,501            0.04  More efficient use of\n\n                                                                                           public resources;\n\n                                                                                           enhanced customer\n\n                                                                                           service;

Thus, the Department is unable to provide monetary estimates of \n\nseveral important benefits to society, including the increased \n\nemployment opportunities for unemployed or under-employed U.S. workers, \n\nbenefits of colocation of Wagner-Peyser Services, enhanced ETP process, \n\nregional planning, and evaluation of State programs. In support of a \n\nState's strategic plan and goals, State-conducted evaluation and \n\nresearch of programs would enable each State to test various \n\ninterventions geared toward State conditions and opportunities. Results \n\nfrom such evaluation and research, if used by States, could improve \n\nservice quality and effectiveness and, thus, potentially lead to higher \n\nemployment rates and earnings among participants. Implementing various \n\ninnovations that have been tested and found effective could also lead \n\nto lower unit costs and increased numbers of individuals served within \n\na State. Sharing the findings nationally could lead to new service or \n\nmanagement practices that other States could adopt to improve \n\nparticipant results, lower unit costs, or increase the number served.\n\n    The Department invites comments regarding possible data sources or \n\nmethodologies for estimating these benefits. In addition, the \n\nDepartment invites comments regarding other benefits that might arise \n\nfrom the proposed rule and how these benefits could be estimated.\n\n    The Department provides a qualitative description of the \n\nanticipated WIOA benefits below. These qualitative forecasts are \n\npredicated on program experience and are outcomes for which data will \n\nonly become available after implementation. Although these studies are \n\nlargely based on programs and their existing requirements under WIA, we \n\nbelieve that they capture the essence of the societal benefits that can \n\nbe expected from this proposed rule.\n\n    Training's impact on placement. A recent study found that flexible \n\nand innovative training which is closely related to a real and in-\n\ndemand occupation is associated with better labor market outcomes for \n\ntraining participants. Youth disconnected from work and school can \n\nbenefit from comprehensive and integrated models of training that \n\ncombine education, occupational skills, and support services.\\21\\ \n\nHowever, the study noted that evidence for effective employment and \n\ntraining-related programs for youth is less extensive than for adults, \n\nand that there are fewer positive findings from evaluations.\\22\\ The \n\nWIA youth program remains largely untested.\\23\\ One study found that \n\n\n\nWIA training services increase placement rates by 4.4 percent among \n\nadults and by 5.9 percent among dislocated workers,\\24\\ while another \n\nstudy concluded that placement rates are 3 to 5 percent higher among \n\nall training recipients.\\25\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ Department of Labor et al. ``What Works In Job Training: A \n\nSynthesis of the Evidence.''

Before enactment of WIA, Job Training \n\nPartnership Act services had a modest but statistically significant \n\nimpact on the earnings of adult participants.\\30\\ WIA training \n\nincreased participants' quarterly earnings by $660; these impacts \n\npersisted beyond two years and were largest among women.\\31\\ WIA adult \n\nprogram participants who received core services (e.g. skill assessment, \n\nlabor market information) or intensive services (e.g. specialized \n\nassessments, counseling) earned up to $200 more per quarter than non-\n\nWIA participants. Participants who received training services in \n\naddition to core and intensive services initially earned less but \n\ncaught up within 10 quarters with the earnings of participants who only \n\nreceived core or intensive services; marginal benefits of training \n\ncould exceed $400 per quarter. Earnings progressions were similar for \n\nWIA adult program participants and users of the\n\n[[Page 20827]]\n\nlabor exchange only.\\32\\ WIA training services also improved \n\nparticipants' long-term wage rates, doubling earnings after 10 quarters \n\nover those not receiving training services.\\33\\ However, WIA \n\nparticipants who did not receive training earned $550 to $700 more in \n\nthe first quarter after placement. The study also noted that \n\nindividuals who did not receive training received effective short-term \n\ncounseling that enabled them to gain an immediate advantage in the \n\nlabor market.\\34\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ Barnow, Burt, and Daniel Gubits. ``Review of Recent Pilot, \n\nDemonstration, Research, and Evaluation Initiatives to Assist in the \n\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/YO%20Impact%20and%20Synthesis%20Report.pdf\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/research/keyword.cfm?fuseaction=dsp_resultDetails&pub_id=2516&mp=y\n\n\nImplementation of Programs under the Workforce Investment Act.'' \n\nBaltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University, 2003.

The accountability measures would \n\nprovide workers with higher-quality information about potential \n\ntraining program providers and enable them to make better informed \n\nchoices about which programs to pursue. The information analyzed and \n\npublished by the WDBs about local labor markets also would help \n\ntrainees and providers target their efforts and develop reasonable \n\nexpectations about outcomes.\n\n    Consumers of educational services, including disadvantaged and \n\ndisplaced workers, require reliable information on the value of \n\ndifferent training options to make informed choices. Displaced workers \n\ntend to be farther removed from schooling and lack information about \n\navailable courses and the fields with the highest financial return.\\38\\ \n\nGiven these information gaps and financial pressures, it is important \n\nthat displaced workers learn of the returns to various training \n\nplans.\\39\\ Still, one study determined that the cost-effectiveness of \n\nWIA job training for disadvantaged workers is ``modestly positive'' due \n\nperhaps to the limited sample of States on which the research was \n\nbased.\\40\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/Net%20Impact%20Estimates%20for%20Services%20Provided%20through%20the%20Workforce%20Investment%20Act-%20Final%20Report.pdf\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/Net%20Impact%20Estimates%20for%20Services%20Provided%20through%20the%20Workforce%20Investment%20Act-%20Final%20Report.pdf\n\n\n    \\38\\ Greenstone, Michael, and Adam Looney. ``Building America's \n\nJob Skills with Effective Workforce Programs: A Training Strategy to \n\nRaise Wages and Increase Work Opportunities.''

WIOA requires the Department \n\nto place sanctions on States that under-perform for two consecutive \n\nyears. The sanction would be five percent of set-aside funding.

Two-thirds of local workforce investment \n\nareas have indicated that the possibility of sanctions influenced their \n\nprograms, whereas only slightly more than half indicated that \n\nincentives had an influence.\\41\\ Further, several Job Centers consider \n\nstudent placement outcomes in staff performance evaluations and pay for \n\nvocational instructors.\\42\\ This practice has significantly increased \n\nstaff interest in successful student placement following program \n\ncompletion.\\43\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\41\\ Dunham, Kate, Melissa Mack, Jeff Salzman, and Andrew \n\nWiegand. ``Evaluation of the WIA Performance Measurement System: \n\nSurvey Report.''

A study of individuals with disabilities \n\nenrolled in training for a broad array of occupations (including \n\nwastewater treatment, auto body repair, meat cutter/wrapper, clerical \n\nsupport staff, surgical tools technician, and veterinary assistant) \n\nfound that the mean hourly wage and hours worked per quarter for \n\nprogram graduates were higher than for individuals who did not complete \n\nthe program.\n\n    In conclusion, after a review of the quantitative and qualitative \n\nanalysis of the impacts of this NPRM, the Department has determined \n\nthat the societal benefits justify the anticipated costs.\n\nB. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    The purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 \n\nU.S.C. 3501 et seq., include minimizing the paperwork burden on \n\naffected entities. The PRA requires certain actions before an agency \n\ncan adopt or revise a collection of information, including publishing \n\nfor public comment a summary of the collection of information and a \n\nbrief description of the need for and proposed use of the information.\n\n    As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent \n\nburden, the Department conducts a preclearance consultation program to \n\nprovide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to \n\ncomment on proposed and continuing collections of information in \n\naccordance with the PRA. See 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A). This activity \n\nhelps to ensure that the public understands the Department's collection \n\ninstructions, respondents can provide the requested data in the desired \n\nformat, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, \n\ncollection instruments are clearly understood, and the Department can \n\nproperly assess the impact of collection requirements on respondents. \n\nhttp://wdr.doleta.gov/research/keyword.cfm?fuseaction=dsp_puListingDetails&pub_id=2293&mp=y&start=12\n\n\nFurthermore, the PRA requires all Federal agencies to analyze proposed \n\nregulations for potential time burdens on the regulated community \n\ncreated by provisions in the proposed regulations, which require the \n\nsubmission of information. The information collection requirements must \n\nalso be submitted to the OMB for approval.\n\n    The Department notes that a Federal agency may not conduct or \n\nsponsor a collection of information unless it is approved by the OMB \n\nunder the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB control number. The \n\npublic is also not required to respond to a collection of information \n\nunless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. In addition, \n\nnotwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person will be subject \n\nto penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if \n\nthe collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB \n\ncontrol number (44 U.S.C. 3512).\n\n    The information collections in this rule are summarized as follows. \n\n(Detailed information about the information collections identified in \n\nthis summary is available in the section-\n\n[[Page 20829]]\n\nby-section discussion of this NPRM, Section IV.)

Consistent with \n\nexisting rules, the proposed rule would require the Department to \n\nprovide guidelines for maintaining records for each student during \n\nenrollment and for disposition of records after separation. As a \n\nresult, the Department does not anticipate any changes in the \n\ninformation collection.\n\n    Affected Public: Private sector.\n\n    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit (WIOA \n\nsec. 147).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 97 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 184,628 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 38,610 hours (no change as a \n\n\n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    NPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under \n\nthis Control Number: Sec.  686.945.\n\n    Title of Collection: Placement Verification and Follow-up of Job \n\nCorps Participants.\n\n    OMB Control Number: 1205-0426.\n\n    Description: Job Corps' performance management system, which \n\nincludes the OMS, is a well-established measurement system the Job \n\nCorps community has been using to track performance of centers and \n\nservice providers for many years. It will be updated to reflect the new \n\nrequirements of WIOA, including the new primary indicators of \n\nperformance, but may also include breakouts of data that will help \n\nprogram managers target interventions in order to achieve the primary \n\nindicators. As a result, additional information would be collected from \n\nrespondents.\n\n    Affected Public: Individuals or households and private sector.\n\n    Obligation to Respond: Voluntary.\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 88,060 (34,737 \n\nadditional respondents resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 88,060 (34,737 \n\nadditional responses resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 19,153 hours (7,713 additional \n\nhours resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    NPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under \n\nthis Control Number: Sec.  686.945, Sec.  686.955, Sec.  686.1000, \n\nSec.  686.1010, Sec.  686.1020, Sec.  686.1030, and Sec.  686.1040.\n\n    Title of Collection: National Emergency Grant Assistance--\n\nApplication and Reporting Procedures.\n\n    OMB Control Number: 1205-0439.\n\n    Description: Specified activities must be conducted before an \n\napplication for a National Dislocated Worker Grant (NDWG) is submitted. \n\nThe proposed rule requires that a project implementation plan, which is \n\nalready required for all NEGs under WIA, be submitted post-NDWG award. \n\nHowever, currently this requirement is included only in guidance; this \n\nNPRM proposes to add this requirement to the regulations. The project \n\nimplementation plan includes more detailed information about project \n\n\n\noperations than is required for the initial application. This \n\ninformation allows the Department to provide grantees with targeted \n\ntechnical assistance, and to exercise appropriate oversight and \n\nmonitoring over the NDWG award.\n\n    Affected Public: State, local, and tribal governments.\n\n    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit (WIOA \n\nsec. 170).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 159 (9 additional \n\nrespondents resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 1,574 (89 additional \n\nresponses resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 1,066 hours (60 additional \n\nhours resulting from this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    NPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under \n\nthis Control Number: Sec.  687.150.\n\n    Title of Collection: Employment and Training Administration \n\nFinancial Report Form 9130.\n\n    OMB Control Number: 1205-0461.\n\n    Description: Existing rules require grantees to submit quarterly \n\nfinancial reports. The proposed rule reflects OMB's Uniform Guidance, \n\nwhich standardizes the administrative, cost, and audit provisions for \n\nall grants and cooperative agreements provided under part 683. The \n\nproposed rule would establish consistent and uniform guidance that \n\nincreases accountability and transparency, promotes fiscal integrity, \n\nand reduces duplication in the quarterly financial reports.\n\n    Affected Public: State, local, and tribal governments, and private \n\nsector.\n\n    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit (2 \n\nCFR 200.327).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 848 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 6,784 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 5,088 hours (1,696 additional \n\nhours as a result of this rulemaking).\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0 (no change as a \n\nresult of this rulemaking).\n\n    NPRM Sections Containing Information Collections Approved Under \n\nthis Control Number: Sec.  681.430, Sec.  683.150, Sec.  683.200, Sec.  \n\n683.300, Sec.  683.730, Sec.  683.740, Sec.  683.750.\n\n\n\n    Interested parties may obtain a copy free of charge of one or more \n\nof the information collection requests submitted to the OMB on the \n\nreginfo.gov Web site at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain. From \n\nthe Information Collection Review tab, select Information Collection \n\nReview. Then select Department of Labor from the Currently Under Review \n\ndropdown menu, and look up the Control Number. A free copy of the \n\nrequests may also be obtained by contacting the person named in the \n\nADDRESSES section of this preamble.\n\n[[Page 20831]]\n\n    As noted in the ADDRESSES section of this NPRM, interested parties \n\nmay send comments about the information collections to the Department \n\nthroughout the 60-day comment period and/or to the OMB within 30 days \n\nof publication of this notice in the Federal Register. In order to help \n\nensure appropriate consideration, comments should mention the \n\napplicable OMB Control Number(s). The Department and OMB are \n\nparticularly interested in comments that:\n\n     Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is \n\nnecessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, \n\nincluding whether the information will have practical utility;\n\n     Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the \n\nburden of the proposed collection of information, including the \n\nvalidity of the methodology and assumptions used;\n\n     Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the \n\ninformation to be collected; and\n\n     Minimize the burden of the collection of information on \n\nthose who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate \n\nautomated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection \n\ntechniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting \n\nelectronic submission of responses.\n\n    The Department notes that in order to meet WIOA requirements, \n\nseveral information collections mentioned in this NPRM need to be in \n\nplace prior to the final rule taking effect. The Department will follow \n\nPRA requirements in clearing the collections (emergency procedures, as \n\nappropriate), including providing appropriate public engagement and \n\ntaking into account the comments received as part of this rulemaking.\n\nC. Executive Order 13132: Federalism\n\n    E.O. 13132 requires Federal agencies to ensure that the principles \n\nof Federalism established by the Framers of our Constitution guide the \n\nexecutive departments and agencies in the formulation and \n\nimplementation of policies and to further the policies of the Unfunded \n\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain\n\n\nMandates Reform Act. Further, agencies shall strictly adhere to \n\nconstitutional principles. Agencies shall closely examine the \n\nconstitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would \n\nlimit the policy-making discretion of the States and they shall \n\ncarefully assess the necessity for any such action. To the extent \n\npracticable, State and local officials shall be consulted before any \n\nsuch action is implemented. Section 3(b) of the Executive Order further \n\nprovides that Federal agencies must implement regulations that have a \n\nsubstantial direct effect only if statutory authority permits the \n\nregulation and it is of national significance. The Department has \n\nreviewed the WIOA NPRM in light of these requirements and have \n\ndetermined that, with the enactment of WIOA and its clear requirement \n\nto publish national implementing regulations, that E.O. sec. 3(b) has \n\nbeen fully reviewed and its requirement satisfied.\n\n    Accordingly, the Department has reviewed this WIOA-required NPRM \n\nand has determined that the proposed rulemaking has no Federalism \n\nimplications. The proposed rule, as noted above, has no substantial \n\ndirect effects on States, on the relationships between the States, or \n\non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \n\nlevels of Government as described by E.O. 13132. Therefore, the \n\nDepartment has determined that this proposed rule does not have a \n\nsufficient Federalism implication to warrant the preparation of a \n\nsummary impact statement.\n\nD. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This Act directs agencies to assess the effects of Federal \n\nregulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments, and the \n\nprivate sector. A Federal mandate is any provision in a regulation that \n\nimposes an enforceable duty upon State, local, or tribal governments, \n\nor imposes a duty on the private sector that is not voluntary.\n\n    The WIOA contains specific language supporting employment and \n\ntraining activities for Indian, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian \n\nindividuals. These program requirements are supported, as is the WIOA \n\nworkforce development system generally, by Federal formula grant funds \n\nand accordingly are not considered unfunded mandates. Similarly, \n\nmigrant and seasonal farmworker activities are authorized and funded \n\nunder the WIOA program as is currently done under the WIA program. The \n\nStates are mandated to perform certain activities for the Federal \n\nGovernment under the WIOA program and will be reimbursed (grant \n\nfunding) for the resources required to perform those responsibilities. \n\nThe same process and grant relationship exists between States and Local \n\nWDBs under the WIA program and shall continue under the WIOA program \n\nand as identified in this NPRM.\n\n\n\n    WIOA contains language establishing procedures regarding the \n\neligibility of training providers to receive funds under the WIOA \n\nprogram. It also contains clear State information collection \n\nrequirements for training entities, for example, submission of \n\nappropriate, accurate, and timely information. A decision by a private \n\ntraining entity to participate as a provider under the WIOA program is \n\npurely voluntary and therefore information collection burdens do not \n\nimpose a duty on the private sector that is not voluntarily assumed.\n\n    The Department's following consideration of these factors has \n\ndetermined that this proposed rule contains no unfunded Federal \n\nmandates, which are defined in 2 U.S.C. 658(6) to include either a \n\n``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' or a ``Federal private sector \n\nmandate.''\n\nE. Plain Language\n\n    The Department drafted this WIOA NPRM in plain language.\n\nF. Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families\n\n    Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations \n\nAct, enacted as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n\nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. \n\n2681) requires the assessment of the impact of this proposed rule on \n\nfamily well-being. A rule that is determined to have a negative effect \n\non families must be supported with an adequate rationale. The \n\nDepartment has assessed this proposed rule in light of this requirement \n\nand determined that the WIOA NPRM would not have a negative effect on \n\nfamilies.\n\nG. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 603, requires \n\nagencies to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis to determine \n\nwhether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a \n\nsubstantial number of small entities. Section 605 of the RFA allows an \n\nagency to certify a rule in lieu of preparing an analysis if the \n\nregulation is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a \n\nsubstantial number of small entities. Further, under the Small Business \n\nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C 801 (SBREFA), an \n\nagency is required to produce compliance guidance for small entities if \n\nthe rule has a significant economic impact.\n\n    The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as \n\none that is ``independently owned and operated and which is not \n\ndominant in its field of operation.'' The definition of small business \n\n\n\nvaries from industry to\n\n[[Page 20832]]\n\nindustry to the extent necessary to reflect industry size differences \n\nproperly. An agency must either use the SBA definition for a small \n\nentity or establish an alternative definition, in this instance, for \n\nthe workforce industry. The Department has adopted the SBA definition \n\nfor the purposes of this certification.\n\n    The Department has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, \n\nunder the RFA at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), and proposes to certify that this \n\nrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n\nnumber of small entities. This finding is supported, in large measure, \n\nby the fact that small entities are already receiving financial \n\nassistance under the WIA program and will likely continue to do so \n\nunder the WIOA program as articulated in this NPRM.\n\nAffected Small Entities\n\n    The proposed rule can be expected to impact small one-stop center \n\noperators. One-stop operators can be a single entity (public, private, \n\nor nonprofit) or a consortium of entities. The types of entities that \n\nmight be a one-stop operator include: (1) An institution of higher \n\neducation; (2) an employment service State agency established under the \n\nWagner-Peyser Act; (3) a community-based organization, nonprofit \n\norganization, or workforce intermediary; (4) a private for-profit \n\nentity; (5) a government agency; (6) a Local Board, with the approval \n\nof the local CEO and the Governor; or (7) another interested \n\norganization or entity that can carry out the duties of the one-stop \n\noperator. Examples include a local chamber of commerce or other \n\nbusiness organization, or a labor organization.\n\nImpact on Small Entities\n\n    The Department indicates that transfer payments are a significant \n\naspect of this analysis in that the majority of WIOA program cost \n\nburdens on State and Local WDBs will be fully financed through Federal \n\ntransfer payments to States. We have highlighted costs that are new to \n\nWIOA implementation and this NPRM. Therefore, the Department expects \n\nthat the WIOA NPRM will have no cost impact on small entities.\n\nH. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    The Department has determined that this proposed rulemaking does \n\nnot impose a significant impact on a substantial number of small \n\nentities under the RFA; therefore, the Department is not required to \n\nproduce any Compliance Guides for Small Entities as mandated by the \n\n\n\nSBREFA.\n\nI. Executive Order 13175 (Indian Tribal Governments)\n\n    The Department reviewed this proposed rule under the terms of E.O. \n\n13175 and has determined it to have no tribal implications in addition \n\nto those created through the reimbursement of WIA and future WIOA \n\nprogram expenses via Federally disbursed formula grant funds. The \n\nproposed rule would have substantial direct effects on one or more \n\nIndian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and \n\nIndian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities \n\nbetween the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. As a result, a tribal \n\nsummary impact statement has been prepared.\n\n    Prior to developing this proposed rule, the Department held three \n\nevents to talk with the tribal institutions about their concerns about \n\nthe current state of Indian and Native American Programs (INAP) as well \n\nas what concerns they see in the future. These three events consisted \n\nof a consultation webinar and two in-person town hall meetings. The \n\nconsultation webinar, entitled ``Listening session on Indian and Native \n\nAmerican Programs,'' occurred on September 15, 2014. Two other \n\nconsultations were held, including an October 21, 2014, town hall \n\nmeeting with Indian and Native American leaders and membership \n\norganizations serving Indians and Native Americans, Hawaiians, and \n\nAlaskan Natives, and a formal consultation December 17, 2014, with \n\nmembers of the Native American Employment and Training Advisory Council \n\nto the Secretary of Labor.\n\n    The Department received feedback from the Indian and Native \n\nAmerican (INA) community and the general public that established \n\nseveral areas of interest concerning the Department of Labor's \n\nrelationship with Indian and Native American Tribes and Tribal \n\nGovernments. These areas of interest are summarized below.\n\nServices Received in American Job Centers\n\n    Specifically, the INA community expressed interest in learning how \n\nAmerican Job Centers will account for the use of their INA funding \n\ndollars and how to ensure that the funds intended for the INA \n\npopulation will be dedicated to that population. In addition, there \n\nwere also several individuals that had concerns that INA individuals \n\nthat enter an American Job Center may not get the general assistance \n\nthat is intended for all people that seek assistance. In other words, \n\nseveral commenters wanted to ensure that INA individuals should receive \n\nassistance intended for other populations that they may qualify for \n\nwhen seeking service. Finally, several commenters were interested in \n\n\n\nlearning more about how INA programs may be required to contribute to \n\nAmerican Job Center infrastructure funding and how American Job Centers \n\nwill account for INA members served to ensure that the American Job \n\nCenter network is responding to the relevant INA population needs.\n\nFunding Per Participant Was Low for INA Programs Especially When \n\nCompared to Other Job Training Programs\n\n    Many of the commenters expressed concern that the funds made \n\navailable on a per participant basis for INA programs were not \n\nsufficient to meet the needs of the populations being served. \n\nSpecifically, many commenters stated that funds available for INA youth \n\nare inadequate to fully meet their needs. In addition, commenters felt \n\nthat more funds were needed for INA job training programs to ensure \n\nthat career pathway training could be carried out. Several commenters \n\ncompared the cost per participant funding for other programs, such as \n\nJob Corps, as evidence of the lack of funding for INA programs. The \n\ncommenters went on to request a comparison of other WIA-funded programs \n\nand the INA programs. Finally, one commenter felt that because of the \n\nlack of funds, INA youth were being served instead of INA adults.\n\n    The majority of comments focused on the use of new funding streams \n\nand the requirements attached to those funds. Commenters expressed \n\nconcern about the issue of using and transferring WIOA funding to \n\nsupport activities under Indian Employment, Training, and Related \n\nServices Demonstration Act of 1992, as amended (Pub. L. 102-477). \n\nSpecifically, commenters talked about the importance of flexibility in \n\nadherence to the requirements because Public Law 102-477 programs are \n\ntribal programs, may be located in rural areas, and have been \n\neffectively and efficiently reporting through existing processes, \n\nincluding a single reporting feature in the annual report. \n\nAdditionally, commenters suggested that vocational rehabilitation, \n\nadult education reentry, and other applicable job/education-related \n\nprogram funding also should be allowed to support Public Law 102-477 \n\nprograms. Clarity around which funding streams are allowable also was \n\nsuggested. Commenters also expressed hope that the Department of \n\nEducation\n\n[[Page 20833]]\n\nwill integrate Carl D. Perkins funding under Public Law 102-477 which \nallows Federally-recognized Tribes and Alaska Native entities to \ncombine formula-funded Federal grant funds administered by the \nDepartment of Interior, which are employment and training-related into \na single plan with a single budget and a single reporting system. \nCommenters noted that the Native American Career and Technical \nEducation Program (NACTEP) is a required partner, and that NACTEP has \nlimited the partner funds available to fund supportive services and \n\n\n\nwork experiences. One commenter asked if statutory language regarding \nkey investments in vulnerable populations would result in an increase \nin funding for Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) \nprograms. Lastly, it was suggested that the 166 Advisory Council \ncontinue, and DINAP programs continue to be staffed with Native \nAmericans and Native American Chiefs.\nConcerns About the Effects of the New Performance Reporting \nRequirements Established in WIOA on the INA Community\n    Many commenters expressed concern that INA programs would not be \nable to meet the performance reporting requirements established by WIOA \nfor several reasons, including limited funds to train individuals for \nthe new performance standards and the need to purchase new technology \nand equipment to meet the reporting requirements. In addition, several \n\ncommenters said that INA programs will have to be more selective in \ndetermining eligibility for training programs because of insufficient \nof funding and the increased focus on performance outcomes.\nLack of Funding To Hire and Effectively Train Staff and Ensuring Policy \nIs Responsive to INA Community Needs\n\n    Commenters stated concerns that INA programs will not be able to \nachieve expected performance levels because they lacked funding to \nadequately staff programs. Several commenters stated concerns about the \nlimited number of staff, increased training needs for staff, and the \nneed to ensure that technical assistance is made available to staff. \nSpecifically, commenters are concerned that INA programs may transition \nslower than States to the new WIOA requirements because of funding and \n\nstaff needs. In addition, they stated that INA programs need more funds \nto implement new administrative tasks as well as provide services to \nthe INA community.\n\nWorking With States and Other Programs\n    Commenters expressed concerns about States' accountability to the \nINA community and how to make other training programs administered by \n\nthe State work comprehensively with INA programs. Others encouraged \n\nflexibility and freedom in funding in working with these same entities \n\nand lauded this flexibility as a way to get more out of funds. \nFurthermore, the commenters emphasized how important it is for Indian \nand Native American Leaders to have a voice in the policy and guidance \nformulation process so that policy is directly responsive to the needs \nand funding has to go hand in hand with the needs identified. Some \ncommenters suggested an on-going dialogue between Indian and Native \nAmerican leaders, Workforce Investment Boards, local and State \nagencies, and the American Job Centers to discuss training and \neducation that leads to jobs. Some commenters stated that State-run \n\nprograms need to be more accountable for how they interact with INA \npopulations. Other commenters expressed frustration that some State \n\nprograms do not see a need to work with INA programs because the States \nthink that the INA programs get money from other sources, such as \n\n\n\ncasinos. Many of the commenters said that they wanted better \ncollaboration with State-run programs and increased networking among \nINA programs and State agencies. Finally, one commenter stated that \ncollaboration between INA programs and the State-run training systems \n\nwould make services to individuals more efficient because it would \nprevent ``double-dipping'' in programs.\n    The Department invites public comment about what can be done to \naddress the areas summarized above.\n\nJ. Executive Order 12630 (Government Actions and Interference With \n\nConstitutionally Protected Property Rights\n\n    The Department has determined that this WIOA NPRM is not subject to \n\nE.O. 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally \n\nProtected Property Rights, because it does not involve implementation \n\nof a policy with takings implications.\n\nK.

Through this system, adults and dislocated \n\nworkers can access a continuum of services. The services are classified \n\n\n\nas career and training services.\n\n    (b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local \n\ngrant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated worker programs, is a \n\nrequired one-stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to \n\nsuch partners described in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with \n\nthose provisions:\n\n    (1) Career services for adults and dislocated workers must be made \n\navailable in at least one comprehensive one-stop center in each local \n\nworkforce investment area. Services may also be available elsewhere, \n\neither at affiliated sites or at specialized centers. For example, \n\nspecialized centers may be established to serve workers being \n\ndislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve \n\nresidents of public housing.\n\n    (2) Through the one-stop system, adults and dislocated workers \n\nneeding training are provided Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) and \n\naccess to lists of eligible providers and programs of training. These \n\nlists contain quality consumer information, including cost and \n\nperformance information for each of the providers' programs, so that \n\nparticipants can make informed choices on where to use their ITAs. \n\n(ITAs are more fully discussed in subpart C of this part.)\n\nSec.  680.110  When must adults and dislocated workers be registered \nand considered a participant?\n\n    (a) Registration is the process for collecting information to \n\nsupport a determination of eligibility. This information may be \n\ncollected through methods that include electronic data transfer, \n\npersonal interview, or an individual's application. Participation \n\noccurs after the registration process of collecting information to \n\nsupport an eligibility determination and begins when the individual \n\nreceives a staff-assisted WIOA service, which does not include self-\n\nservice or informational activities.\n\n    (b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under \n\ntitle I other than self-service or informational activities must be \n\nregistered and must be a participant.\n\n    (c) Employment Opportunity data must be collected on every \n\nindividual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I \n\nfinancially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a \n\nrecipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal \n\ninformation in response to a request from the grant recipient or \n\ndesignated service provider.\n\nSec.  680.120  What are the eligibility criteria for career services \nfor adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?\n\n\n\n    To be eligible to receive career services as an adult in the adult \n\nand dislocated worker programs, an individual must be 18 years of age \n\nor older. To be eligible for any dislocated worker programs, an \n\neligible adult must meet the criteria of Sec.  680.130. Eligibility \n\ncriteria for training services are found at Sec.  680.210.\n\nSec.  680.130  What are the eligibility criteria for career services \nfor dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?\n\n    (a) To be eligible to receive career services as a dislocated \n\nworker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must \n\nmeet the definition of ``dislocated worker'' at WIOA sec. 3(15). \n\nEligibility criteria for training services are found at Sec.  680.210.\n\n    (b) Governors and Local Boards may establish policies and \n\nprocedures for one-stop operators to use in determining an individual's \n\neligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at \n\nWIOA sec. 3(15). These policies and procedures may address such \n\nconditions as:\n\n    (1) What constitutes a ``general announcement'' of plant closing \n\nunder WIOA sec. 3(15)(B)(ii) or (iii); and\n\n    (2) What constitutes ``unemployed as a result of general economic \n\nconditions in the community in which the individual resides or because \n\nof natural disasters'' for determining the eligibility of self-employed \n\nindividuals, including family members and farm workers or ranch hands, \n\nunder WIOA sec. 3(15)(C).\n\nSec.  680.140  What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \nadult and dislocated worker services are Local Boards required and \npermitted to provide?\n\n    (a) WIOA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults \n\nand dislocated workers must be used to provide career and training \n\nservices through the one-stop delivery system. Local Boards determine \n\nthe most appropriate mix of these services, but both types must be \n\navailable for eligible adults and dislocated workers. Different \n\neligibility criteria apply for each type of services. See Sec. Sec.  \n\n680.120, 680.130, and 680.210.\n\n    (b) WIOA title I funds may also be used to provide the additional \n\nservices described in WIOA sec. 134(d), including:\n\n    (1) Job seeker services:\n\n    (i) Customer support to enable individuals with barriers to \n\nemployment (including individuals with disabilities) and veterans, to \n\nnavigate among multiple services and activities (WIOA sec. \n\n134(d)(1)(A)(iv));\n\n    (ii) Training programs for displaced homemakers and for individuals \n\ntraining for nontraditional occupations (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(37) \n\n\n\nas occupations or fields of work in which individuals of one gender \n\ncomprise less than 25 percent of the individuals so employed), in \n\nconjunction with programs operated in the local area (WIOA sec. \n\n134(d)(1)(A)(viii));\n\n    (iii) Work support activities for low-wage workers, in coordination \n\nwith one-stop partners, which will provide opportunities for these \n\nworkers to retain or enhance employment.

The list in \n\nthe Act is not all-inclusive and additional training services may be \n\nprovided.\n\nSec.  680.210  Who may receive training services?\n\n    Under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(A) training services may be made \n\navailable to employed and unemployed adults and dislocated workers who:\n\n    (a) A one-stop operator or one-stop partner determines, after an \n\ninterview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning, are:\n\n    (1) Unlikely or unable to obtain or retain employment that leads to \n\neconomic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than wages \n\nfrom previous employment through career services;\n\n    (2) In need of training services to obtain or retain employment \n\nleading to economic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher \n\nthan wages from previous employment; and\n\n[[Page 20854]]\n\n    (3) Have the skills and qualifications to participate successfully \n\nin training services;\n\n    (b) Have selected a program of training services that is directly \n\nlinked to the employment opportunities in the local area or the \n\nplanning region, or in another area to which the individuals are \n\nwilling to commute or relocate;\n\n    (c) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay \n\nthe costs of such training, including such sources as State-funded \n\ntraining funds, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and Federal Pell Grants \n\nestablished under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or \n\n\n\nrequire WIOA assistance in addition to other sources of grant \n\nassistance, including Federal Pell Grants (provisions relating to fund \n\ncoordination are found at Sec.  680.230 and WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(B)); \n\nand\n\n    (d) If training services are provided through the adult funding \n\nstream, are determined eligible in accordance with the State and local \n\npriority system, if any, in effect for adults under WIOA sec. \n\n134(c)(3)(E) and Sec.  680.600.\n\nSec.  680.220  Are there particular career services an individual must \nreceive before receiving training services under Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act?\n\n    (a) Yes, an individual must at a minimum receive either an \n\ninterview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning or any other \n\nmethod through which the one-stop operator or partner can obtain enough \n\ninformation to make an eligibility determination to be determined \n\neligible for training services see WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(A)(i). Where \n\nappropriate, a recent interview, evaluation, or assessment, may be used \n\nfor the assessment purpose; see WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(A)(ii); and\n\n    (b) The case file must contain a determination of need for training \n\nservices under Sec.  680.210 as determined through the interview, \n\nevaluation, or assessment, and career planning informed by local labor \n\nmarket information and training provider performance information, or \n\nthrough any other career service received. There is no requirement that \n\ncareer services be provided as a condition to receipt of training \n\nservices; however, if career services are not provided before training, \n\nthe Local Board must document the circumstances that justified its \n\ndetermination to provide training without first providing the services \n\ndescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n    (c) There is no Federally-required minimum time period for \n\nparticipation in career services before receiving training services.\n\nSec.  680.230  What are the requirements for coordination of Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act training funds and other grant \nassistance?\n\n    (a) WIOA funding for training is limited to participants who:\n\n    (1) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay \n\nthe costs of their training; or\n\n    (2) Require assistance beyond that available under grant assistance \n\nfrom other sources to pay the costs of such training. Program operators \n\nand training providers must coordinate funds available to pay for \n\ntraining as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. In \n\nmaking the determination under this paragraph, one-stop operators \n\nshould take into account the full cost of participating in training \n\n\n\nservices, including the cost of support services and other appropriate \n\ncosts.\n\n    (b) One-stop operators must coordinate training funds available and \n\nmake funding arrangements with one-stop partners and other entities to \n\napply the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. One-stop \n\noperators must consider the availability of other sources of grants to \n\npay for training costs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n\n(TANF), State-funded training funds, and Federal Pell Grants, so that \n\nWIOA funds supplement other sources of training grants.\n\n    (c) A WIOA participant may enroll in WIOA-funded training while \n\nhis/her application for a Pell Grant is pending as long as the one-stop \n\noperator has made arrangements with the training provider and the WIOA \n\nparticipant regarding allocation of the Pell Grant, if it is \n\nsubsequently awarded. In that case, the training provider must \n\nreimburse the one-stop operator the WIOA funds used to underwrite the \n\ntraining for the amount the Pell Grant covers. Reimbursement is not \n\nrequired from the portion of Pell Grant assistance disbursed to the \n\nWIOA participant for education-related expenses. (WIOA sec. \n\n134(c)(3)(B))\n\nSubpart C--Individual Training Accounts\n\nSec.  680.300  How are training services provided?\n\n    Training service for eligible individuals are typically provided by \n\ntraining providers who receive payment for their services through an \n\nIndividual Training Account (ITA). The ITA is a payment agreement \n\nestablished on behalf of a participant with a training provider. WIOA \n\ntitle I adult and dislocated workers purchase training services from \n\neligible providers they select in consultation with the case manager, \n\nwhich includes discussion of quality and performance information on the \n\navailable training providers. Payments from ITAs may be made in a \n\nvariety of ways, including the electronic transfer of funds through \n\nfinancial institutions, vouchers, or other appropriate methods. \n\nPayments may also be made incrementally, e.g., through payment of a \n\nportion of the costs at different points in the training course. (WIOA \n\nsec. 134(c)(4)(G)) Under limited conditions, as provided in Sec.  \n\n680.320 and WIOA sec. 134(d)(3)(G), a Local Board may contract for \n\nthese services, rather than using an ITA for this purpose. In some \n\nlimited circumstances, the Local Board may itself provide the training \n\nservices, but only if it obtains a waiver from the Governor for this \n\npurpose, and the Local Board meets the other requirements of Sec.  \n\n679.410 and WIOA sec. 107(g)(1).\n\nSec.  680.310  Can the duration and amount of Individual Training \n\n\n\nAccounts be limited?\n\n    (a) Yes, the State or Local Board may impose limits on ITAs, such \n\nas limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.\n\n    (b) Limits to ITAs may be established in different ways:\n\n    (1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is \n\nbased on the needs identified in the individual employment plan, such \n\nas the participant's occupational choice or goal and the level of \n\ntraining needed to succeed in that goal; or\n\n    (2) There may be a policy decision by the State Board or Local \n\nBoard to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount \n\napplicable to all ITAs.\n\n    (c) Limitations established by State or Local Board policies must \n\nbe described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but must not be \n\nimplemented in a manner that undermines the Act's requirement that \n\ntraining services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer \n\nchoice in the selection of an eligible training provider. ITA \n\nlimitations may provide for exceptions to the limitations in individual \n\ncases.\n\n    (d) An individual may select training that costs more than the \n\nmaximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when \n\nother sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other \n\nsources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and \n\nother sources.\n\n[[Page 20855]]\n\nSec.  680.320  Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than \n\nIndividual Training Accounts be used to provide training services?\n\n    (a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITAs only when \n\none or more of the following five exceptions apply:\n\n    (1) When the services provided are on-the-job training (OJT), \n\ncustomized training, incumbent worker training or transitional jobs;\n\n    (2) When the Local Board determines that there are an insufficient \n\nnumber of eligible providers in the local area to accomplish the \n\npurpose of a system of ITAs. The Local Plan must describe the process \n\nto be used in selecting the providers under a contract for services. \n\nThis process must include a public comment period for interested \n\nproviders of at least 30 days;\n\n    (3) When the Local Board determines that there is a training \n\nservices program of demonstrated effectiveness offered in the area by a \n\ncommunity-based organization (CBO) or another private organization to \n\nserve individuals with barriers to employment, as described in \n\n\n\nparagraph (b) of this section. The Local Board must develop criteria to \n\nbe used in determining demonstrated effectiveness, particularly as it \n\napplies to the individuals with barriers to employment to be served. \n\nThe criteria may include:\n\n    (i) Financial stability of the organization;\n\n    (ii) Demonstrated performance in the delivery of services to hard \n\nto serve participant populations through such means as program \n\ncompletion rate; attainment of the skills, certificates or degrees the \n\nprogram is designed to provide; placement after training in \n\nunsubsidized employment; and retention in employment; and\n\n    (iii) How the specific program relates to the workforce investment \n\nneeds identified in the local plan.\n\n    (4) When the Local Board determines that it would be most \n\nappropriate to contract with an institution of higher education or \n\nother eligible provider of training services will facilitate the \n\ntraining of multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors or \n\noccupations, provided that the contract does not limit consumer choice.\n\n    (5) When the Local Board is considering entering into a pay-for-\n\nperformance contract, the Local Board ensures that the contract is \n\nconsistent with Sec.  683.510.\n\n    (b) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment include those individuals in one or more of the \n\nfollowing categories, as prescribed by WIOA sec. 3(24):\n\n    (1) Displaced homemakers;\n\n    (2) Low-income individuals;\n\n    (3) Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians;\n\n    (4) Individuals with disabilities;\n\n    (5) Older individuals, i.e., those aged 55 or over;\n\n    (6) Ex-offenders;\n\n    (7) Homeless individuals;\n\n    (8) Youth who are in or have aged out of the foster care system;\n\n    (9) Individuals who are English language learners, individuals who \n\nhave low levels of literacy, and individuals facing substantial \n\ncultural barriers;\n\n    (10) Eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers, defined in WIOA \n\nsec. 167(i);\n\n    (11) Individuals within 2 years of exhausting lifetime eligibility \n\nunder TANF (part A of title IV of the Social Security Act);\n\n    (12) Single-parents (including single pregnant women);\n\n    (13) Long-term unemployed individuals;\n\n    (14) Other groups determined by the Governor to have barriers to \n\nemployment.\n\n\n\nSec.  680.330  How can Individual Training Accounts, supportive \nservices, and needs-related payments be used to support placing \nparticipating adults and dislocated workers into a registered \napprenticeship program and support participants once they are in a \nregistered apprenticeship program?\n\n    Registered apprenticeships automatically qualify to be a on a \n\nState's eligible training provider list (ETPL) as described in Sec.  \n\n680.470. ITAs can be used to support participants in:\n\n    (a) Pre-apprenticeship training, as defined in Sec.  681.480;\n\n    (b) Training tuition for a registered apprenticeship program to the \n\ntraining provider;\n\n    (c) Supportive services may be provided as described in Sec. Sec.  \n\n680.900 and 680.910; and\n\n    (d) Needs-related payments may be provided as described in \n\nSec. Sec.  680.930, 680.940, 680.950, 680.960, and 680.970;\n\n    (e) Work-based training options may also be used to support \n\nparticipants in registered apprenticeship programs (see Sec. Sec.  \n\n680.740 and 680.750).\n\nSec.  680.340  What are the requirements for consumer choice?\n\n    (a) Training services, whether under ITA's or under contract, must \n\nbe provided in a manner that maximizes informed consumer choice in \n\nselecting an eligible provider.\n\n    (b) Each Local Board, through the one-stop center, must make \n\navailable to customers the State list of eligible providers required in \n\nWIOA sec. 122(e). The list includes a description of the programs \n\nthrough which the providers may offer the training services, the \n\ninformation identifying eligible providers of on-the-job training and \n\ncustomized training required under WIOA sec. 122(h) (where applicable), \n\nand the performance and cost information about eligible providers of \n\ntraining services described in WIOA secs. 122(d) and 122(h).\n\n    (c) An individual who has been determined eligible for training \n\nservices under Sec.  680.210 may select a provider described in \n\nparagraph (b) of this section after consultation with a career planner. \n\nUnless the program has exhausted training funds for the program year, \n\nthe operator must refer the individual to the selected provider, and \n\nestablish an ITA for the individual to pay for training. For purposes \n\nof this paragraph, a referral may be carried out by providing a voucher \n\nor certificate to the individual to obtain the training.\n\n    (d) The cost of referral of an individual with an ITA to a training \n\nprovider is paid by the applicable adult or dislocated worker program \n\nunder title I of WIOA.\n\n    (e) Each Local Board, through the one-stop center, may coordinate \n\n\n\nfunding for ITAs with funding from other Federal, State, local, or \n\nprivate job training programs or sources to assist the individual in \n\nobtaining training services.\n\n    (f) Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, priority \n\nconsideration must be given to programs that lead to recognized post-\n\nsecondary credentials that are aligned with in-demand industry sectors \n\nor occupations in the local area.\n\nSubpart D--Eligible Training Providers\n\nSec.  680.400  What is the purpose of this subpart?\n\n    (a) This subpart describes the process for determining eligible \n\ntraining providers for WIOA title I-B adult and dislocated worker \n\ntraining participants and for publicly disseminating the list of these \n\nproviders with relevant information about their programs. The workforce \n\ndevelopment system established under WIOA emphasizes informed consumer \n\nchoice, job-driven training, provider performance, and continuous \n\nimprovement. The quality and selection of providers and programs of \n\ntraining services is vital to achieving these core principles.\n\n    (b) The State eligible training provider list and the related \n\neligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality and labor-\n\nmarket relevance of programs of training services that receive funds \n\nthrough WIOA title I-B.\n\n[[Page 20856]]\n\nThe State list is also a means for ensuring informed customer choice \n\nfor individuals eligible for training. In administering the eligible \n\ntraining provider process, States and local areas must work to ensure \n\nthat qualified providers offering a wide variety of job-driven training \n\nprograms are available. The State list is made publicly available \n\nonline through Web sites and searchable databases as well as any other \n\nmeans the State uses to disseminate information to consumers. The list \n\nmust be accompanied by relevant performance and cost information and \n\nmust be presented in a way that is easily understood, in order to \n\nmaximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population \n\ngroups, and must also be available in an electronic format. The State \n\neligible training provider performance reports, as required under WIOA \n\nsec. 116(d)(4), are addressed separately in Sec.  677.230.\n\nSec.  680.410  What entities are eligible providers of training \nservices?\n\n    (a) Eligible providers of training services are entities that are \n\neligible to receive WIOA title I-B funds, according to criteria and \n\n\n\nprocedures established by the Governor in accordance with WIOA sec. \n\n122(b) for adult and dislocated worker participants who enroll in \n\ntraining services. Potential providers may include:\n\n    (1) Institutions of higher education that provide a program which \n\nleads to a recognized post-secondary credential;\n\n    (2) Entities that carry out programs registered under the National \n\nApprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.);\n\n    (3) Other public or private providers of a program of training \n\nservices, which may include joint labor-management organizations and \n\neligible providers of adult education and literacy activities under \n\ntitle II if such activities are provided in combination with \n\noccupational skills training; and\n\n    (4) Local Boards, if they meet the conditions of WIOA sec. \n\n107(g)(1).\n\n    (b) In order to provide training services, a provider must meet the \n\nrequirements of this part and WIOA sec. 122.\n\n    (1) The requirements of this part apply to the use of WIOA title I-\n\nB adult and dislocated worker funds to provide training:\n\n    (i) To individuals using individual training accounts to access \n\ntraining through the eligible training provider list; and\n\n    (ii) To individuals for training provided through the exceptions to \n\nindividual training accounts described at Sec. Sec.  680.320 and \n\n680.530. Training services under WIOA title I-B may be provided through \n\na contract for services rather than Individual Training Accounts under \n\nconditions identified in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(G). These exceptions \n\ninclude: on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker \n\ntraining or transitional employment; instances where the Local Board \n\ndetermines there are insufficient number of eligible providers of \n\ntraining services in the local area; where the Local Board determines \n\nan exception is necessary to meet the needs of individuals with \n\nbarriers to employment (including assisting individuals with \n\ndisabilities or adults in need of adult education and literacy \n\nservices); where the Local Board determines that it would be most \n\nappropriate to award a contract to an institution of higher education \n\nor other eligible provider to facilitate the training of multiple \n\nindividuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations (where the \n\ncontract does not limit customer choice); and, for pay-for-performance \n\ncontracts.\n\n    (2) The requirements of this part apply to all entities providing \n\ntraining to adult and dislocated workers, with specific exceptions for \n\nentities that carry out registered apprenticeship programs, as \n\ndescribed in Sec.  680.470.\n\nSec.  680.420  What is a ``program of training services''?\n\n\n\n    A program of training services, as referred to in Sec.  680.410(a), \n\nis one or more courses or classes, or a structured regimen that leads \n\nto:\n\n    (a) A recognized post-secondary credential, secondary school \n\ndiploma or its equivalent,\n\n    (b) Employment, or\n\n    (c) Measurable skill gains toward such a credential or employment.\n\nSec.  680.430  Who is responsible for managing the eligible provider \nprocess?\n\n    (a) The Governor, in consultation with the State Board, establishes \n\nthe criteria, information requirements and procedures, including \n\nprocedures identifying the respective roles of the State and local \n\nareas, governing the eligibility of providers of training services to \n\nreceive funds for adult and dislocated worker training activities as \n\ndescribed under WIOA sec. 133(b).\n\n    (b) The Governor may designate a State agency (or appropriate State \n\nentity) to assist in carrying out the process and procedures for \n\ndetermining the eligibility of training providers. The Governor or such \n\nagency (or appropriate State entity) is responsible for:\n\n    (1) Ensuring the development and maintenance of the State list of \n\neligible providers and programs, as described is Sec. Sec.  680.450, \n\n680.460, and 680.490;\n\n    (2) Ensuring that programs meet eligibility criteria and \n\nperformance levels established by the State, including verifying the \n\naccuracy of the information;\n\n    (3) Removing programs that do not meet State-established program \n\ncriteria or performance levels, as described in Sec.  680.480(c);\n\n    (4) Taking appropriate enforcement actions against providers that \n\nintentionally provide inaccurate information, or that substantially \n\nviolate the requirements of WIOA, as described in Sec.  680.480(a) and \n\n(b) (WIOA secs. 122(f)(1)(A) and (B)); and\n\n    (5) Disseminating the State list, accompanied by performance and \n\ncost information relating to each provider, to the public and the Local \n\nBoards throughout the State, as further described in Sec.  680.500.\n\n    (c) The Local Board must:\n\n    (1) Carry out the procedures assigned to the Local Board by the \n\nState, such as determining the initial eligibility of entities \n\nproviding a program of training services, renewing the eligibility of \n\nproviders, and considering the possible termination of an eligible \n\nprovider due to the provider's submission of inaccurate eligibility and \n\nperformance information or the provider's substantial violation of WIOA \n\n\n\nrequirements;\n\n    (2) Work with the State to ensure there are sufficient numbers and \n\ntypes of providers of training services, including eligible providers \n\nwith expertise in assisting individuals with disabilities and eligible \n\nproviders with expertise in assisting adults in need of adult education \n\nand literacy activities described under WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E), \n\nserving the local area; and\n\n    (3) Ensure the dissemination and appropriate use of the State list \n\nthrough the local one-stop system.\n\n    (d) The Local Board may:\n\n    (1) Make recommendations to the Governor on the procedure used in \n\ndetermining eligibility of providers;\n\n    (2) Require additional criteria and information from local \n\nproviders as criteria to become or remain eligible; and\n\n    (3) Set higher levels of performance than those required by the \n\nState as criteria for local providers to become or remain eligible to \n\nprovide services in that particular local area.\n\nSec.  680.440  What are the transition procedures for Workforce \nInvestment Act-eligible providers to become eligible under the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    (a) The Governor may establish a transition procedure under which\n\n[[Page 20857]]\n\nproviders eligible to provide training services under WIA may continue \n\nto be eligible to provide such services until December 31, 2015 or such \n\nearlier date as the Governor determines to be appropriate.\n\n    (b) After this transition period, which may extend no later than \n\nDecember 31, 2015, the eligibility of these providers will be \n\ndetermined under the application procedure for continued eligibility \n\nestablished by the Governor as described in Sec.  680.460.\n\n    (c) Providers that were previously eligible under WIA are not \n\nsubject to the initial eligibility procedures described under Sec.  \n\n680.450.\n\nSec.  680.450  What is the initial eligibility procedure for new \nproviders?\n\n    (a) All providers that have not previously been an eligible \n\nprovider of training services under WIOA sec. 122 or WIA sec. 122, \n\nexcept for registered apprenticeship programs, must submit required \n\ninformation to be considered for initial eligibility in accordance with \n\nthe Governor's procedures.\n\n    (b) Apprenticeship programs registered under the National \n\n\n\nApprenticeship Act (NAA) are exempt from initial eligibility \n\nprocedures. Registered apprenticeship programs must be included and \n\nmaintained on the list of eligible providers of training services as \n\nlong as the corresponding program remains registered, as described at \n\nWIOA sec. 122(a)(3). Procedures for registered apprenticeship programs \n\nto be added and maintained on the list are described in Sec.  680.470.\n\n    (c) In establishing the State requirements described in paragraph \n\n(d) of this section, the Governor must, in consultation with the State \n\nBoard, develop a procedure for determining the eligibility of training \n\nproviders. This procedure, which must be described in the State Plan, \n\nmust be developed after:\n\n    (1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from \n\nLocal Boards and providers of training services within the State;\n\n    (2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, \n\nincluding representatives of business and labor organizations, to \n\nsubmit comments on the procedure; and\n\n    (3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and \n\nconsidering the recommendations of Local Boards and providers, and for \n\nproviding an opportunity for public comment.\n\n    (d) For institutions of higher education that provide a program \n\nthat leads to a recognized post-secondary credential and for other \n\npublic or private providers of programs of training services, including \n\njoint labor-management organizations, and providers of adult education \n\nand literacy activities, the Governor must establish criteria and State \n\nrequirements for providers seeking initial eligibility.\n\n    (e) The Governor must require providers seeking initial eligibility \n\nto provide verifiable program specific performance information. At a \n\nminimum, these criteria must require applicant providers to:\n\n    (1) Describe each program of training services to be offered;\n\n    (2) Provide information addressing a factor related to the \n\nindicators of performance, as described in WIOA secs. \n\n116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV) and Sec.  680.460(g)(1) through (4) which \n\ninclude unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit, \n\nunsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit, median \n\nearnings and credentials attainment;\n\n    (3) Describe whether the provider is in a partnership with a \n\nbusiness;\n\n    (4) Provide other information the Governor may require in order to \n\ndemonstrate high quality training services, including a program of \n\ntraining services that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential; \n\nand\n\n    (5) Provide information that addresses alignment of the training \n\nservices with in-demand industry sectors and occupations, to the extent \n\n\n\npossible.\n\n    (f) In establishing the initial eligibility procedures and \n\ncriteria, the Governor may establish minimum standards, based on the \n\nperformance information described in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n    (g) Under WIOA sec. 122(b)(4)(B), providers receive initial \n\neligibility for only 1 fiscal year for a particular program.\n\n    (h) After the initial eligibility expires, these initially-eligible \n\nproviders are subject to the Governor's application procedures for \n\ncontinued eligibility, described at Sec.  680.460, in order to remain \n\neligible.\n\nSec.  680.460  What is the application procedure for continued \neligibility?\n\n    (a) The Governor must establish an application procedure for \n\ntraining providers to maintain their continued eligibility. The \n\napplication procedure must take into account the provider's prior \n\neligibility status.\n\n    (1) Training providers that were previously eligible under WIA, as \n\nof July 21, 2014, will be subject to the application procedure for \n\ncontinued eligibility after the close of the Governor's transition \n\nperiod for implementation, described in Sec.  680.440.\n\n    (2) Training providers that were not previously eligible under WIA \n\nand have been determined to be initially-eligible under WIOA, under the \n\nprocedures described at Sec.  680.450, will be subject to the \n\napplication procedure for continued eligibility after their initial \n\neligibility expires.\n\n    (b) The Governor must develop this procedure after:\n\n    (1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from \n\nLocal Boards and providers of training services within the State;\n\n    (2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, \n\nincluding representatives of business and labor organizations, to \n\nsubmit comments on such procedure; and\n\n    (3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and \n\nconsidering the recommendations of Local Boards and providers, and for \n\nproviding an opportunity for public comment.\n\n    (c) Apprenticeship programs registered under the National \n\nApprenticeship Act (NAA) must be included and maintained on the list of \n\neligible providers of training services for as long as the \n\ncorresponding program remains registered. The Governor's procedure must \n\ninclude a mechanism for registered apprenticeship programs to indicate \n\ninterest in being included on the list, as described in Sec.  680.470.\n\n    (d) The application procedure must describe the roles of the State \n\n\n\nand local areas in receiving and reviewing provider applications and in \n\nmaking eligibility determinations.\n\n    (e) The application procedure must be described in the State Plan.\n\n    (f) In establishing eligibility criteria, the Governor must take \n\ninto account:\n\n    (1) The performance of providers of training services on the \n\nperformance accountability measures described in WIOA secs. \n\n116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV) and required by WIOA sec. 122(b)(2), which may \n\ninclude minimum performance standards, and other appropriate measures \n\nof performance outcomes for program participants receiving training \n\nunder WIOA title I-B, as determined by the Governor. Until data from \n\nthe conclusion of each performance indicator's first data cycle is \n\navailable, the Governor may take into account alternate factors related \n\nto such performance measure.\n\n    (2) Ensuring access to training services throughout the State \n\nincluding rural areas and through the use of technology;\n\n    (3) Information reported to State agencies on Federal and State \n\ntraining programs other than programs within WIOA title I-B;\n\n    (4) The degree to which training programs relate to in-demand \n\nindustry sectors and occupations in the State;\n\n[[Page 20858]]\n\n    (5) State licensure requirements of training providers;\n\n    (6) Encouraging the use of industry-recognized certificates and \n\ncredentials;\n\n    (7) The ability of providers to offer programs that lead to post-\n\nsecondary credentials;\n\n    (8) The quality of the program of training services including a \n\nprogram that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential;\n\n    (9) The ability of the providers to provide training services to \n\nindividuals who are employed and individuals with barriers to \n\nemployment;\n\n    (10) Whether the providers timely and accurately submitted eligible \n\ntraining provider performance reports as required under WIOA sec. \n\n116(d)(4); and\n\n    (11) Other factors that the Governor determines are appropriate in \n\norder to ensure: the accountability of providers; that one-stop centers \n\nin the State will meet the needs of local employers and participants; \n\nand, that participants will be given an informed choice among \n\nproviders.\n\n    (g) The information requirements that the Governor establishes \n\nunder paragraph (f)(1) of this section must require training providers \n\n\n\nto submit appropriate, accurate and timely information for participants \n\nreceiving training under WIOA title I-B. That information must include:\n\n    (1) The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized \n\nemployment during the second quarter after exit from the program;\n\n    (2) The percentage of program participants who are in unsubsidized \n\nemployment during the fourth quarter after exit from the program;\n\n    (3) The median earnings of program participants who are in \n\nunsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the \n\nprogram;\n\n    (4) The percentage of program participants who obtain a recognized \n\npost-secondary credential, or a secondary school diploma or its \n\nrecognized equivalent during participation in or within 1 year after \n\nexit from the program;\n\n    (5) Information on recognized post-secondary credentials received \n\nby program participants;\n\n    (6) Information on cost of attendance, including costs of tuition \n\nand fees, for program participants;\n\n    (7) Information on the program completion rate for such \n\nparticipants.\n\n    (h) The eligibility criteria must require that:\n\n    (1) Providers submit performance and cost information as described \n\nin paragraph (g) of this section and in the Governor's procedures for \n\neach program of training services for which the provider has been \n\ndetermined to be eligible, in a timeframe and manner determined by the \n\nState, but at least every 2 years; and\n\n    (2) That the collection of information required to demonstrate \n\ncompliance with the criteria is not unduly burdensome or costly to \n\nproviders (WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)(J)(iv)).\n\n    (i) The procedure for continued eligibility must also provide for \n\nthe State to review biennially-required provider eligibility \n\ninformation to assess the renewal of training provider eligibility. \n\nSuch procedures may establish minimum levels of training provider \n\nperformance as criteria for continued eligibility.\n\n    (j) The procedure for biennial review of the provider eligibility \n\nmust include verification of the registration status of registered \n\napprenticeship programs as described in Sec.  680.470.\n\n    (k) Local Boards may require higher levels of performance for local \n\nprograms than the levels specified in the procedures established by the \n\nGovernor.\n\n    (l) The Governor may establish procedures and timeframes for \n\nproviding technical assistance to eligible providers of training who \n\nare not intentionally supplying inaccurate information or who have not \n\nsubstantially violated any of the requirements under this section but \n\n\n\nare failing to meet the criteria and information requirements due to \n\nundue cost or burden.\n\nSec.  680.470  What is the procedure for registered apprenticeship \nprograms that seek to be included in a State's eligible training \nprovider list?\n\n    (a) All registered apprenticeship programs that are registered with \n\nthe U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Apprenticeship, or a recognized \n\nState apprenticeship agency are automatically eligible to be included \n\nin the State list of eligible training providers. Some program sponsors \n\nmay not wish to be included on the State eligible training provider \n\nlist. Therefore, the Governor must establish a mechanism for registered \n\napprenticeship program sponsors in the State to indicate that the \n\nprogram sponsor wishes to be included on the State eligible training \n\nprovider list. This mechanism should be developed with the assistance \n\nof the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship representative \n\nin the State or, if the State oversees the administration of the \n\napprenticeship system, with the assistance of the recognized State \n\napprenticeship agency.\n\n    (b) Once on the State eligible training provider list, registered \n\napprenticeship programs will remain on the list until they are \n\nderegistered or until the registered apprenticeship program notifies \n\nthe State that it no longer wants to be included on the list.\n\n    (c) Inclusion of a registered apprenticeship in the State eligible \n\ntraining provider list allows an individual who is eligible to use WIOA \n\ntitle I-B funds to use those funds toward apprentice training, \n\nconsistent with their availability and limitations as prescribed by \n\nSec.  680.300. The use of individual training accounts and other WIOA \n\ntitle I-B funds toward apprenticeship training is further described in \n\nSec.  680.330.\n\n    (d) The Governor is encouraged to consult with the State and Local \n\nBoards, ETA's Office of Apprenticeship, recognized State apprenticeship \n\nagencies (where they exist in the Governor's State) or other State \n\nagencies, to establish voluntary reporting of performance information.\n\nSec.  680.480  May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?\n\n    (a) Yes. A training provider must deliver results and provide \n\naccurate information in order to retain its status as an eligible \n\ntraining provider.\n\n    (b) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate \n\ninformation or to have substantially violated any provision of title I \n\nof WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37, must be \n\nremoved from the list in accordance with the enforcement provisions of \n\n\n\nWIOA sec. 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under \n\nthese conditions must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is \n\nliable to repay all adult and dislocated worker training funds it \n\nreceived during the period of noncompliance. The Governor must specify \n\nin the procedures which individual or entity is responsible for making \n\nthese determinations and the process by which the determination will be \n\nmade, which must include an opportunity for a hearing that meets the \n\nrequirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b).\n\n    (c) As a part of the biennial review of eligibility established by \n\nthe Governor, the State must remove provider programs that fail to meet \n\ncriteria established by the Governor to remain eligible, which may \n\ninclude failure to meet established minimum performance levels.\n\n    (d) The Governor must establish an appeals procedure for providers \n\nof training to appeal a denial of eligibility under this subpart that \n\nmeets the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b), which explains the appeals \n\nprocess for\n\n[[Page 20859]]\n\ndenial or termination of eligibility of a provider of training \n\nservices.\n\n    (e) Where a Local Board has established higher minimum standards, \n\naccording to Sec.  680.460(k), the Local Board may remove a provider \n\nprogram from the eligible programs in that local area for failure to \n\nmeet established criteria. The Local Board must establish an appeals \n\nprocedure for providers of training to appeal a denial of eligibility \n\nunder this subpart that meets the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630(b), \n\nwhich explains the appeals process for denial or termination of \n\neligibility of a provider of training services.\n\nSec.  680.490  What kind of performance and cost information must \neligible training providers provide for each program of training?\n\n    (a) In accordance with the State procedure and Sec.  680.460(h), \n\neligible providers of training services must submit, at least every 2 \n\nyears, appropriate, timely and accurate performance and cost \n\ninformation.\n\n    (b) Program-specific performance information must include:\n\n    (1) The information described in WIOA sec. 122(b)(2)(A) for \n\nindividuals participating in the programs of training services who are \n\nreceiving assistance under WIOA sec. 134. This information includes \n\nindicators of performance as described in WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(I)-(IV) \n\nand Sec.  680.460(g)(1) through (4).\n\n    (2) Information identifying the recognized post-secondary \n\ncredentials received by such participants.\n\n\n\n    (3) Program cost information, including tuition and fees, for WIOA \n\nparticipants in the program, and\n\n    (4) Information on the program completion rate for WIOA \n\nparticipants.\n\n    (c) Governors may require any additional performance information \n\n(such as the information described at WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)) that the \n\nGovernor determines to be appropriate to determine or maintain \n\neligibility.\n\n    (d) Governors must establish a procedure by which a provider can \n\ndemonstrate that providing additional information required under this \n\nsection would be unduly burdensome or costly. If the Governor \n\ndetermines that providers have demonstrated such extraordinary costs or \n\nundue burden:\n\n    (1) The Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for \n\nthe collection of the information;\n\n    (2) The Governor may provide additional resources to assist \n\nproviders in the collection of the information from funds for statewide \n\nworkforce investment activities reserved under WIOA secs. 128(a) and \n\n133(a)(1); or\n\n    (3) The Governor may take other steps to assist training providers \n\nin collecting and supplying required information such as offering \n\ntechnical assistance.\n\nSec.  680.500  How is the State list of eligible training providers \ndisseminated?\n\n    (a) In order to assist participants in choosing employment and \n\ntraining activities, the Governor or State agency must disseminate the \n\nState list of eligible training providers and accompanying performance \n\nand cost information to Local Boards in the State and to members of the \n\npublic online including through Web sites and searchable databases and \n\nthrough whatever other means the State uses to disseminate information \n\nto consumers, including the one-stop delivery system and its program \n\npartners throughout the State.\n\n    (b) The State list and information must be updated regularly and \n\nprovider eligibility must be reviewed biennially according to the \n\nprocedures established by the Governor in Sec.  680.460(i).\n\n    (c) In order to ensure informed consumer choice, the State eligible \n\ntraining provider list and accompanying information must be widely \n\navailable to the public through electronic means, including Web sites \n\nand searchable databases, as well as through any other means the State \n\nuses to disseminate information to consumers. The list and accompanying \n\ninformation must be available through the one-stop delivery system and \n\n\n\nits partners including the State's secondary and post-secondary \n\neducation systems. The eligible training provider list should be \n\naccessible to individuals seeking information on training outcomes, as \n\nwell as participants in employment and training activities funded under \n\nWIOA, including those under Sec.  680.210, and other programs. In \n\naccordance with WIOA sec. 188, the State list must also be accessible \n\nto individuals with disabilities.\n\n    (d) The State eligible training provider list must be accompanied \n\nby appropriate information to assist participants in choosing \n\nemployment and training activities. Such information must include:\n\n    (1) Recognized post-secondary credential(s) offered;\n\n    (2) Provider information supplied to meet the Governor's \n\neligibility procedure as described in Sec. Sec.  680.450 and 680.460;\n\n    (3) Performance and cost information as described in Sec.  680.490; \n\nand\n\n    (4) Additional information as the Governor determines appropriate.\n\n    (e) The State list and accompanying information must be made \n\navailable in a manner that does not reveal personally identifiable \n\ninformation about an individual participant. In addition, in developing \n\nthe information to accompany the State list described in Sec.  \n\n680.490(b), disclosure of personally identifiable information from an \n\neducation record must be carried out in accordance with the Family \n\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act, including the circumstances \n\nrelating to prior written consent.\n\nSec.  680.510  In what ways can a Local Board supplement the \ninformation available from the State list?\n\n    (a) Local Boards may supplement the criteria and information \n\nrequirements established by the Governor in order to support informed \n\nconsumer choice and the achievement of local performance measures.\n\n    (b) This additional information may include:\n\n    (1) Information on programs of training services that are linked to \n\noccupations in demand in the local area;\n\n    (2) Performance and cost information, including program-specific \n\nperformance and cost information, for the local outlet(s) of multi-site \n\neligible providers;\n\n    (3) Information that shows how programs are responsive to local \n\nrequirements; and\n\n    (4) Other appropriate information related to the objectives of \n\nWIOA.\n\nSec.  680.520  May individuals choose training providers located \noutside of the local area?\n\n    Yes, individuals may choose any of the eligible providers and \n\n\n\nprograms on the State list. A State may also establish a reciprocal \n\nagreement with other States to permit providers of eligible training \n\nprograms in each State to accept individual training accounts provided \n\nby the other State. See WIOA sec. 122(g). Providers of training \n\nservices that are located outside the local area may not be subject to \n\nState eligibility procedures if the provider has been determined \n\neligible by another State with such an agreement.\n\nSec.  680.530  What requirements apply to providers of on-the-job-\ntraining, customized training, incumbent worker training, and other \ntraining exceptions?\n\n    Providers of on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent \n\nworker training, internships, paid or unpaid work experience, or \n\ntransitional employment are not subject to the same requirements as \n\nentities listed on the eligible training provider list. For these \n\ntraining programs, one-stop operators in a local area must collect such \n\nperformance information as the Governor may require and determine \n\nwhether the providers meet the Governor's performance criteria. The \n\nGovernor may require one-stop\n\n[[Page 20860]]\n\noperators to disseminate a list of providers that have met the \n\nperformance criteria, along with the relevant performance information \n\nabout them, through the one-stop delivery system. Providers that meet \n\nthe criteria are considered eligible providers of training services. \n\nThese providers are not subject to the other requirements of WIOA sec. \n\n122 or this part.\n\nSubpart E--Priority and Special Populations\n\nSec.  680.600  What priority must be given to low-income adults and \npublic assistance recipients and individuals who are basic skills \ndeficient served with adult funds under title I?\n\n    (a) WIOA states, in sec. 134(c)(3)(E), that priority for \n\nindividualized career services (see Sec.  678.430(b)) and training \n\nservices funded with title I adult funds must be given to recipients of \n\npublic assistance, other low-income individuals, who are basic skills \n\ndeficient (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(5)(B)) in the local area.\n\n    (b) States and local areas must establish criteria by which the \n\none-stop operator will apply the priority under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E). \n\nSuch criteria may include the availability of other funds for providing \n\nemployment and training-related services in the local area, the needs \n\nof the specific groups within the local area, and other appropriate \n\nfactors.\n\n\n\n    (c) The priority established under paragraph (b) of this section \n\ndoes not necessarily mean that these services may only be provided to \n\nrecipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and \n\nindividuals without basic work skills. The Local Board and the Governor \n\nmay establish a process that also gives priority to other individuals \n\neligible to receive such services, provided that it is consistent with \n\npriority of service for veterans (see Sec.  680.650).\n\nSec.  680.610  Does the statutory priority for use of adult funds also \napply to dislocated worker funds?\n\n    No, the statutory priority applies only to adult funds for \n\nindividualized career services, as described in Sec.  680.150(b), and \n\ntraining services. Funds allocated for dislocated workers are not \n\nsubject to this requirement.\n\nSec.  680.620  How does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram relate to the one-stop delivery system?\n\n    The local TANF program is a required partner in the one-stop \n\ndelivery system. Part 678 describes the roles of such partners in the \n\none-stop delivery system and it applies to the TANF program. TANF \n\nserves individuals who may also be served by the WIOA programs and, \n\nthrough appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have \n\naccess to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the \n\nTANF program in the one-stop system. TANF participants, who are \n\ndetermined to be WIOA eligible, and who need occupational skills \n\ntraining may be referred through the one-stop system to receive WIOA \n\ntraining, when TANF grant and other grant funds are not available to \n\nthe individual in accordance with Sec.  680.230(a). WIOA participants \n\nwho are also determined TANF eligible may be referred to the TANF \n\noperator for assistance.\n\nSec.  680.630  How does a displaced homemaker qualify for services \nunder title I?\n\n    (a) Individuals who meet the definitions of a ``displaced \n\nhomemaker'' (WIOA sec. 3(16)) qualify for career and training services \n\nwith dislocated worker title I funds.\n\n    (b) Displaced homemakers may also qualify for career and training \n\nservices with adult funds under title I if the requirements of this \n\npart are met (see Sec. Sec.  680.120 and 680.600).\n\n    (c) Displaced homemakers may also be served in statewide employment \n\nand training projects conducted with reserve funds for innovative \n\nprograms for displaced homemakers, as described in 20 CFR 682.210(c).\n\n    (d) The definition of displaced homemaker includes the dependent \n\n\n\nspouse of a member of the Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in \n\nsec. 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code) and whose family income \n\nis significantly reduced because of a deployment, a call or order to \n\nactive duty under a provision of law referred to in sec. 101(a)(13)(B) \n\nof title 10, United State Code, a permanent change of station, or the \n\nservice-connected death or disability of the member.\n\nSec.  680.640  May an individual with a disability whose family does \nnot meet income eligibility criteria under the Act be eligible for \npriority as a low-income adult?\n\n    Yes, even if the family of an individual with a disability does not \n\nmeet the income eligibility criteria, the individual with a disability \n\nis to be considered a low-income individual if the individual's own \n\nincome:\n\n    (a) Meets the income criteria established in WIOA sec. \n\n3(36)(A)(vi); or\n\n    (b) Meets the income eligibility criteria for payments under any \n\nFederal, State or local public assistance program (see WIOA sec. \n\n3(36)(A)(i)).\n\nSec.  680.650  Do veterans receive priority of service under the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Yes, veterans under WIOA sec. 3(63)(A) and 38 U.S.C. 101 receive \n\npriority of service in all Department of Labor-funded training programs \n\nunder 38 U.S.C. 4215 and described in 20 CFR 1010. A veteran must still \n\nmeet each program's eligibility criteria to receive services under the \n\nrespective employment and training program. For income-based \n\neligibility determinations, amounts paid while on active duty or paid \n\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for vocational \n\nrehabilitation, disability payments, or related VA-funded programs are \n\nnot to be considered as income in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4213 and 20 \n\nCFR 683.230.\n\nSec.  680.660  Are separating military service members eligible for \ndislocated worker activities under the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act?\n\n    If the separating service member is separating from the Armed \n\nForces with a discharge that is anything other than dishonorable, the \n\nseparating service member qualifies for dislocated worker activities \n\nbased on the following criteria:\n\n    (a) The separating service member has received a notice of \n\nseparation, a DD-214 from the Department of Defense, or other \n\ndocumentation showing a separation or imminent separation from the \n\nArmed Forces to satisfy the termination or layoff part of the \n\n\n\ndislocated worker eligibility criteria in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(i);\n\n    (b) The separating service member qualifies for the dislocated \n\nworker eligibility criteria on eligibility for or exhaustion of \n\nunemployment compensation in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(ii)(I) or (II); and,\n\n    (c) As a separating service member, the individual meets the \n\ndislocated worker eligibility criteria that the individual is unlikely \n\nto return to a previous industry or occupation in WIOA sec. \n\n3(15)(A)(iii).\n\nSubpart F--Work-Based Training\n\nSec.  680.700  What are the requirements for on-the-job training?\n\n    (a) On-the-job training (OJT) is defined at WIOA sec. 3(44). OJT is \n\nprovided under a contract with an employer in the public, private non-\n\nprofit, or private sector. Through the OJT contract, occupational \n\ntraining is provided for the WIOA participant in exchange for the \n\nreimbursement, typically up to 50 percent of the wage rate of the \n\nparticipant, for the extraordinary costs of providing the\n\n[[Page 20861]]\n\ntraining and supervision related to the training. In limited \n\ncircumstances, as provided in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(h) and Sec.  680.730, \n\nthe reimbursement may be up to 75 percent of the wage rate of the \n\nparticipant.\n\n    (b) On-the-job training contracts under WIOA title I, must not be \n\nentered into with an employer who has received payments under previous \n\ncontracts under WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of \n\nfailing to provide on-the-job training participants with continued \n\nlong-term employment as regular employees with wages and employment \n\nbenefits (including health benefits) and working conditions at the same \n\nlevel and to the same extent as other employees working a similar \n\nlength of time and doing the same type of work.

Local Boards, in consultation with the one-stop partners and other \n\ncommunity service providers, must develop a policy on supportive \n\nservices that ensures resource and service coordination in the local \n\narea. The policy should address procedures for referral to such \n\nservices, including how such services will be funded when they are not \n\notherwise available from other sources. The provision of accurate \n\ninformation about the availability of supportive services in the local \n\narea, as well as referral to such activities, is one of the career \n\nservices that must be available to adults and dislocated workers \n\nthrough the one-stop delivery system.

However, for purposes of \n\nWIOA, the Department does not consider providers of Adult Education \n\nunder title II of WIOA, YouthBuild programs, and Job Corps programs to \n\nbe schools. Therefore, WIOA youth programs may consider a youth to be \n\nout-of-school youth for purposes of WIOA youth program eligibility if \n\nthey are attending Adult Education provided under title II of WIOA, \n\nYouthBuild, or Job Corps.\n\nSec.  681.240  When do local youth programs verify dropout status, \nparticular for youth attending alternative schools?\n\n    Local WIOA youth programs must verify a youth's dropout status at \n\nthe time of WIOA youth program enrollment. A youth attending an \n\nalternative school at the time of enrollment is not a dropout. States \n\nmust define ``alternative school'' in their State Plan. The definition \n\nshould be consistent with their State Education Agency definition, if \n\navailable. An individual who is out-of-school at the time of enrollment \n\nand subsequently placed in an alternative school or any school, is an \n\nout-of-school youth for the purposes of the 75 percent expenditure \n\nrequirement for out-of-school youth.\n\n\n\nSec.  681.250  Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply \nto?\n\n    (a) For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a secondary \n\nschool diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either basic skills \n\ndeficient or an English language learner and youth who require \n\nadditional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to\n\n[[Page 20865]]\n\nsecure or hold employment must be low-income. All other OSY meeting OSY \n\neligibility under Sec.  681.210(c)(1), (2) and (4) through (7) are not \n\nrequired to be low-income. (WIOA secs. 129(a)(1)(iii)(I)-(II) and \n\n129(a)(1)(iii)(IV)-(VII))\n\n    (b) All ISY must be low-income to meet the ISY eligibility \n\ncriteria, except those that fall under the low-income exception.\n\n    (c) WIOA allows a low-income exception where five percent of all \n\nWIOA youth participants may be participants who ordinarily would be \n\nrequired to be low-income for eligibility purposes and who meet all \n\nother eligibility criteria for WIOA youth except the low-income \n\ncriteria. A program must calculate the five percent based on the \n\npercent of all youth served by the program in the local area's WIOA \n\nyouth program in a given program year.\n\n    (d) In addition to the criteria in the definition of ``low-income \n\nindividual'' in WIOA sec. 3(36), a youth is low-income if he or she \n\nreceives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced price lunch under \n\nthe Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et \n\nseq. or if she or her lives in a high-poverty area.\n\nSec.  681.260  How does the Department define ``high poverty area'' for \nthe purposes of the special rule for low-income youth in Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    A youth who lives in a high poverty area is automatically \n\nconsidered to be a low-income individual. A high-poverty area is a \n\nCensus tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, Indian Reservation, \n\ntribal land, or Native Alaskan Village or county that has a poverty \n\nrate of at least 30 percent as set every 5 years using American \n\nCommunity Survey 5-Year data.\n\nSec.  681.270  May a local program use eligibility for free or reduced \nprice lunches under the National School Lunch Program as a substitute \nfor the income eligibility criteria under title I of the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Yes, WIOA sec. 3(36) defines a low-income individual to include an \n\nindividual who receives (or is eligible to receive) a free or reduced \n\nprice lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.\n\n\n\nSec.  681.280  Is a youth with a disability eligible for youth services \nunder the Act if their family income exceeds the income eligibility \ncriteria?\n\n    Yes, for an individual with a disability, income level for \n\neligibility purposes is based on the individual's own income rather \n\nthan his or her family's income. WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi) states that an \n\nindividual with a disability whose own income meets the low-income \n\ndefinition in clause (ii) (income that does not exceed the higher of \n\nthe poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income \n\nlevel), but who is a member of a family whose income exceeds this \n\nincome requirement is eligible for youth services.\n\nSec.  681.290  How does the Department define the ``basic skills \ndeficient'' criterion in this part?\n\n    (a) As defined in Sec.  681.210(c)(3), a youth is ``basic skills \n\ndeficient'' if they:\n\n    (1) Have English reading, writing, or computing skills at or below \n\nthe 8th grade level on a generally accepted standardized test; or\n\n    (2) Are unable to compute or solve problems, or read, write, or \n\nspeak English at a level necessary to function on the job, in the \n\nindividual's family, or in society. (WIOA sec. 3(5))\n\n    (b) The State or Local Board must establish its policy on paragraph \n\n(a)(2) of this section in its respective State or local plan.\n\n    (c) In assessing basic skills, local programs must use assessment \n\ninstruments that are valid and appropriate for the target population, \n\nand must provide reasonable accommodation in the assessment process, if \n\nnecessary, for people with disabilities.\n\nSec.  681.300  How does the Department define the ``requires additional \nassistance to complete an educational program, or to secure and hold \nemployment'' criterion in this part?\n\n    As defined in Sec.  681.200(c)(8), either the State or the local \n\nlevel may establish definitions and eligibility documentation \n\nrequirements for the ``requires additional assistance to complete an \n\neducational program, or to secure and hold employment'' criterion of \n\nSec.  681.200(c)(8). In cases where the State Board establishes State \n\npolicy on this criterion, the State Board must include the definition \n\nin the State Plan. In cases where the State Board does not establish a \n\npolicy, the Local Board must establish a policy in their local plan if \n\nusing this criterion.\n\nSec.  681.310  Must youth participants enroll to participate in the \nyouth program?\n\n    (a) Yes, to participate in youth programs, participants must enroll \n\n\n\nin the WIOA youth program.\n\n    (b) Enrollment in this case requires:\n\n    (1) The collection of information to support an eligibility \n\ndetermination; and\n\n    (2) Participation in any of the fourteen WIOA youth program \n\nelements.\n\nSubpart C--Youth Program Design, Elements, and Parameters\n\nSec.  681.400  What is the process used to select eligible youth \nproviders?\n\n    (a) As provided in WIOA sec. 123, the Local Board must identify \n\neligible providers of youth workforce investment activities in the \n\nlocal area by awarding grants or contracts on a competitive basis, \n\nexcept as provided below in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, based on \n\nthe recommendation of the youth standing committee, if they choose to \n\nestablish a standing youth committee and assign it that function. If \n\nsuch a committee is not established for the local area, this \n\nresponsibility falls to the Local Board.\n\n    (1) Local areas must include the criteria used to identify youth \n\nproviders in the State Plan (including such quality criteria \n\nestablished by the Governor for a training program that leads to a \n\nrecognized post-secondary credential) taking into consideration the \n\nability of the provider to meet the performance accountability measures \n\nbased on primary indicators of performance for youth programs.\n\n    (2) Local areas must conduct a full and open competition to secure \n\nyouth service providers according to the Federal procurement guidelines \n\nat 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, in addition to applicable State and local \n\nprocurement laws.\n\n    (3) Where the Local Board determines there is an insufficient \n\nnumber of eligible providers of youth workforce investment activities \n\nin the local area, such as a rural area, the Local Board may award \n\ngrants or contracts on a sole source basis (WIOA sec. 123(b)).\n\n    (b) The requirement in WIOA sec. 123 that eligible providers of \n\nyouth services be selected by awarding a grant or contract on a \n\ncompetitive basis does not apply to the design framework services when \n\nthese services are more appropriately provided by the grant recipient/\n\nfiscal agent. Design framework services include intake, objective \n\nassessments and the development of individual service strategy, case \n\nmanagement, and follow-up services.\n\nSec.  681.410  Does the requirement that a State and local area expend \nat least 75 percent of youth funds to provide services to out-of-school \n\n\n\nyouth apply to all youth funds?\n\n    Yes. The 75 percent requirement applies to both statewide youth \n\nactivities funds and local youth funds with two exceptions.\n\n    (a) Only statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are \n\nsubject to the OSY expenditure requirement.\n\n[[Page 20866]]\n\nFunds spent on statewide youth activities that do not provide direct \n\nservices to youth, such as most of the required statewide youth \n\nactivities listed in WIOA sec. 129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY \n\nexpenditure requirement. For example, administrative costs, monitoring, \n\nand technical assistance are not subject to OSY expenditure \n\nrequirement; while funds spent on direct services to youth such as \n\nstatewide demonstration projects, are subject to the OSY expenditure \n\nrequirement.\n\n    (b) For a State that receives a small State minimum allotment under \n\nWIOA sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) or WIOA sec. 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II), the \n\nState may submit a request to the Secretary to decrease the percentage \n\nto a percentage not less than 50 percent for a local area in the State, \n\nand the Secretary may approve such a request for that program year, if \n\nthe State meets the following requirements:\n\n    (1) After an analysis of the in-school youth and out-of-school \n\nyouth populations in the local area, the State determines that the \n\nlocal area will be unable to use at least 75 percent of the local area \n\nWIOA youth funds to serve out-of-school youth due to a low number of \n\nout-of-school youth; and\n\n    (2) The State submits to the Secretary, for the local area, a \n\nrequest including a proposed percentage decreased to not less than 50 \n\npercent to provide workforce investment activities for out-of-school \n\nyouth.\n\n    (c) In the exercise of the discretion afforded by WIOA sec. \n\n129(a)(4) the Secretary has determined that requests to decrease the \n\npercentage of funds used to provide activities to OSY will not be \n\ngranted to States based on their having received 90 percent of the \n\nallotment percentage for the preceding year. Therefore, when the \n\nSecretary receives such a request from a State based on having received \n\n90 percent of the allotment percentage for the preceding year, the \n\nrequest will be denied without the Secretary exercising further \n\ndiscretion.\n\n    (d) For local area funds, the administrative costs of carrying out \n\nlocal workforce investment activities described in WIOA sec. 128(b)(4) \n\n\n\nare not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. All other local \n\narea youth funds beyond the administrative costs are subject to the OSY \n\nexpenditure requirement.\n\nSec.  681.420  How must Local Boards design Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act youth programs?\n\n    (a) The design framework services of local youth programs must:\n\n    (1) Provide for an objective assessment of each youth participant \n\nthat meets the requirements of WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A), and includes a \n\nreview of the academic and occupational skill levels, as well as the \n\nservice needs, of each youth for the purpose of identifying appropriate \n\nservices and career pathways for participants and informing the \n\nindividual service strategy;\n\n    (2) Develop, and update as needed, an individual service strategy \n\nfor each youth participant that is directly linked to one or more \n\nindicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii), that \n\nidentifies appropriate career pathways that include education and \n\nemployment goals, that considers career planning and the results of the \n\nobjective assessment and that prescribes achievement objectives and \n\nservices for the participant; and\n\n    (3) Provides case management of youth participants, including \n\nfollow-up services.\n\n    (b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth \n\nprograms in the local area, and how the fourteen program elements \n\nrequired in Sec.  681.460 are to be made available within that \n\nframework.\n\n    (c) Local Boards must ensure appropriate links to entities that \n\nwill foster the participation of eligible local area youth. Such links \n\nmay include connections to:\n\n    (1) Local area justice and law enforcement officials;\n\n    (2) Local public housing authorities;\n\n    (3) Local education agencies;\n\n    (4) Local human service agencies;\n\n    (5) WIOA title II adult education providers;\n\n    (6) Local disability-serving agencies and providers and health and \n\nmental health providers;\n\n    (7) Job Corps representatives; and\n\n    (8) Representatives of other area youth initiatives, such as \n\nYouthBuild, and including those that serve homeless youth and other \n\npublic and private youth initiatives.\n\n    (d) Local Boards must ensure that WIOA youth service providers meet \n\n\n\nthe referral requirements in WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(A) for all youth \n\nparticipants, including:\n\n    (1) Providing these participants with information about the full \n\narray of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local \n\nBoard or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners; and\n\n    (2) Referring these participants to appropriate training and \n\neducational programs that have the capacity to serve them either on a \n\nsequential or concurrent basis.\n\n    (e) If a youth applies for enrollment in a program of workforce \n\ninvestment activities and either does not meet the enrollment \n\nrequirements for that program or cannot be served by that program, the \n\neligible provider of that program must ensure that the youth is \n\nreferred for further assessment, if necessary, or referred to \n\nappropriate programs to meet the skills and training needs of the \n\nyouth.\n\n    (f) In order to meet the basic skills and training needs of \n\napplicants who do not meet the eligibility requirements of a particular \n\nprogram or who cannot be served by the program, each youth provider \n\nmust ensure that these youth are referred:\n\n    (1) For further assessment, as necessary, and\n\n    (2) To appropriate programs, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of \n\nthis section. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(B))\n\n    (g) Local Boards must ensure that parents, youth participants, and \n\nother members of the community with experience relating to youth \n\nprograms are actively involved in both the design and implementation of \n\nits youth programs. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(C))\n\n    (h) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of \n\nthis section or the individual service strategy required under \n\nparagraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program \n\nprovider determines that it is appropriate to use a recent objective \n\nassessment or individual service strategy that was developed under \n\nanother education or training program. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A))\n\n    (i) The Local Board may implement a pay-for-performance contract \n\nstrategy for program elements described at Sec.  681.460, for which the \n\nLocal Board may reserve and use not more than 10 percent of the total \n\nfunds allocated to the local area under WIOA sec. 128(b). For \n\nadditional rules on pay-for-performance contracts see Sec.  683.500.\n\nSec.  681.430  May youth participate in both the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act youth and adult programs concurrently, and how do \nlocal program operators track concurrent enrollment in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act youth and adult programs?\n\n\n\n    (a) Yes, individuals who meet the respective program eligibility \n\nrequirements may participate in adult and youth programs concurrently. \n\nSuch individuals must be eligible under the youth or adult eligibility \n\ncriteria applicable to the services received. Local program operators \n\nmay determine, for these individuals, the appropriate\n\n[[Page 20867]]\n\nlevel and balance of services under the youth and adult programs.\n\n    (b) Local program operators must identify and track the funding \n\nstreams which pay the costs of services provided to individuals who are \n\nparticipating in youth and adult programs concurrently, and ensure no \n\nduplication of services.\n\n    (c) Individuals who meet the respective program eligibility \n\nrequirements for WIOA youth title I and title II may participate in \n\ntitle I youth and title II concurrently.\n\nSec.  681.440  How does a local youth program determine if an 18 to 24 \nyear old is enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nyouth program or the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act adult \nprogram?\n\n    A local program should determine the appropriate program for the \n\nparticipant based on the service needs of the participant and if the \n\nparticipant is career-ready based on an objective assessment of their \n\noccupational skills, prior work experience, employability, and \n\nparticipants needs as required in WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A).\n\nSec.  681.450  For how long must a local Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act youth program serve a participant?\n\n    Local youth programs must provide service to a participant for the \n\namount of time necessary to ensure successful preparation to enter \n\npost-secondary education and/or unsubsidized employment. While there is \n\nno minimum or maximum time a youth can participate in the WIOA youth \n\nprogram, programs must link participation to the individual service \n\nstrategy and not the timing of youth service provider contracts or \n\nprogram years.\n\nSec.  681.460  What services must local programs offer to youth \nparticipants?\n\n    (a) Local programs must make each of the following 14 services \n\navailable to youth participants (WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)):\n\n    (1) Tutoring, study skills training, instruction and evidence-based \n\ndropout prevention and recovery strategies that lead to completion of \n\nthe requirements for a secondary school diploma or its recognized \n\n\n\nequivalent (including a recognized certificate of attendance or similar \n\ndocument for individuals with disabilities) or for a recognized post-\n\nsecondary credential;\n\n    (2) Alternative secondary school services, or dropout recovery \n\nservices, as appropriate;\n\n    (3) Paid and unpaid work experiences that have academic and \n\noccupational education as a component of the work experience, which may \n\ninclude the following types of work experiences:\n\n    (i) Summer employment opportunities and other employment \n\nopportunities available throughout the school year;\n\n    (ii) Pre-apprenticeship programs;\n\n    (iii) Internships and job shadowing; and\n\n    (iv) On-the-job training opportunities;\n\n    (4) Occupational skill training, which includes priority \n\nconsideration for training programs that lead to recognized post-\n\nsecondary credentials that align with in-demand industry sectors or \n\noccupations in the local area involved, if the Local Board determines \n\nthat the programs meet the quality criteria described in WIOA sec. 123;\n\n    (5) Education offered concurrently with and in the same context as \n\nworkforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation \n\nor occupational cluster;\n\n    (6) Leadership development opportunities, including community \n\nservice and peer-centered activities encouraging responsibility and \n\nother positive social and civic behaviors;\n\n    (7) Supportive services, including the services listed in Sec.  \n\n681.570;\n\n    (8) Adult mentoring for a duration of at least 12 months, that may \n\noccur both during and after program participation;\n\n    (9) Follow-up services for not less than 12 months after the \n\ncompletion of participation, as provided in Sec.  681.580;\n\n    (10) Comprehensive guidance and counseling, which may include drug \n\nand alcohol abuse counseling, as well as referrals to counseling, as \n\nappropriate to the needs of the individual youth;\n\n    (11) Financial literacy education;\n\n    (12) Entrepreneurial skills training;\n\n    (13) Services that provide labor market and employment information \n\nabout in-demand industry sectors or occupations available in the local \n\narea, such as career awareness, career counseling, and career \n\nexploration services; and\n\n    (14) Activities that help youth prepare for and transition to post-\n\nsecondary education and training.\n\n    (b) Local programs have the discretion to determine what specific \n\n\n\nprogram services a youth participant receives, based on each \n\nparticipant's objective assessment and individual service strategy. \n\nLocal programs are not required to provide every program service to \n\neach participant.\n\nSec.  681.470  Does the Department require local programs to use WIOA \nfunds for each of the 14 program elements?\n\n    No. The Department does not require local programs to use WIOA \n\nyouth funds for each of the program elements. Local programs may \n\nleverage partner resources to provide some of the readily available \n\nprogram elements. However, the local area must ensure that if a program \n\nelement is not funded with WIOA title I youth funds, the local program \n\nhas an agreement in place with a partner organization to ensure that \n\nthe program element will be offered. The Local Board must ensure that \n\nthe program element is closely connected and coordinated with the WIOA \n\nyouth program.\n\nSec.  681.480  What is a pre-apprenticeship program?\n\n    A pre-apprenticeship is a program or set of strategies designed to \n\nprepare individuals to enter and succeed in a registered apprenticeship \n\nprogram and has a documented partnership with at least one, if not \n\nmore, registered apprenticeship program(s).\n\nSec.  681.490  What is adult mentoring?\n\n    (a) Adult mentoring for youth must:\n\n    (1) Last at least 12 months and may take place both during the \n\nprogram and following exit from the program;\n\n    (2) Be a formal relationship between a youth participant and an \n\nadult mentor that includes structured activities where the mentor \n\noffers guidance, support, and encouragement to develop the competence \n\nand character of the mentee;\n\n    (3) Include a mentor who is an adult other than the assigned youth \n\ncase manager; and\n\n    (4) While group mentoring activities and mentoring through \n\nelectronic means are allowable as part of the mentoring activities, at \n\na minimum, the local youth program must match the youth with an \n\nindividual mentor with whom the youth interacts on a face-to-face \n\nbasis.\n\n    (b) Mentoring may include workplace mentoring where the local \n\nprogram matches a youth participant with an employer or employee of a \n\ncompany.\n\n\n\nSec.  681.500  What is financial literacy education?\n\n    The financial literacy education program element includes \n\nactivities which:\n\n    (a) Support the ability of participants to create budgets, initiate \n\nchecking and savings accounts at banks, and make informed financial \n\ndecisions;\n\n    (b) Support participants in learning how to effectively manage \n\nspending, credit, and debt, including student loans, consumer credit, \n\nand credit cards;\n\n    (c) Teach participants about the significance of credit reports and \n\ncredit scores; what their rights are regarding their credit and \n\nfinancial information; how to determine the accuracy of a credit report \n\nand how to correct inaccuracies; and how to improve or maintain good \n\ncredit;\n\n[[Page 20868]]\n\n    (d) Support a participant's ability to understand, evaluate, and \n\ncompare financial products, services, and opportunities and to make \n\ninformed financial decisions;\n\n    (e) Educate participants about identity theft, ways to protect \n\nthemselves from identify theft, and how to resolve cases of identity \n\ntheft and in other ways understand their rights and protections related \n\nto personal identity and financial data;\n\n    (f) Support activities that address the particular financial \n\nliteracy needs of non-English speakers, including providing the support \n\nthrough the development and distribution of multilingual financial \n\nliteracy and education materials;\n\n    (g) Provide financial education that is age appropriate, timely, \n\nand provides opportunities to put lessons into practice, such as by \n\naccess to safe and affordable financial products that enable money \n\nmanagement and savings; and\n\n    (h) Implement other approaches to help participants gain the \n\nknowledge, skills, and confidence to make informed financial decisions \n\nthat enable them to attain greater financial health and stability by \n\nusing high quality, age-appropriate, and relevant strategies and \n\nchannels, including, where possible, timely and customized information, \n\nguidance, tools, and instruction.\n\nSec.  681.510  What is comprehensive guidance and counseling?\n\n    Comprehensive guidance and counseling provides individualized \n\ncounseling to participants.

Positive social and civic behaviors focus on \n\nareas that may include the following:\n\n    (a) Positive attitudinal development;\n\n    (b) Self-esteem building;\n\n    (c) Openness to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds;\n\n    (d) Maintaining healthy lifestyles, including being alcohol- and \n\ndrug-free;\n\n    (e) Maintaining positive social relationships with responsible \n\nadults and peers, and contributing to the well-being of one's \n\ncommunity, including voting;\n\n    (f) Maintaining a commitment to learning and academic success;\n\n    (g) Avoiding delinquency;\n\n    (h) Postponing parenting and responsible parenting, including child \n\n\n\nsupport education;\n\n    (i) Positive job attitudes and work skills; and\n\n    (j) Keeping informed in community affairs and current events.\n\nSec.  681.540  What is occupational skills training?\n\n    (a) The Department defines occupational skills training as an \n\norganized program of study that provides specific vocational skills \n\nthat lead to proficiency in performing actual tasks and technical \n\nfunctions required by certain occupational fields at entry, \n\nintermediate, or advanced levels. Local areas must give priority \n\nconsideration to training programs that lead to recognized post-\n\nsecondary credentials that align with in-demand industry sectors or \n\noccupations in the local area. Such training must:\n\n    (1) be outcome-oriented and focused on an occupational goal \n\nspecified in the individual service strategy;\n\n    (2) be of sufficient duration to impart the skills needed to meet \n\nthe occupational goal; and\n\n    (3) result in attainment of a recognized post-secondary credential.\n\n    (b) The chosen occupational skills training must meet the quality \n\nstandards in WIOA sec. 123.\n\nSec.  681.550  Are Individual Training Accounts permitted for youth \nparticipants?\n\n    Yes. In order to enhance individual participant choice in their \n\neducation and training plans and provide flexibility to service \n\nproviders, the Department allows WIOA ITAs for out-of-school youth, \n\nages 18 to 24 using WIOA youth funds when appropriate.\n\nSec.  681.560  What is entrepreneurial skills training and how is it \ntaught?\n\n    Entrepreneurial skills training provides the basics of starting and \n\noperating a small business.\n\n    (a) Such training must develop the skills associated with \n\nentrepreneurship. Such skills include, but are not limited to, the \n\nability to:\n\n    (1) Take initiative;\n\n    (2) Creatively seek out and identify business opportunities;\n\n    (3) Develop budgets and forecast resource needs;\n\n    (4) Understand various options for acquiring capital and the trade-\n\noffs associated with each option; and\n\n    (5) Communicate effectively and market oneself and one's ideas.\n\n    (b) Approaches to teaching youth entrepreneurial skills include, \n\nbut are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n    (1) Entrepreneurship education that provides an introduction to the \n\nvalues and basics of starting and running a business. Entrepreneurship \n\neducation programs often guide youth through the development of a \n\nbusiness plan and may also include simulations of business start-up and \n\noperation.\n\n    (2) Enterprise development which provides supports and services \n\nthat incubate and help youth develop their own businesses. Enterprise \n\ndevelopment programs go beyond entrepreneurship education by helping \n\nyouth access small loans or grants that are needed to begin business \n\noperation and by providing more individualized attention to the \n\ndevelopment of viable business ideas.\n\n    (3) Experiential programs that provide youth with experience in the \n\nday-to-day operation of a business. These programs may involve the \n\ndevelopment of a youth-run business that young people participating in \n\nthe program work in and manage. Or, they may facilitate placement in \n\napprentice or internship positions with adult entrepreneurs in the \n\ncommunity.\n\nSec.  681.570  What are supportive services for youth?\n\n    Supportive services for youth, as defined in WIOA sec. 3(59), are \n\nservices\n\n[[Page 20869]]\n\nthat enable an individual to participate in WIOA activities. These \n\nservices include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n    (a) Linkages to community services;\n\n    (b) Assistance with transportation;\n\n    (c) Assistance with child care and dependent care;\n\n    (d) Assistance with housing;\n\n    (e) Needs-related payments;\n\n    (f) Assistance with educational testing;\n\n    (g) Reasonable accommodations for youth with disabilities;\n\n    (h) Referrals to health care; and\n\n    (i) Assistance with uniforms or other appropriate work attire and \n\nwork-related tools, including such items as eye glasses and protective \n\neye gear.\n\nSec.  681.580  What are follow-up services for youth?\n\n    (a) Follow-up services are critical services provided following a \n\nyouth's exit from the program to help ensure the youth is successful in \n\nemployment and/or post-secondary education and training.\n\n    (b) Follow-up services for youth may include:\n\n\n\n    (1) The leadership development and supportive service activities \n\nlisted in Sec. Sec.  681.520 and 681.570;\n\n    (2) Regular contact with a youth participant's employer, including \n\nassistance in addressing work-related problems that arise;\n\n    (3) Assistance in securing better paying jobs, career pathway \n\ndevelopment, and further education or training;\n\n    (4) Work-related peer support groups;\n\n    (5) Adult mentoring; and/or\n\n    (6) Services necessary to ensure the success of youth participants \n\nin employment and/or post-secondary education.\n\n    (c) All youth participants must receive some form of follow-up \n\nservices for a minimum duration of 12 months. Follow-up services may be \n\nprovided beyond 12 months at the State or Local Board's discretion. The \n\ntypes of services provided and the duration of services must be \n\ndetermined based on the needs of the individual and therefore, the type \n\nand intensity of follow-up services may differ for each participant. \n\nHowever, follow-up services must include more than only a contact \n\nattempted or made for securing documentation in order to report a \n\nperformance outcome. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(I))\n\nSec.  681.590  What is the work experience priority?\n\n    Local youth programs must expend not less than 20 percent of the \n\nfunds allocated to them to provide in-school youth and out-of-school \n\nyouth with paid and unpaid work experiences that fall under the \n\ncategories listed in Sec.  681.460(a)(3) and further defined in Sec.  \n\n681.600. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(4))\n\nSec.  681.600  What are work experiences?\n\n    (a) Work experiences are a planned, structured learning experience \n\nthat takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Work \n\nexperience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience may \n\ntake place in the private for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or \n\nthe public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience where \n\nan employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor \n\nStandards Act or applicable State law, exists. Work experiences provide \n\nthe youth participant with opportunities for career exploration and \n\nskill development.\n\n    (b) Work experiences must include academic and occupational \n\n\n\neducation.\n\n    (c) The types of work experiences include the following categories:\n\n    (1) Summer employment opportunities and other employment \n\nopportunities available throughout the school year;\n\n    (2) Pre-apprenticeship programs;\n\n    (3) Internships and job shadowing; and\n\n    (4) On-the-job training opportunities as defined in WIOA sec. 3(44) \n\nand in Sec.  680.700.\n\nSec.  681.610  How will local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\nyouth programs track the work experience priority?\n\n    Local WIOA youth programs must track program funds spent on paid \n\nand unpaid work experiences, including wages and staff costs for the \n\ndevelopment and management of work experiences, and report such \n\nexpenditures as part of the local WIOA youth financial reporting. The \n\npercentage of funds spent on work experience is calculated based on the \n\ntotal local area youth funds expended for work experience rather than \n\ncalculated separately for in-school and out-of-school youth. Local area \n\nadministrative costs are not subject to the 20 percent minimum work \n\nexperience expenditure requirement.\n\nSec.  681.620  Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nrequire Local Boards to offer summer employment opportunities in the \nlocal youth program?\n\n    No, WIOA does not require Local Boards to offer summer youth \n\nemployment opportunities as summer employment is no longer its own \n\nprogram element under WIOA. However, WIOA does require Local Boards to \n\noffer work experience opportunities using at least 20 percent of their \n\nfunding, which may include summer employment.\n\nSec.  681.630  How are summer employment opportunities administered?\n\n    Summer employment opportunities are a component of the work \n\nexperience program element. Providers administering the work experience \n\nprogram element must be selected by the Local Board by awarding a grant \n\nor contract on a competitive basis as described in WIOA sec. 123, based \n\non criteria contained in the State Plan. However, the summer employment \n\nadministrator does not need to select the employers who are providing \n\nthe employment opportunities through a competitive process.\n\nSec.  681.640  What does education offered concurrently with and in the \n\n\n\nsame context as workforce preparation activities and training for a \n\nspecific occupation or occupational cluster mean?\n\n    This program element reflects the integrated education and training \n\nmodel and requires integrated education and training to occur \n\nconcurrently and contextually with workforce preparation activities and \n\nworkforce training. This program element describes how workforce \n\npreparations activities, basic academic skills, and hands-on \n\noccupational skills training are to be taught within the same time \n\nframe and connected to training in a specific occupation, occupational \n\ncluster, or career pathway. (WIOA sec. 129(c)(2)(E))\n\nSec.  681.650  Does the Department allow incentive payments for youth \nparticipants?\n\n    Yes, the Department allows incentive payments to youth participants \n\nfor recognition and achievement directly tied to training activities \n\nand work experiences. The local program must have written policies and \n\nprocedures in place governing the awarding of incentives and must \n\nensure that such incentive payments are:\n\n    (a) Tied to the goals of the specific program;\n\n    (b) Outlined in writing before the commencement of the program that \n\nmay provide incentive payments;\n\n    (c) Align with the local program's organizational policies; and\n\n    (d) Accord with the requirements contained in 2 CFR 200.\n\nSec.  681.660  How can parents, youth, and other members of the \ncommunity get involved in the design and implementation of local youth \nprograms?\n\n    Local Boards and programs must provide opportunities for parents, \n\nparticipants, and other members of the\n\n[[Page 20870]]\n\ncommunity with experience working with youth to be involved in the \n\ndesign and implementation of youth programs. Parents, youth \n\nparticipants, and other members of the community can get involved in a \n\nnumber of ways including serving on youth standing committees, if they \n\nexist and they are appointed by the Local Board. They can also get \n\ninvolved by serving as mentors, serving as tutors, and providing input \n\ninto the design and implementation of other program design elements. \n\nLocal Boards must also make opportunities available to successful \n\nparticipants to volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors or in \n\nother activities.\n\nSubpart D--One-Stop Services to Youth\n\n\n\nSec.  681.700  What is the connection between the youth program and the \none-stop service delivery system?\n\n    (a) WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) requires that the youth program \n\nfunction as a required one-stop partner and fulfill the roles and \n\nresponsibilities of a one-stop partner described in WIOA sec. \n\n121(b)(1)(A).\n\n    (b) In addition to the provisions of 20 CFR part 678, connections \n\nbetween the youth program and the one-stop system may include those \n\nthat facilitate:\n\n    (1) The coordination and provision of youth activities;\n\n    (2) Linkages to the job market and employers;\n\n    (3) Access for eligible youth to the information and services \n\nrequired in Sec.  681.460;\n\n    (4) Services for non-eligible youth such as basic labor exchange \n\nservices, other self-service activities such as job searches, career \n\nexploration, use of career center resources, and referral as \n\nappropriate; and\n\n    (5) Other activities described in WIOA secs. 129(b)-(c).\n\n    (c) Local Boards must either collocate WIOA youth program staff at \n\none-stop centers and/or ensure one-stop centers and staff are equipped \n\nto advise youth in order to increase youth access to services and \n\nconnect youth to the program that best aligns with their needs.\n\nSec.  681.710  Do Local Boards have the flexibility to offer services \nto area youth who are not eligible under the youth program through the \none-stop centers?\n\n    Yes. However, Local Boards must ensure one-stop centers fund \n\nservices for non-eligible youth through programs authorized to provide \n\nservices to such youth. For example, one-stop centers may provide basic \n\nlabor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act to any youth.\n\n0\n\n9.

This \n\napplies when determining if a person is a ``low-income individual'' for \n\neligibility purposes (for example, in the WIOA youth, or NFJP \n\nprograms). Also, it applies when income is used as a factor when a \n\nlocal area provides priority of service for ``low-income individuals'' \n\nwith title I WIOA funds (see 20 CFR 680.600 and 20 CFR 680.650). \n\nQuestions regarding the application of 38 U.S.C. 4213 should be \n\ndirected to the Veterans' Employment and Training Service.\n\nSec.  683.235  May Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I \n\n\n\nfunds be spent for construction?\n\n    WIOA title I funds must not be spent on construction, purchase of \n\nfacilities or buildings, or other capital expenditures for improvements \n\nto land or buildings, except with the prior written approval of the \n\nSecretary.\n\nSec.  683.240  What are the instructions for using real property with \nFederal equity?\n\n    (a) SESA properties.

When such real property \n\nis no longer needed as described in the previous sentence, the State \n\nmust request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer prior to \n\ndisposition or sale.\n\n    (c) Job Training Partnership Act-funded properties. Real property \n\nthat was purchased with JTPA funds and transferred to WIA, is now \n\ntransferred to the WIOA title I programs and must be used for WIOA \n\n\n\npurposes. When such real property is no longer needed for the \n\nactivities of WIOA, the recipient or subrecipient must seek \n\ninstructions from the Grant Officer or State (in the case of a \n\nsubrecipient) prior to disposition or sale.\n\nSec.  683.245  Are employment generating activities, or similar \nactivities, allowable under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct title I?\n\n    (a) Under sec. 181(e) of WIOA, title I funds must not be spent on \n\nemployment generating activities, investment in revolving loan funds, \n\ncapitalization of businesses, investment in contract bidding resource \n\ncenters, economic development activities, or similar activities, unless \n\nthey are directly related to training for eligible individuals.

Under \n\nthat subpart, such assistance may be used for such employment or \n\ntraining only when the assistance is provided indirectly within the \n\nmeaning of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and not \n\nwhen the assistance is provided directly. That subpart also contains \n\nrequirements related to equal treatment in Department of Labor programs \n\nfor religious organizations, and to protecting the religious liberty of \n\nDepartment of Labor social service providers and beneficiaries.

If the Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of \n\nthe situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient.\n\n[[Page 20886]]\n\nThis notification constitutes final agency action.\n\n    (2) Inadequate resolution. If the direct recipient's response and \n\nactions to resolve the findings are found to be inadequate, the Grant \n\nOfficer will begin the Grant Officer resolution process under Sec.  \n\n683.440.\n\n    (b) Audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be resolved through the Grant \n\nOfficer resolution process, as discussed in Sec.  683.440.\n\nSec.  683.440  What is the Grant Officer resolution process?\n\n    (a) General. When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the a \n\nrecipient's disposition of an audit or other resolution of findings \n\n(including those arising out of site visits, incident reports or \n\ncompliance reviews), or with the recipient's response to findings \n\nresulting from investigations or monitoring reports, the initial and \n\nfinal determination process as set forth in this section is used to \n\nresolve the matter.\n\n    (b) Initial determination. The Grant Officer makes an initial \n\ndetermination on the findings for both those matters where there is \n\nagreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's \n\nresolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or \n\nactivities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements \n\nof WIOA, Wagner-Peyser, and applicable regulations, and the terms and \n\nconditions of the grants, contracts, or other agreements under the \n\naward.\n\n    (c) Informal resolution. Except in an emergency situation, when the \n\nSecretary invokes the authority described in sec. 184(e) of WIOA, the \n\nGrant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, \n\nnor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing \n\nthe recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments \n\nto resolve informally those matters in dispute contained in the initial \n\ndetermination. The initial determination must provide for an informal \n\nresolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial \n\ndetermination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant \n\nOfficer must issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this \n\nsection which notifies the parties in writing of the nature of the \n\nresolution and may close the file.\n\n    (d) Final determination. (1) Upon completion of the informal \n\n\n\nresolution process, the Grant Officer provides each party with a \n\nwritten final determination by certified mail, return receipt \n\nrequested. For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients \n\nwhich receive WIOA funds directly from the Department, ordinarily, the \n\nfinal determination is issued not later than 180 days from the date \n\nthat the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved \n\naudit report to the Employment and Training Administration. For audits \n\nof subrecipients conducted by the OIG, ordinarily the final \n\ndetermination is issued not later than 360 days from the date the OIG \n\nissues the final approved audit report to ETA.\n\n    (2) A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:\n\n    (i) Indicate whether efforts to resolve informally matters \n\ncontained in the initial determination have been unsuccessful;\n\n    (ii) List those matters upon which the parties continue to \n\ndisagree;\n\n    (iii) List any modifications to the factual findings and \n\nconclusions set forth in the initial determination and the rationale \n\nfor such modifications;\n\n    (iv) Establish a debt, if appropriate;\n\n    (v) Require corrective action, when needed;\n\n    (vi) Determine liability, method of restitution of funds, and \n\nsanctions; and\n\n    (vii) Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Sec.  \n\n683.800.\n\n    (3) Unless a hearing is requested, a final determination under this \n\nparagraph (d) is final agency action and is not subject to further \n\nreview.\n\nSubpart E--Pay-for-Performance Contract Strategies\n\nSec.  683.500  What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-\n\nfor-Performance contract strategy?\n\n    (a) A WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is a specific type \n\nof performance-based contract strategy that has four distinct \n\ncharacteristics:\n\n    (1) It is a strategy to use WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts as \n\nthey are described in Sec.  683.510;\n\n    (2) It must include the identification of the problem space and \n\ntarget populations for which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-\n\nPerformance contract strategy; the outcomes the local area would hope \n\nto achieve through a Pay-for-Performance contract relative to baseline \n\n\n\nperformance; the acceptable cost to government associated with \n\nimplementing such a strategy; and a feasibility study to determine \n\nwhether the intervention is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance \n\ncontracting strategy;\n\n    (3) It must include a strategy for independently validating the \n\nperformance outcomes achieved under each contract within the strategy \n\nprior to payment occurring;\n\n    (4) It must include a description of how the State or local area \n\nwill reallocate funds to other activities under the contract strategy \n\nin the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks \n\nunder a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract.\n\n    (b) The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy must be \n\ndeveloped in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary.\n\nSec.  683.510  What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-\nfor-Performance contract?\n\n    (a) Pay-for-Performance contract.

WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts must include \n\nindependent validation of the contractor's achievement of the \n\nperformance benchmarks specified in the contract. (WIOA sec. 3(47)(B)) \n\nThis validation must be based on high-quality, reliable, and verified \n\ndata.\n\n    (k) Guidance. The Secretary may issue additional guidance related \n\nto use of WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts.\n\nSec.  683.520  What funds can be used to support Workforce Innovation \n\nand Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategies?\n\n    (a) For WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies providing \n\nadults and dislocated worker training services, funds allocated under \n\nsecs. 133(b)(2)-(3) of WIOA can be used.

and\n\n    (ii) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been \n\ndocumented that further attempts at debt collection from the \n\nperpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile;\n\n    (4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows \n\nthe misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process has been exhausted, \n\nand a debt has been established; and\n\n    (5) The recipient provides documentation to demonstrate that it has \n\nsubstantially complied with the requirements of WIOA sec. 184(d)(2) and \n\nthis section.\n\n    (d) The recipient will not be released from liability for misspent \n\nfunds under the determination required by WIOA sec. 184(d) unless the \n\nGrant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the \n\nrecipient or subrecipient(s), would be inappropriate or would prove \n\nfutile.\n\nSec.  683.740  What is the procedure to handle a recipient of title I \n\n\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds' request for advance \napproval of contemplated corrective actions?\n\n    (a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant \n\nOfficer for contemplated corrective actions, including debt collection \n\nactions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The \n\nrecipient's request must include a description and an assessment of all \n\nactions taken to collect the misspent funds.\n\n    (b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may \n\ndetermine that the recipient may forego certain debt collection actions \n\nagainst a subrecipient when:\n\n    (1) The subrecipient meets the criteria set forth in WIOA sec. \n\n184(d)(2);\n\n    (2) The misexpenditure of funds:\n\n    (i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that \n\nreceived WIOA funds from that subrecipient;\n\n    (ii) Was not a violation of WIOA sec. 184(d)(1), did not constitute \n\nfraud, or failure to disclose, in a timely manner, all violations of \n\nFederal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations \n\npotentially affecting the Federal award; or\n\n    (iii) If fraud did exist,\n\n    (A) It was perpetrated against the subrecipient;\n\n    (B) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and \n\ncooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and\n\n    (C) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented \n\nthat further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the \n\nfraud would be inappropriate or futile;\n\n    (3) A determination which disallows the misexpenditure and \n\nestablishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate level; and,\n\n    (4) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the \n\nrecipient would be either inappropriate or futile.\n\nSec.  683.750  What procedure must be used for administering the \noffset/deduction provisions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct?\n\n    (a)(1) For misexpenditures by direct recipients of title I and \n\nWagner-Peyser formula funds the Grant Officer may determine that a \n\ndebt, or a portion thereof, may be offset against amounts that are \n\nallotted to the recipient. Recipients must submit a written request for \n\nan offset to the Grant Officer. Generally, the Grant Officer will apply \n\nthe offset against amounts that are available at the recipient level \n\nfor administrative costs.\n\n    (2) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under \n\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section, if the misexpenditures were not due \n\n\n\nto willful disregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, \n\nfraud, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of \n\nadministration or a pattern of misexpenditure.\n\n    (b) For subrecipient misexpenditures that were not due to willful \n\ndisregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, fraud, gross \n\nnegligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or \n\na pattern of misexpenditure, if the Grant Officer has required the \n\nState to repay or offset such amount, the State may deduct an amount \n\nequal to the misexpenditure from the subrecipient's allocation of the \n\nprogram year after the determination was made. Deductions are to be \n\nmade\n\n[[Page 20891]]\n\nfrom funds reserved for the administrative costs of the local programs \n\ninvolved, as appropriate.\n\n    (c) If offset is granted, the debt will not be fully satisfied \n\nuntil the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to the recipient by \n\nthe amount of the misexpenditure.\n\n    (d) For recipients of funds under title I and Wagner-Peyser funds, \n\na direct recipient may not make a deduction under paragraph (b) of this \n\nsection until the State has taken appropriate corrective action to \n\nensure full compliance within the local area with regard to appropriate \n\nexpenditure of WIOA funds.\n\nSubpart H--Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review\n\nSec.  683.800  What actions of the Department may be appealed to the \nOffice of Administrative Law Judges?\n\n    (a) An applicant for financial assistance under title I of WIOA who \n\nis dissatisfied by a determination not to award Federal financial \n\nassistance, in whole or in part, to such applicant; or a recipient, \n\nsubrecipient, or a contractor against which the Grant Officer has \n\ndirectly imposed a sanction or corrective action under sec. 184 of \n\nWIOA, including a sanction against a State under 20 CFR part 677, may \n\nappeal to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law \n\nJudges (OALJ) within 21 days of receipt of the final determination.\n\n    (b) Failure to request a hearing within 21 days of receipt of the \n\nfinal determination constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.\n\n    (c) A request for a hearing under this subpart must specifically \n\nstate those issues or findings in the final determination upon which \n\nreview is requested. Issues or findings in the final determination not \n\nspecified for review, or the entire final determination when no hearing \n\nhas been requested within the 21 days, are considered resolved and not \n\nsubject to further review. Only alleged violations of the Act, its \n\n\n\nregulations, the grant or other agreement under the Act raised in the \n\nfinal determination and the request for hearing are subject to review.\n\n    (d) A request for a hearing must be transmitted by certified mail, \n\nreturn receipt requested, to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. \n\nDepartment of Labor, Suite 400, 800 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20001, \n\nwith one copy to the Departmental official who issued the \n\ndetermination.\n\n    (e) The procedures in this subpart apply in the case of a \n\ncomplainant who has engaged in the alternative dispute resolution \n\nprocess set forth in Sec.  683.840, if neither a settlement was reached \n\nnor a decision issued within the 60 days, except that the request for \n\nhearing before the OALJ must be filed within 15 days of the conclusion \n\nof the 60-day period provided in Sec.  683.840.

The rules of practice and \n\nprocedure promulgated by the OALJ at subpart A of 29 CFR part 18, \n\ngovern the conduct of hearings under this subpart. However, a request \n\nfor hearing under this subpart is not considered a complaint to which \n\nthe filing of an answer by the Department or a DOL agency or official \n\nis required. Technical rules of evidence will not apply to hearings \n\nconducted pursuant to this part. However, rules or principles designed \n\nto assure production of the most credible evidence available and to \n\nsubject testimony to cross-examination will apply.\n\n    (b) Prehearing procedures. In all cases, the Administrative Law \n\nJudge (ALJ) should encourage the use of prehearing procedures to \n\nsimplify and clarify facts and issues.\n\n    (c) Subpoenas. Subpoenas necessary to secure the attendance of \n\nwitnesses and the production of documents or other items at hearings \n\nmust be obtained from the ALJ and must be issued under the authority \n\ncontained in WIOA sec. 183(c), incorporating 15 U.S.C. 49.\n\n    (d) Timely submission of evidence. The ALJ must not permit the \n\nintroduction at the hearing of any documentation if it has not been \n\nmade available for review by the other parties to the proceeding either \n\nat the time ordered for any prehearing conference, or, in the absence \n\nof such an order, at least 3 weeks prior to the hearing date.\n\n    (e) Burden of production. The Grant Officer has the burden of \n\nproduction to support her or his decision. This burden is satisfied \n\n\n\nonce the Grant Officer prepares and files an administrative file in \n\nsupport of the decision which must be made part of the record. \n\nThereafter, the party or parties seeking to overturn the Grant \n\nOfficer's decision has the burden of persuasion.\n\nSec.  683.820  What authority does the Administrative Law Judge have in \nordering relief as an outcome of an administrative hearing?\n\n    (a) In ordering relief the ALJ has the full authority of the \n\nSecretary under the Act, except as described in paragraph (b) of this \n\nsection.\n\n    (b) In grant selection appeals of awards funded under WIOA title I, \n\nsubtitle D:\n\n    (1) If the Administrative Law Judge rules, under Sec.  683.800, \n\nthat the appealing organization should have been selected for an award, \n\nthe matter must be remanded to the Grant Officer. The Grant Officer \n\nmust, within 10 working days, determine whether the organization \n\ncontinues to meet the requirements of the applicable solicitation, \n\nwhether the funds which are the subject of the ALJ's decision will be \n\nawarded to the organization, and the timing of the award. In making \n\nthis determination, the Grant Officer must take into account disruption \n\nto participants, disruption to grantees, and the operational needs of \n\nthe program.\n\n    (2) If the Administrative Law Judge rules that additional \n\napplication review is required, the Grant Officer must implement that \n\nreview and, if a new organization is selected, follow the steps laid \n\nout in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine whether the grant \n\nfunds will be awarded to that organization.\n\n    (3) In the event that the Grant Officer determines that the funds \n\nwill not be awarded to the appealing organization for the reasons \n\ndiscussed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an organization which \n\ndoes not have an approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement will \n\nbe awarded its reasonable application preparation costs.\n\n    (4) If funds are awarded to the appealing organization, the Grant \n\nOfficer will notify the current grantee within 10 days. In addition, \n\nthe appealing organization is not entitled to the full grant amount but \n\nwill only receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been \n\nobligated by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and \n\nits subsequent closeout.\n\n    (5) In the event that an organization, other than the appealing \n\norganization, is adversely effected by the Grant Officer's \n\n\n\ndetermination upon completion of the additional application review \n\nunder paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that organization may appeal \n\nthat decision to the Office of Administrative Law Judges by following \n\nthe procedures set forth in Sec.  683.800.\n\n    (6) Any organization selected and/or funded under WIOA title I, \n\nsubtitle D, is subject to having its award removed\n\n[[Page 20892]]\n\nif an ALJ decision so orders. As part of this process, the Grant \n\nOfficer will provide instructions on transition and closeout to both \n\nthe newly selected grantee and to the grantee whose position is \n\naffected or which is being removed. All awardees must agree to the \n\nprovisions of this paragraph as a condition of accepting a grant award.\n\nSec.  683.830  When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a decision?\n\n    (a) The ALJ should render a written decision not later than 90 days \n\nafter the closing of the record.\n\n    (b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, \n\nwithin 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's \n\ndecision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review \n\nBoard (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 02-2012), \n\nspecifically identifying the procedure, fact, law or policy to which \n\nexception is taken. Any exception not specifically raised in the \n\npetition is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for \n\nreview must also be sent to the opposing party and if an applicant or \n\nrecipient, to the Grant Officer and the Grant Officer's Counsel at the \n\ntime of filing. Unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the \n\npetition for review, notifies the parties that the case has been \n\naccepted for review, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency \n\naction. Any case accepted by the ARB must be decided within 180 days of \n\nacceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the ALJ constitutes \n\nfinal agency action.\n\nSec.  683.840  Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that \nmay be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law Judges hearing?\n\n    (a) The parties to a complaint which has been filed according to \n\nthe requirements of Sec.  683.800 may choose to waive their rights to \n\nan administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to \n\ntransfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to \n\nall parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts \n\nand render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written \n\ndecision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter \n\nfor informal review.\n\n\n\n    (b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ \n\ndescribed in paragraph (a) of this section will automatically be \n\nrevoked if a settlement has not been reached or a written decision has \n\nnot been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this \n\nsection.\n\n    (c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will \n\nbe treated as a final decision of an Administrative Law Judge under \n\nWIOA sec. 186(b).\n\nSec.  683.850  Is there judicial review of a final order of the \nSecretary issued under WIOA?\n\n    (a) Any party to a proceeding which resulted in a Secretary's final \n\norder under WIOA sec. 186 in which the Secretary awards, declines to \n\naward, or only conditionally awards financial assistance or with \n\nrespect to a corrective action or sanction imposed under WIOA sec. 184 \n\nmay obtain a review in the United States Court of Appeals having \n\njurisdiction over the applicant or recipient of funds involved, by \n\nfiling a review petition within 30 days of the issuance of the \n\nSecretary's final order in accordance with WIOA sec. 187.\n\n    (b) The court has jurisdiction to make and enter a decree \n\naffirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the Secretary, in \n\nwhole or in part.\n\n    (c) No objection to the Secretary's order may be considered by the \n\ncourt unless the objection was specifically urged, in a timely manner, \n\nbefore the Secretary. The review is limited to questions of law, and \n\nthe findings of fact of the Secretary are conclusive if supported by \n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n    (d) The judgment of the court is final, subject to certiorari \n\nreview by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n0\n\n11.

Services should be \n\nprovided in a culturally appropriate manner, consistent with the \n\nprinciples of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \n\nAct (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.). (WIOA sec. 166(a)(2)).\n\nSec.  684.110  How must Indian and Native American programs be \nadministered?\n\n    (a) INA programs will be administered to maximize the Federal \n\ncommitment to support the growth and development of INAs and their \n\ncommunities as determined by representatives of such communities.\n\n    (b) In administering these programs, the Department will follow the \n\nCongressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-\n\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. 450a, as well \n\nas the Department of Labor's ``American Indian and Alaska Native \n\nPolicies.\n\n    (c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the \n\ntrust responsibilities of the Federal government to federally-\n\nrecognized tribes in any way.\n\n    (d) The Department will administer INA programs through a single \n\norganizational unit and consistent with the requirements in sec. 166(i) \n\nof WIOA. The Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) \n\nwithin the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is designated \n\nas this single organizational unit as required by sec. 166(i)(1) of \n\nWIOA.\n\n    (e) The Department will establish and maintain administrative \n\nprocedures for the selection, administration, monitoring, and \n\nevaluation of INA employment and training programs authorized under \n\nthis Act.\n\nSec.  684.120  What obligation does the Department have to consult with \nthe Indian and Native American grantee community in developing rules, \nregulations, and standards of accountability for Indian and Native \nAmerican programs?\n\n    The Department's primary consultation vehicle for INA programs is \n\nthe Native American Employment and Training Council. The Department \n\nwill consult with the INA grantee community in developing policies for \n\nthe INA programs, actively seeking and considering the views of INA \n\ngrantees prior to establishing INA program policies and regulations. \n\n\n\n(WIOA sec. 166(i)(4)).

The \n\nrequirement to submit a 4-year plan does not apply to entities that \n\nhave been granted approval to transfer their WIOA funds to the \n\nDepartment of Interior pursuant to Public Law 102-477.\n\nSec.  684.230  What appeal rights are available to entities that are \ndenied a grant award?\n\n    Any entity that is denied a grant award for which it applied in \n\nwhole or in part may appeal the denial to the Office of the \n\nAdministrative Law Judges using the procedures at 20 CFR 683.800 or the \n\nalternative dispute resolution procedures at 20 CFR 683.840. The Grant \n\nOfficer will provide an entity whose request for a grant award was \n\ndenied, in whole or in part, with a copy of the appeal procedures.\n\nSec.  684.240  Are there any other ways in which an entity may be \nawarded a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?\n\n    Yes. For areas that would otherwise go unserved, the Grant Officer \n\nmay designate an entity, which has not submitted a competitive \n\napplication, but which meets the qualifications for a grant award, to \n\nserve the particular geographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP \n\nwill seek the views of INA leaders in the community that would \n\notherwise go unserved before making the decision to designate the \n\nentity that would serve the community. DINAP will inform the Grant \n\nOfficer of the INA leaders' views. The Grant Officer will accommodate \n\nviews of INA leaders in such areas to the extent possible.\n\n[[Page 20895]]\n\nSec.  684.250  Can an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award \n\nbe terminated?\n\n    (a) Yes, the Grant Officer can terminate a grantee's award for \n\n\n\ncause, or the Secretary or another Department of Labor official \n\nconfirmed by the Senate can terminate a grantee's award in emergency \n\ncircumstances where termination is necessary to protect the integrity \n\nof Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program under \n\nsec. 184(e) of WIOA.\n\n    (b) The Grant Officer may terminate a grantee's award for cause \n\nonly if there is a substantial or persistent violation of the \n\nrequirements in WIOA or the WIOA regulations. The grantee must be \n\nprovided with written notice 60 days before termination, stating the \n\nspecific reasons why termination is proposed. The appeal procedures at \n\n20 CFR 683.800 apply.\n\nSec.  684.260  Does the Department have to award a grant for every part \nof the country?\n\n    No, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for a grant \n\naward in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, the \n\nDepartment will not award funds for that service area. The funds that \n\notherwise would have been allocated to that area under Sec.  684.270 \n\nwill be distributed to other INA program grantees, or used for other \n\nprogram purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). \n\nUnawarded funds used for technical assistance and training are in \n\naddition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved \n\nunder Sec.  684.270(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may \n\nbe restored during a subsequent grant award cycle, when and if a \n\ncurrent grantee or other eligible entity applies for a grant award to \n\nserve that area.\n\nSec.  684.270  How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds \nallocated to Indian and Native American program grantees?\n\n    (a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this \n\nsection and funds used for other program purposes under Sec.  684.260, \n\nall funds available for WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive \n\nworkforce investment services program at the beginning of a program \n\nyear will be allocated to INA program grantees for the geographic \n\nservice area(s) awarded to them through the grant competition.\n\n    (b) Each INA program grantee will receive the sum of the funds \n\ncalculated using the following formula:\n\n    (1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the \n\nbasis of the number of unemployed American Indian, Alaska Native and \n\nNative Hawaiian individuals in the grantee's geographic service area(s) \n\ncompared to all such unemployed persons in the United States.\n\n\n\n    (2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the \n\nbasis of the number of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native \n\nHawaiian individuals in poverty in the grantee's geographic service \n\narea(s) as compared to all such persons in poverty in the United \n\nStates.\n\n    (3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas are \n\nprovided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.\n\n    (c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the \n\nformula described in paragraph (b) of this section, based upon criteria \n\nto be described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the \n\nDepartment may utilize a hold harmless factor to reduce the disruption \n\nin grantee services which would otherwise result from changes in \n\nfunding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the \n\ngrantee community and the Native American Employment and Training \n\nCouncil.\n\n    (d) The Department may reallocate funds from one INA program \n\ngrantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve its area for any \n\nreason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal \n\n(political) strife, failure to adhere to or meet grant terms and \n\nconditions, or lack of ability or interest. If a grantee has excess \n\ncarry-in for a program year, the Department may also readjust the \n\nawards granted under the funding formula so that an amount that equals \n\nthe previous program year's carry-in will be allocated to another INA \n\nprogram grantee(s).\n\n    (e) The Department may reserve up to one percent of the funds \n\nappropriated under WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for any program year for \n\ntechnical assistance and training (TAT) purposes. It will consult with \n\nthe Native American Employment and Training Council in planning how the \n\nTAT funds will be used, designating activities to meet the unique needs \n\nof the INA communities served by the INA program. Section 166 grantees \n\nalso will have access to resources available to other Department \n\nprograms to the extent permitted under other law.\n\nSubpart C--Services to Customers\n\nSec.  684.300  Who is eligible to receive services under the Indian and \nNative American program?\n\n    (a) A person is eligible to receive services under the INA program \n\nif that person is:\n\n    (1) An Indian, as determined by a policy of the INA program \n\ngrantee.

Sec.  684.700 and 684.710, and is required for both \n\nadult and youth funds. As indicated in Sec.  684.710(c), additional \n\nplanning information required for applicants requesting supplemental \n\nyouth funding will be provided in the FOA. The Department envisions \n\nthat the strategy for youth funds will not be extensive; however, \n\ngrantees will be required to provide the number of youth it plans to \n\nserve and projected performance outcomes.

(WIOA sec.129(a)(2))\n\nSec.  684.440  How is funding for supplemental youth services \ndetermined?\n\n    (a) Supplemental youth funding will be allocated to eligible INA \n\nprogram grantees on the basis of the relative number of INA youth \n\nbetween the ages of 14 and 24 living in poverty in the grantee's \n\ngeographic service area compared to the number of INA youth between the \n\nages of 14 and 24 living in poverty in in all eligible geographic \n\nservice areas. The Department reserves the right to redefine the \n\nsupplemental youth funding stream in future program years, in \n\nconsultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council, \n\nas program experience warrants and as appropriate data become \n\navailable.\n\n    (b) The data used to implement this formula are provided by the \n\nU.S. Bureau of the Census.\n\n    (c) The hold harmless factor described in Sec.  684.270(c) also \n\napplies to supplemental youth services funding. This factor also will \n\nbe determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native \n\nAmerican Employment and Training Council.\n\n    (d) The reallocation provisions of Sec.  684.270(d) also apply to \n\nsupplemental youth services funding.\n\n    (e) Any supplemental youth services funds not allotted to a grantee \n\nor refused by a grantee may be used for the purposes outlined in Sec.  \n\n684.270(e), as described in Sec.  684.260.

However, it is \n\nunlawful to target services to subgroups on grounds prohibited by WIOA \n\nsec. 188 and 29 CFR part 37, including tribal affiliation (which is \n\nconsidered national origin). Outreach efforts, on the other hand, may \n\nbe targeted to any subgroups.\n\nSubpart G--Section 166 Planning/Funding Process\n\nSec.  684.700  What is the process for submitting a 4-year plan?\n\n    Every 4 years, INA program grantees must submit a 4-year strategy \n\nfor meeting the needs of INAs in accordance with WIOA sec. 166(e). This \n\nplan will be part of, and incorporated with, the 4-year competitive \n\nprocess described in WIOA sec. 166(c) and Sec.  684.220. Accordingly, \n\nspecific requirements for the submission of a 4-year plan will be \n\nprovided in a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) and will include \n\nthe information described at Sec.  684.710.\n\n\n\n[[Page 20900]]\n\nSec.  684.710  What information must be included in the 4-year plans as \n\npart of the competitive application?\n\n    (a) The 4-year plan, which will be submitted as part of the \n\ncompetitive process, must include the information required at WIOA \n\nsecs. 166(e)(2)-(5) which are:\n\n    (1) The population to be served;\n\n    (2) The education and employment needs of the population to be \n\nserved and the manner in which the activities to be provided will \n\nstrengthen the ability of the individuals served to obtain or retain \n\nunsubsidized employment leading to self-sufficiency;\n\n    (3) A description of the activities to be provided and the manner \n\nin which such activities are to be integrated with other appropriate \n\nactivities; and\n\n    (4) A description of the performance measures and expected levels \n\nof performance.\n\n    (b) The 4-year plan must also include any additional information \n\nrequested in the FOA.\n\n    (c) INA program grantees receiving supplemental youth funds will be \n\nrequired to provide additional information (at a minimum the number of \n\nyouth it plans to serve and the projected performance outcomes) in the \n\n4-year plan that describes a strategy for serving low-income, INA \n\nyouth. Additional information required for supplemental youth funding \n\nwill be identified in the FOA.\n\nSec.  684.720  When must the 4-year plan be submitted?\n\n    The 4-year plans will be submitted as part of the competitive FOA \n\nprocess described at Sec.  684.220. Accordingly, the due date for the \n\nsubmission of the 4-year plan will be specified in the FOA.\n\nSec.  684.730  How will the Department review and approve such plans?\n\n    (a) It is the Department's intent to approve a grantee's 4-year \n\nstrategic plan before the date on which funds for the program become \n\navailable unless:\n\n    (1) The planning documents do not contain the information specified \n\nin the regulations in this part and/or the FOA; or\n\n    (2) The services which the INA program grantee proposes are not \n\npermitted under WIOA or applicable regulations.\n\n    (b) After competitive grant selections have been made, the DINAP \n\noffice will assist INA grantees in resolving any outstanding issues \n\n\n\nwith the 4-year plan. However, the Department may delay funding to \n\ngrantees until all issues have been resolved. If the issues with the \n\napplication of an incumbent grantee cannot be solved, the Department \n\nwill reallocate funds from the grantee to other grantees that have an \n\napproved 4-year plan.

However, these funds may flow through the one-\n\nstop delivery system.\n\nSec.  652.205  May funds authorized under the Act be used to supplement \nfunding for labor exchange programs authorized under separate \nlegislation?\n\n    (a) Section 7(c) of the Act enables States to use funds authorized \n\nunder sec. 7(a) or 7(b) of the Act to supplement funding of any \n\nworkforce activity carried out under WIOA.\n\n    (b) Funds authorized under the Act may be used under sec. 7(c) to \n\nprovide additional funding to other activities authorized under WIOA \n\nif:\n\n    (1) The activity meets the requirements of the Act, and its own \n\nrequirements;\n\n    (2) The activity serves the same individuals as are served under \n\nthe Act;\n\n    (3) The activity provides services that are coordinated with \n\nservices under the Act; and\n\n\n\n    (4) The funds supplement, rather than supplant, funds provided from \n\nnon-Federal sources.\n\nSec.  652.206  May a State use funds authorized under the Act to \nprovide applicable ``career services,'' as defined in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act?\n\n    Yes, funds authorized under sec. 7(a) of the Act must be used to \n\nprovide basic career services as identified in Sec.  678.430(a) of this \n\nchapter and secs. 134(c)(2)(A)(i)-(xi) of WIOA, and may be used to \n\nprovide individualized career services as identified in Sec.  \n\n678.430(b) of this chapter and sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) of WIOA. Funds \n\nauthorized under sec. 7(b) of the Act may be used to provide career \n\nservices. Career services must be provided consistent with the \n\nrequirements of the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n\nSec.  652.207  How does a State meet the requirement for universal \naccess to services provided under the Act?\n\n    (a) A State has discretion in how it meets the requirement for \n\nuniversal access to services provided under the Act. In exercising this \n\ndiscretion, a State must meet the Act's requirements.\n\n    (b) These requirements are:\n\n    (1) Labor exchange services must be available to all employers and \n\njob seekers, including unemployment insurance (UI) claimants, veterans, \n\nmigrant and seasonal farmworkers, and individuals with disabilities;\n\n    (2) The State must have the capacity to deliver labor exchange \n\nservices to employers and job seekers, as described in the Act, on a \n\nstatewide basis through:\n\n    (i) Self-service, including virtual services;\n\n    (ii) Facilitated self-help service; and\n\n    (iii) Staff-assisted service;\n\n    (3) In each local workforce investment area, in at least one \n\ncomprehensive physical center, staff funded under the Act must provide \n\nlabor exchange services (including staff-assisted labor exchange \n\nservices) and career services as described in Sec.  652.206; and\n\n    (4) Those labor exchange services provided under the Act in a local \n\nworkforce investment area must be described in the Memorandum of \n\nUnderstanding (MOU) described in Sec.  678.500.\n\nSec.  652.208  How are applicable career services related to the \nmethods of service delivery described in in this part?\n\n    Career services may be delivered through any of the applicable \n\nthree methods of service delivery described in Sec.  652.207(b)(2). \n\nThese methods are:\n\n\n\n    (a) Self-service, including virtual services;\n\n    (b) Facilitated self-help service; and\n\n    (c) Staff-assisted service.\n\nSec.  652.209  What are the requirements under the Act for providing \nreemployment services and other activities to referred unemployment \ninsurance claimants?\n\n    (a) In accordance with sec. 3(c)(3) of the Act, the State agency, \n\nas part of the one-stop delivery system, must provide reemployment \n\nservices to UI claimants for whom such services are required as a \n\ncondition for receipt of UI benefits. Services must be appropriate to \n\nthe needs of UI claimants who are referred to reemployment services \n\nunder any Federal or State UI law.\n\n    (b) The State agency must also provide other activities, including:\n\n    (1) Coordination of labor exchange services with the provision of \n\nUI eligibility services as required by sec. 5(b)(2) of the Act;\n\n    (2) Administration of the work test, conducting eligibility \n\nassessments, and registering UI claimants for employment services in \n\naccordance with a State's unemployment compensation law, and provision \n\nof job finding and placement services as required by sec. 3(c)(3) and \n\ndescribed in sec. 7(a)(3)(F) of the Act;\n\n    (3) Referring UI claimants to, and providing application assistance \n\nfor, training and education resources and programs, including Federal \n\nPell grants and other student assistance under title IV of the Higher \n\nEducation Act, the Montgomery GI Bill, Post-9/11 GI Bill, and other \n\nVeterans Educational Assistance, training provided for youth, and adult \n\nand dislocated workers, as well as other employment training programs \n\nunder WIOA, and for Vocational Rehabilitation Services under title I of \n\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\n[[Page 20939]]\n\nSec.  652.210  What are the Act's requirements for administration of \n\nthe work test, including eligibility assessments, as appropriate, and \n\nassistance to unemployment insurance claimants?\n\n    (a) State UI law or rules establish the requirements under which UI \n\nclaimants must register and search for work in order to fulfill the UI \n\nwork test requirements.\n\n    (b) Staff funded under the Act must assure that:\n\n    (1) UI claimants receive the full range of labor exchange services \n\navailable under the Act that are necessary and appropriate to \n\nfacilitate their earliest return to work, including career services \n\n\n\nspecified in Sec.  652.206 and listed in sec. 134(c)(2)A) of WIOA;\n\n    (2) UI claimants requiring assistance in seeking work receive the \n\nnecessary guidance and counseling to ensure they make a meaningful and \n\nrealistic work search; and\n\n    (3) ES staff will provide UI program staff with information about \n\nUI claimants' ability or availability for work, or the suitability of \n\nwork offered to them.\n\nSec.  652.211  What are State planning requirements under the Act?\n\n    The Employment Service is a core program identified in WIOA and \n\nmust be included as part of each State's Unified or Combined State \n\nPlans.

The only change proposed in this section is to \n\nchange ``WIA'' to ``WIOA'' in the section question; the remainder of \n\nthe text has not changed from the existing regulation. The Department \n\nhas followed this policy since the earliest years of the ES, in order \n\nto ensure minimum standards for the quality of the services provided. A \n\n1998 U.S. District Court decision, Michigan v. Herman, 81 F. Supp. 2nd \n\n840 (http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/) upheld this policy. State merit staff \nemployees are directly \n\naccountable to State government entities, and the standards for their \n\nperformance and their determinations on the use of public funds require \n\nthat decisions be made in the best interest of the public and of the \n\npopulation to be served. State merit staff meet objective professional \n\nqualifications and provide impartial, transparent information and \n\nservices to all customers while complying with established government \n\nstandards.\n\nSec.  652.216  May the one-stop operator provide guidance to State \nmerit staff employees in accordance with the Act?\n\n    Yes, the one-stop delivery system envisions a partnership in which \n\nWagner-Peyser Act labor exchange services are coordinated with other \n\nactivities provided by other partners in a one-stop setting. As part of \n\nthe local Memorandum of Understanding described in Sec.  678.500, the \n\nState agency, as a one-stop partner, may agree to have staff receive \n\nhttp://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/81/840/2420800/\n\n\nguidance from the one-stop operator regarding the provision of labor \n\nexchange services. Personnel matters, including compensation, personnel \n\nactions, terms and conditions of employment, performance appraisals, \n\nand accountability of State merit staff employees funded under the Act, \n\nremain under the authority of the State agency. The guidance given to \n\nemployees must be consistent with the provisions of the Act, the local \n\nMemorandum of Understanding, and applicable collective bargaining \n\nagreements.\n\nSubpart D--Workforce and Labor Market Information\n\nSec.  652.300  What role does the Secretary of Labor have concerning \nthe Workforce and Labor Market Information System?\n\n    (a) The Secretary of Labor must oversee the development, \n\nmaintenance, and continuous improvement of the workforce and labor \n\nmarket information system defined in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15 and 20 \n\nCFR 651.10.\n\n    (b) With respect to data collection, analysis, and dissemination of \n\nworkforce and labor market information as defined in Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nsec. 15 and 20 CFR 651.10, the Secretary must:\n\n    (1) Assign responsibilities within the Department of Labor for \n\nelements of the workforce and labor market information system described \n\nin sec. 15(a) of the Wagner-Peyser Act to ensure that the statistical \n\nand administrative data collected are consistent with appropriate \n\nBureau of Labor Statistics standards and definitions, and that the \n\ninformation is accessible and understandable to users of such data;\n\n    (2) Actively seek the cooperation of heads of other Federal \n\nagencies to establish and maintain mechanisms for ensuring \n\ncomplementarity and non-duplication in the development and operation of \n\nstatistical and administrative data collection activities;\n\n    (3) Solicit, receive, and evaluate the recommendations of the \n\nWorkforce Information Advisory Council established by Wagner-Peyser Act \n\nsec. 15(d);\n\n    (4) Eliminate gaps and duplication in statistical undertakings;\n\n    (5) Through the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Employment and \n\nTraining Administration, and in collaboration with States, develop and \n\nmaintain the elements of the workforce and labor market information \n\nsystem, including the development of consistent procedures and \n\ndefinitions for use by States in collecting and reporting the workforce \n\nand labor market information data described in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. \n\n15 and defined in 20 CFR 651.10; and\n\n    (6) Establish procedures for the system to ensure that the data and \n\ninformation are timely, and paperwork and reporting for the system are \n\nreduced to a minimum.\n\n\n\nSec.  652.301  What are wage records for purposes of the Wagner-Peyser \nAct?\n\n    Wage records, for purposes of the Wagner-Peyser Act, are records \n\nthat contain ``wage information'' as defined in 20 CFR 603.2(k). In \n\nthis part, ``State wage records'' refers to wage records produced or \n\nmaintained by a State.\n\nSec.  652.302  How do the Secretary of Labor's responsibilities \ndescribed in this part apply to State wage records?\n\n    (a) State wage records, as defined in Sec.  652.301, are source \n\ndata used in the development of a significant portion of the workforce \n\nand labor market information defined in Sec.  651.10.\n\n    (b) Based on the Secretary of Labor's responsibilities described in \n\nWagner-Peyser Act sec. 15 and 20 CFR 652.300, the Secretary of Labor \n\nwill, in consultation with the Workforce Information Advisory Council \n\ndescribed in Wagner-Peyser Act sec. 15(d), Federal agencies, and \n\nStates, develop:\n\n    (1) Standardized definitions for the data elements comprising \n\n``wage records'' as defined in Sec.  652.301; and\n\n    (2) Improved processes and systems for the collection and reporting \n\nof wage records.\n\n    (c) In carrying out these activities, the Secretary may also \n\nconsult with other stakeholders, such as employers.\n\nSec.  652.303  How do the requirements of part 603 of this chapter \napply to wage records?\n\n    All information collected by the State in wage records referred to \n\nin Sec.  652.302 is subject to the confidentiality regulations at 20 \n\nCFR part 603.\n\n0\n\n19.

State agencies with significant MSFW \n\nlocal employment service offices, must undertake special efforts to \n\nrecruit MSFWs and persons from MSFW backgrounds for its staff.\n\n    (1) Where qualified minority applicants are not available to be \n\nhired as permanent staff, qualified minority part-time, provisional, or \n\ntemporary staff must be hired in accordance with State merit system \n\nprocedures, where applicable.\n\n    (2) If a local employment service office does not have a sufficient \n\nnumber of qualified minority staff, the State agency must establish a \n\ngoal to achieve sufficient staffing at the local employment service \n\noffice. The State agency will also establish a reasonable timetable for \n\nachieving the staffing goal by hiring or promoting available, qualified \n\nstaff in the under-represented categories. In establishing timetables, \n\nthe State agency must consider the vacancies anticipated through \n\nexpansion, contraction, and turnover in the office(s) and available \n\nfunds. All affirmative action programs must establish timetables that \n\nare designed to achieve the staffing goal no later than 1 year after \n\nthe submission of the Unified or Combined State Plan or annual summary, \n\nwhichever is sooner. Once such goals have been achieved, the State \n\nagency must submit a State Plan modification request to the Department \n\nwith the assurance that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this \n\nsection have been achieved.\n\n    (3) The State monitor advocates, regional monitor advocates, or the \n\nnational monitor advocate, as part of their regular reviews of State \n\nagency compliance with these regulations, must monitor the extent to \n\nwhich the State agency has complied with its affirmative action \n\nprogram.\n\nSubpart C-E--[Reserved]\n\nSubpart F--Agricultural Recruitment System for U.S. Farmworkers \n\n(ARS)\n\nSec.  653.500  Purpose and scope of subpart.\n\n    This subpart includes the requirements for the acceptance of \n\nintrastate and interstate job clearance orders which seek U.S. workers \n\nto perform farmwork on a temporary, less than year-round basis. Orders \n\nseeking workers to perform farmwork on a year-round basis are not \n\n\n\nsubject to the requirements of this subpart. This section affects all \n\njob orders for workers who are recruited through the employment service \n\ninterstate and intrastate clearance systems for less than year-round \n\nfarmwork, including both MSFWs and non-MSFW job seekers.\n\nSec.  653.501  Requirements for processing clearance orders.\n\n    (a) No local employment service office or State agency may place a \n\njob order seeking workers to perform farmwork into intrastate or \n\ninterstate clearance unless:\n\n    (1) The local employment service office and employer have \n\nattempted, and have not been able, to obtain sufficient workers within \n\nthe local labor market area, or\n\n    (2) The local employment service office anticipates a shortage of \n\nlocal workers.\n\n    (b) Employment service office responsibilities. (1) Each employment \n\nservice office must ensure that the agricultural clearance form \n\nprescribed by the Department (ETA Form 790 or its subsequently issued \n\nform), and its attachments are complete when placing intrastate or \n\ninterstate clearance orders seeking farmworkers.\n\n    (2) All clearance orders must be posted in accordance with \n\napplicable ETA guidance. If the job order for the local employment \n\nservice office incorporates offices beyond the local office commuting \n\narea, the employment service office must suppress the employer \n\ninformation in order to facilitate the orderly movement of workers \n\nwithin the employment service system.\n\n[[Page 20945]]\n\n    (3) Employment service staff must determine, through a preoccupancy \n\nhousing inspection performed by employment service staff or other \n\nappropriate public agency, that the housing assured by the employer is \n\neither available and meets the applicable housing standards or has been \n\napproved for conditional access to the clearance system as set forth in \n\n20 CFR 653.502; except that mobile range housing for sheepherders and \n\ngoatherders must meet existing Departmental guidelines and/or \n\napplicable regulations.\n\n    (c) State agency responsibilities. (1) State agencies must ensure \n\nthat intrastate and interstate orders:\n\n    (i) Include the following language: ``In view of the statutorily \n\nestablished basic function of the employment service as a no-fee labor \n\nexchange, that is, as a forum for bringing together employers and job \n\nseekers, neither the ETA nor the State agencies are guarantors of the \n\n\n\naccuracy or truthfulness of information contained on job orders \n\nsubmitted by employers. Nor does any job order accepted or recruited \n\nupon by the employment service constitute a contractual job offer to \n\nwhich the ETA or a State agency is in any way a party;''\n\n    (ii) Do not contain an unlawful discriminatory specification by \n\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender \n\nidentity, age, disability, or genetic information;\n\n    (iii) Are signed by the employer; and\n\n    (iv) State all the material terms and conditions of the employment, \n\nincluding:\n\n    (A) The crop;\n\n    (B) The nature of the work;\n\n    (C) The anticipated period and hours of employment;\n\n    (D) The anticipated starting and ending date of employment and the \n\nanticipated number of days and hours per week for which work will be \n\navailable;\n\n    (E) The hourly wage rate or the piece rate estimated in hourly wage \n\nrate equivalents for each activity and unit size;\n\n    (F) Any deductions to be made from wages;\n\n    (G) A specification of any non-monetary benefits to be provided by \n\nthe employer;\n\n    (H) Any hours, days or weeks for which work is guaranteed, and, for \n\neach guaranteed week of work except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(i) \n\nof this section, the exclusive manner in which the guarantee may be \n\nabated due to weather conditions or other acts of God beyond the \n\nemployer's control; and\n\n    (I) Any bonus or work incentive payments or other expenses which \n\nwill be paid by the employer in addition to the basic wage rate, \n\nincluding the anticipated time period(s) within which such payments \n\nwill be made.\n\n    (2) State agencies must ensure that:\n\n    (i) The wages and working conditions offered are not less than the \n\nprevailing wages and working conditions among similarly employed \n\nfarmworkers in the area of intended employment or the applicable \n\nFederal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher. If the wages \n\noffered are expressed as piece rates or as base rates and bonuses, the \n\nemployer must make the method of calculating the wage and supporting \n\n\n\nmaterials available to employment service staff who must check if the \n\nemployer's calculation of the estimated hourly wage rate is reasonably \n\naccurate and is not less than the prevailing wage rate or applicable \n\nFederal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher; and\n\n    (ii) The employer has agreed to provide or pay for the \n\ntransportation of the workers and their families at or before the end \n\nof the period of employment specified in the job order on at least the \n\nsame terms as transportation is commonly provided by employers in the \n\narea of intended employment to farmworkers and their families recruited \n\nfrom the same area of supply. Under no circumstances may the payment or \n\nprovision of transportation occur later than the departure time needed \n\nto return home to begin the school year, in the case of any worker with \n\nchildren 18 years old or younger, or be conditioned on the farmworker \n\nperforming work after the period of employment specified in the job \n\norder.\n\n    (3) State agencies must ensure that the clearance order includes \n\nthe following assurances:\n\n    (i) The employer will provide to workers referred through the \n\nclearance system the number of hours of work cited in paragraph \n\n(c)(1)(iv)(D) of this section for the week beginning with the \n\nanticipated date of need, unless the employer has amended the date of \n\nneed at least 10 working days prior to the original date of need \n\n(pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section) by so notifying the \n\norder-holding office. The State agency must make a record of this \n\nnotification and must attempt to expeditiously inform referred workers \n\nof the change.\n\n    (ii) No extension of employment beyond the period of employment \n\nspecified in the clearance order may relieve the employer from paying \n\nthe wages already earned, or if specified in the clearance order as a \n\nterm of employment, providing transportation or paying transportation \n\nexpenses to the worker's home.\n\n    (iii) The working conditions comply with applicable Federal and \n\nState minimum wage, child labor, social security, health and safety, \n\nfarm labor contractor registration and other employment-related laws.\n\n    (iv) The employer will expeditiously notify the order-holding \n\noffice or State agency by emailing and telephoning immediately upon \n\nlearning that a crop is maturing earlier or later, or that weather \n\nconditions, over-recruitment or other factors have changed the terms \n\n\n\nand conditions of employment.\n\n    (v) The employer, if acting as a farm labor contractor (``FLC'') or \n\nfarm labor contractor employee (``FLCE'') on the order, has a valid \n\nFederal FLC certificate or Federal FLCE identification card; and when \n\nappropriate, any required State farm labor contractor certificate.\n\n    (vi) The availability of no cost or public housing which meets the \n\nFederal standards and which is sufficient to house the specified number \n\nof workers requested through the clearance system. This assurance must \n\ncover the availability of housing for only those workers, and, when \n\napplicable, family members who are unable to return to their residence \n\nin the same day.\n\n    (vii) Outreach workers must have reasonable access to the workers \n\nin the conduct of outreach activities pursuant to Sec.  653.107.\n\n    (viii) The job order contains all the material terms and conditions \n\nof the job. The employer must assure this by signing the following \n\nstatement in the clearance order: ``This clearance order describes the \n\nactual terms and conditions of the employment being offered by me and \n\ncontains all the material terms and conditions of the job.''\n\n    (4) If a State agency discovers that an employer's clearance order \n\ncontains a material misrepresentation, the State agency may initiate \n\nthe Discontinuation of Services as set forth in 20 CFR part 658, \n\nsubpart F.\n\n    (5) If there is a change to the anticipated date of need and the \n\nemployer fails to notify the order-holding office at least 10 working \n\ndays prior to the original date of need the employer must pay eligible \n\n(pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section) workers referred through \n\nthe clearance system the specified hourly rate of pay, or if the pay is \n\npiece-rate, the higher of the Federal or State minimum wage for the \n\nfirst week starting with the originally anticipated date of need or \n\nprovide alternative work if such alternative work is stated on the \n\nclearance order. If an employer fails to comply under this\n\n[[Page 20946]]\n\nsection the order holding office may notify DOL's Wage and Hour \n\nDivision for possible enforcement.\n\n    (d) Processing clearance orders. This section does not apply to \n\nclearance orders that are attached to applications for foreign \n\ntemporary agricultural workers pursuant to 20 CFR 655 subpart B.\n\n    (1) The order-holding office must transmit an electronic copy of \n\nthe approved clearance order to the State agency. The State agency must \n\n\n\ndistribute additional electronic copies of the form with all \n\nattachments (except that the State agency may, at its discretion, \n\ndelegate this distribution to the local office) as follows:\n\n    (i) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to each \n\nof the State agencies selected for recruitment (areas of supply);\n\n    (ii) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to each \n\napplicant-holding ETA regional office;\n\n    (iii) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to the \n\norder-holding ETA regional office; and\n\n    (iv) At least one copy of the clearance order must be sent to the \n\nRegional Farm Labor Coordinated Enforcement Committee and/or other \n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration and Wage and Hour \n\nDivision regional agricultural coordinators, and/or other committees as \n\nappropriate in the area of employment.\n\n    (2) The local office may place an intrastate or interstate order \n\nseeking workers to perform farmwork for a specific farm labor \n\ncontractor or for a worker preferred by an employer provided the order \n\nmeets employment service nondiscrimination criteria. The order would \n\nnot meet such criteria, for example, if it requested a ``white male \n\ncrew leader'' or ``any white male crew leader.''\n\n    (3) The ETA regional office must review and approve the order \n\nwithin 10 working days of its receipt of the order, and the Regional \n\nAdministrator or his/her designee must approve the areas of supply to \n\nwhich the order will be extended. Any denial by the Regional \n\nAdministrator or his/her designee must be in writing and state the \n\nreasons for the denial.\n\n    (4) The applicant holding office must notify all referred \n\nfarmworkers, farm labor contractors on behalf of farmworkers, or family \n\nheads on behalf of farmworker family members, to contact a local \n\nemployment service office, preferably the order-holding office, to \n\nverify the date of need cited in the clearance order between nine and 5 \n\nworking days prior to the original date of need cited in the clearance \n\norder; and that failure to do so will disqualify the referred \n\nfarmworker from the first weeks' pay as described in paragraph \n\n(c)(3)(i) of this section. The State agency must make a record of this \n\nnotification.\n\n    (5) If the worker referred through the clearance system contacts a \n\nlocal employment service office (in any State) other than the order \n\nholding office, that local employment service office must assist the \n\nreferred worker in contacting the order holding office on a timely \n\n\n\nbasis. Such assistance must include, if necessary, contacting the order \n\nholding office by telephone or other timely means on behalf of the \n\nworker referred through the clearance system.\n\n    (6) Local employment service office staff must assist all \n\nfarmworkers, upon request in their native language, to understand the \n\nterms and conditions of employment set forth in intrastate and \n\ninterstate clearance orders and must provide such workers with \n\nchecklists in their native language showing wage payment schedules, \n\nworking conditions, and other material specifications of the clearance \n\norder.\n\n    (7) If an order holding office learns that a crop is maturing \n\nearlier than expected or that other material factors, including weather \n\nconditions and recruitment levels, have changed since the date the \n\nclearance order was accepted, the agency must immediately contact the \n\napplicant holding office which must immediately inform crews and \n\nfamilies scheduled to report to the job site of the changed \n\ncircumstances and must adjust arrangements on behalf of such crews and \n\nfamilies.\n\n    (8) When there is a delay in the date of need, State agencies must \n\ndocument notifications by employers and contacts by individual \n\nfarmworkers or crew leaders on behalf of farmworkers or family heads on \n\nbehalf of farmworker family members to verify the date of need.\n\n    (9) If weather conditions, over-recruitment or other conditions \n\nhave eliminated the scheduled job opportunities, the State agencies \n\ninvolved must make every effort to place the workers in alternate job \n\nopportunities as soon as possible, especially if the worker(s) is \n\nalready en-route or at the job site. Employment service office staff \n\nmust keep records of actions under this section.\n\n    (10) Applicant-holding offices must provide workers referred on \n\nclearance orders with a checklist summarizing wages, working conditions \n\nand other material specifications in the clearance order. Such \n\nchecklists, where necessary, must be in the workers' native language. \n\nThe checklist must include language notifying the worker that a copy of \n\nthe original clearance order is available upon request. State agencies \n\nmust use a standard checklist format provided by the Department (such \n\nas in Form WH516 or a successor form).\n\n    (11) The applicant-holding office must give each referred worker a \n\ncopy of the list of worker's rights described in the Department's ARS \n\nHandbook.\n\n    (12) If the labor supply State agency accepts a clearance order, \n\nthe State agency must actively recruit workers for referral. In the \n\n\n\nevent a potential labor supply State agency rejects a clearance order, \n\nthe reasons for rejection must be documented and submitted to the \n\nRegional Administrator having jurisdiction over the State agency. The \n\nRegional Administrator will examine the reasons for rejection, and, if \n\nthe Regional Administrator agrees, will inform the Regional \n\nAdministrator with jurisdiction over the order-holding State agency of \n\nthe rejection and the reasons. If the Regional Administrator who \n\nreceives the notification of rejection does not concur with the reasons \n\nfor rejection, that Regional Administrator will inform the national \n\nmonitor advocate, who, in consultation with the Administrator of ETA's \n\nOffice of Workforce Investment, will make a final determination on the \n\nacceptance or rejection of the order.\n\nSec.  653.502  Conditional access to the agricultural recruitment \nsystem.\n\n    (a) Filing requests for conditional access--(1) ``Noncriteria'' \n\nemployers. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an \n\nemployer whose housing does not meet applicable standards may file with \n\nthe local employment service office serving the area in which its \n\nhousing is located, a written request that its clearance orders be \n\nconditionally allowed into the intrastate or interstate clearance \n\nsystem, provided that the employer's request assures that its housing \n\nwill be in full compliance with the requirements of the applicable \n\nhousing standards at least 20 calendar days (giving the specific date) \n\nbefore the housing is to be occupied.\n\n    (2) ``Criteria'' employers. If the request for conditional access \n\ndescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is from an employer \n\nfiling a clearance order pursuant to an application for temporary alien \n\nagricultural labor certification for H-2A workers under subpart B of \n\npart 655 of this chapter, the request must be filed with the Certifying \n\nOfficer (CO) at the Department's Chicago National Processing Center \n\n(NPC) designated by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) \n\nAdministrator to make determinations on applications for temporary\n\n[[Page 20947]]\n\nemployment certification under the H-2A program.\n\n    (3) Assurance. The employer's request pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) \n\nor (2) of this section must contain an assurance that the housing will \n\n\n\nbe in full compliance with the applicable housing standards at least 20 \n\ncalendar days (stating the specific date) before the housing is to be \n\noccupied.\n\n    (b) Processing requests--(1) State agency processing. Upon receipt \n\nof a written request for conditional access to the intrastate or \n\ninterstate clearance system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the \n\nlocal employment service office must send the request to the State \n\nagency, which, in turn, must forward it to the Regional Administrator.\n\n    (2) Regional office processing and determination. Upon receipt of a \n\nrequest for conditional access pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this \n\nsection, the Regional Administrator must review the matter and, as \n\nappropriate, must either grant or deny the request.\n\n    (c) Authorization. The authorization for conditional access to the \n\nintrastate or interstate clearance system must be in writing, and must \n\nstate that although the housing does not comply with the applicable \n\nstandards, the employer's job order may be placed into intrastate or \n\ninterstate clearance until a specified date. The Regional Administrator \n\nmust send the authorization to the employer and must send copies (hard \n\ncopy or electronic) to the appropriate State agency and local \n\nemployment service office. The employer must submit and the local \n\nemployment service office must attach copies of the authorization to \n\neach of the employer's clearance orders which is placed into intrastate \n\nor interstate clearance.\n\n    (d) Notice of denial. If the Regional Administrator denies the \n\nrequest for conditional access to the intrastate or interstate \n\nclearance system they must provide written notice to the employer, the \n\nappropriate State agency, and the local employment service office, \n\nstating the reasons for the denial.\n\n    (e) Inspection. The local employment service office serving the \n\narea containing the housing of any employer granted conditional access \n\nto the intrastate or interstate clearance system must assure that the \n\nhousing is inspected no later than the date by which the employer has \n\npromised to have its housing in compliance with the applicable housing \n\nstandards. An employer, however, may request an earlier preliminary \n\ninspection. If, on the date set forth in the authorization, the housing \n\nis not in full compliance with the applicable housing standards as \n\nassured in the request for conditional access, the local employment \n\nservice office must afford the employer 5 calendar days to bring the \n\nhousing into full compliance. After the 5-calendar-day period, if the \n\n\n\nhousing is not in full compliance with the applicable housing standards \n\nas assured in the request for conditional access, the local employment \n\nservice office immediately:\n\n    (1) Must notify the RA, or the NPC designated by the Regional \n\nAdministrator;\n\n    (2) Must remove the employer's clearance orders from intrastate and \n\ninterstate clearance; and\n\n    (3) Must, if workers have been recruited against these orders, in \n\ncooperation with the employment service agencies in other States, make \n\nevery reasonable attempt to locate and notify the appropriate crew \n\nleaders or workers, and to find alternative and comparable employment \n\nfor the workers.\n\nSec.  653.503  Field checks.\n\n    (a) If a worker is placed on a clearance order, the State agency \n\nmust notify the employer in writing that the State agency, through its \n\nlocal employment service offices, and/or Federal staff, must conduct \n\nrandom, unannounced field checks to determine and document whether \n\nwages, hours, and working and housing conditions are being provided as \n\nspecified in the clearance order.\n\n    (b) The State agency must conduct field checks on at least 25 \n\npercent of all agricultural worksites where placements have been made \n\nthrough the intrastate or interstate clearance system or at 100 percent \n\nof the worksites where less than 10 employment service placements have \n\nbeen made. This requirement must be met on a quarterly basis.\n\n    (c) Field checks must include visit(s) to the worksite at a time \n\nwhen workers are present. When conducting field checks, local \n\nemployment service staff must consult both the employees and the \n\nemployer to ensure compliance with the full terms and conditions of \n\nemployment.\n\n    (d) If State agency or Federal personnel observe or receive \n\ninformation, or otherwise have reason to believe that conditions are \n\nnot as stated in the clearance order or that an employer is violating \n\nan employment-related law, the State agency must document the finding \n\nand attempt informal resolution. If the matter has not been resolved \n\nwithin 5 working days, the State agency must initiate the \n\nDiscontinuation of Services as set forth at 20 CFR part 658 subpart F \n\nand must refer apparent violations of employment-related laws to \n\nappropriate enforcement agencies in writing.\n\n    (e) State agencies may enter into formal or informal arrangements \n\n\n\nwith appropriate State and Federal enforcement agencies where the \n\nenforcement agency staff may conduct field checks instead of and on \n\nbehalf of State agency personnel. The agreement may include the sharing \n\nof information and any actions taken regarding violations of the terms \n\nand conditions of the employment as stated in the clearance order and \n\nany other violations of employment related laws. An enforcement agency \n\nfield check must satisfy the requirement for State agency field checks \n\nwhere all aspects of wages, hours, working and housing conditions have \n\nbeen reviewed by the enforcement agency. The State agency must \n\nsupplement enforcement agency efforts with field checks focusing on \n\nareas not addressed by enforcement agencies.\n\n    (g) ES staff must keep records of all field checks.\n\nPART 654--SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE SYSTEM\n\n0\n\n20.

The experiences of the \n\nemployment service agencies indicate that employees so referred have on \n\nmany occasions been provided with inadequate, unsafe, and unsanitary \n\nhousing conditions. To discourage this practice, it is the policy of \n\nthe Federal-State employment service system to deny its intrastate and \n\ninterstate recruitment services to employers until the State employment \n\nservice agency has ascertained that the employer's housing meets \n\ncertain standards.\n\n    (b) To implement this policy, Sec.  653.501 of this chapter \n\nprovides that recruitment services must be denied unless the employer \n\nhas signed an assurance that if the workers are to be housed, a \n\npreoccupancy inspection has been conducted and the employment service \n\nstaff has ascertained that, with respect to intrastate or interstate \n\nclearance orders, the employer's housing meets the full set of \n\nstandards set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142 or 20 CFR 654 subpart E, except \n\nthat mobile range housing for sheepherders or goatherders must meet \n\nexisting Departmental guidelines and/or applicable regulations.\n\n    (c) Per Sec.  654.401(a) below, this subpart is effective only \n\nuntil [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE \n\nFEDERAL REGISTER].\n\nSec.  654.401  Applicability.\n\n    (a) Housing that was completed or under construction prior to April \n\n3, 1980 or was under a signed contract for construction prior to March \n\n\n\n4, 1980 may continue to follow the full set of the Department's ETA \n\nstandards set forth in this subpart until the date specified in \n\nparagraph (b) of this section.\n\n    (b) On [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE \n\nFEDERAL REGISTER] all housing for agricultural workers governed by the \n\nstandards set forth in this subpart must comply with the Occupational \n\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) housing standards set forth \n\nin 29 CFR 1910.142.\n\n    (c) To effectuate the transition to the OSHA standards, \n\nagricultural housing to which this subpart applies and which complies \n\nwith the full set of standards and provisions set forth in this subpart \n\nmust be considered to be in compliance with the OSHA temporary labor \n\ncamp standards at 29 CFR 1910.142 until [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF \n\nPUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\n\nSec.  654.402  Variances.\n\n    (a) An employer may apply for a structural variance from a specific \n\nstandard(s) in this subpart by filing a written application for such a \n\nvariance with the local employment service office serving the area in \n\nwhich the housing is located. This application must:\n\n    (1) Clearly specify the standard(s) from which the variance is \n\ndesired;\n\n    (2) Provide adequate justification that the variance is necessary \n\nto obtain a beneficial use of an existing facility, and to prevent a \n\npractical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and\n\n    (3) Clearly set forth the specific alternative measures which the \n\nemployer has taken to protect the health and safety of workers and \n\nadequately show that such alternative measures have achieved the same \n\nresult as the standard(s) from which the employer desires the variance.\n\n    (b) Upon receipt of a written request for a variance under \n\nparagraph (a) of this section, the local employment service office must \n\nsend the request to the State office which, in turn, must forward it to \n\nthe ETA Regional Administrator (RA). The RA must review the matter and, \n\nafter consultation with OSHA, must either grant or deny the request for \n\na variance.\n\n    (c) The variance granted by the RA must be in writing, must state \n\nthe particular standard(s) involved, and must state as conditions of \n\nthe variance the specific alternative measures which have been taken to \n\nprotect the health and safety of the workers. The RA must send the \n\napproved variance to the employer and must send copies to OSHA's \n\nRegional Administrator, the Regional Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n\nDivision (WHD), and the appropriate State agency and the local \n\n\n\nemployment service office. The employer must submit and the local \n\nemployment service office must attach copies of the approved variance \n\nto each of the employer's job orders which is placed into intrastate or \n\ninterstate clearance.\n\n    (d) If the RA denies the request for a variance, the RA must \n\nprovide written notice stating the reasons for the denial to the \n\nemployer, the appropriate State agency and the local employment service \n\noffice.

The request for a hearing must be handled in accordance \n\nwith the complaint procedures set forth at Sec. Sec.  658.424 and \n\n658.425 of this chapter.\n\n    (e) The procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section \n\nonly apply to an employer who has chosen, as evidenced by its written \n\nrequest for a variance, to comply with the ETA housing standards at \n\nSec. Sec.  654.404-654.417 of this subpart.\n\n    (f) All requests and/or approvals for variance under this section \n\nwill expire on [ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN \n\nTHE FEDERAL REGISTER]. After that date no requests for variance will be \n\naccepted by the Department.\n\nSec.  654.403  [Reserved].\n\nHousing Standards\n\nSec.  654.404  Housing site.\n\n    (a) Housing sites must be well drained and free from depressions in \n\nwhich water may stagnate.

A SWA's failure to meet the operational \n\nobjectives set forth in the Unified State Plan raises a presumption \n\nthat the agency is violating ES regulations and/or obligations under \n\nits Unified State Plan. In such cases the Department must afford the \n\nSWA an opportunity to rebut the presumption of a violation pursuant to \n\nthe procedures at subpart H of this part.\n\n\n\n    (3) The Department must take into account that certain program \n\nperformance data may measure items over which SWAs have direct or \n\nsubstantial control while other data may measure items over which the \n\nSWA has indirect or minimal control.\n\n    (i) Generally, for example, a SWA has direct and substantial \n\ncontrol over the delivery of employment services such as referrals to \n\njobs, job development contacts, counseling, referrals to career and \n\nsupportive services and the conduct of field checks.\n\n    (ii) State Workforce Agencies, however, have only indirect control \n\nover the outcome of services. For example, SWAs cannot guarantee that \n\nan employer will hire a referred applicant, nor can they guarantee that \n\nthe terms and conditions of employment will be as stated on a job \n\norder.\n\n    (iii) Outside forces, such as a sudden heavy increase in \n\nunemployment rates, a strike by SWA employees, or a severe drought or \n\nflood may skew the results measured by program performance data.\n\n    (4) The Department must consider a SWA's failure to keep accurate \n\nand complete program performance data\n\n[[Page 20963]]\n\nrequired by ES regulations as a violation of the ES regulations.\n\nSec.  658.605  Communication of findings to State agencies.\n\n    (a) The Regional Administrator must inform SWAs in writing of the \n\nresults of review and assessment activities and, as appropriate, must \n\ndiscuss with the State Administrator the impact or action required by \n\nthe Department as a result of review and assessment activities.\n\n    (b) The ETA National Office must transmit the results of any review \n\nand assessment activities it conducted to the Regional Administrator \n\nwho must send the information to the SWA.\n\n    (c) Whenever the review and assessment indicates a SWA violation of \n\nES regulations or its Unified State Plan, the Regional Administrator \n\nmust follow the procedures set forth at subpart H of this part.\n\n    (d) Regional Administrators must follow-up any corrective action \n\nplan imposed on a SWA under subpart H of this part by further review \n\nand assessment of the State agency pursuant to this subpart.\n\nSubpart H--Federal Application of Remedial Action to State Agencies\n\nSec.  658.700  Scope and purpose of subpart.\n\n    This subpart sets forth the procedures which the Department must \n\nfollow upon either discovering independently or receiving from other(s) \n\ninformation indicating that SWAs may not be adhering to ES regulations.\n\n\n\nSec.  658.701  Statements of policy.\n\n    (a) It is the policy of the Department to take all necessary \n\naction, including the imposition of the full range of sanctions set \n\nforth in this subpart, to ensure that State agencies comply with all \n\nrequirements established by ES regulations.\n\n    (b) It is the policy of the Department to initiate decertification \n\nprocedures against SWAs in instances of serious or continual violations \n\nof ES regulations if less stringent remedial actions taken in \n\naccordance with this subpart fail to resolve noncompliance.\n\n    (c) It is the policy of the Department to act on information \n\nconcerning alleged violations by SWAs of the ES regulations received \n\nfrom any person or organization.\n\nSec.  658.702  Initial action by the Regional Administrator.\n\n    (a) The ETA Regional Administrator is responsible for ensuring that \n\nall SWAs in his/her region are in compliance with ES regulations.\n\n    (b) Wherever a Regional Administrator discovers or is apprised of \n\npossible SWA violations of ES regulations by the review and assessment \n\nactivities under subpart G of this part, or through required reports or \n\nwritten complaints from individuals, organizations or employers which \n\nare elevated to the Department after the exhaustion of SWA \n\nadministrative remedies, the Regional Administrator must conduct an \n\ninvestigation. Within 10 days after receipt of the report or other \n\ninformation, the Regional Administrator must make a determination \n\nwhether there is probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES \n\nregulations.\n\n    (c) The Regional Administrator must accept complaints regarding \n\npossible SWA violations of ES regulations from employee organizations, \n\nemployers or other groups, without exhaustion of the complaint process \n\ndescribed at subpart E, if the Regional Administrator determines that \n\nthe nature and scope of the complaint are such that the time required \n\nto exhaust the administrative procedures at the State level would \n\nadversely affect a significant number of applicants. In such cases, the \n\nRegional Administrator must investigate the matter within 10 working \n\ndays, may provide the SWA 10 working days for comment, and must make a \n\ndetermination within an additional 10 working days whether there is \n\nprobable cause to believe that the SWA has violated ES regulations.\n\n    (d) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is no \n\nprobable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations, he/\n\nshe must retain all reports and supporting information in Department \n\n\n\nfiles. In all cases where the Regional Administrator has insufficient \n\ninformation to make a probable cause determination, he/she must so \n\nnotify the Administrator in writing and the time for the investigation \n\nmust be extended 20 additional working days.\n\n    (e) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is probable \n\ncause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations, he/she must \n\nissue a Notice of Initial Findings of Non-compliance by registered mail \n\n(or other legally viable means) to the offending SWA. The notice will \n\nspecify the nature of the violation, cite the regulations involved, and \n\nindicate corrective action which may be imposed in accordance with \n\nparagraphs (g) and (h) of this section. If the non-compliance involves \n\nservices to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must \n\nbe sent to the NMA.\n\n    (f)(1) The SWA may have 20 working days to comment on the findings, \n\nor a longer period, up to 20 additional days, if the Regional \n\nAdministrator determines that a longer period is appropriate. The SWA's \n\ncomments must include agreement or disagreement with the findings and \n\nsuggested corrective actions, where appropriate.\n\n    (2) After the period elapses, the Regional Administrator must \n\nprepare within 20 working days, written final findings which specify \n\nwhether or not the SWA has violated ES regulations. If in the final \n\nfindings the Regional Administrator determines that the SWA has not \n\nviolated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must notify the \n\nState Administrator of this finding and retain supporting documents in \n\nhis/her files. If the final finding involves services to MSFWs or the \n\nComplaint System, the Regional Administrator must also notify the NMA. \n\nIf the Regional Administrator determines that a SWA has violated ES \n\nregulations, the Regional Administrator must prepare a Final Notice of \n\nNoncompliance which must specify the violation(s) and cite the \n\nregulations involved. The Final Notice of Noncompliance must be sent to \n\nthe SWA by registered mail or other legally viable means. If the \n\nnoncompliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a \n\ncopy of the Final Notice must be sent to the NMA.\n\n    (g) If the violation involves the misspending of grant funds, the \n\nRegional Administrator may order in the Final Notice of Noncompliance a \n\ndisallowance of the expenditure and may either demand repayment or \n\nwithhold future funds in the amount in question. If the Regional \n\nAdministrator disallows costs, the Regional Administrator must give the \n\nreasons for the disallowance, inform the SWA that the disallowance is \n\neffective immediately and that no more funds may be spent in the \n\n\n\ndisallowed manner, and offer the SWA the opportunity to request a \n\nhearing pursuant to Sec.  658.707. The offer, or the acceptance of an \n\noffer of a hearing, however, does not stay the effectiveness of the \n\ndisallowance. The Regional Administrator must keep complete records of \n\nthe disallowance.\n\n    (h) If the violation does not involve misspending of grant funds or \n\nthe Regional Administrator determines that the circumstances warrant \n\nother action:\n\n    (1) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must direct the SWA to \n\nimplement a specific corrective action plan to correct all violations. \n\nIf the SWA's comment demonstrates with supporting evidence (except \n\nwhere inappropriate) that all violations have already been corrected, \n\nthe Regional Administrator need not impose a corrective action plan and \n\ninstead may cite the violation(s) and accept their\n\n[[Page 20964]]\n\nresolution, subject to follow-up review, if necessary. If the Regional \n\nAdministrator determines that the violation(s) cited had been found \n\npreviously and that the corrective action(s) taken had not corrected \n\nthe violation(s) contrary to the findings of previous follow-up \n\nreviews, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the \n\nSWA pursuant to Sec.  658.704.\n\n    (2) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must specify the time by \n\nwhich each corrective action must be taken. This period may not exceed \n\n40 working days unless the Regional Administrator determines that \n\nexceptional circumstances necessitate corrective actions requiring a \n\nlonger time period. In such cases, and if the violations involve \n\nservices to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator \n\nmust notify the Administrator in writing of the exceptional \n\ncircumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and must specify \n\nthat time period. The specified time period must commence with the date \n\nof signature on the registered mail receipt.\n\n    (3) When the time period provided for in paragraph (h)(2) of this \n\nsection elapses, Department staff must review the SWA's efforts as \n\ndocumented by the SWA to determine if the corrective action(s) has been \n\ntaken and if the SWA has achieved compliance with ES regulations. If \n\nnecessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part of \n\nthis review.\n\n    (4) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator \n\ndetermines that the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional \n\nAdministrator must record the basis for this determination, notify the \n\nSWA, send a copy to the Administrator, and retain a copy in Department \n\nfiles.\n\n\n\n    (5) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator \n\ndetermines that the SWA has taken corrective action but is unable to \n\ndetermine if the violation has been corrected due to seasonality or \n\nother factors, the Regional Administrator must notify in writing the \n\nSWA and the Administrator of his/her findings. The Regional \n\nAdministrator must conduct further follow-up at an appropriate time to \n\nmake a final determination if the violation has been corrected. If the \n\nRegional Administrator's further follow-up reveals that violations have \n\nnot been corrected, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial \n\nactions to the SWA pursuant to Sec.  658.704.\n\n    (6) If, as a result of the review the Regional Administrator \n\ndetermines that the SWA has not corrected the violations and has not \n\nmade good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of \n\nthe violations, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions \n\nto the SWA pursuant to Sec.  658.704.\n\n    (7) If, as a result of the review, the Regional Administrator \n\ndetermines that the SWA has made good faith efforts and adequate \n\nprogress toward the correction of the violation and it appears that the \n\nviolation will be fully corrected within a reasonable time period, the \n\nSWA must be advised by registered mail or other legally viable means \n\n(with a copy sent to the Administrator) of this conclusion, of \n\nremaining differences, of further needed corrective action, and that \n\nall deficiencies must be corrected within a specified time period. This \n\nperiod may not exceed 40 working days unless the Regional Administrator \n\ndetermines that exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective action \n\nrequiring a longer time period. In such cases, the Regional \n\nAdministrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the \n\nexceptional circumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and \n\nmust specify that time period. The specified time period commences with \n\nthe date of signature on the registered mail receipt.\n\n    (8)(i) If the SWA has been given an additional time period pursuant \n\nto paragraph (h)(7) of this section, Department staff must review the \n\nSWA's efforts as documented by the SWA at the end of the time period. \n\nIf necessary, the Department must conduct a follow-up visit as part of \n\nthis review.\n\n    (ii) If the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional \n\nAdministrator must document that finding, notify in writing the SWA and \n\nthe Administrator, and retain supporting documents in Department files. \n\nIf the SWA has not corrected the violation(s), the Regional \n\nAdministrator must apply remedial actions pursuant to Sec.  658.704.\n\nSec.  658.703  Emergency corrective action.\n\n\n\n    In critical situations as determined by the Regional Administrator, \n\nwhere it is necessary to protect the integrity of the funds, or insure \n\nthe proper operation of the program, the Regional Administrator may \n\nimpose immediate corrective action. Where immediate corrective action \n\nis imposed, the Regional Administrator must notify the SWA of the \n\nreason for imposing the emergency corrective action prior to providing \n\nthe SWA an opportunity to comment.\n\nSec.  658.704  Remedial actions.\n\n    (a) If a SWA fails to correct violations as determined pursuant to \n\nSec.  658.702, the Regional Administrator must apply one or more of the \n\nfollowing remedial actions to the SWA:\n\n    (1) Imposition of special reporting requirements for a specified \n\nperiod of time;\n\n    (2) Restrictions of obligational authority within one or more \n\nexpense classifications;\n\n    (3) Implementation of specific operating systems or procedures for \n\na specified time;\n\n    (4) Requirement of special training for SWA personnel;\n\n    (5) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after \n\naffording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a \n\nconference with the Assistant Secretary, the elevation of specific \n\ndecision-making functions from the State Administrator to the Regional \n\nAdministrator;\n\n    (6) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after \n\naffording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a \n\nconference with the Assistant Secretary, the imposition of Federal \n\nstaff in key State agency positions;\n\n    (7) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after \n\naffording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a \n\nconference with the Assistant Secretary, funding of the State agency on \n\na short-term basis or partial withholding of funds for a specific \n\nfunction or for a specific geographical area;\n\n    (8) Holding of public hearings in the State on the SWA's \n\ndeficiencies;\n\n    (9) Disallowance of funds pursuant to Sec.  658.702 (g); or\n\n    (10) If the matter involves a serious or continual violation, the \n\ninitiation of decertification procedures against the State agency, as \n\nset forth in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n    (b) The Regional Administrator must send, by registered mail, a \n\nNotice of Remedial Action to the SWA. The Notice of Remedial Action \n\nmust set forth the reasons for the remedial action. When such a notice \n\n\n\nis the result of violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs \n\n(20 CFR 653.100 et seq.) or the Complaint System (Sec. Sec.   658.400 \n\net seq.), a copy of said notice must be sent to the Administrator, who \n\nmust publish the notice promptly in the Federal Register.\n\n    (c) If the remedial action is other than decertification, the \n\nnotice must state that the remedial action must take effect \n\nimmediately. The notice must also state that the SWA may request a \n\nhearing pursuant to Sec.  658.707 by filing a request in writing with \n\nthe Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec.  658.707 within 20 working \n\ndays of the SWA's receipt of the notice. The offer of\n\n[[Page 20965]]\n\nhearing, or the acceptance thereof, however, does not stay or otherwise \n\ndelay the implementation of remedial action.\n\n    (d) Within 60 working days after the initial application of \n\nremedial action, the Regional Administrator must conduct a review of \n\nthe SWA's compliance with ES regulations unless the Regional \n\nAdministrator determines that a longer time period is necessary. In \n\nsuch cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in \n\nwriting of the circumstances which necessitate a longer time period, \n\nand specify that time period. If necessary, Department staff must \n\nconduct a follow-up visit as part of this review. If the SWA is in \n\ncompliance with the ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must \n\nfully document these facts and must terminate the remedial actions. The \n\nRegional Administrator must notify the SWA of his/her findings. When \n\nthe case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs \n\nor the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to the \n\nAdministrator, who must promptly publish the notice in the Federal \n\nRegister. The Regional Administrator must conduct, within a reasonable \n\ntime after terminating the remedial actions, a review of the SWA's \n\ncompliance to determine whether any remedial actions should be \n\nreapplied.\n\n    (e) If, upon conducting the on-site review referred to in paragraph \n\n(c) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds that the SWA \n\nremains in noncompliance, the Regional Administrator must continue the \n\nremedial action and/or impose different additional remedial actions. \n\nThe Regional Administrator must fully document all such decisions and, \n\nwhen the case involves violations of regulations governing services to \n\nMSFWs or the Complaint System, must send copies to the Administrator, \n\nwho must promptly publish the notice in the Federal Register.\n\n    (f)(1) If the SWA has not brought itself into compliance with ES \n\nregulations within 120 working days of the initial application of \n\n\n\nremedial action, the Regional Administrator must initiate \n\ndecertification unless the Regional Administrator determines that \n\ncircumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for a longer \n\nperiod of time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify \n\nthe Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate the \n\nlonger time period, and specify the time period.\n\n    (2) The Regional Administrator must notify the SWA by registered \n\nmail or by other legally viable means of the decertification \n\nproceedings, and must state the reasons therefor. Whenever such a \n\nnotice is sent to a State agency, the Regional Administrator must \n\nprepare five copies (hard copies or electronic copies) containing, in \n\nchronological order, all the documents pertinent to the case along with \n\na request for decertification stating the grounds therefor. One copy \n\nmust be retained. Two must be sent to the ETA National Office, one must \n\nbe sent to the Solicitor of Labor, Attention: Associate Solicitor for \n\nEmployment and Training, and, if the case involves violations of \n\nregulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, one \n\ncopy must be sent to the NMA. All copies must also be sent \n\nelectronically to each respective party. The notice sent by the \n\nRegional Administrator must be published promptly in the Federal \n\nRegister.\n\nSec.  658.705  Decision to decertify.\n\n    (a) Within 30 working days of receiving a request for \n\ndecertification, the ETA Assistant Secretary must review the case and \n\nmust decide whether to proceed with decertification.\n\n    (b) The Assistant Secretary must grant the request for \n\ndecertification unless he/she makes a finding that:\n\n    (1) The violations of ES regulations are neither serious nor \n\ncontinual;\n\n    (2) The State agency is in compliance; or\n\n    (3) The Assistant Secretary has reason to believe that the SWA will \n\nachieve compliance within 80 working days unless exceptional \n\ncircumstances necessitate a longer time period, pursuant to the \n\nremedial action already applied or to be applied. (In the event the \n\nAssistant Secretary does not have sufficient information to act upon \n\nthe request, he/she may postpone the determination for up to an \n\nadditional 20 working days in order to obtain any available additional \n\ninformation.) In making a determination of whether violations are \n\n``serious'' or ``continual,'' as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this \n\nsection, the Assistant Secretary must consider:\n\n\n\n    (i) Statewide or multiple deficiencies as shown by performance data \n\nand/or on-site reviews;\n\n    (ii) Recurrent violations, even if they do not persist over \n\nconsecutive reporting periods, and\n\n    (iii) The good faith efforts of the State to achieve full \n\ncompliance with ES regulations as shown by the record.\n\n    (c) If the Assistant Secretary denies a request for \n\ndecertification, he/she must write a complete report documenting his/\n\nher findings and, if appropriate, instructing that an alternate \n\nremedial action or actions be applied. Electronic copies of the report \n\nmust be sent to the Regional Administrator. Notice of the Assistant \n\nSecretary's decision must be published promptly in the Federal \n\nRegister, and the report of the Assistant Secretary must be made \n\navailable for public inspection and copying.\n\n    (d) If the Assistant Secretary decides that decertification is \n\nappropriate, he/she must submit the case to the Secretary providing \n\nwritten explanation for his/her recommendation of decertification.\n\n    (e) Within 30 working days after receiving the Assistant \n\nSecretary's report, the Secretary must determine whether to decertify \n\nthe SWA. The Secretary must grant the request for decertification \n\nunless he/she makes one of the three findings set forth in paragraph \n\n(b) of this section. If the Secretary decides not to decertify, he/she \n\nmust then instruct that remedial action be continued or that alternate \n\nactions be applied. The Secretary must write a report explaining his/\n\nher reasons for not decertifying the SWA and copies (hard copy and \n\nelectronic) will be sent to the State agency. Notice of the Secretary's \n\ndecision must be published promptly in the Federal Register, and the \n\nreport of the Secretary must be made available for public inspection \n\nand copy.\n\n    (f) Where either the Assistant Secretary or the Secretary denies a \n\nrequest for decertification and order further remedial action, the \n\nRegional Administrator must continue to monitor the SWA's compliance. \n\nIf the SWA achieves compliance within the time period established \n\npursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Regional Administrator \n\nmust terminate the remedial actions. If the SWA fails to achieve full \n\ncompliance within that time period after the Secretary's decision not \n\nto decertify, the Regional Administrator must submit a report of his/\n\nher findings to the Assistant Secretary who must reconsider the request \n\nfor decertification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of \n\nthis section.\n\nSec.  658.706  Notice of decertification.\n\n\n\n    If the Secretary decides to decertify a SWA, he/she must send a \n\nNotice of Decertification to the State agency stating the reasons for \n\nthis action and providing a 10 working day period during which the SWA \n\nmay request an administrative hearing in writing to the Secretary. The \n\nnotice must be published promptly in the Federal Register.\n\n[[Page 20966]]\n\nSec.  658.707  Requests for hearings.\n\n    (a) Any SWA which received a Notice of Decertification under Sec.  \n\n658.706 or a notice of disallowance under Sec.  658.702(g) may request \n\na hearing on the issue by filing a written request for hearing with the \n\nSecretary within 10 working days of receipt of the notice. This request \n\nmust state the reasons the SWA believes the basis of the decision to be \n\nwrong, and it must be signed by the State Administrator (electronic \n\nsignatures may be accepted).\n\n    (b) When the Secretary receives a request for a hearing from a \n\nState agency, he/she must send copies of a file containing all \n\nmaterials and correspondence relevant to the case to the Assistant \n\nSecretary, the Regional Administrator, the Solicitor of Labor, and the \n\nDOL Chief Administrative Law Judge. When the case involves violations \n\nof regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a \n\ncopy must be sent to the NMA.\n\n    (c) The Secretary must publish notice of hearing in the Federal \n\nRegister. This notice must invite all interested parties to attend and \n\nto present evidence at the hearing. All interested parties who make \n\nwritten request to participate must thereafter receive copies (hard \n\ncopy and/or electronic) of all documents filed in said proceedings.\n\nSec.  658.708  Hearings.\n\n    (a) Upon receipt of a hearing file by the Chief Administrative Law \n\nJudge, the case must be docketed and notice sent by electronic mail and \n\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, to the Solicitor of Labor, \n\nAttention: Associate Solicitor for Employment and Training, the \n\nAdministrator, the Regional Administrator and the State Administrator. \n\nThe notice must set a time, place, and date for a hearing on the matter \n\nand must advise the parties that:\n\n    (1) They may be represented at the hearing;\n\n    (2) They may present oral and documentary evidence at the hearing;\n\n    (3) They may cross-examine opposing witnesses at the hearing; and\n\n    (4) They may request rescheduling of the hearing if the time, \n\nplace, or date set are inconvenient.\n\n\n\n    (b) The Solicitor of Labor or the Solicitor's designee will \n\nrepresent the Department at the hearing.\n\nSec.  658.709  Conduct of hearings.\n\n    (a) Hearings must be conducted in accordance with secs. 5-8 of the \n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 et seq.\n\n    (b) Technical rules of evidence do not apply, but rules or \n\nprinciples designed to assure production of the most credible evidence \n\navailable and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination, must \n\nbe applied if necessary by the ALJ conducting the hearing. The ALJ may \n\nexclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. All \n\ndocuments and other evidence offered or taken for the record must be \n\nopen to examination by the parties. Opportunity must be given to refute \n\nfacts and arguments advanced on either side of the issue. A transcript \n\nmust be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance \n\nthereof is stipulated for the record.\n\n    (c) The general provisions governing discovery as provided in the \n\nRules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Court, title V, \n\n28 U.S.C., rules 26 through 37, may be made applicable to the extent \n\nthat the Administrative Law Judge concludes that their use would \n\npromote the proper advancement of the hearing.\n\n    (d) When a public officer is a respondent in a hearing in an \n\nofficial capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise \n\nceases to hold office, the proceeding does not abate and the officer's \n\nsuccessor is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings \n\nfollowing the substitution must be in the name of the substituted \n\nparty, but any misnomer not affecting the substantive rights of the \n\nparties must be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at \n\nany time, but the omission to enter such an order may not affect the \n\nsubstitution.\n\nSec.  658.710  Decision of the Administrative Law Judge.\n\n    (a) The ALJ has jurisdiction to decide all issues of fact and \n\nrelated issues of law and to grant or deny appropriate motions, but \n\ndoes not have jurisdiction to decide upon the validity of Federal \n\nstatutes or regulations.\n\n    (b) The decision of the ALJ must be based on the hearing record, \n\nmust be in writing, and must state the factual and legal basis of the \n\ndecision. Notice of the decision must be published in the Federal \n\nRegister and the ALJ's decision must be available for public inspection \n\nand copying.\n\n    (c) Except when the case involves the decertification of a SWA, the \n\ndecision of the ALJ will be considered the final decision of the \n\n\n\nSecretary.\n\n    (d) If the case involves the decertification of an appeal to the \n\nState agency, the decision of the ALJ must contain a notice stating \n\nthat, within 30 calendar days of the decision, the State agency or the \n\nAdministrator may appeal to the Administrative Review Board, United \n\nStates Department of Labor, by sending by registered mail, return \n\nreceipt requested, a written appeal to the Administrative Review Board, \n\nin care of the Administrative Law Judge who made the decision.\n\nSec.  658.711  Decision of the Administrative Review Board.\n\n    (a) Upon the receipt of an appeal to the Administrative Review \n\nBoard, United States Department of Labor, the ALJ must certify the \n\nrecord in the case to the Administrative Review Board, which must make \n\na decision to decertify or not on the basis of the hearing record.\n\n    (b) The decision of the Administrative Review Board must be final, \n\nmust be in writing, and must set forth the factual and legal basis for \n\nthe decision. Notice of the Administrative Review Board's decision must \n\nbe published in the Federal Register, and copies must be made available \n\nfor public inspection and copying.\n\nThomas E.
