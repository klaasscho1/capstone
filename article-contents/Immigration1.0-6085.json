{"title": "Labor Pact Reached At Townsend Culinary; Immigrants a Major Part of Work Force", "body": "\nAfter years of litigation, including a rare class action sexual harassment suit by the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the largely immigrant work force at Townsend Culinary Inc. in Laurel has won agreement on its \nfirst union contract.\n\nThe agreement negotiated earlier this month by Local 400 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union \nprovides wage increases, improved health benefits and union protections even if the company is sold.\n\nThe contract agreement also represents a major trend in unionizing efforts by organized labor that has, in effect, \nreturned to its roots by once again targeting poor, immigrant workers at the bottom of the nation's economic \nladder.\n\nApproximately 85 percent of the company's 200 hourly employees are noncitizens and, as a group, speak six \ndifferent languages. More than half the workers are female.\n\n\"They are who we used to be,\" said Local 400 President Jim Lowthers, referring to the immigrant past of many in \nthe labor movement. Local 400, with 40,000 members in Maryland, Virginia and bits of North Carolina and West \nVirginia, now has nine full-time organizers who speak Spanish, French, Vietnamese and Korean.\n\nThe breakthrough in contract talks came late last year when the federal courts upheld an injunction by the National \nLabor Relations Board and ordered the company to recognize the union and bargain for a contract. Soon after, in \nlate November, an administrative law judge at the NLRB added to the pressure on Townsend with a ruling that the \ncompany had violated federal labor law on a number of fronts.\n\nAt that point, said David Majors, vice president for human resources at Townsend, the company decided to settle \nthe case and negotiation a contract. \"We were in negotiations once we got the ruling from the NLRB judge,\" Major \nsaid.\n\nOnce the two sides sat down at the table the talks went quickly. Majors said agreement was reached after four \nbargaining sessions. \"It was very amicable,\" he said.\n\nThe new contract provides wage rates ranging from $ 6.25 to $ 8.40 an hour depending upon skill levels and bonus \npayments for workers with the lowest skills, and vacation benefits of up to five weeks after 25 years compared with \ntwo weeks maximum after six years of service. In the event the company is sold, the contract has a successorship \nclause, which means the new owner must recognize the union and the contract.\n\nThe EEOC sexual harassment suit is still unsettled, but Townsend attorney Barry Willoughby said there have been \ndiscussions about a possible settlement. The problem is who should pay more, Townsend or the W.R. Grace Co., \n\n\nwhich sold the food preparation company to Townsend in March 1996. Townsend maintains that the sexual \nharassment alleged by the EEOC occurred under Grace.\n\nA separate complaint by the Justice Department against Townsend also is pending. The government said \nTownsend violated the rights of two legal immigrants who were fired after failing to immediately produce certain \nimmigration documents. Both Willoughby and the union agree that the NLRB settlement effectively remedies the \nJustice Department complaint making that action moot.\n"}
