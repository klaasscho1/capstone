Cayce Clerk Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 1 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 2 Before KING, SMITH, and ELROD, Circuit Judges. \nJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge: The United States1 appeals a preliminary injunction, pending trial, forbidding \nimplementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program \n\n\n(&ldquo;DAPA&rdquo;). Twenty-six states (the &ldquo;states&rdquo;2) challenged DAPA under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;) and the Take Care Clause of the Constitution;3 in an impressive and thorough \nMemorandum Opinion and Order issued February 16, 2015, the district court enjoined the program on the ground \nthat the states are likely to succeed on their claim that DAPA is subject to the APA\u2019s procedural requirements. \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677 (S.D. Tex. 2015).4 The government appealed and moved to stay \nthe injunction pending resolution of the merits. After extensive briefing and more than two hours of oral argument, a \nmotions panel denied the stay after determining that the appeal was unlikely to succeed on its merits. Texas v. \nUnited States, 787 F.3d 733, 743 (5th Cir. 2015). Reviewing the district court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion, we \naffirm the preliminary injunction because the states have standing; they have established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their procedural and substantive APA claims; and they have satisfied the other elements \nrequired for an injunction.5 1 This opinion refers to the defendants collectively as &ldquo;the United States&rdquo; \nor &ldquo;the government&rdquo; unless otherwise indicated. 2 We refer to the plaintiffs collectively as &ldquo;the \nstates,&rdquo; but as appropriate we refer only to Texas because it is the only state that the district court \ndetermined to have standing. 3 We find it unnecessary, at this early stage of the proceedings, to address or decide \nthe challenge based on the Take Care Clause. 4 We cite the district court\u2019s opinion as &ldquo;Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. \nSupp. 3d at ___.&rdquo; 5 Our dedicated colleague has penned a careful dissent, with which we largely but Case: \n15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 2 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 3 I. A. In June 2012, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (&ldquo;DHS&rdquo;) implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nprogram (&ldquo;DACA&rdquo;).6 In the DACA Memo to agency heads, the DHS Secretary &ldquo;set[] forth how, \nin the exercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion, [DHS] should enforce the Nation\u2019s immigration laws against certain \nyoung people&rdquo; and listed five &ldquo;criteria [that] should be satisfied before an individual is considered for \nan exercise of prosecutorial discretion.&rdquo;7 The Secretary further instructed that &ldquo;[n]o individual should \nreceive deferred action . . . unless they [sic] first pass a background check and requests for relief . . . are to be \ndecided on a case by case basis.&rdquo;8 Although stating that &ldquo;[f]or individuals who are granted deferred \naction . . . , [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (&ldquo;USCIS&rdquo;)] shall accept applications to \ndetermine whether these individuals qualify for work authorization,&rdquo; the DACA Memo purported to \n&ldquo;confer[] no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.&rdquo;9 At least 1.2 million \npersons qualify for DACA, and approximately 636,000 applications were approved through 2014. respectfully \ndisagree. It is well-researched, however, and bears a careful read. 6 Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, Sec\u2019y, \nDep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., to David Aguilar, Acting Comm\u2019r, U.S. Customs and Border Prot., et al. 1 (June 15, 2012) \n(the &ldquo;DACA Memo&rdquo;), http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-\ndiscretionindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf. 7 Id.

In November 2014, by what is \ntermed the &ldquo;DAPA Memo,&rdquo; DHS expanded DACA by making millions more persons eligible for the \nprogram10 and extending &ldquo;[t]he period for which DACA and the accompanying employment authorization is \ngranted . . . to three-year increments, rather than the current twoyear increments.&rdquo;11 The Secretary also \n&ldquo;direct[ed] USCIS to establish a process, similar to DACA,&rdquo; known as DAPA, which applies to \n&ldquo;individuals who . . . have, [as of November 20, 2014], a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful \npermanent resident&rdquo; and meet five additional criteria.12 The Secretary stated that, although \n&ldquo;[d]eferred action does not confer any form of legal status in this country, much less citizenship[,] it [does] \nmean[] that, for a specified period of time, an individual is permitted to be lawfully present in the United \nStates.&rdquo;13 Of the approximately 11.3 million illegal aliens14 in the United 10 Memorandum from Jeh \nJohnson, Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., to Leon Rodriguez, Dir., USCIS, et al. 3-4 (Nov. 20, 2014),            \nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_deferred_action.pdf. 11 Id. at 3. The district \ncourt enjoined implementation of the following three DACA expansions, and they are included in the term \n&ldquo;DAPA&rdquo; in this opinion: (1) the &ldquo;age restriction exclud[ing] those who were older than 31 on the \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretionindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretionindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_deferred_action.pdf\n\n\ndate of the [DACA] announcement . . . will no longer apply,&rdquo; id.; (2) &ldquo;[t]he period for which DACA and \nthe accompanying employment authorization is granted will be extended to three-year increments, rather than the \ncurrent two-year increments,&rdquo; id.; (3) &ldquo;the eligibility cut-off date by which a DACA applicant must have \nbeen in the United States should be adjusted from June 15, 2007 to January 1, 2010,&rdquo; id. at 4. Dist. Ct. Op., \n86 F. Supp. 3d at 677-78 & n.111. 12 DAPA Memo at 4 (directing that individuals may be considered for deferred \naction if they &ldquo;[1] have, on [November 20, 2014], a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident; [2] have continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; [3] are physically present \nin the United States on [November 20, 2014], and at the time of making a request for consideration of deferred \naction with USCIS; [4] have no lawful status on [November 20, 2014]; [5] are not an enforcement priority as \nreflected in the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented \nImmigrants Memorandum; and [6] present no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, makes the grant of \ndeferred action inappropriate&rdquo;). 13 Id. at 2 (emphasis added). 14 Although &ldquo;[a]s a general rule, it is not \na crime for a removable alien to remain Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 4 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 \nNo. 15-40238 5 States, 4.3 million would be eligible for lawful presence pursuant to DAPA. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. \nSupp. 3d at 612 n.11, 670. &ldquo;Lawful presence&rdquo; is not an enforceable right to remain in the United \nStates and can be revoked at any time, but that classification nevertheless has significant legal consequences. \nUnlawfully present aliens are generally not eligible to receive federal public benefits, see 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1611, or \nstate and local public benefits unless the state otherwise provides, see 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1621.15 But as the \ngovernment admits in its opening brief, persons granted lawful presence pursuant to DAPA are no longer \n&ldquo;bar[red] . . . from receiving social security present in the United States,&rdquo; it is a civil offense. Arizona v. \nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2505 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), 1227(a)(1)(A)-(B). This \nopinion therefore refers to such persons as &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo;: The usual and preferable term in \n[American English] is illegal alien. The other forms have arisen as needless euphemisms, and should be avoided \nas neargobbledygook. The problem with undocumented is that it is intended to mean, by those who use it in this \nphrase, &ldquo;not having the requisite documents to enter or stay in a country legally.&rdquo; But the word \nstrongly suggests &ldquo;unaccounted for&rdquo; to those unfamiliar with this quasi-legal jargon, and it may \ntherefore obscure the meaning. More than one writer has argued in favor of undocumented alien . . . [to] avoid[] the \nimplication that one\u2019s unauthorized presence in the United States is a crime . . . . Moreover, it is wrong to equate \nillegality with criminality, since many illegal acts are not criminal. Illegal alien is not an opprobrious epithet: it \ndescribes one present in a country in violation of the immigration laws (hence &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;). BRYAN A. \nGARNER, GARNER\u2019S DICTIONARY OF LEGAL USAGE 912 (Oxford 3d ed. 2011) (citations omitted). And as the \ndistrict court pointed out, &ldquo;it is the term used by the Supreme Court in its latest pronouncement pertaining to \nthis area of the law.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 605 n.2 (citing Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. \n2492, 2497 (2012)). &ldquo;[I]legal alien has going for it both history and well-documented, generally accepted \nuse.&rdquo; Matthew Salzwedel, The Lawyer\u2019s Struggle to Write, 16 SCRIBES JOURNAL OF LEGAL WRITING \n69, 76 (2015). 15 Those provisions reflect Congress\u2019s concern that &ldquo;aliens have been applying for and \nreceiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[i]t \nis a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of \npublic benefits.&rdquo; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1601. Moreover, the provisions incorporate a national policy that \n&ldquo;aliens within the Nation\u2019s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs&rdquo; and that \n&ldquo;[s]elf-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country\u2019s earliest \nimmigration statutes.&rdquo; Id. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 5 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 6 retirement benefits, social security disability benefits, or health insurance under Part A of the Medicare \nprogram.&rdquo;16 That follows from &sect; 1611(b)(2)-(3), which provides that the exclusion of benefits in &sect; \n1611(a) &ldquo;shall not apply to any benefit[s] payable under title[s] II [and XVIII] of the Social Security Act . . . to \nan alien who is lawfully present in the United States as determined by the Attorney General . . . .&rdquo; (emphasis \nadded). A lawfully present alien is still required to satisfy independent qualification criteria before receiving those \nbenefits, but the grant of lawful presence removes the categorical bar and thereby makes otherwise ineligible \npersons eligible to qualify. &ldquo;Each person who applies for deferred action pursuant to the [DAPA] criteria . . . \nshall also be eligible to apply for work authorization for the [renewable three-year] period of deferred action.&rdquo; \nDAPA Memo at 4. The United States concedes that &ldquo;[a]n alien with work authorization may obtain a Social \nSecurity Number,&rdquo; &ldquo;accrue quarters of covered employment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;correct wage \n\n\n\nrecords to add prior covered employment within approximately three years of the year in which the wages were \nearned or in limited circumstances thereafter.&rdquo;17 The district court determined\u2015and the government does \nnot dispute\u2015&ldquo;that DAPA recipients would be eligible for earned income tax credits once they received a \nSocial Security number.&rdquo;18 As for state benefits, although &ldquo;[a] State may provide that an alien who is \nnot lawfully present in the United States is eligible for any State or local public benefit for which such alien would \notherwise be ineligible under 16 Brief for Appellants at 48-49 (citing 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1611(b)(2)-(3)). 17 Brief for \nAppellants at 49 (citation omitted) (citing 42 U.S.C. &sect; 405(c)(1)(B), (4), (5)(A)-(J); 8 C.F.R. &sect; 1.3(a)(4)(vi); \n20 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 422.104(a)(2), 422.105(a)). 18 Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 654 n.64; see also 26 U.S.C. \n&sect; 32(c)(1)(E), (m) (stating that eligibility for earned income tax credit is limited to individuals with Social \nSecurity numbers); 20 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 422.104(a)(2), 422.107(a), (e)(1). Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 6 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 7 subsection (a),&rdquo; &sect; 1621(d), Texas has \nchosen not to issue driver\u2019s licenses to unlawfully present aliens.19 Texas maintains that documentation \nconfirming lawful presence pursuant to DAPA would allow otherwise ineligible aliens to become eligible for state-\nsubsidized driver\u2019s licenses. Likewise, certain unemployment compensation &ldquo;[b]enefits are not payable \nbased on services performed by an alien unless the alien . . . was lawfully present for purposes of performing the \nservices . . . .&rdquo;20 Texas contends that DAPA recipients would also become eligible for unemployment \ninsurance. B. The states sued to prevent DAPA\u2019s implementation on three grounds. First, they asserted that DAPA \nviolated the procedural requirements of the APA as a substantive rule that did not undergo the requisite notice-\nandcomment rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C. &sect; 553. Second, the states claimed that DHS lacked the authority to \nimplement the program even if it followed the correct rulemaking process, such that DAPA was substantively \nunlawful under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(A)-(C). Third, the states urged that DAPA was an abrogation of \nthe President\u2019s constitutional duty to &ldquo;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.&rdquo; U.S. CONST. \nart. II, &sect; 3. The district court held that Texas has standing. It concluded that the state would suffer a financial \ninjury by having to issue driver\u2019s licenses to DAPA beneficiaries at a loss. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 616-23. \n19 TEX. TRANSP. CODE &sect; 521.142(a) (&ldquo;An applicant who is not a citizen of the United States must \npresent . . . documentation issued by the appropriate United States agency that authorizes the applicant to be in the \nUnited States before the applicant may be issued a driver\u2019s license.&rdquo; (emphasis added)). 20 TEX. LAB. \nCODE &sect; 207.043(a)(2) (emphasis added); see also 26 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(14)(A) (approval of state laws \nmaking compensation not payable to aliens unless they are &ldquo;lawfully present for purposes of performing \nsuch services&rdquo; (emphasis added)). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 7 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 8 Alternatively, the court relied on a new theory it called &ldquo;abdication \nstanding&rdquo;: Texas had standing because the United States has exclusive authority over immigration but has \nrefused to act in that area. Id. at 636-43. The court also considered but ultimately did not accept the notions that \nTexas could sue as parens patriae on behalf of citizens facing economic competition from DAPA beneficiaries and \nthat the state had standing based on the losses it suffers generally from illegal immigration. Id. at 625-36. The court \ntemporarily enjoined DAPA\u2019s implementation after determining that Texas had shown a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on its claim that the program must undergo notice and comment. Id. at 677. Despite full briefing, the court \ndid not rule on the &ldquo;Plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on their substantive APA claim or their constitutional \nclaims under the Take Care Clause/separation of powers doctrine.&rdquo; Id. On appeal, the United States \nmaintains that the states do not have standing or a right to judicial review and, alternatively, that DAPA is exempt \nfrom the notice-and-comment requirements. The government also contends that the injunction, including its \nnationwide scope, is improper as a matter of law. II. &ldquo;We review a preliminary injunction for abuse of \ndiscretion.&rdquo;21 A preliminary injunction should issue only if the states, as movants, establish (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, (3) that \nthe threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and \n(4) that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.[22] &ldquo;As to each element of the district \ncourt\u2019s preliminary-injunction analysis 21 Sepulvado v. Jindal, 729 F.3d 413, 417 (5th Cir. 2013). 22 Id. (quoting \nByrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir. 2009)). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 8 Date \nFiled: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 9 . . . findings of fact are subject to a clearly-erroneous standard of review, while \nconclusions of law are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.&rdquo;23 III. The government \nclaims the states lack standing to challenge DAPA. As we will analyze, however, their standing is plain, based on \nthe driver\u2019s-license rationale,24 so we need not address the other possible grounds for standing. As the parties \n\n\n\ninvoking federal jurisdiction, the states have the burden of establishing standing. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, \n133 S. Ct. 1138, 1148 (2013). They must show an injury that is &ldquo;concrete, particularized, and actual or \nimminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.&rdquo; Id. at 1147 \n(citation omitted). &ldquo;When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some \npossibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly \nharmed the litigant.&rdquo; Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007). &ldquo;[T]he presence of one party \nwith standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement.&rdquo; Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006). 23 Id. (quoting Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 591-\n92 (5th Cir. 2011)). 24 We did not reach this issue in Crane v. Johnson, 783 F.3d 244 (5th Cir. 2015). There, we \nconcluded that neither the State of Mississippi nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (&ldquo;ICE&rdquo;) \nagents and deportation officers had standing to challenge DACA. Id. at 255. We explicitly determined that \nMississippi had waived the theory that Texas now advances: In a letter brief filed after oral argument, Mississippi \nput forward three new arguments in support of its standing, [including] (1) the cost of issuing driver\u2019s licenses to \nDACA\u2019s beneficiaries . . . . Because Mississippi failed to provide evidentiary support on these arguments and failed \nto make these arguments in their opening brief on appeal and below, they have been waived. Id. at 252 n.34. Case: \n15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 9 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 10 A. We begin by considering \nwhether the states are entitled to &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; in our standing inquiry under Massachusetts v. \nEPA. They are. The Court held that Massachusetts had standing to contest the EPA\u2019s decision not to regulate \ngreenhouse-gas emissions from new motor vehicles, which allegedly contributed to a rise in sea levels and a loss of \nthe state\u2019s coastal land. Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 526. &ldquo;It is of considerable relevance that the \nparty seeking review here is a sovereign State and not . . . a private individual&rdquo; because &ldquo;States are \nnot normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.&rdquo; Id. at 518.25 The Court identified two \nadditional considerations that entitled Massachusetts &ldquo;to special solicitude in [the Court\u2019s] standing \nanalysis.&rdquo; Id. at 520.26 First, the Clean Air Act created a procedural right to challenge the EPA\u2019s decision: \nThe parties\u2019 dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute, a question eminently suitable to \nresolution in federal court. Congress has moreover authorized this type of challenge to EPA action. That \nauthorization is of critical importance to the standing inquiry: &ldquo;Congress has the power to define injuries and \narticulate 25 The dissent, throughout, cleverly refers to the states, more than forty times, as the \n&ldquo;plaintiffs,&rdquo; obscuring the fact that they are sovereign states (while referring to the defendants as the \n&ldquo;government&rdquo;). See Dissent, passim. 26 The dissent attempts to diminish the considerable \nsignificance of the &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; language, which, to say the least, is inconvenient to the United \nStates in its effort to defeat standing. The dissent protests that it is &ldquo;only a single, isolated phrase&rdquo; \nthat &ldquo;appears only once.&rdquo; Dissent at 9. The dissent, however, avoids mention of the Court\u2019s \nexplanation that &ldquo;[i]t is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign \nState.&rdquo; Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 518. In light of that enlargement on the &ldquo;special \nsolicitude&rdquo; phrase, it is obvious that being a state greatly matters in the standing inquiry, and it makes no \ndifference, in the words of the dissent, &ldquo;whether the majority means that states are afforded a relaxed \nstanding inquiry by virtue of their statehood or whether their statehood, in [and] of itself, helps confer \nstanding.&rdquo; Dissent at 9. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 10 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 11 chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;In exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate \nand relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.&rdquo; We will not, therefore, &ldquo;entertain \ncitizen suits to vindicate the public\u2019s nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.&rdquo;[27] \nSecond, the EPA\u2019s decision affected Massachusetts\u2019s &ldquo;quasi-sovereign&rdquo; interest in its territory: When \na State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives. Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island \nto force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India, and in \nsome circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-\nempted. These sovereign prerogatives are now lodged in the Federal Government, and Congress has ordered EPA \nto protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing standards applicable to the &ldquo;emission of any air \npollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator\u2019s] judgment cause, or \ncontribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.&rdquo;[28] \nLike Massachusetts, the instant plaintiffs\u2015the states\u2015&ldquo;are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking \n\n\n\nfederal jurisdiction,&rdquo; id. at 518, and the same two additional factors are present. First, &ldquo;[t]he parties\u2019 \ndispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute,&rdquo;29 the APA, which authorizes challenges \nto &ldquo;final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.&rdquo; 5 U.S.C. &sect; 704. \nSimilarly, the disagreement in Massachusetts v. EPA concerned the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, which \nprovides for judicial review of &ldquo;final action taken[] by the Administrator.&rdquo; 27 Massachusetts v.

Further, as we will explain, the states are within the zone of interests of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (&ldquo;INA&rdquo;);30 they are not asking us to &ldquo;entertain citizen suits \nto vindicate the public\u2019s nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.&rdquo;31 In enacting the \nAPA, Congress intended for those &ldquo;suffering legal wrong because of agency action&rdquo; to have judicial \nrecourse,32 and the states fall well within that definition.33 The Clean Air Act\u2019s review provision is more specific \nthan the APA\u2019s, but the latter is easily adequate to justify &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; here. The procedural \nright to challenge EPA decisions created by the Clean Air Act provided important support to Massachusetts \nbecause the challenge Massachusetts sought to bring\u2015a challenge to an agency\u2019s decision not to act\u2015is \ntraditionally the type for which it is most difficult to establish standing and a justiciable issue.34 Texas, by contrast, \nchallenges DHS\u2019s affirmative decision to set guidelines for granting lawful presence to a broad class of illegal \naliens. Because the states here challenge DHS\u2019s decision to act, rather than its decision to remain inactive, a \nprocedural right similar to that created by the Clean Air Act is not necessary to support standing. See 5 U.S.C. \n&sect; 704. As we will show, DAPA would have a major effect on the states\u2019 fiscs, causing millions of dollars of \nlosses in Texas alone, and at least in Texas, the 30 See infra part IV. 31 Massachusetts v.

Second, DAPA affects the states\u2019 &ldquo;quasi-sovereign&rdquo; interests by \nimposing substantial pressure on them to change their laws, which provide for issuing driver\u2019s licenses to some \naliens and subsidizing those licenses.35 &ldquo;[S]tates have a sovereign interest in \u2018the power to create and \nenforce a legal code.\u2019&rdquo;36 Pursuant to that interest, states may have standing based on (1) federal assertions \nof authority to regulate matters they believe they control,37 (2) federal preemption of state law,38 and (3) federal \ninterference with the enforcement of state law,39 at least where &ldquo;the state statute at issue regulate[s] \nbehavior or provide[s] for the administration of a state program&rdquo;40 and does not &ldquo;simply purport[] to \nimmunize [state] citizens from federal law.&rdquo;41 Those intrusions are analogous to pressure to change state \nlaw.42 Moreover, these plaintiff states\u2019 interests are like Massachusetts\u2019s in 35 See, e.g., TEX. TRANSP. CODE \n&sect; 521.142(a) (specifying the requirements for licenses), .181 (providing for the issuance of licenses), .421(a) \n(setting the fees for licenses); Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F.

When the \nstates joined the union, they surrendered some of their sovereign prerogatives over immigration.43 They cannot \n\n\n\nestablish their own classifications of aliens,44 just as &ldquo;Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island to force \nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions [and] cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India.&rdquo;45 \nThe states may not be able to discriminate against subsets of aliens in their driver\u2019s license programs without \nrunning afoul of preemption or the Equal Protection Clause;46 similarly, &ldquo;in some circumstances[, \nMassachusetts\u2019s] exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-\nempted.&rdquo;47 Both these plaintiff states and Massachusetts now rely on the federal government to protect their \ninterests.48 These parallels confirm that DAPA affects the states\u2019 &ldquo;quasi-sovereign&rdquo; interests. The \nsignificant opinion in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, 135 S. Ct. 2652 \n(2015), announced shortly before oral argument herein, reinforces that conclusion. The Court held that the Arizona \nLegislature had standing to sue in response to a ballot initiative that removed its redistricting authority and vested it \ninstead in an independent commission. Id. at 2665-66. The Court emphasized that the legislature was &ldquo;an \ninstitutional plaintiff asserting an institutional injury&rdquo; to what it believed was its constitutional power to \nregulate elections. Id. at 2664. So too 43 See generally Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2498-2501. 44 See \nVillas at Parkside Partners v.

The Court also cited Massachusetts v. \nEPA as opining that the state in that case was &ldquo;entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.&rdquo; \nId. at 2664-65 n.10 (quoting Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 520). The United States suggests that three \npresumptions against standing apply here. The first is a presumption that a plaintiff lacks standing to challenge \ndecisions to confer benefits on, or not to prosecute, a third party. But the cases the government cites for that \nproposition either did not involve standing;49 concerned only nonprosecution (as distinguished from both \nnonprosecution and the conferral of benefits);50 or merely reaffirmed that a plaintiff must satisfy the standing \nrequirements.51 The second presumption is against justiciability in the immigration context. None of the cases the \ngovernment cites involved standing52 and include only general language about the government\u2019s authority over \nimmigration; without a specific discussion of standing, they are of limited relevance.53 The third presumption is that \n&ldquo;[t]he [Supreme] Court\u2019s standing analysis . . . has been \u2018especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the \ndispute would force [the Court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other 49 See Chaney, 470 U.S. at \n823; United States v.

In the other \ncase the government cites, &ldquo;we assume[d], without deciding, that the plaintiffs have standing.&rdquo; Texas \nv. United States, 106 F.3d 661, 664 n.2 (5th Cir. 1997). 53 We address justiciability in part V.B, infra.

Therefore, the states are entitled to &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; in the standing inquiry. We stress that \nour decision is limited to these facts. In particular, the direct, substantial pressure directed at the states and the fact \nthat they have surrendered some of their control over immigration to the federal government mean this case is \nsufficiently similar to Massachusetts v. EPA, but pressure to change state law may not be enough\u2015by itself\u2015in \nother situations. B. At least one state\u2014Texas\u2014has satisfied the first standing requirement by demonstrating that it \nwould incur significant costs in issuing driver\u2019s licenses to DAPA beneficiaries. Under current state law, licenses \nissued to beneficiaries would necessarily be at a financial loss. The Department of Public Safety &ldquo;shall \nissue&rdquo; a license to a qualified applicant.

A noncitizen &ldquo;must \npresent . . . documentation issued by the appropriate United States agency that authorizes the applicant to be in the \nUnited States.&rdquo; Id. &sect; 521.142(a).

Ct. Op., 86 \nF. Supp. 3d at 617. Instead of disputing those figures, the United States claims that the costs would be offset by \nother benefits to the state. It theorizes that, because DAPA beneficiaries would be eligible for licenses, they would \nregister their vehicles, generating income for the state, and buy auto insurance, reducing the expenses associated \nwith uninsured motorists. The government suggests employment authorization would lead to increased tax revenue \nand decreased reliance on social services. Even if the government is correct, that does not negate Texas\u2019s injury, \nbecause we consider only those offsetting benefits that are of the same type and arise from the same transaction \nas the costs.59 &ldquo;Once injury is shown, no 57 See TEX.

Standing is recognized to complain that some particular aspect of the relationship is unlawful \nand has caused injury.&rdquo;60 &ldquo;Our standing analysis is not an accounting exercise . . . .&rdquo;61 The \none case in which we concluded that the costs of a challenged program were offset by the benefits involved a much \ntighter nexus. In Henderson, 287 F.3d at 379-81, we determined that taxpayers lacked standing to challenge a \nLouisiana law authorizing a license plate bearing a pro-life message, reasoning that the plaintiffs had not shown \nthat the program would use their tax dollars, because the extra fees paid by drivers who purchased the plates could \nhave covered the associated expenses. The costs and benefits arose out of the same transaction, so the plaintiffs \nhad not demonstrated injury. Here, none of the benefits the government identifies is sufficiently connected to the \ncosts to qualify as an offset. The only benefits that are conceivably relevant are the increase in vehicle registration \nand the decrease in uninsured motorists, but even those are based on the independent decisions of DAPA \nbeneficiaries and are not a direct result of the issuance of licenses. Analogously, the Third Circuit held that sports \nleagues had standing to challenge New Jersey\u2019s decision to license sports gambling, explaining that damage to the \nleagues\u2019 reputations was a cognizable injury despite evidence that more people would have watched sports had \nbetting been allowed. NCAA, 730 F.3d 547, 557-58 (6th Cir. 2003) (deciding that grandparents had standing to \nchallenge a requirement that they pay more for Medicaid benefits than would similarly situated parents, even \nthough the grandparents may have received more of other types of welfare benefits). 60 13A CHARLES ALAN \nWRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE &sect; 3531.4, at 147 (3d ed. 2015) (footnote \nomitted). 61 NCAA v.

The diminished public perception of the \nleagues and the greater interest in sports were attributable to the licensing plan but did not arise out of the same \ntransaction and so could not be compared. In the instant case, the states have alleged an injury, and the \ngovernment predicts that the later decisions of DAPA beneficiaries would produce offsetting benefits. Weighing \nthose costs and benefits is precisely the type of &ldquo;accounting exercise,&rdquo; id. at 223, in which we cannot \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/real-idenforcement-brief\n\n\nengage. Texas has shown injury. C. Texas has satisfied the second standing requirement by establishing that its \ninjury is &ldquo;fairly traceable&rdquo; to DAPA. It is undisputed that DAPA would enable beneficiaries to apply for \ndriver\u2019s licenses, and there is little doubt that many would do so because driving is a practical necessity in most of \nthe state. The United States urges that Texas\u2019s injury is not cognizable, because the state could avoid injury by not \nissuing licenses to illegal aliens or by not subsidizing its licenses. Although Texas could avoid financial loss by \nrequiring applicants to pay the full costs of licenses, it could not avoid injury altogether. &ldquo;[S]tates have a \nsovereign interest in \u2018the power to create and enforce a legal code,\u2019&rdquo;62 and the possibility that a plaintiff \ncould avoid injury by incurring other costs does not negate standing.63 62 Tex. Office of Pub. Util. Counsel v. FCC, \n183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, \n601 (1982)). 63 See Texas v. United States, 497 F.3d 491, 497 (5th Cir. 2007). The dissent theorizes that if \n&ldquo;forcing Texas to change its laws would be an injury because states have a \u2018sovereign interest in the \n&ldquo;power to create and enforce a legal code,&rdquo;\u2019&rdquo; then Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 \n(1976) (per curiam), must be wrongly decided. Dissent at 12 n.16. The dissent posits that Pennsylvania (there) and \nTexas (here) faced pressure to change their laws, so their Article III standing vel non must be the same. But the \ndissent ignores a key distinction between Pennsylvania v. New Jersey and the instant case: As we explain below, \nthe pressure Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 19 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 20 Indeed, \ntreating the availability of changing state law as a bar to standing would deprive states of judicial recourse for many \nbona fide harms. For instance, under that theory, federal preemption of state law could never be an injury, because \na state could always change its law to avoid preemption. But courts have often held that states have standing \nbased on preemption.64 And states could offset almost any financial loss by raising taxes or fees. The existence of \nthat alternative does not mean they lack standing. Relying primarily on Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 \n(1976) (per curiam), the United States maintains that Texas\u2019s injury is self-inflicted because the state voluntarily \nchose to base its driver\u2019s license policies on federal immigration law. In Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, id. at 664, \n666, the Court held that several states lacked standing to contest other states\u2019 laws taxing a portion of nonresidents\u2019 \nincomes. The plaintiff states alleged that the defendant states\u2019 taxes injured them because the plaintiffs gave their \nresidents credits for taxes paid to other states, so the defendants\u2019 taxes increased the amount of those credits, \ncausing the plaintiffs to lose revenue. Id. at 663. The Court flatly rejected that theory of standing: In neither of the \nsuits at bar has the defendant State inflicted any injury upon the plaintiff States through the imposition of the \n[challenged taxes]. The injuries to the plaintiffs\u2019 fiscs were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by their respective \nstate legislatures. Nothing required Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont to extend a tax credit to their residents for \nincome taxes paid to New Hampshire, and nothing prevents Pennsylvania from withdrawing that credit for taxes \npaid to New Jersey. No State can be heard to complain about damage inflicted by its own hand. Id. at 664. that \nPennsylvania faced to change its laws was self-inflicted; Texas\u2019s is not. 64 See, e.g., Crank, 539 F.3d at 1242; \nAlaska, 868 F.2d at 443-44; Celebrezze, 766 F.2d at 232-33. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 20 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 21 The more recent decision in Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437 (1992), \nalso informs our analysis. There, the Court held that Wyoming had standing to challenge an Oklahoma law \nrequiring some Oklahoma power plants to burn at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. Id. at 447. The Court explained \nthat Wyoming taxed the extraction of coal in the state and that Oklahoma\u2019s law reduced demand for that coal and \nWyoming\u2019s corresponding revenue. Id. The Court emphasized that the case involved an &ldquo;undisputed&rdquo; \n&ldquo;direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.&rdquo; Id. at 448. It rejected Oklahoma\u2019s \ncontention &ldquo;that Wyoming is not itself engaged in the commerce affected, is not affected as a consumer, and \nthus has not suffered the type of direct injury cognizable in a Commerce Clause action,&rdquo; id., concluding that \nWyoming\u2019s loss of revenue was sufficient, id. at 448-50. The Court did not cite Pennsylvania v. New Jersey or \ndiscuss the theory that Wyoming\u2019s injury was self-inflicted. Both the Pennsylvania v. New Jersey plaintiffs and \nWyoming structured their laws in ways that meant their finances would have been affected by changes in other \nstates\u2019 laws. Because the tax credits in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey were based on taxes paid to other states, any \ntax increases in other states would have decreased the plaintiffs\u2019 revenues, and any tax cuts would have had the \nopposite effect. Analogously, Wyoming\u2019s tax was based on the amount of coal extracted there, so any policies in \nother states that decreased demand for that coal would have diminished Wyoming\u2019s revenues, and any policies that \nbolstered demand would have had the opposite effect. In other words, the schemes in both cases made the plaintiff \nstates\u2019 finances dependent on those of third parties\u2014either resident taxpayers or coal companies\u2014which in turn \nwere affected by other states\u2019 laws. The issues in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey and Wyoming v. Oklahoma were \n\n\n\nthus similar to the question here, but the Court announced different results. The two cases Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 21 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 22 are readily distinguishable, however, \nand, based on two considerations, Wyoming v. Oklahoma directs our decision. First, Texas and Wyoming sued in \nresponse to major changes in the defendant states\u2019 policies. Texas sued after the United States had announced \nDAPA, which could make at least 500,000 illegal aliens eligible for driver\u2019s licenses and cause millions of dollars of \nlosses; Wyoming sued after Oklahoma had enacted a law that cost Wyoming over $1 million in tax revenues. See \nid. at 445-46 & n.6. Conversely, the Pennsylvania v. New Jersey plaintiffs sued not because of a change in the \ndefendant states\u2019 laws but because they believed that Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U.S. 656 (1975), had \nrendered the defendants\u2019 laws unconstitutional. See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. at 661- 63. The fact that \nTexas sued in response to a significant change in the defendants\u2019 policies shows that its injury is not self-inflicted. \nSecond, the plaintiffs\u2019 options for accomplishing their policy goals were more limited in this case and in Wyoming v. \nOklahoma than in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey. Texas seeks to issue licenses only to those lawfully present in the \nUnited States, and the state is required to use federal immigration classifications to do so. See Villas at Parkside \nPartners, 726 F.3d at 536. Likewise, Wyoming sought to tax the extraction of coal and had no way to avoid being \naffected by other states\u2019 laws that reduced demand for that coal.65 65 It follows that the dissent\u2019s unsubstantiated \nclaim that &ldquo;Pennsylvania, like Texas, tied its law to that of another sovereign, whereas Wyoming did \nnot&rdquo; (emphasis added), is obvious error. Dissent at 12 n.16. The dissent ignores our explication of Texas\u2019s \nand Wyoming\u2019s policy goals. We do not assert that those states cannot change their laws to avoid injury from \nchanges in the laws of another state. Rather, we demonstrate that Texas and Wyoming cannot both change their \nlaws to avoid injury from amendments to another sovereign\u2019s laws and achieve their policy goals. For example, \nalthough, as we have said but the dissent overlooks, Wyoming easily could have avoided injury from changes in \nOklahoma\u2019s laws by abandoning entirely its tax on coal extraction, it would have surrendered its policy goal of \ntaxing extraction in the first Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 22 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 23 By way of contrast, the plaintiff states in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey could have achieved their policy \ngoal in myriad ways, such as basing their tax credits on residents\u2019 out-of-state incomes instead of on taxes actually \npaid to other states. That alternative would have achieved those plaintiffs\u2019 goal of allowing their residents to avoid \ndouble taxation of their out-of-state incomes, but it would not have tied the plaintiffs\u2019 finances to other states\u2019 laws. \nThe fact that Texas had no similar option means its injury is not self-inflicted. The decision in Amnesty International \nsupports this conclusion: The Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a provision of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act authorizing the interception of certain electronic communications. Amnesty Int\u2019l, 133 S. \nCt. at 1155. The plaintiffs alleged that they had been forced to take costly steps to avoid surveillance, such as \ntraveling to meet in person and not discussing certain topics by email or phone. Id. at 1150-51. The Court held that \nany such injuries were selfinflicted, id. at 1152-53, reasoning that plaintiffs &ldquo;cannot manufacture standing \nmerely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly \nimpending.&rdquo; Id. at 1151 (citing Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. at 664). &ldquo;If the law were \notherwise, an enterprising plaintiff would be able to secure a lower standard for Article III place. Similarly, Texas \ncould avoid financial loss by increasing fees, not subsidizing its licenses, or perhaps not issuing licenses to \nlawfully present aliens, but the consequence would be that by taking those actions Texas would have abandoned \nits fully permissible policy goal of providing subsidized licenses only to those who are lawfully present in the United \nStates\u2015a policy that, as we have repeatedly pointed out, Texas instituted well before the Secretary designed \nDACA or DAPA. In essence, the dissent would have us issue the following edict to Texas: &ldquo;You may avoid \ninjury to the pursuit of your policy goals\u2014injury resulting from a change in federal immigration law\u2014by changing \nyour laws to pursue different goals or eliminating them altogether. Therefore, your injuries are self-inflicted.&rdquo; \nPresumably the dissent would have liked for the Supreme Court to have issued a similar edict to Wyoming, which \nsought to tax the extraction of coal and had no way both to continue taxing extraction and to avoid being affected by \nOklahoma\u2019s laws that reduced demand for that coal. See Dissent at 12-13. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 23 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 24 standing simply by making an expenditure based \non a nonparanoid fear.&rdquo; Id. By way of contrast, there is no allegation that Texas passed its driver\u2019s license \nlaw to manufacture standing. The legislature enacted the law one year before DACA and three years before DAPA \nwas announced,66 and there is no hint that the state anticipated a change in immigration policy\u2015much less a \nchange as sweeping and dramatic as DAPA. Despite the dissent\u2019s bold suggestion that Texas\u2019s license-plate-cost \ninjury &ldquo;is entirely manufactured by Plaintiffs for this case,&rdquo; Dissent at 12, the injury is not self-inflicted. \n\n\n\nIn addition to its notion that Texas could avoid injury, the government theorizes that Texas\u2019s injury is not fairly \ntraceable to DAPA because it is merely an incidental and attenuated consequence of the program. But \nMassachusetts v. EPA establishes that the causal connection is adequate. Texas is entitled to the same \n&ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; as was Massachusetts, and the causal link is even closer here. For Texas to incur \ninjury, DAPA beneficiaries would have to apply for driver\u2019s licenses as a consequence of DHS\u2019s action, and it is \napparent that many would do so. For Massachusetts\u2019s injury to have occurred, individuals would have had to drive \nless fuel-efficient cars as a result of the EPA\u2019s decision, and that would have had to contribute meaningfully to a rise \nin sea levels, causing the erosion of the state\u2019s shoreline. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 523. There was \nsome uncertainty about whether the EPA\u2019s inaction was a substantial cause of the state\u2019s harm, considering the \nmany other emissions sources involved.67 But the Court held that Massachusetts had satisfied the causation 66 \nSee Certain State Fiscal Matters; Providing Penalties, ch. 4, sec. 72.03, &sect; 521.101(f-2), 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws \n5254, 5344 (codified at TEX. TRANSP. CODE &sect; 521.142(a)). 67 See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 523-\n24; id. at 540-45 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (questioning whether Massachusetts had lost land at all as a result of \nclimate change and whether the EPA\u2019s decision had contributed meaningfully to any erosion). Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 24 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 25 requirement because the possibility \nthat the effect of the EPA\u2019s decision was minor did not negate standing, and the evidence showed that the effect \nwas significant in any event. Id. at 524-25. This case raises even less doubt about causation, so the result is the \nsame. The matters in which the Supreme Court held that an injury was not fairly traceable to the challenged law \nreinforce this conclusion. In some of them, the independent act of a third party was a necessary condition of the \nharm\u2019s occurrence, and it was uncertain whether the third party would take the required step.68 Not so here. DAPA \nbeneficiaries have strong incentives to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, and it is hardly speculative that many would do so if \nthey became eligible. In other cases, in which there was insufficient proof of causation, several factors potentially \ncontributed to the injury, and the challenged policy likely played a minor role.69 68 See, e.g., Amnesty Int\u2019l, 133 S. \nCt. at 1147-50 (explaining that, for a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to have resulted in the \nmonitoring of the plaintiffs\u2019 communications, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence would \nhave had to authorize the collection of the communications, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would have \nhad to approve the government\u2019s request, and the government would have had to intercept the communications \nsuccessfully); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 156- 60 (1990) (reasoning that, for a death-row inmate\u2019s \ndecision not to appeal to have harmed the plaintiff, who was another death row inmate, the court hearing any \nappeal would have had to rule in a way favorable to the plaintiff). 69 See, e.g., Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 133 S. Ct. \n721, 731 (2013) (rejecting the theory &ldquo;that a market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a \ncompetitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\u2014whether a trademark, the awarding of a contract, a \nlandlord-tenant arrangement, or so on.&rdquo;); McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 228 (2003) (commenting that the \nplaintiffs, candidates for public office, were unable to compete not because of increased hard-money limits but \ninstead because of their personal decisions not to accept large contributions), overruled on other grounds by \nCitizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 756-59 (1984) (observing that any lack \nof opportunity for the plaintiffs\u2019 children to attend racially integrated public schools was attributable not only to tax \nexemptions for discriminatory private schools but also to the decisions of privateschool administrators and other \nparents), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377 \n(2014). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 25 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 26 Far from \nplaying an insignificant role, DAPA would be the primary cause and likely the only one. Without the program, there \nwould be little risk of a dramatic increase in the costs of the driver\u2019s-license program. This case is far removed from \nthose in which the Supreme Court has held an injury to be too incidental or attenuated. Texas\u2019s injury is fairly \ntraceable to DAPA. D. Texas has satisfied the third standing requirement, redressability. Enjoining DAPA based on \nthe procedural APA claim could prompt DHS to reconsider the program, which is all a plaintiff must show when \nasserting a procedural right. See id. at 518. And enjoining DAPA based on the substantive APA claim would \nprevent Texas\u2019s injury altogether. E. The United States submits that Texas\u2019s theory of standing is flawed because it \nhas no principled limit. In the government\u2019s view, if Texas can challenge DAPA, it could also sue to block a grant of \nasylum to a single alien or any federal policy that adversely affects the state, such as an IRS revenue ruling that \ndecreases a corporation\u2019s federal taxable income and corresponding state franchise-tax liability. The flaw in the \ngovernment\u2019s reasoning is that Massachusetts v. EPA entailed similar risks, but the Court still held that \nMassachusetts had standing. Under that decision, Massachusetts conceivably could challenge the government\u2019s \n\n\n\ndecision to buy a car with poor fuel efficiency because the vehicle could contribute to global warming. The state \nmight be able to contest any federal action that prompts more travel. Or it potentially could challenge any change in \nfederal policy that indirectly results in greenhouse-gas emissions, such as a trade-promotion program that leads to \nmore shipping. One of the Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 26 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 27 dissenting Justices in Massachusetts v. EPA criticized the decision on that ground,70 but the majority \nfound those concerns unpersuasive, just as they are here. After Massachusetts v. EPA, the answer to those \ncriticisms is that there are other ways to cabin policy disagreements masquerading as legal claims.71 First, a state \nthat has standing still must have a cause of action. Even the APA\u2014potentially the most versatile tool available to an \nenterprising state\u2014 imposes a number of limitations. A state must be defending concerns that are &ldquo;arguably \nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in \nquestion.&rdquo;72 It is unclear whether a state dissatisfied with an IRS revenue ruling would be defending such an \ninterest. Moreover, judicial review is unavailable where the statute precludes it or the matter is committed to agency \ndiscretion. 5 U.S.C. &sect; 701(a). Because of those restrictions, a state would have limited ability to challenge \nmany asylum determinations. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(b)(4)(D). Further, numerous policies that adversely affect \nstates either are not rules at all or are exempt from the noticeand-comment requirements. See generally 5 U.S.C. \n&sect; 553. Second, the standing requirements would preclude much of the litigation the government describes. For \nexample, it would be difficult to establish standing to challenge a grant of asylum to a single alien based on the \ndriver\u2019s-license theory. The state must allege an injury that has already occurred or is 70 See Massachusetts v. \nEPA, 549 U.S. at 546 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (&ldquo;Every little bit helps, so Massachusetts can sue over any \nlittle bit.&rdquo;). 71 The dissent responds to this by asserting that &ldquo;[t]he majority\u2019s observation that this suit \ninvolves \u2018policy disagreements masquerading as legal claims\u2019 is also telling.&rdquo; Dissent at 22. That of course is \nnot what our sentence (which is not a description of the suit at hand) says at all. 72 Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass\u2019n, 479 \nU.S. 388, 396 (1987) (quoting Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). \nCase: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 27 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 28 &ldquo;certainly \nimpending&rdquo;;73 it is easier to demonstrate that some DAPA beneficiaries would apply for licenses than it is to \nestablish that a particular alien would. And causation could be a substantial obstacle. Although the district court\u2019s \ncalculation of Texas\u2019s loss from DAPA was based largely on the need to hire employees, purchase equipment, and \nobtain office space,74 those steps would be unnecessary to license one additional person. Third, our determination \nthat Texas has standing is based in part on the &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; we afford it under Massachusetts \nv. EPA as reinforced by Arizona State Legislature. To be entitled to that presumption, a state likely must be \nexercising a procedural right created by Congress and protecting a &ldquo;quasi-sovereign&rdquo; interest. See \nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 520. Those factors will seldom exist. For instance, a grant of asylum to a single \nalien would impose little pressure to change state law. Without &ldquo;special solicitude,&rdquo; it would be difficult \nfor a state to establish standing, a heavy burden in many of the government\u2019s hypotheticals. Fourth, as a practical \nmatter, it is pure speculation that a state would sue about matters such as an IRS revenue ruling. Though not \ndispositive of the issue, the absence of any indication that such lawsuits will occur suggests the government\u2019s \nparade of horribles is unfounded,75 and its concerns about the possible future effects of Texas\u2019s theory of standing \ndo not alter our conclusion. The states have standing. 73 Amnesty Int\u2019l, 133 S. Ct. at 1147 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 565 n.2). 74 See Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 616-17 (discussing the \npotential loss and citing a portion of a declaration addressing those expenses). 75 See Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical \nLutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694, 710 (2012) (stating, in response to an alleged &ldquo;parade of \nhorribles,&rdquo; that &ldquo;[t]here will be time enough to address . . . other circumstances&rdquo; in future \ncases without altering the Court\u2019s present conclusion).

Because the states are suing under the APA, they &ldquo;must satisfy not \nonly Article III\u2019s standing requirements, but an additional test: The interest [they] assert[] must be \u2018arguably within \nthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute\u2019 that [they] say[] was violated.&rdquo;76 That \n&ldquo;test . . . \u2018is not meant to be especially demanding\u2019&rdquo; and is applied &ldquo;in keeping with Congress\u2019s \n\u2018evident intent\u2019 when enacting the APA \u2018to make agency action presumptively reviewable.\u2019&rdquo;77 The Supreme \nCourt &ldquo;ha[s] always conspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test to indicate that the benefit of any \ndoubt goes to the plaintiff,&rdquo; and &ldquo;[w]e do not require any \u2018indication of congressional purpose to \nbenefit the would-be plaintiff.\u2019&rdquo;78 &ldquo;The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s \u2018interests are so \nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed \n\n\n\nthat Congress intended to permit the suit.\u2019&rdquo;79 The interests the states seek to protect fall within the zone of \ninterests of the INA.80 &ldquo;The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish the importance of \nimmigration policy to the States,&rdquo; which &ldquo;bear[] many of the consequences of unlawful \nimmigration.&rdquo; Arizona v.

Reflecting a concern that &ldquo;aliens have been \napplying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates,&rdquo; 8 \nU.S.C. &sect; 1601, &ldquo;Congress deemed some unlawfully present aliens ineligible for certain state and local \npublic benefits unless the state explicitly provides otherwise.&rdquo;81 With limited exceptions, unlawfully present \naliens are &ldquo;not eligible for any State or local public benefit.&rdquo; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1621(a). Contrary to the \ngovernment\u2019s assertion, Texas satisfies the zone-ofinterests test not on account of a generalized grievance but \ninstead as a result of the same injury that gives it Article III standing\u2014Congress has explicitly allowed states to \ndeny public benefits to illegal aliens. Relying on that guarantee, Texas seeks to participate in notice and comment \nbefore the Secretary changes the immigration classification of millions of illegal aliens in a way that forces the state \nto the Hobson\u2019s choice of spending millions of dollars to subsidize driver\u2019s licenses or changing its statutes. V. The \ngovernment maintains that judicial review is precluded even if the states are proper plaintiffs. &ldquo;Any person \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved\u2019 by agency action . . . is entitled to \u2018judicial review thereof,\u2019 as long as the action is \na \u2018final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u2019&rdquo;82 &ldquo;But before any \nreview at all may be had, a party must first clear the hurdle of 5 U.S.C. &sect; 701(a). That section provides that the \nchapter on judicial review \u2018applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that\u2014 (1) statutes \npreclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to 81 United States v. Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1298 \n(11th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1621). 82 Chaney, 470 U.S. at 828 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n&sect;&sect; 702, 704). The government does not dispute that DAPA is a &ldquo;final agency action.&rdquo; See \nLujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 882 (1990).

EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2015).

If 500,000 unlawfully present aliens residing in Texas were \nreclassified as lawfully present pursuant to DAPA, they would become eligible for driver\u2019s licenses at a subsidized \nfee.

Deferred \naction under DAPA and \u2018lawful presence\u2019 during that limited period are thus two sides of the same coin.&rdquo;103 \n99 See supra part I.A. DAPA would also toll the duration of the recipients\u2019 unlawful presence under the INA\u2019s \nreentry bars, which would benefit aliens who receive lawful presence as minors because the unlawful-presence \nclock begins to run only at age eighteen. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I). Most adult beneficiaries would be \nunlikely to benefit from tolling because, to be eligible for DAPA, one must have continuously resided in the United \nStates since before January 1, 2010, and therefore would likely already be subject to the reentry bar for aliens who \nhave &ldquo;been unlawfully present in the United States for one year or more.&rdquo; &sect; 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II); \nsee &sect; 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). 100 See supra part I.A. 101 Cf.

The Cole Memo establishes how \nprosecutorial discretion will be used in relation to marihuana enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act. \nUnlike the DAPA Memo, it does not direct an agency to grant eligibility for affirmative benefits to anyone engaged in \nunlawful conduct. As we have explained, to receive public benefits, aliens accorded lawful presence must satisfy \nadditional criteria set forth in the various benefit schemes, but they nevertheless become eligible to satisfy those \ncriteria. That eligibility is itself a cognizable benefit. 102 Supplemental Brief for Appellants at 16.

Likewise, to be reviewable agency action, DAPA need \nnot directly confer public benefits\u2014removing a categorical bar on receipt of those benefits and thereby making a \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_\nhttp://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/\n\n\nclass of persons newly eligible for them &ldquo;provides a focus for judicial review.&rdquo; Chaney, 470 U.S. at \n832. Moreover, if deferred action meant only nonprosecution, it would not necessarily result in lawful presence. \n&ldquo;[A]lthough prosecutorial discretion is broad, it is not \u2018unfettered.\u2019&rdquo;104 Declining to prosecute does not \ntransform presence deemed unlawful by Congress into lawful presence and confer eligibility for otherwise \nunavailable benefits based on that change. Regardless of whether the Secretary has the authority to offer lawful \npresence and employment authorization in exchange for participation in DAPA, his doing so is not shielded from \njudicial review as an act of prosecutorial discretion. This evident conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndescription, in AAADC, of deferred action as a nonprosecution decision: To ameliorate a harsh and unjust outcome, \nthe INS may decline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or decline to execute a final order of \ndeportation. This commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without express statutory \nauthorization, originally was known as nonpriority and is now designated as deferred action . . . . Approval of \ndeferred action status means that . . . no action will thereafter be taken to proceed against an apparently \ndeportable alien, even on grounds normally regarded as aggravated.[105] In their procedural claim, the states do \nnot challenge the Secretary\u2019s decision 104 Wayte v.

Thus, DAPA &ldquo;provides a focus for judicial review, inasmuch as the \nagency must have exercised its power in some manner.

But where there is affirmative agency action\u2014as with DAPA\u2019s issuance of lawful \npresence and employment authorization\u2014and in light of the INA\u2019s intricate regulatory scheme for changing \nimmigration classifications and issuing employment authorization,110 &ldquo;[t]he action at least can be reviewed \nto determine whether the agency exceeded its statutory powers.&rdquo; Chaney, 470 U.S. at 832.

But if DAPA\u2019s deferred-action program must be subjected to notice-andcomment, \nthen work authorizations may not be validly issued pursuant to that subsection until that process has been \n\n\n\ncompleted and aliens have been &ldquo;granted deferred action.&rdquo; &sect; 274a.12(c)(14).

The dissent\u2019s insistent invocation of what it \nperceives as Congress\u2019s inadequate funding is regrettable and exposes the weakness of the government\u2019s legal \nposition.

The facts, not commentary on political decisions, are what should matter. Thus \nthe dissent\u2019s notion that &ldquo;this case essentially boils down to a policy dispute,&rdquo; Dissent at 22, far \nmisses the mark and avoids having to tackle the hard reality\u2015for the government\u2015of existing law. Similarly \nunimpressive is the dissent\u2019s resort to hyperbole. E.g., Dissent at 10 (&ldquo;[t]he majority\u2019s breathtaking expansion \nof state standing&rdquo;); id. at 11 (&ldquo;the majority\u2019s sweeping \u2018special solicitude\u2019 analysis&rdquo;); id. at 11 \n\n\n\nn.14 (&ldquo;the sweeping language the majority uses today&rdquo;); id. at 42 n.54 (&ldquo;this radical theory of \nstanding&rdquo;); id at 47 n.61 (&ldquo;The majority\u2019s ruling . . . is potentially devastating.&rdquo;).

At the very least, the statistics on which the dissent relies are highly \nmisleading. Although DHS claims that a record-high of 0.44 million aliens were deported in 2013, it arrives at that \nnumber by using only &ldquo;removals&rdquo; (which are deportations by court order) per year and ignoring \n&ldquo;returns&rdquo; (which are deportations achieved without court order). If, more accurately, one counts total \nremovals and returns by both ICE and the Border Patrol, deportations peaked at over 1.8 million in 2000 and \nplunged to less than half\u2015about 0.6 million\u2015in 2013.

At its core, this case is about the Secretary\u2019s decision to change the immigration classification \nof millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis. The states properly maintain that DAPA\u2019s grant of lawful presence \nand accompanying eligibility for benefits is a substantive rule that must go through notice and comment, before it \nimposes substantial costs on them, and that DAPA is substantively contrary to law. The federal courts are fully \ncapable of adjudicating those disputes. VI.

The district court did in fact mistakenly write &ldquo;denials&rdquo; \n(used to describe applications refused for failure to meet the criteria) in the above quoted passage where the \nUSCIS response actually said &ldquo;rejections&rdquo; (applications refused for procedural defects). USCIS \nreported that approximately 6% of DACA applicants were rejected and that an additional 4% were denied. USCIS \ndoes not draw a distinction between denials of applicants who did not meet the criteria and denials of those who \nmet the criteria but were refused deferred action as a result of a discretionary choice.

For example, the DACA National Standard Operating \nProcedures (&ldquo;SOP&rdquo;) specifically directs officers on which evidence an applicant is required to submit, \nwhat evidence is to be considered, &ldquo;the weight to be given&rdquo; to evidence, and the standards of proof \nrequired to grant or deny an application. U.S. DEP\u2019T OF HOMELAND SEC., NATIONAL STANDARD OPERATING \nPROCEDURES: DACA 42 (2012). To elaborate: An affidavit alone may not support an application, and DACA \napplicants must prove education and age criteria by documentary evidence. Id. at 8-10. The SOP also mandates, \nhowever, that &ldquo;[o]fficers will NOT deny a DACA request solely because the DACA requestor failed to submit \nsufficient evidence with the request . . . officers will issue a [Request for Evidence (RFE)] . . . whenever \npossible.&rdquo; Id. at 42.

And &ldquo;[w]hen an RFE is issued, the response time given \nshall be 87 days.&rdquo; SOP at 42. These specific evidentiary standards and RFE steps imposed by the SOP are \njust examples the district court had before it when it concluded that DACA and DAPA &ldquo;severely restrict[ \n]&rdquo; agency discretion.

This detailed explication of \nthe DAPA Memo flies in the face of the dissent\u2019s unjustified critique that the district court &ldquo;eschew[ed] the \nplain language of the [DAPA] Memorandum.&rdquo; Dissent at 31. 135 Texas v. United States, No. B-14-254, 2015 \nWL 1540022, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 7, 2015). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 46 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 47 The DACA and DAPA Memos purport to grant discretion, but a rule can be binding if it \nis &ldquo;applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is binding,&rdquo;136 and there was evidence from \nDACA\u2019s implementation that DAPA\u2019s discretionary language was pretextual. For a number of reasons, any \nextrapolation from DACA must be done carefully.137 First, DACA involved issuing benefits to self-selecting \napplicants, and persons who expected to be denied relief would seem unlikely to apply. But the issue of self-\nselection is partially mitigated by the finding that &ldquo;the [g]overnment has publicly declared that it will make no \nattempt to enforce the law against even those who are denied deferred action (absent extraordinary \ncircumstances).&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663 (footnote omitted). Second, DACA and DAPA are not \nidentical: Eligibility for DACA was 136 Gen. Elec., 290 F.3d at 383; accord McLouth Steel, 838 F.2d at 1321-22 \n(reviewing historical conformity as part of determination of whether rule was substantive or non-binding policy, \ndespite language indicating that it was policy statement); id. at 1321 (&ldquo;More critically than EPA\u2019s language [,] \n. . . its later conduct applying it confirms its binding character.&rdquo;). 137 The dissent, citing National Mining \nAss\u2019n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 253 (D.C. Cir. 2014), criticizes the states and the district court for enjoining DAPA \nwithout &ldquo;an early snapshot&rdquo; of its implementation. Dissent at 32. First, the dissent overlooks a \nfundamental principle of preliminary injunctions: An injunction is of no help if one must wait to suffer injury before \nthe court grants it. United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001) (&ldquo;[T]he injury need not have \nbeen inflicted when application [for the injunction] is made or be certain to occur[.]&rdquo;). Second, the dissent \nassumes the conclusion of National Mining\u2014that the agency action in question is not subject to pre-enforcement \nreview\u2014is applicable here and asserts that we need an &ldquo;early snapshot&rdquo; of DAPA enforcement. The \ntwo cases are easily distinguished. The court found EPA\u2019s &ldquo;Final Guidance&rdquo; exempt from pre-\nenforcement review because it had &ldquo;no legal impact.&rdquo; National Mining, 758 F.3d at 253; see id., at \n\n\n\n252 (&ldquo;The most important factor concerns the actual legal effect (or lack thereof) of the agency action on \nregulated entities. . . . As a legal matter, the Final Guidance is meaningless . . . [and] has no legal impact.&rdquo; \nDAPA, by contrast, has an effect on regulated entities (i.e. illegal aliens). DAPA removes a categorical bar to illegal \naliens who are receiving state and federal benefits, so it places a cost on the states. The states are not required to \nsuffer the injury of that legal impact before seeking an injunction. See id. 252. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 47 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 48 restricted to a younger and less numerous \npopulation,138 which suggests that DACA applicants are less likely to have backgrounds that would warrant a \ndiscretionary denial. Further, the DAPA Memo contains additional discretionary criteria: Applicants must not be \n&ldquo;an enforcement priority as reflected in the [Prioritization Memo]; and [must] present no other factors that, in \nthe exercise of discretion, makes the grant of deferred action inappropriate.&rdquo; DAPA Memo at 4. But despite \nthose differences, there are important similarities: The Secretary &ldquo;direct[ed] USCIS to establish a process, \nsimilar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion,&rdquo; id. (emphasis added), and there was evidence that \nthe DACA application process itself did not allow for discretion, regardless of the rates of approval and denial.139 \nInstead of relying solely on the lack of evidence that any DACA application had been denied for discretionary \nreasons, the district court found pretext for additional reasons. It observed that &ldquo;the \u2018Operating Procedures\u2019 \nfor implementation of DACA contains nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or denying deferred \naction to applicants&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[d]enials are 138 Approximately 1.2 million illegal aliens are eligible for \nDACA and 4.3 million for DAPA. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609, 670. 139 Despite these differences and the \ndissent\u2019s protestations to the contrary (see, e.g., Dissent at 34-38), DACA is an apt comparator to DAPA. The \ndistrict court considered the DAPA Memo\u2019s plain language, in which the Secretary equates the DACA and DAPA \nprocedure, background checks, fee exemptions, eligibility for work authorizations, durations of lawful presence and \nwork authorization, and orders DHS to establish, for DAPA, processes similar to those for DACA: In order to align \nthe DACA program more closely with the other deferred action authorization outlined below, . . . I hereby direct \nUSCIS to establish a process, similar to DACA . . . . There will be no fee waivers, and like DACA . . . . As with \nDACA, the above criteria are to be considered for all individuals . . . . DAPA Memo at 4-5. See Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. \nSupp. 3d at 610-11. The district court\u2019s conclusion that DACA and DAPA would be applied similarly, based as it \nwas in part on the memorandum\u2019s plain language, was not clearly erroneous and indeed was not error under any \nstandard of review. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 48 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 49 \nrecorded in a \u2018check the box\u2019 standardized form, for which USCIS personnel are provided templates. Certain \ndenials of DAPA must be sent to a supervisor for approval[, and] there is no option for granting DAPA to an \nindividual who does not meet each criterion.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (footnotes omitted). The \nfinding was also based on the declaration from Palinkas that, as with DACA, the DAPA application process itself \nwould preclude discretion: &ldquo;[R]outing DAPA applications through service centers instead of field offices . . . \ncreated an application process that bypasses traditional in-person investigatory interviews with trained USCIS \nadjudications officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;prevents officers from conducting case-by-case investigations, \nundermines officers\u2019 abilities to detect fraud and national-security risks, and ensures that applications will be \nrubber-stamped.&rdquo; See id. at 609-10 (citing that declaration). As the government points out, there was \nconflicting evidence on the degree to which DACA allowed for discretion. Donald Neufeld, the Associate Director for \nService Center Operations for USCIS, declared that &ldquo;deferred action under DACA is a . . . case-specific \nprocess&rdquo; that &ldquo;necessarily involves the exercise of the agency\u2019s discretion,&rdquo; and he purported \nto identify several instances of discretionary denials.140 Although Neufeld stated that approximately 200,000 \nrequests for additional evidence had been made upon receipt of DACA applications, the government does not know \nthe number, if any, that related to discretionary factors rather than the objective criteria. Similarly, 140 The states \nproperly maintain that those denials were not discretionary but instead were required because of failures to meet \nDACA\u2019s objective criteria. For example, Neufeld averred that some discretionary denials occurred because \napplicants &ldquo;pose[d] a public safety risk,&rdquo; &ldquo;[were] suspected of gang membership or gang-\nrelated activity, had a series of arrests without convictions&rdquo; or &ldquo;ongoing criminal \ninvestigations.&rdquo; As the district court aptly noted, however, those allegedly discretionary grounds fell squarely \nwithin DACA\u2019s objective criteria because DACA explicitly incorporated the enforcement priorities articulated in the \nDACA Operation Instructions and the memorandum styled Policies for Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of \nUndocumented Immigrants. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 n.101.

Reviewing for clear error, we conclude that the states have established a substantial likelihood that DAPA \nwould not genuinely leave the agency and its employees free to exercise discretion. B. A binding rule is not required \nto undergo notice and comment if it is one &ldquo;of agency organization, procedure, or practice.&rdquo; &sect; \n553(b)(A). &ldquo;[T]he substantial impact test is the primary means by which [we] look beyond the label \n\u2018procedural\u2019 to determine whether a rule is of the type Congress thought appropriate for public \nparticipation.&rdquo;143 &ldquo;An agency rule that modifies 141 The United States was also given the chance to \nshow that it planned to put DAPA into effect in a manner different from how it implemented DACA; it failed to take \nadvantage of that opportunity. Further, after assuring the district court that &ldquo;[USCIS] does not intend to \nentertain requests for deferred action under the challenged policy until February 18, 2015,&rdquo; the government \nlater admitted to having approved dozens of DAPA applications and threeyear employment authorization to more \nthan 100,000 aliens satisfying the original DACA criteria; the government could not demonstrate which applicants, \nif any, were rejected on purely discretionary grounds, as distinguished from failure to meet the requirements set \nforth in the memoranda. 142 After a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the government filed a sur-reply that \nincluded the Neufeld declaration. The government did not seek an evidentiary hearing, but the states requested one \nif the &ldquo;new declarations create a fact dispute of material consequence to the motion.&rdquo; No such hearing \nwas held, and the court cited the Palinkas declaration favorably, e.g., Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609-10, 613 \nn.13, 669 n.101, yet described other sources as providing insufficient detail, e.g., id. at 669 n.101. 143 U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nLabor v.

United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. The \nlimited ways in which illegal aliens can lawfully reside in the United States reflect Congress\u2019s concern that \n&ldquo;aliens have been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at \nincreasing rates,&rdquo; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1601(3), and that &ldquo;[i]t is a compelling government interest to enact \nnew rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \nnational immigration policy,&rdquo; &sect; 1601(5). In specific and detailed provisions, the INA expressly and \ncarefully provides legal designations allowing defined classes of aliens to be lawfully present162 and confers \neligibility for &ldquo;discretionary relief allowing [aliens in less formal than \u2018notice and comment\u2019 rulemaking does \nnot automatically deprive that interpretation of the judicial deference otherwise its due.&rdquo; Barnhart v. Walton, \n535 U.S. 212, 221 (2002) (citation omitted). Instead, we consider factors such as &ldquo;the interstitial nature of the \nlegal question, the related expertise of the Agency, the importance of the question to administration of the statute, \nthe complexity of that administration, and the careful consideration the Agency has given the question over a long \nperiod of time . . . .&rdquo; Id. We need not decide whether DHS\u2019s interpretation satisfies that test, however, \nbecause, as we explain, the agency cannot prevail even under Chevron. Chevron deference requires the courts to \naccept an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute as long as it is &ldquo;not patently inconsistent with the \nstatutory scheme.&rdquo; Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 813 (5th Cir. 2000). As explained \nbelow, we decide that, assuming Chevron deference does apply, DAPA is not a reasonable construction of the INA, \nbecause it is &ldquo;manifestly contrary&rdquo; to the INA statutory scheme. Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. & \nResearch v. United States, 562 U.S. 44, 53 (2011). An agency construction that is manifestly contrary to a statutory \nscheme could not be persuasive under the test in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), a test that affords \nagency constructions less deference than does Chevron. See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 256 (2006) \n(providing that under Skidmore, an &ldquo;interpretation is entitled to respect only to the extent it has the power to \npersuade&rdquo;). Therefore, our decision to forego discussion of the Walton factors is sensible.

The INA authorizes \ncancellation of removal and adjustment of status if, inter alia, &ldquo;the alien has been physically present in the \nUnited States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such \napplication&rdquo; and if &ldquo;removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s \nspouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence.&rdquo; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1229b(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).

DAPA Memo at 4. Although \nthe Secretary has discretion to make immigration decisions based on humanitarian grounds, that discretion is \nconferred only for particular family relationships and specific forms of relief\u2014none of which includes granting lawful \npresence, on the basis of a child\u2019s immigration status, to the class of aliens that would be eligible for DAPA.171 \nThe INA also specifies classes of aliens eligible172 and ineligible173 for work authorization, including those \n&ldquo;eligible for work authorization and deferred action&rdquo;\u2015with no mention of the class of persons whom \nDAPA would make eligible for work authorization.

Throughout the dissent is the notion that DHS must pursue DAPA because Congress\u2019s funding \ndecisions have left the agency unable to deport as many illegal aliens as it would if funding were available. But the \nadequacy or insufficiency of legislative appropriations is not relevant to whether DHS has statutory authority to \nimplement DAPA. Neither our nor the dissent\u2019s reasoning hinges on the budgetary feasibility of a more thorough \nenforcement of the immigration laws; instead, our conclusion turns on whether the INA gives DHS the power to \ncreate and implement a sweeping class-wide rule changing the immigration status of the affected aliens without full \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, especially where\u2015as here\u2015the directive is flatly contrary to the statutory text. \nThe dissent\u2019s repeated references to DAPA as the appropriate continuation of a longstanding practice, see, e.g., \nDissent at 2, badly mischaracterizes the nature of DAPA. Previous iterations of deferred action were limited in time \nand extent, affecting only a few thousand aliens for months or, at most, a few years.

As we have indicated, the INA prescribes how parents may derive an immigration classification on the basis \nof their child\u2019s status and which classes of aliens can achieve deferred action and eligibility for work authorization. \nDAPA is foreclosed by Congress\u2019s careful plan; the program is &ldquo;manifestly contrary to the statute&rdquo;201 \nand therefore was properly enjoined.202 VIII.

The states have shown &ldquo;that the threatened injury \nif the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted.&rdquo; Sepulvado, 729 \nF.3d at 417 (quoting Byrum, 566 F.3d at 445). The states have alleged a concrete threatened injury in the form of \nmillions of dollars of losses. The harms the United States has identified are less substantial. It claims that the \n\n\n\ninjunction &ldquo;obstructs a core Executive prerogative&rdquo; and offends separation-of-powers and federalism \nprinciples. Those alleged harms are vague, and the principles the government cites are more likely to be affected \nby the resolution of the case on the merits than by the injunction. Separately, the United States postulates that the \ninjunction prevents DHS from effectively prioritizing illegal aliens for removal. But the injunction &ldquo;does not \nenjoin or impair the Secretary\u2019s ability to marshal his assets or deploy the resources of the DHS [or] to set \npriorities,&rdquo; including selecting whom to remove first, see Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 678, and any \ninefficiency is outweighed by the major financial losses the states face. The government also complains that the \ninjunction imposes administrative burdens because DHS has already leased office space and begun hiring \nemployees to implement DAPA. Such inconveniences are common incidental effects of injunctions, and the \ngovernment could have avoided them by delaying preparatory work until the litigation was resolved.203 Finally, the \ngovernment reasonably speculates that the injunction burdens DAPA beneficiaries and 203 Cf. Kos Pharm., Inc. v. \nAndrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 728 (3d Cir. 2004) (&ldquo;[W]hen the potential harm to each party is weighed, a party \n\u2018can hardly claim to be harmed [where] it brought any and all difficulties occasioned by the issuance of an injunction \nupon itself.\u2019&rdquo; (second alteration in original) (quoting Opticians Ass\u2019n of Am. v.

This factor overlaps considerably with the previous \none, and most of the same analysis applies.204 The main difference is that, instead of relying on their financial \ninterests, the states refer to the public interest in protecting separation of powers by curtailing unlawful executive \naction. Although the United States cites the public interest in maintaining separation of powers and federalism by \navoiding judicial and state interference with a legitimate executive function, there is an obvious difference: The \ninterest the government has identified can be effectively vindicated after a trial on the merits. The interest the states \nhave identified cannot be, given the difficulty of restoring the status quo ante if DAPA were to be implemented.205 \nThe public interest easily favors an injunction. IX. The government claims that the nationwide scope of the \ninjunction is an abuse of discretion and requests that it be confined to Texas or the plaintiff 204 Cf. Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (&ldquo;Once an applicant satisfies the first two factors [for a stay of an alien\u2019s removal \npending judicial review], the traditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing \nthe public interest. These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.&rdquo;). 205 See Wenner v. \nTex. Lottery Comm\u2019n, 123 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir. 1997) (&ldquo;It is well settled that the issuance of a prohibitory \ninjunction freezes the status quo, and is intended \u2018to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the \nmerits can be held.\u2019 Preliminary injunctions commonly favor the status quo and seek to maintain things in their initial \ncondition so far as possible until after a full hearing permits final relief to be fashioned.&rdquo; (citation omitted) \n(quoting Univ. of Tex. v.

Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 70 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 71 KING, Circuit Judge, dissenting: Although there \nare approximately 11.3 million removable aliens in this country today, for the last several years Congress has \nprovided the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with only enough resources to remove approximately \n400,000 of those aliens per year.1 Recognizing DHS\u2019s congressionally granted prosecutorial discretion to set \nremoval enforcement priorities, Congress has exhorted DHS to use those resources to &ldquo;mak[e] our country \nsafer.&rdquo; In response, DHS has focused on removing &ldquo;those who represent threats to national security, \npublic safety, and border security.&rdquo; The DAPA Memorandum at issue here focuses on a subset of removable \naliens who are unlikely to be removed unless and until more resources are made available by Congress: those \nwho are the parents of United States citizens or legal permanent residents, who have resided in the United States \nfor at least the last five years, who lack a criminal record, and who are not otherwise removal priorities as \ndetermined by DHS. The DAPA Memorandum has three primary objectives for these aliens: (1) to permit them to \nbe lawfully employed and thereby enhance their ability to be self-sufficient, a goal of United States immigration law \nsince this country\u2019s earliest immigration statutes; (2) to encourage them to come out of the shadows and to identify \nthemselves and where they live, DHS\u2019s prime law enforcement objective; and (3) to maintain flexibility so that if \nCongress is able to make more resources for removal available, DHS will be able to respond. 1 During the period \nfrom 2009 through 2014, approximately 2.4 million aliens were removed from the United States. DHS claims that \nthis is a record number, and Plaintiffs do not dispute that point. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 71 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 72 Plaintiffs do not challenge DHS\u2019s ability to allow the aliens subject to the \nDAPA Memorandum\u2014up to 4.3 million, some estimate\u2014to remain in this country indefinitely. Indeed, Plaintiffs \nadmit that such removal decisions are well within DHS\u2019s prosecutorial discretion.2 Rather, Plaintiffs complain of the \nconsequences of DHS\u2019s decision to use its decades-long practice of granting &ldquo;deferred action&rdquo; to \nthese individuals, specifically that these &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; may temporarily work lawfully for a living and \nmay also eventually become eligible for some public benefits. Plaintiffs contend that these consequences and \nbenefits must be struck down even while the decision to allow the &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; to remain stands. \nBut Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge cannot be so easily bifurcated. For the benefits of which Plaintiffs complain are not \nconferred by the DAPA Memorandum\u2014the only policy being challenged in this case\u2014but are inexorably tied to \nDHS\u2019s deferred action decisions by a host of unchallenged, preexisting statutes and notice-and-comment \nregulations enacted by Congresses and administrations long past. Deferred action decisions, such as those \ncontemplated by the DAPA Memorandum, are quintessential exercises of prosecutorial discretion. As the Supreme \nCourt put it sixteen years ago, &ldquo;[a]t each stage [of the removal process] the Executive has discretion to \nabandon the endeavor, [including by] engaging in a regular practice (which had come to be known as \u2018deferred \naction\u2019) of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its own convenience.&rdquo;3 Because \nall parties agree that an exercise of prosecutorial discretion itself is unreviewable, this case should be dismissed on \njusticiability grounds. 2 In their briefing on appeal, Plaintiffs refute the &ldquo;mistaken premise that this lawsuit \nchallenges [DHS]\u2019s decision not to remove certain unauthorized aliens,&rdquo; making clear that &ldquo;[t]his \nlawsuit has never challenged any decision by the Executive to initiate or forego removal proceedings.&rdquo; \nAppellees\u2019 Suppl. Br. 18-19. 3 Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483-84 (1999). Case: \n15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 72 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 73 Even if this case were \njusticiable, the preliminary injunction, issued by the district court, is a mistake. If the Memorandum is implemented \nin the truly discretionary, case-by-case manner it contemplates, it is not subject to the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment \nrequirements, and the injunction cannot stand. Although the very face of the Memorandum makes clear that it must \n\n\n\nbe applied with such discretion, the district court concluded on its own\u2014prior to DAPA\u2019s implementation, based on \nimproper burden-shifting, and without seeing the need even to hold an evidentiary hearing\u2014that the Memorandum \nis a sham, a mere &ldquo;pretext&rdquo; for the Executive\u2019s plan &ldquo;not [to] enforce the immigration laws as to \nover four million illegal aliens.&rdquo; Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 638 (S.D. Tex. 2015) \n[hereinafter Dist. Ct. Op.]. That conclusion is clearly erroneous. The majority affirms and goes one step further \ntoday. It holds, in the alternative, that the Memorandum is contrary to the INA and substantively violates the APA. \nThese conclusions are wrong. The district court expressly declined to reach this issue without further development, \nid. at 677, and the limited briefing we have before us is unhelpful and unpersuasive. For these reasons, as set out \nbelow, I dissent. I. The DAPA Memorandum For all of the pounds of paper written about it, the DAPA Memorandum \nspans only five pages, and I attach it to this dissent for all to read.4 The D.C. Circuit (which hears more of these \nadministrative law cases than any other) has wisely observed that &ldquo;[s]ometimes a simple reading of the \ndocument and 4 The DAPA Memorandum is attached as Appendix A. As Appendix B, I also attach the Secretary\u2019s \nNovember 20, 2014, memorandum entitled &ldquo;Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of \nUndocumented Immigrants&rdquo; (Enforcement Priorities Memorandum), which itself is unchallenged by Plaintiffs, \nbut which the DAPA Memorandum incorporates by reference. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 73 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 74 study of its role in the regulatory scheme will yield the answer.&rdquo; \nPub. Citizen, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 940 F.2d 679, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The DAPA \nMemorandum is one of a series of memoranda issued by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on \nNovember 20, 2014. Broadly speaking, the Memorandum does two things: (1) it expands certain parameters of the \nprior DACA Memorandum, which provided guidelines for the use of deferred action with respect to certain \nindividuals who came to the United States as children; and (2) it includes &ldquo;guidance for case-by-case use of \ndeferred action for those adults who have been in this country since January 1, 2010, are the parents of U.S. \ncitizens or lawful permanent residents, and who are otherwise not enforcement priorities.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 3. It is \nimportant to recognize at the outset the backdrop upon which the Memorandum was written. As noted above, given \nthe resource constraints faced by DHS, the agency is faced with important prioritization decisions as to which \naliens should be the subject of removal proceedings. Congress has made clear that those decisions are to be \nmade by DHS, not by Congress itself\u2014and certainly not by the courts. Indeed, Congress has delegated to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security the authority to &ldquo;[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies and \npriorities,&rdquo; 6 U.S.C. &sect; 202(5),5 and to &ldquo;establish such regulations; . . . issue such instructions; \nand perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out&rdquo; his responsibilities, 8 U.S.C. &sect; \n1103(a)(3).6 Congress has given the Secretary some direction, in appropriations bills, as to how removal resources \nshould be spent\u2014by specifically devoting funding toward &ldquo;identify[ing] aliens convicted of a crime who may \nbe deportable, and . . . remov[ing] them from the United States once they are judged 5 This statute was passed in \n2002. 6 A version of this statute was first passed in 1990. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 74 Date \nFiled: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 75 deportable,&rdquo; and by making clear that the Secretary &ldquo;shall \nprioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the severity of that crime.&rdquo; \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 114-4, 129 Stat 39, 43 (2015). In an apparent \neffort to maximize the resources that can be devoted to such ends and consistent with his congressionally granted \nauthority to set enforcement priorities, the Secretary contends that he has chosen\u2014through the DACA and DAPA \nMemoranda\u2014to divert some of DHS\u2019s resources away from the lowest priority aliens to better enforce the \nimmigration laws against the highest priority aliens. See Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17-18 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(&ldquo;DACA and DAPA . . . apply to the portion of the population that [DHS] considers not threatening to public \nsafety and that has not had any involvement, or only minimal and minor involvement, with the criminal justice \nsystem.&rdquo;). By granting deferred action to children who were brought to this country unlawfully, and to the \nparents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (who otherwise have clean records), DHS has sought to \n&ldquo;encourage [those individuals] to come out of the shadows, submit to background checks, pay fees, apply \nfor work authorization . . . and be counted.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 3. Qualifying individuals can therefore work \n&ldquo;on the books&rdquo;\u2014meaning, of course, that they will pay taxes on the income they earn. Furthermore, \nthe Secretary points to the humanitarian aim of the DAPA Memorandum which, in conjunction with the DACA \nMemorandum, keeps families together\u2014at least temporarily. Cf. Reno, 525 U.S. at 484 (describing &ldquo;deferred \naction&rdquo; as an &ldquo;exercis[e] [of] discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the Executive\u2019s] own \nconvenience&rdquo;). And by encouraging removable aliens to selfidentify and register, both DACA and DAPA \n\n\n\nallow DHS to collect information (names, addresses, etc.) that will make it easier to locate these aliens in the \nfuture\u2014if and when DHS ultimately decides to remove them. DHS is, of Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 \nPage: 75 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 76 course, a law enforcement agency, and this is what we would \ncall &ldquo;good policing.&rdquo; Although these programs will likely apply to a large number of individuals, that \nresult is the inevitable upshot of decades of congressional appropriations decisions,7 which require DHS (whether \nby policy or by practice) to de-prioritize millions of removable aliens each year due to these resource constraints. \nThe DAPA Memorandum operates in two ways. First, with respect to the expansion of DACA, the DAPA \nMemorandum: removes the age cap (the DACA Memorandum excluded applicants over 31 years of age); extends \nthe period of deferred action from two to three years; and adjusts the date-of-entry requirement from June 15, 2007, \nto January 1, 2010. Second, the Memorandum establishes new deferred action guidance, &ldquo;direct[ing] USCIS \nto establish a process, similar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, \non a case-by-case basis, to those individuals&rdquo; who meet six threshold criteria: \uf0b7 have, on the date of this \nmemorandum, a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; \uf0b7 have continuously resided in \nthe United States since before January 1, 2010; \uf0b7 are physically present in the United States on the date of this \nmemorandum, and at the time of making a request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS; \uf0b7 have no \nlawful status on the date of this memorandum; \uf0b7 are not an enforcement priority as reflected in the [Enforcement \nPriorities Memorandum8]; and 7 The limited resources that Congress has made available to DHS for removals are \nmost probably a product of the nation\u2019s limited resources, not of penuriousness on the part of Congress. 8 The \nEnforcement Priorities Memorandum classifies aliens into three priority categories: (1) &ldquo;Priority 1 (threats to \nnational security, border security, and public safety)&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;Priority 2 (misdemeanants and new \nimmigration violators)&rdquo;; and (3) &ldquo;Priority 3 (other immigration violations).&rdquo; Appx. B, at 3-4. It \nfurther states that &ldquo;resources should be Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 76 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 77 \uf0b7 present no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, makes the grant of \ndeferred action inappropriate. Appx. A, at 4. The Memorandum describes deferred action as a &ldquo;form of \nprosecutorial discretion by which the Secretary deprioritizes an individual\u2019s case for humanitarian reasons, \nadministrative convenience, or in the interest of the Department\u2019s overall enforcement mission.&rdquo;9 Appx. A, at \n2. The Memorandum makes clear that deferred action: must be &ldquo;granted on a case-by-case basis&rdquo;; \n&ldquo;may be terminated at any time at the agency\u2019s discretion&rdquo;;10 and &ldquo;does not confer any form of \nlegal status in this country, much less citizenship.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 2. The Memorandum also states that although \n&ldquo;immigration officers will be provided with specific eligibility criteria for deferred action, . . . the ultimate \njudgment as to whether an immigrant is granted deferred action will be determined on a case-by-case \nbasis.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 5. In addition, the Memorandum makes clear that applicants must submit to a background \ncheck and pay a $465 fee.11 Appx. A, at 4-5. It notes that deferred action recipients are eligible to apply for \nemployment authorization.12 Appx. A, at 4. Finally, the Memorandum states that it &ldquo;confers no substantive \nright, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 5. dedicated, to the greatest degree possible, \nto the removal of aliens described in the priorities set forth above, commensurate with the level of prioritization \nidentified.&rdquo; Appx. B, at 5. 9 The Memorandum also summarizes the substantial past use of deferred action. \nAppx. A, at 2. 10 Therefore, if Congress were to substantially increase the amount of funding available to DHS for \nremovals, deferred action would pose no impediment to the removal even of these low-priority aliens. 11 DHS \ncontends that the fees collected will be sufficient to offset any administrative costs required to implement the DAPA \nMemorandum. 12 As discussed below, this is merely a statement of preexisting law. See 8 C.F.R. &sect; \n274a.12(c)(14). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 77 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 78 \nHolding that Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to this Memorandum is likely to succeed on the merits, the majority reaches four \nconclusions, the first three of which were reached by the district court, to sustain the preliminary injunction: (1) \nPlaintiffs have standing; (2) this case is justiciable and reviewable under the APA; (3) the DAPA Memorandum \nconstitutes a substantive rule that must go through the notice-and-comment process; and (4) the DAPA \nMemorandum is not authorized by statute and is a substantive violation of the APA. As to the first conclusion, the \nmajority finds that Texas is entitled to &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; in the standing analysis as DAPA implicates \nstate &ldquo;sovereignty concerns.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 10, 14. Within this framework of standing, Texas has \ndemonstrated an injury-in-fact because &ldquo;it would incur significant costs in issuing driver\u2019s licenses to DAPA \nbeneficiaries.&rdquo; Id. at 16. The majority contends that even though &ldquo;Texas could avoid financial loss by \nrequiring applicants to pay the full costs of licenses, it could not avoid injury altogether&rdquo; because \n\n\n\n&ldquo;avoid[ing] injury by incurring other costs does not negate standing.&rdquo; Id. at 19. Second, the majority \ndetermines that this action is reviewable under the APA even though DAPA helps set &ldquo;priority levels&rdquo; \nfor immigration enforcement, suggesting that it &ldquo;is a presumptively unreviewable exercise of \u2018prosecutorial \ndiscretion.\u2019&rdquo; Id. at 35. Despite this, the majority claims that DAPA is reviewable because it \n&ldquo;affirmatively confer[s] \u2018lawful presence\u2019 and associated benefits.&rdquo; Id. While reaching this conclusion \nthe majority also casts doubt on the validity of one of these benefits\u2014a decades-old regulation on employment \nauthorization, previously unchallenged in this suit. See id. at 39- 40. Third, recognizing that the &ldquo;DAPA Memo \nfacially purports to confer discretion,&rdquo; id. at 44, the majority nonetheless deems the DAPA Memorandum a \nsubstantive rule subject to the requirements of notice-and-comment rulemaking, id. at 44-54. According to the \nmajority, the district court\u2019s conclusion\u2014that &ldquo;[n]othing about DAPA \u2018genuinely leaves the agency and its \nCase: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 78 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 79 [employees] free to \nexercise discretion,\u2019&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 670\u2014 is not clearly erroneous, as there was at least \n&ldquo;conflicting evidence on the degree to which DACA allowed for discretion.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 49 \n(emphasis added). Finally, the majority reaches beyond the district court\u2019s judgment to conclude that DAPA \nconstitutes a substantive violation of the APA because it &ldquo;is not authorized by statute.&rdquo; Id. at 63. I \naddress each of these conclusions in turn. II. Standing While I would conclude that this case is non-justiciable, I \nwrite first to note my concerns with the majority\u2019s primary theory of standing, premised on an expansive notion of \nstate standing and Texas\u2019s increased costs due to the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses to DAPA recipients. Building off \na single, isolated phrase in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007), the majority finds that Texas has \n&ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; in the standing inquiry because &ldquo;DAPA affects the states\u2019 \u2018quasi-sovereign\u2019 \ninterests.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 13. It is altogether unclear whether the majority means that states are afforded a \nrelaxed standing inquiry by virtue of their statehood or whether their statehood, in of itself, helps confer standing. In \nany event, both propositions are deeply troublesome for three reasons. First, this reasoning misconstrues the \nholding of Massachusetts. In that case, the Supreme Court held that Massachusetts had standing to challenge the \nEPA\u2019s decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526. But it did so based on \nMassachusetts\u2019 quasi-sovereign interests and a provision of the Clean Air Act that specifically &ldquo;recognized a \nconcomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious.&rdquo; \nId. at 520 (citing 42 U.S.C. &sect; 7607(b)(1)). The Court there recognized that this statutory &ldquo;authorization \n[was] of critical importance to the standing inquiry.&rdquo; Id. at 516. By contrast, neither the INA Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 79 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 80 nor the APA specifically authorizes this \nsuit.13 Massachusetts also provides little instruction as to how far this &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; reaches. \nThe phrase appears only once in the Massachusetts majority opinion. And the Court has had no occasion to revisit \nit since.14 Second, the majority\u2019s ruling raises serious separation of powers concerns. Long recognized is \n&ldquo;the foundational role that Article III standing plays in our separation of powers.&rdquo; Ariz. Christian Sch. \nTuition Org. v. Winn, 131 S. Ct. 1436, 1443 (2011); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, \n125 n.20 (1998) (&ldquo;[O]ur standing doctrine is rooted in separationof-powers concerns.&rdquo;). By preserving \nthe proper bounds of Article III standing, the judiciary prevents itself from &ldquo;aggrandiz[ing] itself . . . at the \nexpense of one of the other branches.&rdquo; John G. Roberts, Jr., Article III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42 Duke \nL.J. 1219, 1230 (1993). The majority\u2019s breathtaking expansion of state standing would inject the courts into far \nmore federal-state disputes and review of the political branches than is now the case. While the majority claims that \nthe factors giving a state &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; to sue the federal government will &ldquo;seldom \nexist,&rdquo; its holding suggests otherwise. Majority Op. at 28. If the APA provides the requisite procedural right to \nfile suit\u2014as the majority indicates, see id. at 11\u2014 13 The majority suggests that the APA does provide specific \nauthorization for suit here because it &ldquo;authorizes challenges to \u2018final agency action for which there is no other \nadequate remedy in a court.\u2019&rdquo; Majority Op. at 11 (citing 5 U.S.C. &sect; 704). If this were the case, then \npresumably Massachusetts would have also referenced the APA as conferring a procedural right since the plaintiffs \nthere challenged &ldquo;final agency action&rdquo; within the ambit of the APA. Massachusetts did not, however, \neven refer to the APA. And, as discussed below, it would be odd if the APA provided such an expansive procedural \nright to states. 14 The notion of &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; was cited in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona \nIndependent Redistricting Commission (AIRC), 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2664-65 n.10 (2015)\u2014but as recognized by a \ntreatise, in a footnote, in an opinion that did not concern federal-state suits. That footnote correctly observed that \n&ldquo;[t]he cases on the standing of states to sue the federal government&rdquo; are &ldquo;hard to \n\n\n\nreconcile.&rdquo; Id. (quoting R. Fallon et al., Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System \n263-66 (6th ed. 2009)). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 80 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 \n81 and a state need only assert a &ldquo;quasi-sovereign interest&rdquo; to get &ldquo;special solicitude,&rdquo; \nthen states can presumably challenge a wide array of federal regulatory actions. The majority dismisses such a \npossibility as a &ldquo;parade of horribles&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfounded&rdquo; based on the lack of such \nlawsuits at the moment. Id. at 28. It is certainly possible to describe a parade of horribles that could result from the \nmajority\u2019s decision, but those horribles are only &ldquo;unfounded&rdquo; because the majority\u2019s broad ruling is \nuntested and unparalleled in any other court.15 By relaxing standing for state suits against the federal government, \nwe risk transforming ourselves into &ldquo;ombudsmen of the administrative bureaucracy, a role for which [we] are \nill-suited both institutionally and as a matter of democratic theory.&rdquo; Roberts, supra, at 1232. Third, and \nrelatedly, the majority\u2019s sweeping &ldquo;special solicitude&rdquo; analysis &ldquo;has no principled limit.&rdquo; \nMajority Op. at 26. Recognizing that fact, it &ldquo;stress[es] that [its] decision is limited to these facts.&rdquo; Id. at \n16. Really? If that were true, there would be no need to assuage concerns regarding the opinion\u2019s breadth by \narguing &ldquo;that there are other ways to cabin policy disagreements masquerading as legal claims.&rdquo; Id. \nat 27. It is hard for me to 15 The majority cites a number of cases to show that courts have held that states have \nstanding to sue the federal government. Majority Op. at 12-13. Many of these cases are inapposite. Alaska v. U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, 868 F.2d 441, 443-45 (D.C. Cir. 1989), found standing because the FAA, much like \nthe CAA in Massachusetts, created a procedural right to sue available to states. The court in Virginia ex rel. \nCuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 272 (4th Cir. 2011), actually denied standing. And Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. \nv. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592 (1982), Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986), and Maine v. Taylor, \n477 U.S. 131 (1986), did not involve federal-state suits. It is true that courts found state standing against the federal \ngovernment in Ohio ex rel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Department of Transportation, 766 F.2d 228, 232-33 (6th Cir. 1985), \nTexas Office of Public Utility v. Federal Communications Commission, 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999), Wyoming \nex rel. Crank v. United States, 539 F.3d 1236, 1241-44 (10th Cir. 2008), and New Mexico ex rel. Richardson v. \nBureau of Land Management, 565 F.3d 683, 696 n.13 (10th Cir. 2009), respectively. However, Celebrezze \npreceded the Supreme Court\u2019s more rigorous standing cases (i.e., post-Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555 (1992)). And Texas Office of Public Utility, Crank, and Richardson offered very cursory examinations of state \nstanding bereft of the sweeping language the majority uses today. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: \n81 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 82 see the bounds of the majority\u2019s broad ruling. Circuit Judge Alvin B. \nRubin of this court once wrote that &ldquo;[a]ny appellate opinion worth publishing should not merely give a \nreasoned disposition of the particular matter; it should, in addition, articulate a standard or a rule that can be applied \nby lawyers and judges in future cases.&rdquo; Alvin B. Rubin, Views From the Lower Court, 23 UCLA L. Rev. 448, \n451 (1976). Anything else is a &ldquo;\u2018railway ticket\u2019 decision\u2014good only for this day and station.&rdquo; Id. \nToday\u2019s decision is either just such a &ldquo;railway ticket&rdquo; (which, we are told, it actually aspires to be) or a \nbroad, new-fangled concept of state standing with little instruction going forward. Apart from its &ldquo;special \nsolicitude&rdquo; analysis, the majority also holds that Texas has standing because it suffered an injury-in-fact \ntraceable to DAPA. This injury results from two independent decisions made by Texas: (1) an alleged decision to \nunderwrite the costs of issuing driver\u2019s licenses to all applicants; and (2) a decision to allow deferred action \nrecipients to apply for driver\u2019s licenses. The majority claims, at length, that there is a &ldquo;pressure to change \nstate law,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 13, because the DAPA Memorandum has the downstream effect of expanding the \npool of potential Texas driver\u2019s license applicants, thus increasing the costs Texas has made the choice to bear. \nThis &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; is entirely manufactured by Plaintiffs for this case, and the majority and the district \ncourt have signed on. Nothing in the DAPA Memorandum suggests changes in state law. And I am skeptical that an \nincidental increase in state costs is sufficient to confer standing for the purposes of Article III. See Pennsylvania v. \nNew Jersey, 426 U.S. 660, 664 (1976) (&ldquo;No State can be heard to complain about damage inflicted by its \nown hand.&rdquo;). But see Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 448 (1992) (holding a state had standing to sue \nanother state when it suffered &ldquo;a direct injury in the form of a loss of specific Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 82 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 83 tax revenues&rdquo;).16 Such a theory of \nstanding\u2014based on the indirect economic effects of agency action\u2014could theoretically bestow upon states \nstanding to challenge any number of federal programs as well (assuming states have the motivation to create the \nfactual record to support those economic effects). I have serious misgivings about any theory of standing that \nappears to allow limitless state intrusion into exclusively federal matters\u2014effectively enabling the states, through \n\n\n\nthe courts, to second-guess federal policy decisions\u2014 especially when, as here, those decisions involve \nprosecutorial discretion. See AIRC, 135 S. Ct. at 2665 n.12 (&ldquo;The Court\u2019s standing analysis . . . has been \n\u2018especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute would force [the Court] to decide whether an action \ntaken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.\u2019&rdquo; (quoting Raines v. \nByrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20 (1997)). III. Justiciability I would conclude, as did Judge Higginson in dissenting from \nthe denial of a stay in this action, that this case is non-justiciable. I write only to supplement Judge Higginson\u2019s \nthorough and forceful analysis as to this issue, 16 Recognizing the tension between these two cases, the majority \nclaims that Texas\u2019s injury is like that of Wyoming in Wyoming v. Oklahoma, and not like that of Pennsylvania in \nPennsylvania v. New Jersey. But a principal difference in these cases was that Pennsylvania, like Texas, tied its \nlaw to that of another sovereign, whereas Wyoming did not. See Pennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 663 \n(&ldquo;Pennsylvania permits a tax credit to any of its residents for income taxes paid to other States, including, of \ncourse, New Jersey.&rdquo;). The majority asserts that forcing Texas to change its laws would be an injury \nbecause states have &ldquo;a sovereign interest in \u2018the power to create and enforce a legal code.\u2019&rdquo; Majority \nOp. at 19 (footnote omitted). Yet if that is enough of an injury, then presumably Pennsylvania should have had \nstanding in Pennsylvania v.

United States, 787 F.3d 733, 769-84 \n(5th Cir. 2015) (Higginson, J., dissenting). Plaintiffs concede that if the DAPA Memorandum is only an exercise in \nenforcement discretion\u2014without granting any &ldquo;additional benefits&rdquo;\u2014it is unreviewable under 5 U.S.C. \n&sect; 701(a).17 See Majority Op. at 54 n.156 (recognizing that &ldquo;a nonenforcement policy . . . presumptively \nwould be committed to agency discretion&rdquo;); see also Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985) \n(&ldquo;[A]n agency\u2019s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or criminal process, is a decision \ngenerally committed to an agency\u2019s absolute discretion.&rdquo;); Texas v. United States, 106 F.3d 661, 667 (5th \nCir. 1997) (&ldquo;An agency\u2019s decision not to take enforcement actions is unreviewable . . . .&rdquo;). Even the \ndistrict court concluded that &ldquo;decisions as to how to marshal DHS resources, how to best utilize DHS \nmanpower, and where to concentrate its activities are discretionary decisions solely within the purview of the \nExecutive Branch.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 645. But those are exactly the type of decisions the \nDAPA Memorandum contemplates. The Memorandum is a statement embodying the Secretary\u2019s tentative decision, \nbased on an assessment of the best uses of DHS\u2019s limited resources and under his congressionally delegated \nauthority to &ldquo;[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies and priorities,&rdquo; 6 U.S.C. &sect; \n202(5), not to remove qualifying applicants for a certain period of time.

See Arizona v. United States, 132 \nS. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012) (&ldquo;A principal feature of the Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 85 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 86 removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration \nofficials.&rdquo;);18 Reno, 525 U.S. at 490 (stating that concerns of judicial intrusion into enforcement decisions \n&ldquo;are greatly magnified in the deportation context&rdquo;); see also 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(g) (stripping courts \nof jurisdiction &ldquo;to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by \nthe Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any \nalien&rdquo;). To the extent the exercise of deferred action &ldquo;trigger[s]&rdquo; other benefits, those are not \nnew or &ldquo;associated&rdquo; benefits contained within the DAPA Memorandum itself. Majority Op. at 35-36.19 \nRather, those benefits are a function of statutes and regulations that were enacted by Congresses and \nadministrations long past\u2014statutes and regulations which, vitally, Plaintiffs do not challenge in this action. The \nability to apply for work authorization, the benefit on which the district court most heavily relied, has been tied to \ndeferred action by a federal regulation since the early 1980s. The most current such regulation, promulgated in \n1987, states that &ldquo;[a]n alien who has been granted deferred action, an act of administrative convenience to \nthe government which gives some cases lower priority,&rdquo; may apply for work authorization &ldquo;if the alien \nestablishes an economic necessity for employment.&rdquo;20 8 C.F.R. 18 The majority repeatedly cites Arizona to \nsupport its position, including an assertion that &ldquo;[t]he pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish \nthe importance of immigration policy to the States.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 29-30 (citing Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2500). \nTo say the least, the majority\u2019s reliance on Arizona is misplaced. Arizona repeatedly approved of broad discretion in \nfederal immigration enforcement and actually held that a state law concerning immigration was preempted. 19 Nor \ndoes the DAPA Memorandum do anything to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits. 20 A predecessor \nregulation enacted in 1981 similarly stated that &ldquo;[a]ny alien in whose case the district director recommends \nconsideration of deferred action, an act of administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases \nlower priority&rdquo; may apply for work authorization &ldquo;[p]rovided, [t]he alien establishes to the satisfaction \nof the district director that he/she is financially unable to maintain himself/herself and family Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 86 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 87 &sect; 274a.12(c)(14). It is this \nregulation, not the DAPA Memorandum, which affords those granted deferred action the ability to apply for work \nauthorization. Plaintiffs did not challenge the validity of this regulation,21 and for good reason\u2014it was promulgated \nvia the notice-and-comment process.22 The majority nevertheless states that &sect; 274a.12(c)(14) as applied \n&ldquo;to any class of illegal aliens whom DHS declines to remove\u2014is beyond the scope of what the INA can \nreasonably be interpreted to authorize.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 40. This broad holding is very damaging to DHS\u2019s \nimmigration enforcement policy, which has operated, from time to time, on a class-wide basis. It stems from a \ndeeply flawed reading of the INA that I discuss below. Each of the other benefits relied on by the district court and \nthe majority\u2014not one of which is even mentioned on the face of the DAPA Memorandum\u2014results, if at all, from \nprior statutes and notice-and-comment regulations: (1) the suspension of the accrual of certain time periods for \nwithout employment.&rdquo; 46 Fed. Reg. 25,079, 25,081 (May 5, 1981) (formerly codified at 8 C.F.R. &sect; \n109.1(b)(6)). 21 Plaintiffs suggested at oral argument that they were challenging the statutory underpinnings of 8 \nC.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14), but that position is inconsistent with their briefing on appeal, in which they contend \nthat the work authorization regulation &ldquo;is not facially invalid,&rdquo; and in which they &ldquo;assum[e] \narguendo that the regulation is valid in all applications.&rdquo; Appellees\u2019 Br. 21 n.9. Moreover, throughout this \nlitigation, Plaintiffs stated that they were challenging only the validity of the DAPA Memorandum; this is \nunderscored by the complaint, which does not mention any challenge to the validity of 8 C.F.R. &sect; \n274a.12(c)(14). In any event, Plaintiffs\u2019 minimal and inconsistent briefing as to this issue cannot be considered \nsufficient to mount a challenge to a notice-and-comment regulation that has been on the books for decades, and we \nshould not decide this issue. See United States v. Scroggins, 599 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir. 2010) (&ldquo;A party that \nasserts an argument on appeal, but fails to adequately brief it, is deemed to have waived it. It is not enough to \nmerely mention or allude to a legal theory.&rdquo; (internal citations omitted)). 22 Congress, of course, can limit \nthose to whom work authorization is granted, see 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(a)(3) (barring the Attorney General from \ngranting work authorization to aliens who are &ldquo;arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the \nalien is to be removed from the United States&rdquo;), but it has not done so with respect to those eligible for \n\n\n\ndeferred action under DAPA.

And to the extent there are &ldquo;state benefits,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 36, \nto individuals granted deferred action, those benefits stem from state statutes or regulations, none of which is being \nchallenged here. Accordingly, DAPA itself grants no new rights or benefits. It merely announces guidelines for the \ngranting of deferred action (which may trigger benefits under this framework of preexisting law) in an effort to \n&ldquo;encourage [qualifying individuals] to come out of the shadows, submit to background checks, pay fees, \napply for work authorization . . . and be 23 See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (passed in 1997) (stating that \n&ldquo;[f]or purposes of [the illegal entry bars], an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present in the United States if \nthe alien is present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General \nor is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled&rdquo; (emphasis added)); Dhuka v. Holder, \n716 F.3d 149, 156 (5th Cir. 2013) (&ldquo;\u2018[A]uthorized by the Attorney General\u2019 describes an exercise of discretion \nby a public official.&rdquo; (quoting 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii))). DHS contends that this \n&ldquo;benefit&rdquo; is largely irrelevant here, as the vast majority of potential DAPA recipients have already \naccrued sufficient unlawful presence to trigger these statutory bars to admissibility. 24 See 8 U.S.C. &sect; \n1611(b)(2)-(3) (passed in 1997) (stating that aliens &ldquo;lawfully present in the United States as determined by \nthe Attorney General&rdquo; are not barred from receiving certain Social Security and Medicare benefits); 8 C.F.R. \n&sect; 1.3(a)(4)(vi) (promulgated in 2011) (defining an &ldquo;alien who is lawfully present in the United \nStates&rdquo; to include &ldquo;[a]liens currently in deferred action status&rdquo;). 25 See 20 C.F.R. &sect; \n422.104(a)(2) (promulgated in 2003) (stating that &ldquo;[a]n alien . . . under other authority of law permitting [the \nalien] to work in the United States&rdquo; is &ldquo;eligible for SSN assignment&rdquo;); 20 C.F.R. &sect; \n422.105(a) (promulgated in 2004) (stating that &ldquo;a current document authorized by [DHS] that verifies \nauthorization to work has been granted&rdquo; is sufficient documentation &ldquo;to enable SSA to issue an SSN \ncard that is valid for work&rdquo;). Under preexisting statutes and regulations, obtaining a Social Security number \nmay also trigger other benefits, such as earned income tax benefits. See 26 U.S.C. &sect; 32(c)(1)(E), (m) (passed \nin 1997). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 88 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 89 \ncounted.&rdquo;26 Appx. A, at 3. Even absent this announcement, the above benefits would attach to any grant of \ndeferred action. These tangible benefits aside, the majority concludes that the term &ldquo;lawful presence&rdquo; \nitself constitutes a benefit bestowed by the DAPA Memorandum because it is &ldquo;a change in designation that \nconfers eligibility for substantial federal and state benefits on a class of otherwise ineligible aliens.&rdquo; Majority \nOp. at 38. The majority ascribes some added importance to &ldquo;lawful presence.&rdquo; The Memorandum \nuses the phrase &ldquo;lawful presence&rdquo; to describe what deferred action is: &ldquo;Deferred action . . . \nsimply means that, for a specified period of time, an individual is permitted to be lawfully present in the United \nStates.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 2. As the Memorandum makes clear, &ldquo;[d]eferred action does not confer any form \nof legal status in this country, much less citizenship,&rdquo; and it &ldquo;may be terminated at any time at the \nagency\u2019s discretion.&rdquo; Id. at 2; see also Dhuka, 716 F.3d at 156 (&ldquo;We conclude that \u2018lawful status\u2019 \nimplies a right protected by law, while \u2018[lawful presence]\u2019 describes an exercise of discretion by a public \nofficial.&rdquo;); Chaudhry v.

Thus, &ldquo;lawful presence&rdquo; does not &ldquo;confer[] legal status upon its \nrecipients,&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 637 n.45 (emphasis added), nor does it constitute &ldquo;a \nchange in designation,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 38. Rather, both &ldquo;lawful presence&rdquo; and &ldquo;deferred \naction&rdquo; refer to nothing more than DHS\u2019s tentative decision, revocable at any time, not to remove an \nindividual for the time being\u2014i.e., the decision to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Even the majority 26 Of course, \nthe DAPA Memorandum itself does not grant anyone deferred action. Those decisions will be made in the future by \nDHS agents guided by the DAPA Memorandum. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 89 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 90 acknowledges that, at its core, &ldquo;deferred action [is] a nonprosecution \ndecision.&rdquo; Id. at 37 (citing Reno, 525 U.S. at 484).27 The Memorandum provides guidelines for this exercise \nof prosecutorial discretion, and thus falls squarely within DHS\u2019s &ldquo;broad discretion to \u2018decide whether it makes \nsense to pursue removal at all.\u2019&rdquo; Id. at 34; see also Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 645 (noting the \n\n\n\nSecretary\u2019s &ldquo;virtually unlimited discretion when prioritizing enforcement objectives and allocating its limited \nresources&rdquo;). Accordingly, precedent compels the conclusion that this case is non-justiciable.28 See Texas, \n106 F.3d at 667 (concluding that an &ldquo;allegation that defendants have failed to enforce the immigration laws . . \n. is not subject to judicial review . . . because a court has no workable standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s \nexercise of discretion&rdquo;); see also Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831 (noting &ldquo;the general unsuitability for judicial \nreview of agency decisions to refuse enforcement&rdquo;); Johns v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 653 F.2d 884, 893 (5th Cir. \n1981) (&ldquo;Th[e] discretion [to commence deportation proceedings] is, like prosecutorial discretion, immune \nfrom review in the courts.&rdquo;). That a prior statute or regulation ties a benefit to the exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion does not make that ordinarily unreviewable exercise of prosecutorial discretion reviewable or turn it into \n&ldquo;affirmative agency action.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 39. Rather, the challenge is properly leveled at the prior \nlegislation that does the 27 Strangely, the majority cites to Reno to support its conclusion that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are \njusticiable. Reno stressed the broad discretion afforded to federal immigration officials and found the case at hand \nto be non-justiciable based on certain jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the INA. Reno, 525 U.S. at 484-92. 28 This \napproach would not, as Plaintiffs suggest, constitute a &ldquo;novel extension of Heckler,&rdquo; allowing DHS to \ninsulate grants of benefits from judicial review by attaching them to any enforcement policy. Appellees\u2019 Br. 18. \nRather, the crucial fact rendering this action non-justiciable is that the benefits at issue are not being granted by the \nMemorandum itself. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 doomsday scenario of DHS &ldquo;grant[ing] . . . voting rights . . . in \nconjunction with a non-removal policy,&rdquo; Appellees\u2019 Br. 18-19, would certainly be reviewable, as no \npreexisting statute or regulation grants voting rights to deferred action recipients. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 90 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 91 tying. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Kast Metals \nCorp., 744 F.2d 1145, 1156 (5th Cir. 1984) (deeming a rule non-substantive where the rule\u2019s &ldquo;substantive \neffect . . . is purely derivative&rdquo; of preexisting statutes and regulations). Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to formally challenge \nthe statutes and regulations discussed above\u2014either through the political process at the time of their enactment or \nin this litigation\u2014does not change the equation. It is always a risk that a different administration will be more \ngenerous with its discretion than the one in place at the time the statutes or regulations are passed. Moreover, that \nthese decisions will likely be made with respect to a large number of individuals, and that DHS seeks to organize \nthe process by memorializing these decisions and notifying applicants of the results, does not transform deferred \naction into anything other than an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Rather, as noted above, the scale of this \npolicy is a direct function of Congress\u2019s past appropriations decisions. Nor can it possibly be maintained that this \nexercise of prosecutorial discretion may be reviewed because DHS, which has been removing individuals from the \nUnited States in record numbers, &ldquo;\u2018consciously and expressly adopted a general policy\u2019 that is so extreme as \nto amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.&rdquo; 29 Heckler, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4. Although \nPlaintiffs may prefer a different approach to immigration 29 In determining that DHS has adopted such a policy, the \ndistrict court reasoned that &ldquo;the Government here is \u2018doing nothing to enforce\u2019 the removal laws against a \nclass of millions of individuals.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663 (quoting Texas, 106 F.3d at 667). But by \ncabining its sample size only to DAPA-eligible individuals, and ignoring DHS\u2019s record number of enforcement \nefforts against others, the district court\u2019s conclusion was preordained. Under the district court\u2019s logic, if DHS grants \ndeferred action to ten individuals, it would have &ldquo;abdicated its duty&rdquo; to enforce the immigration laws as \nto those ten individuals\u2014 rendering that action reviewable. Reading Heckler\u2019s narrow exception so broadly would \nswallow the general rule that &ldquo;an agency\u2019s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed \nimmune from judicial review.&rdquo; Heckler, 470 U.S. at 832. The majority does not appear to endorse this \nmisrepresentation today.

As we have stated, &ldquo;[r]eal or perceived inadequate \nenforcement of immigration laws does not constitute a reviewable abdication of duty.&rdquo; Id.; see also Heckler, \n470 U.S. at 834 (&ldquo;The danger that agencies may not carry out their delegated powers with sufficient vigor \ndoes not necessarily lead to the conclusion that courts are the most appropriate body to police this aspect of their \nperformance.&rdquo;). Finally, I would note that characterizing any &ldquo;associated&rdquo; benefits as flowing \nexclusively from the DAPA Memorandum\u2014despite the fact that they stem from separate legal authorities\u2014sets a \ndangerous precedent. The majority concludes that, in order to be reviewable, &ldquo;DAPA need not directly confer \npublic benefits&rdquo;; merely &ldquo;removing a categorical bar on receipt of those benefits and thereby making a \nclass of persons newly eligible for them \u2018provides a focus for judicial review.\u2019&rdquo; Majority Op. at 37. Under this \n\n\n\nlogic, any non-enforcement decision that triggers a collateral benefit somewhere within the background regulatory \nand statutory scheme is subject to review by the judiciary. As DHS notes, many exercises of prosecutorial \ndiscretion trigger such benefits. For example, a prosecutor\u2019s decision to place an individual in a federal pretrial \ndiversion program in lieu of prosecution may result in that individual receiving drug treatment. See Thomas E. \nUlrich, Pretrial Diversion in the Federal Court System, Fed. Prob., Dec. 2002 at 30, 32.30 At the very least, the \nmajority\u2019s reasoning would render reviewable every single exercise 30 While the majority suggests DAPA is more \nthan &ldquo;nonprosecution&rdquo; because it &ldquo;remov[es] a categorical bar on [the] receipt of . . . \nbenefits,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 37, diversion also removes a categorical bar on the receipt of benefits as convicted \ndrug offenders are otherwise ineligible for certain public benefits. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. &sect; 862a(a) (preventing \nthese offenders from receiving TANF and food stamps). Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 92 Date \nFiled: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 93 of deferred action\u2014programmatic or ad hoc\u2014as any grant of deferred action \ntriggers benefits under the statutes and regulations discussed above. While the district court distinguished away \nmany past exercises of deferred action as &ldquo;different in kind and scope&rdquo; from DAPA for the purposes \nof reviewability,31 Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 664, the majority does not cabin its conclusion. In fact, it \nsuggests that all exercises of deferred action would be subject to judicial scrutiny. Majority Op. at 35 \n(&ldquo;Deferred action . . . is much more than nonenforcement.&rdquo;) This is logic to which I cannot subscribe. \nBecause the DAPA Memorandum contains only guidelines for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and does not \nitself confer any benefits to DAPA recipients, I would deem this case non-justiciable. The policy decisions at issue in \nthis case are best resolved not by judicial fiat, but via the political process. That this case essentially boils down to a \npolicy dispute is underscored not only by the dozens of amicus briefs filed in this case by interested parties across \nthe ideological spectrum\u2014Mayors, Senators, Representatives, and law enforcement officials, among others\u2014but \nalso by the district court\u2019s opinion, which repeatedly expresses frustration that the Secretary is &ldquo;actively \nact[ing] to thwart&rdquo; the immigration laws and &ldquo;is not just rewriting the laws [but is] creating them from \nscratch.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663. The majority\u2019s observation that this suit involves &ldquo;policy \ndisagreements masquerading as legal claims&rdquo; is also telling. Majority Op. at 27. Whether or not the district \ncourt\u2019s characterization of this case is accurate\u2014though the record number of removals in recent years \ndemonstrates that it is not\u2014to the extent some are 31 As noted by DHS and various amici, the granting of deferred \naction\u2014even to whole classes of individuals\u2014has occurred for decades, under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 93 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 94 \nunhappy with the vigor of DHS\u2019s enforcement efforts, their remedies lie in the political process, not in litigation. See \nMathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81 (1976) (&ldquo;For reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for \nregulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political \nbranches of the Federal Government.&rdquo;). Congress is free to constrain DHS\u2019s discretion, and, ultimately, the \nvoters are free to express their approval or disapproval of DAPA through their choice of elected officials. See \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993) (&ldquo;[W]e hardly need to note that an agency\u2019s decision to ignore \ncongressional expectations may expose it to grave political consequences.&rdquo;). Accordingly, this case should \nbe dismissed on justiciability grounds. However, for the sake of thoroughness and to correct serious errors \ncommitted by the district court in granting the preliminary injunction and the majority in affirming that grant, I discuss \nbelow the merits of both APA claims. IV. APA Procedural Claim Our precedent is clear: &ldquo;As long as the \nagency remains free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise, then the agency action in \nquestion has not established a binding norm,&rdquo; and thus need not go through the procedures of notice-and-\ncomment. Prof\u2019ls & Patients for Customized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d 592, 596-97 (5th Cir. 1995) (citation \nomitted).32 Therefore, 32 As the Fifth Circuit has noted, in determining whether a rule is substantive, and thus \nsubject to notice-and-comment procedures, we must &ldquo;focus[] primarily on whether the rule has binding effect \non agency discretion or severely restricts it.&rdquo; Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 595 (footnote omitted). Plaintiffs \nnow appear to argue (for the first time) on appeal that regardless of the discretion it confers, the DAPA \nMemorandum is a substantive rule because it &ldquo;changed the law&rdquo; by granting benefits to 4.3 million \nindividuals. But as discussed above, the DAPA Memorandum itself confers no additional benefits. Moreover, the \nscale of the program has no bearing on the substantive rule inquiry\u2014i.e., whether the policy will be administered \nwith case-by-case discretion. See id.; McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317, 1320 (D.C. Cir. 1988) \n(&ldquo;The question for purposes of [5 U.S.C.] &sect; 553 is whether a statement is a rule of present binding \neffect; the answer depends on whether the statement constrains the agency\u2019s discretion.&rdquo;). Indeed, Plaintiffs \n\n\n\nput it best in a letter brief filed with Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 94 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. \n15-40238 95 in order for Plaintiffs to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits\u2014the required \nshowing for a preliminary injunction, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2014)\u2014\nPlaintiffs bore the burden of demonstrating that the Memorandum was non-discretionary. As the majority admits, \nthe Memorandum &ldquo;facially purports to confer discretion.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 44. But the district court \nignored this clear language, concluding that agency officials implementing DAPA will defy the Memorandum and \nsimply rubberstamp applications. In so doing, the district court disregarded a mountain of highly probative evidence \nfrom DHS officials charged with implementing DAPA, relying instead on selected excerpts of the President\u2019s public \nstatements, facts relating to a program materially distinguishable from the one at issue here, and improper burden-\nshifting. The majority now adopts the district court\u2019s conclusions wholesale and without question. Id. at 50. For the \nreasons set out below, I would hold that the Memorandum is nothing more than a general statement of policy and \nthat the district court\u2019s findings cannot stand, even under clear error review. A. The Language and Substance of the \nDAPA Memorandum In determining whether the DAPA Memorandum constitutes a substantive rule, we must begin \nwith the words of the Memorandum itself. See Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 596. The Memorandum states that it \nreflects &ldquo;new policies,&rdquo; Appx. A, at 1, and &ldquo;guidance for case-by-case use of deferred \naction,&rdquo; Appx. A, at 3. Accordingly, the Secretary characterizes the Memorandum as a &ldquo;general \nstatement[] of policy&rdquo;\u2014which is not subject to the notice-and-comment process. 5 U.S.C. &sect; \n553(b)(3)(A); see also Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 596 (&ldquo;[T]he description as \u2018policy\u2019 in the [statement] the \ndistrict court: &ldquo;To be sure, \u2018case-by-case discretion\u2019 determines whether the [Memorandum] is a \u2018substantive \nrule\u2019 under the APA.&rdquo; Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 95 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 96 itself . . . militate[s] in favor of a holding that [the statement] is not a substantive rule.&rdquo;). The \nMemorandum also repeatedly references (more than ten times) the discretionary, &ldquo;case-by-case&rdquo; \ndeterminations to be made by agents in deciding whether to grant deferred action. It emphasizes that, despite the \ncriteria contained therein, &ldquo;the ultimate judgment as to whether an immigrant is granted deferred action will \nbe determined on a case-by-case basis.&rdquo;33 Appx. A, at 5; see also Ass\u2019n of Flight Attendants-CWA v. \nHuerta, 785 F.3d 710, 717 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (stating that a document &ldquo;riddled with caveats is not&rdquo; likely \nto constitute a substantive rule); Brock v. Cathedral Bluffs Shale Oil Co., 796 F.2d 533, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, \nJ.) (concluding that agency guidelines for determining when to take enforcement action against mine operators did \nnot constitute a substantive rule where &ldquo;[t]he language of the guidelines is replete with indications that the \nSecretary retained his discretion to cite production-operators as he saw fit&rdquo;). Indeed, this court has already \nrecognized the &ldquo;discretion expressly granted under&rdquo; DAPA\u2014discretion that allows &ldquo;agent[s] to \ndeal with each alien on a case by case basis.&rdquo; Crane v. 33 The Memorandum also states that (1) \n&ldquo;DHS must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law&rdquo;; (2) our immigration laws \n&ldquo;are not designed to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each \ncase&rdquo;; (3) &ldquo;[d]eferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion by which the Secretary deprioritizes \nan individual\u2019s case for humanitarian reasons, administrative convenience, or in the interest of the Department\u2019s \noverall enforcement mission&rdquo;; (4) &ldquo;deferred action is legally available so long as it is granted on a \ncase-by-case basis, and it may be terminated at any time at the agency\u2019s discretion&rdquo;; (5) \n&ldquo;[h]istorically, deferred action has been used . . . on a case-by-case basis&rdquo;; (6) &ldquo;I am now \nexpanding certain parameters of DACA and issuing guidance for caseby-case use of deferred action&rdquo;; (7) \n&ldquo;[c]ase-by-case exercises of deferred action for children and long-standing members of American society \nwho are not enforcement priorities are in this Nation\u2019s security and economic interests&rdquo;; (8) &ldquo;I hereby \ndirect USCIS to establish a process . . . for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on \na case-by-case basis&rdquo;; (9) &ldquo;ICE is . . . instructed to review pending removal cases . . . of individuals \nidentified who meet the above criteria, and to refer such individuals to USCIS for case-by-case \ndeterminations&rdquo;; and (10) &ldquo;[i]t remains within the authority of the Executive Branch . . . to set forth \npolicy for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action within the framework of existing law.&rdquo; \nAppx. A, at 1-5. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 96 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 97 \nJohnson, 783 F.3d 244, 255 (5th Cir. 2015) (concluding that, on the record in Crane, the plaintiffs lacked standing to \nchallenge DACA). The discretionary nature of the DAPA Memorandum is further supported by the policy\u2019s \nsubstance. Although some of the Memorandum\u2019s criteria can be routinely applied,34 many will require agents to \nmake discretionary judgments as to the application of the respective criteria to the facts of a particular case. For \n\n\n\nexample, agents must determine whether an applicant &ldquo;pose[s] a danger to national security,&rdquo; Appx. \nB, at 3, whether the applicant is &ldquo;a threat to . . . border security&rdquo; or &ldquo;public safety,&rdquo; Appx. \nB, at 4, and whether the applicant has &ldquo;significantly abused the visa or visa waiver programs,&rdquo;35 \nAppx. B, at 4. Such criteria cannot be mechanically applied, but rather entail a degree of judgment; in other words, \nthey are &ldquo;imprecise and discretionary\u2014not exact and certain.&rdquo;36 Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 600 \n(concluding that an FDA policy delineating nine factors the agency should consider in determining whether to bring \nan enforcement action did not constitute a substantive rule). This aspect of the DAPA Memorandum appears to \nhave been overlooked by the district court, which\u2014in analyzing whether the Memorandum allows for case-by-case \ndiscretion\u2014was fixated on the extent to which applicants meeting DAPA\u2019s criteria would nonetheless be denied 34 \nFor example: whether the applicant has &ldquo;a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 4. 35 Although these criteria come from the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum, the \nDAPA Memorandum incorporates these criteria into its own, stating that deferred action may be granted to \nindividuals who &ldquo;are not an enforcement priority as reflected in the&rdquo; Enforcement Priorities \nMemorandum. Appx. A, at 4. 36 Similarly, an agent implementing the DACA Memorandum must make the \nthreshold discretionary determinations of whether the applicant has been convicted of &ldquo;a significant \nmisdemeanor,&rdquo; and whether the applicant &ldquo;poses a threat to national security or public safety.&rdquo; \nAnd as we concluded in Crane, the DACA Memorandum too &ldquo;makes it clear that the Agents shall exercise \ntheir discretion in deciding to grant deferred action, and this judgment should be exercised on a case-by-case \nbasis.&rdquo; Crane, 783 F.3d at 254-55. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 97 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 98 deferred action.37 Such an approach ignores the fact that applying these threshold \ncriteria itself involves an exercise of discretion. Most strikingly, the last criterion contained in the DAPA \nMemorandum is entirely open-ended, stating that deferred action should be granted only if the applicant \n&ldquo;present[s] no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, makes the grant of deferred action \ninappropriate.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 4. The Memorandum does not elaborate on what such &ldquo;other \nfactors&rdquo; should be considered\u2014leaving this analysis entirely to the judgment of the agents processing the \napplications. This court has held that such a caveat &ldquo;express[ing] that [a] list of . . . factors is neither \ndispositive nor exhaustive,&rdquo; &ldquo;clearly leaves to the sound discretion of the agency in each case the \nultimate decision whether to bring an enforcement action.&rdquo; Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 600-01. Indeed, \nconstruing the DAPA memorandum as a categorical grant of deferred action for all applicants meeting the other \nDAPA criteria would render this last criterion meaningless. Cf. Brock, 796 F.2d at 538. Thus, due to the presence of \nthese various flexible and indefinite criteria, the DAPA Memorandum is not a substantive rule that &ldquo;so fills out \nthe statutory scheme that upon application one need only determine whether a given case is within the rule\u2019s \ncriterion.&rdquo; Huerta, 785 F.3d at 718 (citation omitted); cf. Pickus v. U.S. Bd. of Parole, 507 F.2d 1107, 1113 \n(D.C. Cir. 1974) (concluding that the &ldquo;formula like&rdquo; guidance for determining the length of parole \nconstituted a substantive rule, as it involved the &ldquo;purely mechanical operation&rdquo; of computing a score \nusing exclusive criteria). 37 The majority perpetuates this error today by accepting the district court\u2019s \ncharacterizations of DAPA without question\u2014despite recognizing that there was &ldquo;conflicting \nevidence&rdquo; below and that extrapolating DAPA from DACA needed to &ldquo;be done carefully.&rdquo; \nMajority Op. at 47, 49. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 98 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 99 \nAs Judge Kavanaugh, writing for the D.C. Circuit, has stated, &ldquo;[t]he most important factor&rdquo; in \ndistinguishing between a substantive rule and a general statement of policy &ldquo;concerns the actual legal effect \n(or lack thereof) of the agency action in question on regulated entities.&rdquo; Nat\u2019l Mining Ass\u2019n v. McCarthy, 758 \nF.3d 243, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Here, the Memorandum makes clear that it &ldquo;confers no substantive right, \nimmigration status or pathway to citizenship.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 5. The majority suggests that DAPA \n&ldquo;modifies substantive rights and interests,&rdquo; by &ldquo;conferring lawful presence on 500,000 illegal \naliens&rdquo; and forcing Texas to change its laws. Majority Op. at 50-51. None of this appears on the face of the \nMemorandum though.38 In fact, nothing in the Memorandum indicates that it is legally binding\u2014i.e., that an \napplicant who is not granted deferred action can challenge that decision in court, or that DHS would be barred from \nremoving an applicant who appears to satisfy the Memorandum\u2019s criteria. See Tex. Sav. & Cmty. Bankers Ass\u2019n v. \nFed. Hous. Fin. Bd., 201 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir. 2000) (&ldquo;Substantive or legislative rules affect individual \nrights and obligations and are binding on the courts.&rdquo;); cf. Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. Young, 818 F.2d 943, 948 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (deeming enforcement criteria a substantive rule where, &ldquo;[a]s FDA conceded at \n\n\n\noral argument, it would be daunting indeed to try to convince a court that the agency could appropriately prosecute \na producer [who did not meet the agency\u2019s criteria for enforcement]&rdquo;). Nor does anyone assert that the \nMemorandum &ldquo;impose[s] any obligation or prohibition on regulated entities,&rdquo; i.e., the potential DAPA \napplicants.39 Huerta, 785 F.3d at 717; cf. Heckler, 38 &ldquo;Lawful presence,&rdquo; as previously indicated, is \nalso not a substantive right, but rather a form of nonprosecution that can be revoked at any time. Any purported \nharm to Texas is incidental and not contemplated by DAPA. 39 The majority suggests that there is a &ldquo;burden \nimposed on Texas&rdquo; by DAPA and even then concedes that this &ldquo;is derivative of issuing lawful \npresence to beneficiaries.&rdquo; Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 99 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. \n15-40238 100 470 U.S. at 832 (&ldquo;[W]hen an agency refuses to act it generally does not exercise its coercive \npower over an individual\u2019s liberty or property rights, and thus does not infringe upon areas that courts often are \ncalled upon to protect.&rdquo;). Moreover, even absent the DAPA Memorandum, DHS would have the authority to \ntake the action of which Plaintiffs complain\u2014i.e., by granting deferred action on an ad hoc basis. See McCarthy, \n758 F.3d at 253 (&ldquo;When the agency applies a general statement of policy in a particular situation, it must be \nprepared to support the policy just as if the policy statement had never been issued.&rdquo; (internal brackets \nomitted)). Accordingly, based on its language and substance, the Memorandum does not constitute a binding \nsubstantive rule subject to the requirements of notice-and-comment. The majority recognizes that the plain \nlanguage of Memorandum &ldquo;facially purports to confer discretion&rdquo; and does not argue that DAPA \ncreates a substantive rule from its four corners alone. Majority Op. at 44. Nonetheless, the district court reached the \nopposite conclusion. And it bears identifying the errors committed by the district court in holding that DAPA was a \nsubstantive rule on its face. The district court focused on the Memorandum\u2019s &ldquo;mandatory term[s], \ninstruction[s], [and] command[s]&rdquo;\u2014in particular, the Secretary\u2019s &ldquo;direct[ion]&rdquo; to USCIS to begin \nimplementing DAPA. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 671 n.103. But it should be no surprise that the Memorandum \n&ldquo;direct[s]&rdquo; the USCIS to establish a process for implementing this guidance, Appx. A, at 4; certainly \nthe Secretary did not intend for it to be ignored, see Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 599 (&ldquo;[W]hat purpose \nwould an agency\u2019s statement of policy serve if agency employees could not refer to it for guidance?&rdquo;). \nAlthough &ldquo;the Majority Op. at 52. But the analysis centers on the effect of the policy statement on regulated \nentities, and Texas is plainly not regulated by or even mentioned in the DAPA Memorandum. Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 100 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 101 mandatory tone of the factors is \nundoubtedly calculated to encourage compliance,&rdquo; such language does not transform a statement of policy \ninto a substantive rule so long as there is &ldquo;an opportunity for individualized determinations.&rdquo; Id. at 597. \nOur discussion in Professionals and Patients is particularly instructive on this point: True, the FDA had even greater \ndiscretion in bringing enforcement actions before [the policy for determining whether to bring enforcement actions \nagainst pharmacies] issued; prior to that time inspectors were apparently provided with no official guidance \nwhatsoever. In that sense, therefore, [the policy] has &ldquo;channeled&rdquo; the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion, \nproviding direction\u2014where once there was none\u2014by helping to determine whether a pharmacy is engaged in \ntraditional compounding or drug manufacturing. But all statements of policy channel discretion to some degree\u2014\nindeed, that is their purpose. The more cogent question therefore is whether [the policy] is so restrictive in defining \nwhich pharmacies are engaged in drug manufacturing that it effectively removes most, if not all, of the FDA\u2019s \ndiscretion in deciding against which pharmacies it will bring an enforcement action. We cannot read [the policy] that \nrestrictively. Id. at 600. Nor should the DAPA Memorandum be read so restrictively. Its channeling of agency \nenforcement discretion\u2014through the use of nonexhaustive, flexible criteria\u2014is entirely consistent with a non-\nsubstantive rule. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Roofing Contractors Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 639 F.3d 339, 341-42 (7th Cir. \n2011) (&ldquo;The Secretary committed to paper the criteria for allowing regulatory violations to exist without \nredress, a step essential to control her many subordinates. This does not make the exercise less \ndiscretionary.&rdquo;); Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 101 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 102 Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 667 (D.C. Cir. 1978) \n(&ldquo;The mandatory tone of the specifications for audits and auditors doubtless encourages compliance. \nHowever, an opportunity for an individualized determination is afforded.&rdquo;); see also Kast Metals Corp., 744 \nF.2d at 1152 n.13 (&ldquo;[A]gency instructions to agency officers are not legislative rules.&rdquo;). This is the law \nfor good reason. Requiring each and every policy channeling prosecutorial discretion to go through the notice-and-\ncomment process would perversely encourage unwritten, arbitrary enforcement policies. The plain language of the \nMemorandum cannot be characterized as &ldquo;draw[ing] a \u2018line in the sand\u2019 that, once crossed, removes all \n\n\n\ndiscretion from the agency.&rdquo; Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 601. Furthermore, the fact that the DAPA \nMemorandum relates to two areas in which courts should be reluctant to interfere\u2014immigration and prosecutorial \ndiscretion\u2014counsels in favor of concluding that it does not constitute a substantive rule. See Brock, 796 F.2d at 538 \n(&ldquo;Our decision [that the rule is non-substantive] is reinforced by the fact that the statement here in question \npertains to an agency\u2019s exercise of its enforcement discretion\u2014an area in which the courts have traditionally been \nmost reluctant to interfere.&rdquo;). Rather than relying on the language of the Memorandum, the majority \nconcludes that DAPA is a substantive rule because it &ldquo;would not genuinely leave [DHS] and its employees \nfree to exercise discretion&rdquo; in practice. Majority Op. at 50; see also Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 595 \n(quoting Young, 818 F.2d at 946). But in doing so, the majority relies unquestioningly on the district court\u2019s finding \nthat the discretionary language in DAPA was &ldquo;merely pretext&rdquo; and that DHS officials would not \nexercise case-by-case discretion of removals under DAPA. Majority Op. at 44; see also id. at 52 (&ldquo;DAPA \nestablishes \u2018the substantive standards by which the [agency] evaluates Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 \nPage: 102 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 103 applications.&rdquo; (alterations in original)). The district \ncourt\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous, however, and I turn to it next. B. Evidence of Pretext The district court erred \nnot only in its analysis of the legal effect of the DAPA Memorandum, but also in its resolution of the facts. By \neschewing the plain language of the Memorandum, and concluding that its discretionary aspects are &ldquo;merely \npretext,&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 n.101, the district court committed reversible error. To the \nextent the district court\u2019s pretext conclusion constitutes a factual finding entitled to &ldquo;clear error&rdquo; \nreview, that does not mean that we &ldquo;rubber stamp the district court\u2019s findings simply because they were \nentered.&rdquo; McLennan v. Am. Eurocopter Corp., 245 F.3d 403, 409 (5th Cir. 2001). Rather, &ldquo;[c]lear error \nexists when this court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.&rdquo; Ogden v. \nComm\u2019r, 244 F.3d 970, 971 (5th Cir. 2001) (per curiam). I am left with such a conviction for three independent \nreasons: (1) the record lacks any probative evidence of DAPA\u2019s implementation; (2) the district court erroneously \nequated DAPA with DACA; and (3) even assuming DAPA and DACA can be equated, the evidence of DACA\u2019s \nimplementation fails to establish pretext. It is true that the plain language of the Memorandum\u2014which, in the \nmajority\u2019s words, &ldquo;facially purports to confer discretion&rdquo;\u2014may not be conclusive if rebutted by \n&ldquo;what the agency does in fact.&rdquo; Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 596. Here, however, there is no such \nevidence of what the agency has done &ldquo;in fact,&rdquo; as DAPA has yet to be implemented. The district \ncourt ruled even before it had &ldquo;an early snapshot&rdquo; of the policy\u2019s implementation. McCarthy, 758 F.3d \nat 253 (stating that, &ldquo;because . . . recently issued guidance will have been implemented in only a few \ninstances,&rdquo; courts &ldquo;look[ing] to postguidance events to determine whether the agency has applied the \nguidance as Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 103 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 104 if it \nwere binding&rdquo; must rely on &ldquo;an early snapshot&rdquo;).40 Plaintiffs have cited no authority, and I am \nnot aware of any, deeming a statement of policy pretextual without direct evidence of the policy\u2019s implementation. \nCf. Interstate Nat. Gas Ass\u2019n of Am. v. FERC, 285 F.3d 18, 60 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (&ldquo;[I]f there have so far been \nany applications of the [agency]\u2019s policy, neither side has seen fit to bring it to our attention. So there is no basis \nhere for any claim that the [agency] has actually treated the policy with the de facto inflexibility of a binding \nnorm.&rdquo;). Nor should pretext be found here absent such evidence. As noted at the outset, courts should not \nbe quick to conclude that when a coordinate branch of government describes a policy as discretionary, it does not \nmean what it says. How, then, did the district court reach the conclusion that the DAPA Memorandum\u2019s express \ninclusion of case-by-case discretion is &ldquo;merely pretext&rdquo;? First, the district court selectively relied on \npublic statements the President made in describing the DAPA Memorandum to the public. Majority Op. at 46. But \nthere is no precedent for a court relying on such general pronouncements in determining a program\u2019s effect on the \nagency and on those being regulated. As Judge Higginson aptly noted in his dissent from 40 As several amici \nargue, a challenge to a statement of policy as pretextual may be unripe prior to the policy\u2019s implementation. For \nexample, where: [T]he facts are so wholly ambiguous and unsharpened as not to present a purely legal question \u2018fit \n. . . for judicial decision,\u2019 and where the agency\u2019s characterization of its action would fit them cleanly into a &sect; \n553 exemption, . . . the most prudent course [is] to await the sharpened facts that come from the actual workings of \nthe regulation in question before striking the objective down as violative of the APA. Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Bowen, 834 \nF.2d 1037, 1056 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (first alteration in original) (internal citation omitted); see Hudson v. FAA, 192 F.3d \n1031, 1034-35 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Pub. Citizen, Inc., 940 F.2d at 683. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 \nPage: 104 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 105 the denial of the motion for a stay, &ldquo;Presidents, like \n\n\n\ngovernors and legislators, often describe [a] law enthusiastically yet defend the same law narrowly.&rdquo; Texas, \n787 F.3d at 780 (Higginson, J., dissenting); see also Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 599 (reasoning that \n&ldquo;informal communications often exhibit a lack of \u2018precision of draftsmanship\u2019 and . . . internal \ninconsistencies&rdquo; and thus are &ldquo;entitled to limited weight&rdquo;).41 More importantly, the statements \nrelied upon by the district court are not inconsistent with the DAPA Memorandum\u2019s grant of discretion to agency \ndecision makers. For example, the President\u2019s statement that those who &ldquo;meet the [DAPA] criteria . . . can \ncome out of the shadows,&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 668, does not suggest that applications will be \nrubberstamped, given that (as discussed above) those very criteria involve the exercise of discretion. Similarly, the \nPresident\u2019s suggestion that agents who do not follow DAPA\u2019s guidelines may suffer consequences does not support \nthe conclusion that the Memorandum is pretextual. Rather, it supports the opposite conclusion\u2014that the terms of \nthe DAPA Memorandum, which incorporate case-by-case discretion, will be followed. An order to &ldquo;use your \ndiscretion&rdquo; is not a substantive rule. The district court\u2019s reliance on language contained in DHS\u2019s DAPA \nwebsite\u2014a source apparently not even cited by the parties and not mentioned by the majority\u2014rests on even \nshakier ground. According to the district court, the DHS website\u2019s characterization of DAPA as a \n&ldquo;program&rdquo; and an &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; somehow contradicts DHS\u2019s position that the \nMemorandum constitutes &ldquo;guidance.&rdquo; Of course, DAPA may very well be all three, but this has no \nbearing on whether the Memorandum constitutes a substantive rule\u2014i.e., 41 The majority appears to endorse the \ndistrict court\u2019s reliance on presidential statements as it too cites the President\u2019s remark that he &ldquo;\u2018change[d] \nthe law\u2019&rdquo; as support for concluding that DAPA is beyond the scope of the INA. Majority Op. at 65. Case: 15-\n40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 105 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 106 whether the \n&ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; or &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; genuinely allows the agency to \nexercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis. Even more dubious is the district court\u2019s argument that, by using \nthe word &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; on its website, DHS was intending to use the word in its technical legal sense to \nreference voter initiatives, thus implying a &ldquo;legislative process.&rdquo;42 Id. at 667-68. Lacking any \nprobative evidence as to DAPA\u2019s implementation, the district court relied most heavily on evidence of DACA\u2019s \nimplementation\u2014 concluding unequivocally that DAPA will be &ldquo;implemented exactly like DACA.&rdquo; Id. \nat 663. It is this analysis that the majority finds convincing, all the while noting that &ldquo;any extrapolation from \nDACA must be done carefully.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 47. The district court reached this conclusion on two flawed \nbases: (1) the DAPA Memorandum\u2019s statement directing the USCIS to &ldquo;establish a process, similar to \nDACA&rdquo; for implementing DAPA, Appx. A, at 4; and (2) the &ldquo;lack of any suggestion that DAPA will be \nimplemented in a fashion different from DACA,&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 649. With respect to the \nformer, this single, nebulous statement does not specify how the DAPA and DACA processes would be similar; the \nphrase cannot be construed to mean that DAPA and DACA will be implemented identically. The latter is pure \nburdenshifting\u2014the district court implies that the burden is on DHS to show that the two programs will be \nimplemented differently. Of course, in the preliminary injunction context, Plaintiffs, &ldquo;by a clear showing, \ncarr[y] the burden of persuasion.&rdquo; Harris Cnty. v. CarMax Auto Superstores Inc., 177 F.3d 306, 312 42 The \ndistrict court noted that this voter initiative definition is the &ldquo;sole definition offered for \u2018initiative\u2019&rdquo; in \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 668. There are, of course, other dictionaries\u2014dictionaries \nfar more likely to capture DHS\u2019s intended use of the word in a website created to describe DAPA to the public \n(rather than to attorneys or judges). For example, the first definition of &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; in the Oxford English \nDictionary is &ldquo;[t]hat which initiates, begins, or originates,&rdquo; Initiative, The Oxford English Dictionary (2d \ned. 1989)\u2014a definition that certainly does not imply a binding norm. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 \nPage: 106 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 107 (5th Cir. 1999). The district court also completely ignored the \nstatement contained in the Declaration of Donald W. Neufeld\u2014the Associate Director for Service Center Operations \nfor USCIS\u2014that &ldquo;USCIS is in the process of determining the procedures for reviewing requests under DAPA, \nand thus USCIS has not yet determined whether the process to adjudicate DAPA requests will be similar to the \nDACA process.&rdquo; More importantly, the fact that the administration of the two programs may be similar is not \nevidence that the substantive review under both programs will be the same. As discussed in more detail below, the \ndistrict court relied heavily on the denial rates of applications submitted under DACA. But those rates are irrelevant \nfor one simple reason, a reason the district court failed to confront: the substantive criteria under DACA and DAPA \nare different. And even the majority concedes that &ldquo;DACA and DAPA are not identical.&rdquo; Majority Op. \nat 47. Review under the DACA Memorandum does not, for example, require reference to the various discretionary \n\n\n\nfactors contained in the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum, nor does DACA contain DAPA\u2019s criterion that the \napplicant &ldquo;present no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, makes the grant of deferred action \ninappropriate.&rdquo; Appx. A, at 4; see also Majority Op. at 48 (&ldquo;Further, the DAPA Memo contains \nadditional discretionary criteria.&rdquo;). Thus, even assuming DACA and DAPA applications are reviewed using \nthe exact same administrative process, the district court had no basis for concluding that the results of that \nprocess\u2014a process that would involve the application of markedly different, discretionary criteria\u2014 would be the \nsame. For this reason alone\u2014that is, the district court\u2019s heavy Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 107 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 108 reliance upon this minimally probative evidence\u2014I would conclude that \nthe district court clearly erred.43 There are additional reasons, however, to discount the DACA-related evidence on \nwhich the district court based its decision and which the majority now accepts. First, even assuming DACA\u2019s 5% \ndenial rate has some probative value, and assuming that rate can be properly characterized as low,44 a low rate \nwould be unsurprising given the self-selecting nature of the program, as the majority concedes. Majority Op. at 47. \nIt should be expected that only those highly likely to receive deferred action will apply; otherwise, applicants would \nrisk revealing their immigration status and other identifying information to authorities, thereby risking removal (and \nthe loss of a sizeable fee). The majority recognizes this issue but finds that it &ldquo;is partially mitigated by the \nfinding that \u2018the [g]overnment has publicly declared that it will make no attempt to enforce the law against even \nthose who are denied deferred action.&rdquo; Id. (citing Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663). But this public \ndeclaration, cited by the district court, comes from an informational DHS website that never states that DHS will \nmake no attempt to enforce the law.45 43 In addition, as Judge Higginson noted in his dissent, DACA is materially \ndistinguishable from DAPA because the former applies only to &ldquo;a subset of undocumented immigrants who \nare particularly inculpable as they \u2018were brought to this country as children\u2019 and, thus, \u2018lacked the intent to violate \nthe law.\u2019&rdquo; Texas, 787 F.3d at 781 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (quoting the DACA Memorandum). Accordingly, \nit would be reasonable to expect that denial rates under DAPA would be higher than those under DACA, as DACA \napplicants are far less likely to exhibit other factors (e.g., a threat to national security) that would prompt an exercise \nof discretion not to grant deferred action. 44 This rate represents 38,080 denials out of the 723,358 applications \naccepted for processing at USCIS service centers through December 2014. There were an additional 42,919 \napplications rejected for purely administrative reasons during this time period. Neither of these numbers suggests \nan agency on autopilot. 45 The majority\u2019s acceptance of this passage is but one illustration of the problem with \nrelying on the district court\u2019s factual conclusions. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 108 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 109 The district court also erred in its mischaracterization of a letter written by \nLe&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez, Director of USCIS, to Senator Charles Grassley, suggesting that the top four \nreasons for DACA denials are: (1) the applicant used the wrong form; (2) the applicant failed to provide a valid \nsignature; (3) the applicant failed to file or complete Form I-765 or failed to enclose the fee; and (4) the applicant \nwas below the age of fifteen and thus ineligible to participate in the program. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609. \nThis, however, is not what the letter says. The letter actually states that these were the top four reasons for DACA \napplication rejections, not denials. As made clear in DHS\u2019s Neufeld Declaration, &ldquo;a DACA request is \n\u2018rejected\u2019 when [it is] determine[d] upon intake that the [application] has a fatal flaw,&rdquo; while &ldquo;[a] DACA \nrequest is \u2018denied\u2019 when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by-case basis, determines that the requestor has not \ndemonstrated that they satisfy the guidelines for DACA or when an adjudicator determines that deferred action \nshould be denied even though the threshold guidelines are met.&rdquo; By conflating rejections with denials, the \ndistrict court suggested that most denials are made for mechanical administrative reasons and thus could not have \nbeen discretionary. But the five percent denial rate does not even take into account these administrative rejections. \nThe district court also appeared singularly focused on one metric for measuring whether DACA (and by implication, \nDAPA) is implemented in a discretionary manner. The court insisted that DHS provide: &ldquo;the number, if any, \nof requests that were denied even though the applicant met the DACA Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 \nPage: 109 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 110 criteria as set out in Secretary Napolitano\u2019s DACA \nmemorandum.&rdquo;46 Id. at 609. In yet another instance of improper burden-shifting, the court reasoned that \n&ldquo;[b]ecause the Government could not produce evidence concerning applicants who met the program\u2019s \ncriteria but were denied DACA status, this Court accepts the States\u2019 evidence as correct.&rdquo; Id. at 609 n.8. But \nthe burden of showing DAPA is non-discretionary was on Plaintiffs\u2014the States\u2014and Plaintiffs provided no \nevidence as to the number of these denials. Rather, the district court accepted as true Plaintiffs\u2019 bare assertion that \nthere were no such denials, concluding unequivocally that &ldquo;[n]o DACA application that has met the criteria \n\n\n\nhas been denied based on an exercise of individualized discretion.&rdquo; Id. at 669 n.101. The district court \nreached this conclusion in the face of uncontested evidence contained in the Neufeld Declaration that DACA \napplications &ldquo;have also been denied on the basis that deferred action was not appropriate for other reasons \nnot expressly set forth in [the] 2012 DACA Memorandum.&rdquo; The district court also failed to acknowledge the \nreason DHS did not introduce statistics as to these denials: it had no ability to do so. As stated in the Neufeld \nDeclaration, &ldquo;[u]ntil very recently, USCIS lacked any ability to automatically track and sort the reasons for \nDACA denials,&rdquo; presumably because it had no reason to track such data prior to this litigation. Although this \npoint is undisputed, the district court and now the majority nonetheless fault DHS for failing to provide the \ninformation the district court requested. See Majority Op. at 50 (&ldquo;[T]he government did not provide the \nnumber of cases that service-center officials referred to field offices for interviews.&rdquo;). Yet it was not DHS\u2019s \nburden to disprove Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of 46 As discussed above, this focus was misplaced, as application of both \nthe DACA and DAPA criteria themselves involves the exercise of discretion. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 110 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 111 pretext, nor must DHS (anticipatorily) track data \nin a way that may be convenient to an adversary in future litigation. The district court also relied on a four-page \ndeclaration by Kenneth Palinkas, President of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council (the union \nrepresenting USCIS employees processing DACA applications), for the proposition that &ldquo;DACA applications \nare simply rubberstamped if the applicants meet the necessary criteria.&rdquo;47 Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at \n610. Yet lay witness conclusions are only competent evidence if rationally drawn from facts personally observed. \nSee Fed. R. Evid. 701. Here, Palinkas\u2019s conclusion was supported only by the fact that DACA applications are \nrouted to &ldquo;service centers instead of field offices,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;USCIS officers in service centers . \n. . do not interview applicants&rdquo;\u2014a weak basis on which to conclude that DHS\u2019s representations (both to the \npublic and to the courts) are &ldquo;merely pretext.&rdquo;48 See 11A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice & Procedure &sect; 2949 (3d ed. 2015) (&ldquo;Preliminary injunctions frequently are denied if the \naffidavits are too vague or conclusory to demonstrate a clear right to relief under Rule 65.&rdquo;). Indeed, \nPalinkas\u2019s assertions are rebutted\u2014and the step-by-step process for reviewing DACA applications is explained\u2014in \nthe detailed affidavit filed by Donald Neufeld, the head of those very USCIS service centers. Neufeld declares that \nthe service centers &ldquo;are designed to adjudicate applications, petitions and requests&rdquo; for various \nprograms &ldquo;that have higher-volume caseloads.&rdquo; Neufeld goes on to describe the &ldquo;multi-step, \ncase-specific process&rdquo; for reviewing DACA 47 Yet again, this focus ignores the discretion inherent in those \ncriteria. 48 Palinkas also focuses on the USCIS\u2019s announcement that it will create a new service center for the \nprocessing of DAPA applications, to be staffed by approximately 700 USCIS employees and 300 federal \ncontractors. But the fact that so many agents are necessary to assess DAPA applications is inconsistent with the \nnotion that the review will be conducted in a mechanical, pro forma manner. Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 111 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 112 applications: &ldquo;Once a case arrives at a \nService Center, a specially trained USCIS adjudicator is assigned to determine whether the requestor satisfies the \nDACA guidelines and ultimately determine whether a request should be approved or denied.&rdquo;49 Adjudicators \n&ldquo;evaluate the evidence each requestor submits in conjunction with the relevant DACA guidelines&rdquo; and \n&ldquo;assess the appropriate weight to accord such evidence.&rdquo;50 Citing various examples, Neufeld \nexplains that &ldquo;[e]ven if it is determined that a requestor has satisfied the threshold DACA guidelines, USCIS \nmay exercise discretion to deny a request where other factors make the grant of deferred action \ninappropriate.&rdquo;51 As a part of their review, adjudicators can investigate the facts and evidence supporting \nthe application &ldquo;by contacting educational institutions, other government agencies, employers, or other \nentities.&rdquo; Moreover, although the Palinkas Declaration accurately states that adjudicators at USCIS service \ncenters do not have the capability to interview applicants, the Neufeld Declaration clarifies that service center \nadjudicators &ldquo;may refer a case for interview at a Field Office&rdquo;\u2014for example, &ldquo;when the \nadjudicator determines, after careful review of the request and supporting documents, that a request is deniable, \nbut potentially curable, with information that can best be received through an interview.&rdquo; Adjudicators may \nalso request that applicants submit additional evidence in support of their applications for deferred action; this was \nno rare occurrence, as nearly 200,000 such requests for additional evidence were issued by adjudicators. &ldquo;In \naddition, all DACA requestors must submit 49 Applications are first mailed to USCIS &ldquo;lockboxes,&rdquo; \nwhere they are reviewed to determine whether they should be rejected for administrative reasons. 50 Neufeld \nnotes, consistent with the discussion above, that &ldquo;USCIS must . . . exercise significant discretion in \n\n\n\ndetermining whether&rdquo; some of the DACA guidelines apply; for example, &ldquo;determining whether a \nrequestor \u2018poses a threat to national security or public safety\u2019 necessarily involves the exercise of the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion.&rdquo; 51 Such discretionary denials are generally reviewed at USCIS headquarters. Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 112 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 113 to background checks, and requests \nare denied if these background checks show that deferred action would be inappropriate.&rdquo; Placing these \ndeclarations side-by-side, the detailed Neufeld Declaration does not simply rebut the conclusory assertions \ncontained in the Palinkas Declaration\u2014it provides undisputed context for how USCIS service centers actually work \nand how DACA application decisions are made. Or at the very least, as the majority concedes, the two in tandem \ncreate &ldquo;conflicting evidence on the degree to which DACA allowed for discretion.&rdquo; Majority Op. at 49. \nYet the district court concluded that the Neufeld Declaration did not provide &ldquo;the level of detail that the Court \nrequested.&rdquo;52 Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609. It is difficult to imagine what level of detail would have \nsatisfied the district court. At a minimum, as recognized by Judge Higginson in his dissent to the denial of the stay \npending appeal, the Neufeld Declaration created a factual dispute warranting an evidentiary hearing.53 See Texas, \n787 F.3d at 781-82 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (citing authorities); see also Landmark Land Co. v. Office of Thrift \nSupervision, 990 F.2d 807, 812 (5th Cir. 1993) (&ldquo;The record reveals several disputes of material fact that the \ndistrict court must necessarily resolve in deciding whether to issue the injunction. An evidentiary hearing thus is in \norder upon remand.&rdquo;); Marshall Durbin Farms, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Farmers Org., Inc., 446 F.2d 353, 356 n.4 (5th \nCir. 1971) (&ldquo;[W]here so very much turns upon an accurate presentation of numerous facts . . . the propriety \nof proceeding upon affidavits becomes the most questionable.&rdquo;); Cobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 261 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (&ldquo;Particularly when a court must make 52 The district court did not, however, make an express \nfinding that it deemed the Palinkas Declaration more credible than the Neufeld Declaration. 53 Even Plaintiffs \nnoted, after DHS submitted the Neufeld Declaration, that &ldquo;if the Court decides that the Defendants\u2019 new \ndeclarations create a material fact dispute of material consequence to the motion . . . , the correct step would be to \nhold a second hearing.&rdquo; Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 113 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. \n15-40238 114 credibility determinations to resolve key factual disputes in favor of the moving party, it is an abuse of \ndiscretion for the court to settle the question on the basis of documents alone, without an evidentiary \nhearing.&rdquo; (emphasis added)). The district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing further undermines \nfaith in its factual conclusions. The district court also looked to the operating procedures governing the \nimplementation of DACA, noting that they &ldquo;contain[] nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or \ndenying deferred action&rdquo; and involve the use of standardized forms for recording denials\u2014a fact the majority \nmentions. Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (footnote omitted). But no such operating procedures for the \nimplementation of DAPA appear in the record\u2014a fact the majority does not mention. As noted above, the USCIS is \ncurrently &ldquo;in the process of determining the procedures for reviewing requests under DAPA.&rdquo; In any \nevent, even &ldquo;specific and detailed requirements&rdquo; may qualify as a &ldquo;\u2018general\u2019 statement of \npolicy.&rdquo; Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 589 F.2d at 667. And the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of a statement \nof policy is to &ldquo;channel discretion&rdquo; of agency decision makers; such channeling does not trigger the \nrequirements of noticeand-comment unless it is &ldquo;so restrictive . . . that it effectively removes most, if not all, \nof the [agency]\u2019s discretion.&rdquo; Prof\u2019ls & Patients, 56 F.3d at 600. As for the use of standardized forms to \nrecord denials, what matters is not whether DAPA decisions are memorialized in a mechanical fashion, but whether \nthey are made in such a fashion. For the many reasons discussed above, the district court had no legitimate basis \nfor concluding that they will be. Finally, the district court\u2019s lengthy discussion of an &ldquo;abdication theory&rdquo; \nof standing\u2014a theory for which Plaintiffs have not even expressly advocated\u2014 Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 114 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 115 provides context for the district court\u2019s \nconclusions as to pretext.54 In determining that the DAPA Memorandum constituted an &ldquo;abdication&rdquo; \nof DHS\u2019s duties, the district court asserted (repeatedly) that it &ldquo;cannot be disputed&rdquo; that &ldquo;the \nGovernment has abandoned its duty to enforce the law.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 638. The district \ncourt deemed it &ldquo;evident that the Government has determined that it will not enforce the law as it applies to \nover 40% of the illegal alien population that qualify for DAPA.&rdquo;55 Id. at 639 (emphasis added). Such blanket \nassertions\u2014made without discussing any of the evidence set out above\u2014assume a lack of discretion in the review \nof DAPA applications. This assumption\u2014which the district court apparently required DHS to rebut\u2014infects the \nopinion below, yet has no evidentiary basis. The majority accepts the district court\u2019s factual conclusions almost \ncarte blanche. But clear error review is not a rubber stamp, and the litany of errors committed by the district court \n\n\n\nbecome readily apparent from a review of the 54 It appears that no court in the country has accepted this radical \ntheory of standing. Indeed, the district court admitted that it had &ldquo;not found a case where the plaintiff\u2019s \nstanding was supported solely on this basis.&rdquo; Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 643 n.48. The majority\u2019s broad \nconcept of state standing based on harm to &ldquo;quasi-sovereign interests&rdquo; is strikingly similar to this \ntheory of standing. See Majority Op. at 14 (&ldquo;When the states joined the union, they surrendered some of their \nsovereign prerogatives over immigration.&rdquo;). 55 In addition, the district court stated: (1) &ldquo;DHS has \nclearly announced that it has decided not to enforce the immigration laws as they apply to approximately 4.3 million \nindividuals&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;Secretary Johnson announced that the DHS will not enforce the immigration laws as \nto over four million illegal aliens eligible for DAPA, despite the fact that they are otherwise deportable&rdquo;; (3) \n&ldquo;As demonstrated by DACA and DAPA . . . , the Government has decided that it will not enforce these \nimmigration laws as they apply to well over five million people&rdquo;; (4) &ldquo;The DHS unilaterally established \nthe parameters for DAPA and determined that it would not enforce the immigration laws as they apply to millions of \nindividuals&rdquo;; and (5) &ldquo;the DHS does not seek compliance with the federal law in any form, but instead \nestablishes a pathway for non-compliance and completely abandons entire sections of this country\u2019s immigration \nlaw.&rdquo; Id. at 637 n.45, 638-43. The district court also characterized DAPA as an &ldquo;announced policy of \nnon-enforcement.&rdquo; Id. at 637 n.45. Although these quotations from the district court\u2019s opinion focus on what it \nperceives to be the failures of DHS to enforce the immigration laws, at other places in that opinion, the district court \nidentifies the decades-long failure of Congress to fund what the district court would consider adequate enforcement. \nCase: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 115 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 116 record. The record \nbefore us, when read properly, shows that DAPA is merely a general statement of policy. As such, it is exempt from \nthe notice-andcomment requirements of 5 U.S.C. &sect; 553. V. APA Substantive Claim The majority\u2019s conclusion \nthat the states are substantially likely to succeed on their APA procedural claim should presumably be enough to \naffirm the decision below. Yet, for reasons altogether unclear, the majority stretches beyond the judgment of the \ndistrict court and concludes that DAPA and a long, preexisting regulation (8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14)), as \napplied to DAPA, are substantive APA violations. See Majority Op. at 54-66. Prudence and judicial economy \nwarrant against going this far, and I would not reach this issue on the record before us. For one, &ldquo;the district \ncourt enjoined DAPA solely on the basis of the procedural APA claim.&rdquo; Id. at 54. It did not evaluate the \nsubstantive APA claim at issue. See Dist. Ct. Op., 86 F. Supp. 3d at 677 (&ldquo;[T]he Court is specifically not \naddressing Plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on their substantive APA claim.&rdquo;). In fact, the district court \neschewed determination of this issue and Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim &ldquo;until there [could be] further \ndevelopment of the record.&rdquo; Id.56 On appeal, the parties offered only sparse arguments on the substantive \nAPA claim. The parties filed briefs totaling 203 pages, of which ten pages addressed the substantive APA claim.57 \nThis hardly seems to be enough to help us answer a complicated question of statutory interpretation and \nadministrative law. I would not address the substantive APA claim in light of this limited record while cognizant of \nthe principle that &ldquo;[c]ases are to be 56 There might not be much left in the way of factual development of the \nrecord, see Majority Op. at 54 n.158, but there is much left wanting in the way of legal development. 57 Appellees\u2019 \nBr. 47-50; Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 21-23; Appellants\u2019 Suppl.

Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 116 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 117 decided on the narrowest legal \ngrounds available.&rdquo; Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, 1275 (5th Cir. 1975). That said, were I to reach the \nsubstantive APA claim I would find the majority\u2019s conclusion unpersuasive on the limited record before us. The \nargument that DAPA is a substantive APA violation, as I read it, appears to be the following: (1) DAPA is \n&ldquo;manifestly contrary,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 66, to the text of the INA and deserves no deference partly \nbecause Congress would not assign it such a &ldquo;decision[] of vast \u2018economic and political significance,\u2019&rdquo; \nid. at 62 (citation omitted); and (2) even if DHS deserved deference, DAPA is not a reasonable interpretation of the \nINA. Questions of how agencies construe their governing statutes fall under the two-step inquiry announced in \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). It bears reiterating this \nframework as I believe the majority misapplies it and its associated precedents. At step one of Chevron, courts are \nto look at &ldquo;whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.&rdquo; Id. at 842. If \nCongress has directly spoken, then the court &ldquo;must give effect to [its] unambiguously expressed \nintent.&rdquo; Id. at 843. But &ldquo;if the statute is silent or ambiguous,&rdquo; then at step two, a court is to defer \nto an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute so long as it is &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; Id. at 843-44. The majority first \nstates that DAPA fails Chevron step one because Congress has directly addressed the issue of deferred action. \n\n\n\nMajority Op. at 55-56. To bolster its conclusion, the majority points to provisions of the INA that delineate which \naliens can receive lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, can be eligible for deferred action, and can receive LPR \nstatus by having a citizen family member. Id. at 55-57. These provisions are, indeed, &ldquo;specific and \ndetailed,&rdquo; id. at 55, but none of them precisely prohibits or addresses the kind of deferred action provided for \nunder DAPA. The Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 117 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 118 \nquestion under step one is whether the language of a statute is &ldquo;precisely directed to the question,&rdquo; \nnot whether &ldquo;parsing of general terms in the text of the statute will reveal an actual intent of \nCongress.&rdquo; Chevron, 467 U.S. at 861- 62. Most of the provisions identified by the majority are directed at the \nrequirements for legal status, not the lawful presence permitted by DAPA. And even the majority acknowledges the \ntwo are not the same. See Majority Op. at 57 (&ldquo;LPR status is more substantial than is lawful \npresence.&rdquo;). DAPA does not purport to create &ldquo;a lawful immigration classification.&rdquo; Id. at 56. It \nis true that Congress has specified certain categories of aliens that are eligible for deferred action. See id. at 56. \nThis line of argument follows from the legal maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius (&ldquo;the expression of \none is the exclusion of others&rdquo;) suggesting that because DAPA was not specified by Congress, it is contrary \nto the INA. But this argument is nonetheless incorrect. The expressio unius &ldquo;canon has little force in the \nadministrative setting.&rdquo; Tex. Rural Legal Aid, Inc. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 940 F.2d 685, 694 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \nAnd the inquiry at step one is &ldquo;whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at \nissue,&rdquo; not whether it legislated in the general area or around the periphery. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842 \n(emphasis added). Congress has never prohibited or limited ad hoc deferred action, which is no different than \nDAPA other than scale.58 In fact, each time Congress spoke to this general issue, it did so incidentally and as part \nof larger statutes not concerned 58 The majority makes much of the scope of DAPA in concluding that it violates the \nAPA. See Majority Op. at 56, 59. Yet the conclusions regarding DAPA\u2019s legality are similarly applicable to ad hoc \ndeferred action. Ad hoc deferred action triggers the same eligibility for benefits and Congress has not directly \nmentioned it by statute. It should follow then that ad hoc deferred action is also not authorized by the INA and is a \nsubstantive APA violation. But this cannot be the case for the reasons mentioned below. Despite the majority\u2019s \nemphasis on the scale of DAPA, its size plays no role in whether or not it is authorized by statute. I am aware of no \nprinciple that makes scale relevant in this analysis, and the majority does not cite any authority otherwise. The \nquestion of whether an agency has violated its governing statute does not change if its actions affect one person or \n&ldquo;4.3 million&rdquo; persons. Id. at 56. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 118 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 119 with deferred action. See, e.g., USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, Pub L. No. 107- 56, \n&sect; 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (discussing deferred action for family members of LPRs killed by terrorism within \na far larger statute aimed primarily at combatting terrorism). And the language regarding deferred action was \nworded in permissive terms, not prohibitive terms. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (stating that a \nqualifying &ldquo;is eligible for deferred action and work authorization&rdquo;). More importantly, in enacting these \nprovisos, Congress was legislating against a backdrop of longstanding practice of federal immigration officials \nexercising ad hoc deferred action. By the time Congress specified categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, \nimmigration officials were already &ldquo;engaging in a regular practice . . . of exercising [deferred action] for \nhumanitarian reasons or simply for its own convenience.&rdquo; Reno, 525 U.S. at 484. 59 Yet Congress did \nnothing to upset this practice. The provisions cited by the majority, if anything, highlight Congress\u2019s continued \nacceptance of flexible and discretionary deferred action.60 Denying DHS\u2019s ability to grant 59 The Court in Reno \nnoted that &ldquo;[p]rior to 1997, deferred-action decisions were governed by internal INS guidelines which \nconsidered [a variety of factors].&rdquo; Reno, 525 U.S. at 484 n. 8. Although the guidelines were rescinded, the \nCourt also observed that &ldquo;there [was] no indication that the INS has ceased making this sort of determination \non a case-bycase basis.&rdquo; Id. 60 The Office of Legal Counsel, in its evaluation of DAPA, noted that Congress \nhad given its &ldquo;implicit approval&rdquo; to deferred action over the years. Office of Legal Counsel, The \nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019s Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the \nUnited States and to Defer Removal of Others 30-31 (2014), available at            \nhttp://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2014/11/20/2014-11-19- auth-prioritize-\nremoval.pdf. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 119 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 120 \ndeferred action on a &ldquo;class-wide basis,&rdquo; Majority Op. at 32, as the majority does, severely constrains \nthe agency.61 The majority makes a similar mistake with respect to the work authorization regulation, 8 C.F.R. \n&sect; 274a.12(c)(14). The majority holds that this regulation as &ldquo;to any class of illegal aliens whom DHS \n\nhttp://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2014/11/20/2014-11-19-\n\n\ndeclines to remove- is beyond the scope of what the INA can reasonably be interpreted to authorize.&rdquo; \nMajority Op. at 40. It bases its conclusion on provisions of the INA that specify classes of aliens eligible and \nineligible for work authorization and scattered statements from past cases supposedly stating that Congress \nrestricted immigration to preserve jobs from American workers. Yet, much like with deferred action, Congress has \nnever directly spoken to the question at issue and, if anything, has indirectly approved of it. In one form or another, \n8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14) has been on the books since 1981. It follows from a grant of discretion to the \nSecretary to establish work authorizations for aliens, see 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1324a(h)(3), and it predates the INA \nprovisions the majority cites. See Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1048 (5th Cir. 1990) (noting that up to that \npoint there was &ldquo;nothing in the [INA] [that] expressly provid[ed] for the grant of employment \nauthorization&rdquo;). Had Congress wanted to negate this regulation, it presumably would have done so \nexpressly, but by specifying the categories of aliens eligible for work authorization, Congress signaled its implicit \napproval of this longstanding regulation. Furthermore, no court, until today, has ever cast doubt on this regulation. \nOur own circuit in Perales found no problems with 8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14) in concluding that a challenge to \n61 The majority\u2019s ruling that class-wide deferred action violates the INA is potentially devastating. The definition of a \nclass is expansive: &ldquo;A group of people, things, qualities, or activities that have common characteristics or \nattributes.&rdquo; Class, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). I suspect that DHS frequently grants deferred \naction to two or more aliens with common characteristics. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 120 \nDate Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 121 employment authorization denials was non-justiciable. Id. 62 The \nmajority\u2019s snapshot of Supreme Court opinions discussing the aims of the immigration laws does not speak to this \nissue and is misleading. Those opinions noted that the immigration laws regarding employment authorization were \nalso concerned with creating an &ldquo;extensive \u2018employment verification system\u2019 . . . designed to deny \nemployment to aliens who (a) are not lawfully present in the United States, or (b) are not lawfully authorized to work \nin the United States.&rdquo; Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 147 (2002) (citing 8 U.S.C. \n&sect; 1324a) (emphasis added). DAPA and 8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14) further both these aims and also \npromote the &ldquo;[s]elf-sufficiency&rdquo; of aliens by giving them work authorization and making them less \nreliant on public benefits. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1601(1) (&ldquo;Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United \nStates immigration law since this country\u2019s earliest immigration statutes.&rdquo;). The majority next holds that \nDAPA, fails Chevron step one because the INA\u2019s broad grants of authority &ldquo;cannot reasonably be construed \nas assigning [DHS] \u2018decisions of vast economic and political significance,\u2019 such as DAPA.&rdquo; Majority Op. at \n61-62 (footnote omitted). To the contrary, immigration decisions often have substantial economic and political \nsignificance. In Arizona, the Court noted that &ldquo;discretionary decisions&rdquo; made in the enforcement of \nimmigration law &ldquo;involve policy choices that bear on this Nation\u2019s international relations.&rdquo; 132 S. Ct. at \n2499. &ldquo;Removal decisions,&rdquo; it has been observed, &ldquo;\u2018may implicate our relations with foreign \npowers\u2019 and require consideration of \u2018changing political and economic circumstances.\u2019&rdquo; Jama v. Immigration \n& Customs Enf\u2019t, 543 U.S. 335, 348 (2005) (quoting 62 If 8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.12(c)(14) were contrary to the INA, \nthen presumably the challenge in Perales would have been justiciable since an agency\u2019s &ldquo;abdication of its \nstatutory responsibilities&rdquo; is sufficient to overcome the presumption that agency inaction is unreviewable. \nHeckler, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 121 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-\n40238 122 Matthews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81 (1976)). And deferred action\u2014whether ad hoc or through DAPA\u2014is \nnot an effort by DHS to &ldquo;hide elephants in mouseholes,&rdquo; Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., 531 \nU.S. 457, 468 (2001), but rather &ldquo;[a] principal feature of the removal system,&rdquo; Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at \n2499. The majority\u2019s reliance on King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480 (2015), for its conclusion is misplaced. The Court \nin King held that it was unlikely Congress delegated a key reform of the ACA to the IRS\u2014an agency not charged \nwith implementing the ACA and with &ldquo;no expertise in crafting health insurance policy.&rdquo; Id. at 2489. By \ncontrast, DHS is tasked with enforcement of the immigration laws, see, e.g., 6 U.S.C. &sect; 202, and its substantial \nexpertise in this area has been noted time and time again. See, e.g., Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506 (&ldquo;[T]he \nremoval process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government.&rdquo;). Lastly, the majority concludes \nthat &ldquo;[e]ven with \u2018special deference\u2019 to the Secretary,&rdquo; DAPA is an unreasonable interpretation of the \nINA. Majority Op. at 62-63 (footnote omitted). Reasonableness at step two of Chevron requires only a \n&ldquo;minimum level of reasonability,&rdquo; Tex. Office of Pub. Util. Counsel, 183 F.3d at 420, and will be found \nso long as an agency\u2019s interpretation is &ldquo;not patently inconsistent with the statutory scheme,&rdquo; Am. \nAirlines, Inc. v. Dep't of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 813 (5th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). It is hard to see how DAPA is \n\n\n\nunreasonable on the record before us. DAPA does not negate or conflict with any provision of the INA. See \nWhitman, 531 U.S. at 484. DHS has repeatedly asserted its right to engage in deferred action. Cf. FDA v. Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 146 (2000) (concluding an agency was not entitled to deference where it \npreviously disavowed its enforcement authority). And DAPA appears to further DHS\u2019s Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 122 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 123 mission of &ldquo;[e]stablishing national \nimmigration enforcement policies and priorities.&rdquo; 6 U.S.C. &sect; 202(5). Indeed, if DAPA were unreasonable \nunder the INA, then it follows that ad hoc grants of deferred action are unreasonable as well\u2014something the \nmajority declines to reach. See Majority Op. at 66 n.202. But, as previously mentioned, there is no difference \nbetween the two other than scale, and ad hoc deferred action has been repeatedly acknowledged by Congress and \nthe courts as a key feature of immigration enforcement. See Reno, 525 U.S. at 483-84. After all, agencies are \n&ldquo;far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of [their] \npriorities,&rdquo; Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831-32, and &ldquo;[t]he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such \npolicy choices . . . are not judicial ones,&rdquo; Chevron, 467 U.S. at 866. From the limited record before us, I \nwould conclude that the DAPA Memorandum is not a substantive APA violation. VI. Conclusion There can be little \ndoubt that Congress\u2019s choices as to the level of funding for immigration enforcement have left DHS with difficult \nprioritization decisions. But those decisions, which are embodied in the DAPA Memorandum, have been delegated \nto the Secretary by Congress. Because federal courts should not inject themselves into such matters of \nprosecutorial discretion, I would dismiss this case as non-justiciable. Furthermore, the evidence in the record (the \nimportance of which should not be overlooked) makes clear that the injunction cannot stand. A determination of \n&ldquo;pretext&rdquo; on the part of DHS must have a basis in concrete evidence. Of course, as appellate judges, \nwe may not substitute our own view of the facts for that of the district court. But we must also embrace our duty to \ncorrect clear errors of fact\u2014that is, to ensure that factual determinations are based not on conjecture, intuition, or \npreconception, but on evidence. Based Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 123 Date Filed: \n11/09/2015 No. 15-40238 124 on the record as it currently stands, the district court\u2019s conclusion that DAPA \napplications will not be reviewed on a discretionary, case-by-case basis cannot withstand even the most deferential \nscrutiny. Today\u2019s opinion preserves this error and, by reaching the substantive APA claim, propounds its own. I \nhave a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made. That mistake has been exacerbated by the \nextended delay that has occurred in deciding this &ldquo;expedited&rdquo; appeal. There is no justification for that \ndelay. I dissent. Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 124 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 Secretary U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security Washington, DC 20528 Homeland Security November 20, 2014 \nMEMORANDUM FOR: Le6n Rodriguez Director U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Thomas S. Winkowski \nActing Director U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement R. Gil Kerlikowske Commissioner U.S. Customs and \nBor FROM: Secretary SUBJECT: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \nUnited States as Children and with Respect to Certain Individuals Who Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or \nPermanent Residents This memorandum is intended to reflect new policies for the use of deferred action. By \nmemorandum dated June 15, 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued guidance entitled Exercising Prosecutorial \nDiscretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children. The following supplements and \namends that guidance. The Department ofHomeland Security (DHS) and its immigration components are \nresponsible for enforcing the Nation' s immigration laws. Due to limited resources, DHS and its Components cannot \nrespond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States. As is true ofvirtually every \nother law enforcement agency, DHS must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement ofthe law. Secretary \nNapolitano noted two years ago, when she issued her prosecutorial discretion guidance regarding children, that \n\"[o]ur Nation's immigration laws must be enforced in a strong and sensible manner. They are not designed to be \nblindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case.\" 1            www.dhs.gov \nAPPENDIX A Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 125 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 Deferred action is a \nlong-standing administrative mechanism dating back decades, by which the Secretary of Homeland Security may \ndefer the removal of an undocumented immigrant for a period oftime. 1 A form of administrative relief similar to \ndeferred action, known then as \"indefinite voluntary departure,\" was originally authorized by the Reagan and Bush \nAdministrations to defer the deportations of an estimated 1.5 million undocumented spouses and minor children \nwho did not qualify for legalization under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Known as the \"Family \nFairness\" program, the policy was specifically implemented to promote the humane enforcement of the law and \nensure family unity. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion by which the Secretary deprioritizes an \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/\n\n\nindividual's case for humanitarian reasons, administrative convenience, or in the interest of the Department's overall \nenforcement mission. As an act of prosecutorial discretion, deferred action is legally available so long as it is \ngranted on a case-by-case basis, and it may be terminated at any time at the agency's discretion. Deferred action \ndoes not confer any form of legal status in this country, much less citizenship; it simply means that, for a specified \nperiod of time, an individual is permitted to be lawfully present in the United States. Nor can deferred action itself \nlead to a green card. Although deferred action is not expressly conferred by statute, the practice is referenced and \ntherefore endorsed by implication in several federal statutes.2 Historically, deferred action has been used on behalf \nof particular individuals, and on a case-by-case basis, for classes of unlawfully present individuals, such as the \nspouses and minor children of certain legalized immigrants, widows of U.S. citizens, or victims of trafficking and \ndomestic violence. 3 Most recently, beginning in 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued guidance for case-by-case \ndeferred action with respect to those who came to the United States as children, commonly referred to as \"DACA.\" \n1 Deferred action, in one form or another, dates back to at least the 1960s. \"Deferred action\" per se dates back at \nleast as far as 1975. See, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Operation Instructions &sect; 103.l (a)(l)(ii) \n(1975). 2 INA&sect; 204(a)(l)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (Violence Against Women Act (VA WA) self-petitioners not in removal \nproceedings are \"eligible for deferred action and employment authorization \"); INA&sect; 237(d)(2) (DHS may grant \nstay ofremoval to applicants for Tor U visas but that denial of a stay request \"shall not preclude the alien from \napplying for . . . deferred action\"); REAL ID Act of 2005 &sect; 202(c)(2)(B)(viii), Pub. L. 109-13 (requiring states to \nexamine documentary evidence oflawfal status for driver 's license eligibility purposes, including \"approved \ndeferred action status\"); National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 &sect; 1703( c) ( d) Pub. L. 108-\n136 (spouse, parent or child ofcertain US. citizen who died as a result ofhonorable service may self-petition for \npermanent residence and \"shall be eligible for deferred action, advance parole, and work authorization \"). 3 In \nAugust 2001 , the former-Immigration and Naturalization Service issued guidance providing deferred action to \nindividuals who were eligible for the recently created U and T visas. Two years later, USCJS issued subsequent \nguidance, instructing its officers to use existing mechanisms like deferred action for certain U visa applicants facing \npotential removal. More recently, in June 2009, USCIS issued a memorandum providing deferred action to certain \nsurviving spouses of deceased U.S. citizens and their children while Congress considered legislation to allow these \nindividuals to qualify for permanent residence status. 2 Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 126 Date \nFiled: 11/09/2015 By this memorandum, I am now expanding certain parameters of DACA and issuing guidance for \ncase-by-case use of deferred action for those adults who have been in this country since January 1, 2010, are the \nparents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and who are otherwise not enforcement priorities, as set \nforth in the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented \nImmigrants Memorandum. The reality is that most individuals in the categories set forth below are hard-working \npeople who have become integrated members of American society. Provided they do not commit serious crimes or \notherwise become enforcement priorities, these people are extremely unlikely to be deported given this \nDepartment's limited enforcement resources-which must continue to be focused on those who represent threats to \nnational security, public safety, and border security. Case-by-case exercises of deferred action for children and \nlong-standing members of American society who are not enforcement priorities are in this Nation's security and \neconomic interests and make common sense, because they encourage these people to come out of the shadows, \nsubmit to background checks, pay fees, apply for work authorization (which by separate authority I may grant), and \nbe counted. A. Expanding DACA DACA provides that those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, who \nentered the United States before June 15, 2007 (5 years prior) as children under the age of 16, and who meet \nspecific educational and public safety criteria, are eligible for deferred action on a case-by-case basis. The initial \nDACA announcement of June 15, 20 12 provided deferred action for a period of two years. On June 5, 2014, U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that DACA recipients could request to renew their \ndeferred action for an additional two years. In order to further effectuate this program, I hereby direct USCIS to \nexpand DACA as follows: Remove the age cap. DACA will apply to all otherwise eligible immigrants who entered \nthe United States by the requisite adjusted entry date before the age of sixteen (16), regardless of how old they \nwere in June 2012 or are today. The current age restriction excludes those who were older than 31 on the date of \nannouncement (i.e., those who were born before June 15, 1981 ). That restriction will no longer apply. Extend \nDACA renewal and work authorization to three-years. The period for which DACA and the accompanying \nemployment authorization is granted will be extended to three-year increments, rather than the current two-year \nincrements. This change shall apply to all first-time applications as well as all applications for renewal effective \n\n\n\nNovember 24, 2014. Beginning on that date, USCIS should issue all work 3 Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 127 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 authorization documents valid for three years, including to those \nindividuals who have applied and are awaiting two-year work authorization documents based on the renewal of their \nDACA grants. USCIS should also consider means to extend those two-year renewals already issued to three years. \nAdjust the date-of-entry requirement. In order to align the DACA program more closely with the other deferred \naction authorization outlined below, the eligibility cut-off date by which a DACA applicant must have been in the \nUnited States should be adjusted from June 15, 2007 to January 1, 2010. USCIS should begin accepting \napplications under the new criteria from applicants no later than ninety (90) days from the date of this \nannouncement. B. Expanding Deferred Action I hereby direct USCIS to establish a process, similar to DACA, for \nexercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis, to those individuals \nwho: &bull; have, on the date of this memorandum, a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident; &bull; have continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; &bull; are physically \npresent in the United States on the date of this memorandum, and at the time of making a request for consideration \nof deferred action with USCIS; &bull; have no lawful status on the date of this memorandum; &bull; are not an \nenforcement priority as reflected in the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal \nof Undocumented Immigrants Memorandum; and &bull; present no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, \nmakes the grant of deferred action inappropriate. Applicants must file the requisite applications for deferred action \npursuant to the new criteria described above. Applicants must also submit biometrics for USCIS to conduct \nbackground checks similar to the background check that is required for DACA applicants. Each person who applies \nfor deferred action pursuant to the criteria above shall also be eligible to apply for work authorization for the period \nof deferred action, pursuant to my authority to grant such authorization reflected in section 274A(h)(3) of 4 Case: \n15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 128 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 the Immigration and Nationality Act.4 \nDeferred action granted pursuant to the program shall be for a period ofthree years. Applicants will pay the work \nauthorization and biometrics fees, which currently amount to $465. There will be no fee waivers and, like DACA, \nvery limited fee exemptions. USCIS should begin accepting applications from eligible applicants no later than one \nhundred and eighty (180) days after the date of this announcement. As with DACA, the above criteria are to be \nconsidered for all individuals encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP), or USCIS, whether or not the individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a \nfinal order of removal. Specifically: &bull; ICE and CBP are instructed to immediately begin identifying persons in \ntheir custody, as well as newly encountered individuals, who meet the above criteria and may thus be eligible for \ndeferred action to prevent the further expenditure of enforcement resources with regard to these individuals. &bull; \nICE is further instructed to review pending removal cases, and seek administrative closure or termination ofthe \ncases of individuals identified who meet the above criteria, and to refer such individuals to USCIS for case-by-case \ndeterminations. ICE should also establish a process to allow individuals in removal proceedings to identify \nthemselves as candidates for deferred action. &bull; USCIS is instructed to implement this memorandum consistent \nwith its existing guidance regarding the issuance of notices to appear. The USCIS process shall also be available to \nindividuals subject to final orders of removal who otherwise meet the above criteria. Under any of the proposals \noutlined above, immigration officers will be provided with specific eligibility criteria for deferred action, but the \nultimate judgment as to whether an immigrant is granted deferred action will be determined on a case-by-case \nbasis. This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only an Act of \nCongress can confer these rights. It remains within the authority of the Executive Branch, however, to set forth \npolicy for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action within the framework of existing law. This \nmemorandum is an exercise of that authority. 4 INA &sect; 274A(h)(3), 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1324a(h)(3) (\"As used in \nthis section, the term ' unauthorized alien' means, with respect to the employment of an alien at a particular time, \nthat the alien is not at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (8) authorized to \nbe so employed by this chapter or by the[Secretary].\"); 8 C.F.R. &sect; 274a.

Gil Kerlikowske Commissioner U.S. Customs and Border Protection Leon Rodriguez Director U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services Alan D. Bersin Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy FROM: Jeh Charles \nJohnson Secretary SUBJECT: Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants \n\n\n\nThis memorandum reflects new policies for the apprehension, detention, and removal of aliens in this country. This \nmemorandum should be considered Department-wide guidance, applicable to the activities of U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS). This memorandum should inform enforcement and removal activity, detention decisions, budget \nrequests and execution, and strategic planning. In general, our enforcement and removal policies should continue \nto prioritize threats to national security, public safety, and border security. The intent of this new policy is to provide \nclearer and more effective guidance in the pursu it of those priorities. To promote public confidence in our \nenforcement activities, I am also directing herein greater transparency in the annual reporting of our removal \nstatistics, to include data that tracks the priorities outlined below.            www.dhs..gov APPENDIX B Case: 15-\n40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 130 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \nand its immigration componentsCBP, ICE, and USCIS-are responsible for enforcing the nation's immigration laws. \nDue to limited resources, DHS and its Components cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all \npersons illegally in the United States. As is true of virtually every other law enforcement agency, DHS must exercise \nprosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law. And, in the exercise of that discretion,DHS can and should \ndevelop smart enforcement priorities, and ensure that use of its limited resources is devoted to the pursuit of those \npriorities. DHS's enforcement priorities are, have been, and will continue to be national security, border security, \nand public safety. DHS personnel are directed to prioritize the use of enforcement personnel , detention space, and \nremoval assets accordingly. In the immigration context, prosecutorial discretion should apply not only to the \ndecision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary \nenforcement decisions, including deciding: whom to stop, question, and arrest; whom to detain or release; whether \nto settle, dismiss, appeal, or join in a motion on a case; and whether to grant deferred action, parole, or a stay of \nremoval instead of pursuing removal in a case. While DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of an \nenforcement proceeding, it is generally preferable to exercise such discretion as early in the case or proceeding as \npossible in order to preserve government resources that would otherwise be expended in pursuing enforcement \nand removal of higher priority cases. Thus, DHS personnel are expected to exercise discretion and pursue these \npriorities at all stages of the enforcement process-from the earliest investigative stage to enforcing final orders of \nremoval-subject to their chains of command and to the particular responsibilities and authorities applicable to their \nspecific position. Except as noted below, the following memoranda are hereby rescinded and superseded: John \nMorton, Civil Immigration Enforcement: Priorities for the Apprehension , Detention, and Removal of Aliens, March \n2, 2011; John Morton, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Enforcement Priorities of the \nAgency for the Apprehension , Detention and Removal of Aliens, June 17, 20 11; Peter Vincent, Case-by-Case \nReview of Incoming and Certain Pending Cases, November 17, 2011; Civil Immigration Enforcement: Guidance on \nthe Use of Detainers in the Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Criminal Justice Systems, December 21, 2012; \nNational Fugitive Operations Program: Priorities, Goals, and Expectations, December 8, 2009. 2 Case: 15-40238 \nDocument: 00513264640 Page: 131 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 A. Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities The \nfollowing shall constitute the Department's civil immigration enforcement priorities: Priority 1 (threats to national \nsecurity, border security, and public safety) Aliens described in this priority represent the highest priority to which \nenforcement resources should be directed: (a) aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, or who \notherwise pose a danger to national security; (b) aliens apprehended at the border or ports of entry while \nattempting to unlawfully enter the United States; (c) aliens convicted of an offense for which an element was active \nparticipation in a criminal street gang, as defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 52 l(a), or aliens not younger than 16 years of \nage who intentionally participated in an organized criminal gang to further the illegal activity of the gang; (d) aliens \nconvicted of an offense classified as a felony in the convicting jurisdiction, other than a state or local offense for \nwhich an essential element was the alien's immigration status; and (e) aliens convicted of an \"aggravated felony,\" \nas that term is defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act at the time of theconviction. The \nremoval of these aliens must be prioritized unless they qualify for asylum or another form of relief under our laws, \nor unless, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief or CBP Director of Field Operations, \nthere are compelling and exceptional factors that clearly indicate the alien is not a threat to national security, border \nsecurity, or public safety and should not therefore be an enforcement priority. Priority 2 (misdemeanants and new \nimmigration violators) Aliens described in this priority , who are also not described in Priority 1, represent the \nsecond-highest priority for apprehension and removal. Resources should be dedicated accordingly to the removal \nof the following: (a) aliens convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, other than minor traffic offenses or \n\nhttp://www.dhs..gov\n\n\nstate or local offenses for which an essential element 3 Case: 15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 132 Date \nFiled: 11/09/2015 was the alien's immigration status, provided the offenses arise out of three separate incidents; (b) \naliens convicted of a \"significant misdemeanor,\" which for these purposes is an offense of domestic violence ; 1 \nsexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; un lawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or \ndriving under the influence; or if not an offense listed above, one for which the individual was sentenced to time in \ncustody of 90 days or more (the sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a \nsuspended sentence); (c) aliens apprehended anywhere in the United States after unlawfully entering or re-\nentering the United States and who cannot establish to the satisfaction of an immigration officer that they have been \nphysically present in the United States continuously since January 1, 2014 ; and (d) aliens who, in the judgment of \nan ICE Field Office Director, USCIS District Director, or USCIS Service Center Director, have significantly abused \nthe visa orvisa waiver programs. These aliens should be removed unless they qualify for asylum or another form of \nrelief under our laws or, unless, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief, CBP Director of \nField Operations, USCIS District Director, or users Service Center Director, there are factors indicating the alien is \nnot a threat to national security, border security, or public safety, and should not therefore be an enforcement \npriority. Priority 3 (other immigration violations) Priority 3 aliens are those who have been issued a final order of \nremoval2 on or after January 1, 2014. Aliens described in this priority, who are not also described in Priority 1 or 2, \nrepresent the third and lowest priority for apprehension and removal. Resources should be dedicated accordingly to \naliens in this priority. Priority 3 aliens should generally be removed unless they qualify for asylum or another form \nof relief under our laws or, unless, in the judgment of an immigration officer, the alien is not a threat to the integrity \nof the immigration system or there are factors suggesting the alien should not be an enforcement priority. 1 ln \nevaluating whether the offense is a significant misdemeanor involving ..domestic violence,\" careful consideration \nshould be given to whether the convicted alien was also the victim of domestic violence; if so, this should be a \nmitigating factor. See generally, John Morton, Prosecutorial Discretion: Certain Victims, Witnesses, and \nPlaintiffs,June 17, 201 1. 2 For present purposes, \"final order\" is defined as it isin 8 C.F.R. &sect; 124 l.1. 4 Case: \n15-40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 133 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 B. Apprehension, Deten tion, and Removal \nofOther Aliens Unlawfully in the United States Nothing in this memorandum should be construed to prohibit or \ndiscourage the apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are not identified \nas priorities herein. However, resources should be dedicated, to the greatest degree possible, to the removal of \naliens described in the priorities set forth above, commensurate with the level of prioritization identified. Immigration \nofficers and attorneys may pursue removal of an alien not identified as a priority herein, provided, in the judgment \nof an ICE Field Office Director, removing such an alien would serve an important federal interest. C. Detention As a \ngeneral rule, DHS detention resources should be used to support the enforcement priorities noted above or for \naliens subject to mandatory detention by law. Absent extraordinary circumstances or the requirement of mandatory \ndetention, field office directors should not expend detention resources on aliens who are known to be suffering from \nserious physical or mental illness, who are disabled, elderly, pregnant, or nursing, who demonstrate that they are \nprimary caretakers of children or an infirm person, or whose detention is otherwise not in the public interest. To \ndetain aliens in those categories who are not subject to mandatory detention, DHS officers or special agents must \nobtain approval from the ICE Field Office Director. If an alien falls within the above categories and is subject to \nmandatory detention, field office directors are encouraged to contact their local Office of Chief Counsel for \nguidance. D. Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Section A, above, requires DHS personnel to exercise discretion \nbased on individual circumstances. As noted above, aliens in Priority l must be prioritized for removal unless they \nqualify for asylum or other form of relief under our laws, or unl ess, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, \nCBP Sector Chief, or CBP Director of Field Operations, there are compelling and exceptional factors that clearly \nindicate the alien is not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety and should not therefore be an \nenforcement priority. Likewise, aliens in Priority 2 should be removed unless they qualify for asylum or other forms \nof relief under our laws, or unless, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief, CBP Director \nof Field Operations, USCIS District Director, or USCIS Service Center Director, there are factors indicating the alien \nis not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety and should not therefore be an enforcement \npriority . Similarly, aliens in Priority 3 should generally be removed unless they qualify for asylum or another form of \nrelief under our laws or, unless, in the judgment of an immigration officer, the alien is not a threat to the 5 Case: 15-\n40238 Document: 00513264640 Page: 134 Date Filed: 11/09/2015 integrity of the immigration system or there are \nfactors suggesting the alien should not be an enforcement priority. In making suchjudgment s, DHS personnel \n\n\n\nshould consider factorssuch as: extenuating circumstances involving the offense of conviction; extended length of \ntime since the offense of conviction; length of time in the United States; military service; family or community ties in \nthe United States;status as a victim, witness or plaintiff in civil or criminal proceedings; or compelling humanitarian \nfactors such as poor health, age, pregnancy, a young child, or a seriously ill relative. These factors are not intended \nto be dispositive nor is this list intended to be exhaustive. Decisions should be based on the totality of the \ncircumstances. E. Implementation The revised guidance shall be effective on January 5, 2015. Implementing \ntraining and guidance will be provided to the workforce prior to the effective date. The revised guidance in this \nmemorandum applies only to aliens encountered or apprehended on or after the effective date, and aliens \ndetained, in removal proceedings, or subject to removal orders who have not been removed from the United States \nas of the effective date. Nothing in this guidance is intended to modify USCIS Notice to Appear policies, which \nremain in force and effect to the extent they are not inconsistent with this memorandum. F. Data By this \nmemorandum I am directing the Office of Immigration Statistics to create the capability to collect, maintain, and \nreport to the Secretary data reflecting the numbers of those apprehended, removed, returned, or otherwise \nrepatriated by any component of DHS and to report that data in accordance with the priorities set forth above. I \ndirect CBP, ICE, and USCIS to cooperate in this effort. I intend for this data to be part of the package of data \nreleased by DHS to the public annually. G. NoPrivate Right Statement These guidelines and priorities are not \nintended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \nenforceable at law by any party inany administrative, civil, or criminal matter. 6 Case: 15-40238 Document: \n00513264640 Page: 135 Date Filed: 11/09/2015\n\n \n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\n"}
