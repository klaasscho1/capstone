{"title": "5,000 expected at immigration walk", "body": "\nOrganizers expect 5,000 people to attend a walk for dignity and self-respect for immigrants Oct. 7 from the state \nCapitol to Turner Field and back.\n\nWalk organizers are calling for federal immigration reform that would legalize the nation's estimated 12 million \nillegal immigrants and an end to immigration raids and deportations.\n\nThey are also protesting Georgia's new law, known as SB 529, which uses the tax code to penalize employers who \nhire illegal immigrants. The bill also requires public agencies to verify lawful status for someone to receive taxpayer-\nfunded benefits.\n\nE-mails announcing the walk say in English, Spanish and Portuguese, \"Congress, Get Back to Work!\" \"Legalization \nfor All.\"\n\nThe three- to four-mile walk is scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m. and includes about 20 speakers at the Capitol \nafterwards, said organizer Teodoro Maus, Mexico's former consul general in Atlanta. The Atlanta Police \nDepartment expects to issue the walk permit Friday, Maj. Calvin Moss said.\n\nThe state immigration bill has put a chill through Georgia's illegal immigrant community, said Maus. If the trend of \nanti-illegal immigrant rhetoric continues, immigrants will indeed leave the country, he said.\n\n\"But if we are going to leave, we should leave with our heads up and with dignity,\" he said.\n"}
