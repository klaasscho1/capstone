{"title": "If Arizona's Law Succeeds", "body": "\nThe Post hyperbolized when it  faulted Arizona law for its failure to recognize \"the plain reality of America's need for  \nimmigrant labor\" [\"Immigration Ground Zero,\" editorial, Dec. 26].\n\nAccording to  a July Census report, there are 54,277,000 Americans ages 16 to 64 who aren't in the labor force. \nThis includes 23 million \"less-educated\" adults who, for a variety of reasons, don't have a job.\n\nNarrowing this down further,  there are 14 million people actively seeking employment who can't find a full-time job \nin today's economy, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the supply of illegal workers were to dry up \nthrough Arizona's new enforcement programs, employers in the state would be forced to respond by offering \nhigher wages, increased benefits and improved working conditions. Employers would have more incentives to \nmodernize and eliminate unnecessary workers. The result would be a new deal for unskilled American  and legal \nworkers because they would be better paid and have more enlightened work environments.\n\nCan you imagine it:  Shifting the costs of illegal immigrant employment from the taxpayers to the marketplace?\n\nMICHAEL SCOTT\n\nGlendora, Calif.\n"}
