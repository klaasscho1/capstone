{"title": "The Nation in Summary;Freedom Delayed For Haitians", "body": "\nHad they come at another time or perhaps from another place, the thousands of Haitian immigrants now detained in \nthe United States and Puerto Rico might have been welcomed at the country's ''golden door.'' Instead they are \nperceived as having climbed through a what one Government lawyer called ''a window of vulnerability'' that a \nFederal court in Miami may have opened a bit wider last week.\nFederal District Judge orders Government to parole detained Haitians pending hearings to determine political or \neconomic refugee status\n\nFederal District Judge Eugene P. Spellman ordered the Government to parole 1,900 Haitians, most of whom have \nbeen locked up more than a year, pending hearings on whether they are political or economic refugees. The former \nwould be granted asylum; the latter sent back to Haiti.\n\nLawyers for the Haitians said Judge Spellman's decision was a ''major victory'' and expressed hope that it would \nlead to ''a reasonable and orderly release process to remedy this awful detention.'' But it may be a while before \ncelebrations are in order.  Judge Spellman refused to stay his order and the Justice Department filed an appeal with \nthe United States Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The appeal could take as long as a year and the Justice Department \nsaid the Haitians would continue to be detained in the meantime.\n"}
