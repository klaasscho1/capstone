{"title": "why bojo might welcome fiery return to the eu council; INSIDE POLITICS", "body": "\nBORIS Johnson can expect to be in unfamiliar surroundings next week attending his first EU Council summit for \nmore than 20 years.\n\nWith the Brexit negotiations intensifying dramatically last night, the Prime Minister is scheduled to be in Brussels \nONTHURSDAY as the tortuous Article 50 departure process hurtles towards its conclusion.\n\nMr Johnson last attended an EU Council in his old job as a newspaper correspondent covering the machinations of \nthe bloc's bureaucracy in the early 1990s. Back then, European statesmen Jacques Chirac, who died last month, \nand Helmut Kohl were the dominant figures.\n\nThe bizarre egg-shaped Europa summit building, where the gathering of European leaders will take place, was not \neven a glint in a lavishly-paid architect's eye.\n\nStill, with his experience of reporting on the infuriatingly drawn-out procedures of the EU elite, the Prime Minister \nmay have some insight into the hours of tedium that await him.\n\nIf anything, meetings are now even more languid given the EU's expansion, which has added more bodies to the \nroom than on his last visit.\n\nDavid Cameron's recent memoir, ForThe Record, vividly captures the torpor of such gatherings. \"Sometimes I \nwould sit there and count how many people around the table were asleep,\" the former prime minister wrote.\n\nHe recalled how the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy \"would often be reading the French papers\" while \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel \"had to be told to turn the football down on her laptop because she'd forgotten to \nplug her headphones in\".\n\nMr Johnson has plenty of reasons to hope a Brexit deal is close at hand, not least because agreement could well \nmean his return to the EU Council ONTHURSDAY will be the last time he has to attend such a dreary event.\n"}
