{"title": "Judge keeps immigrant in jail for now", "body": "\nAn appeals judge Thursday blocked the release of an immigrant accused of threatening Attorney General Janet \nReno. The decision came a day after another judge ordered him freed immediately because the government \nviolated his constitutional rights.\n\nHany Kiareldeen, a 31-year-old resident of New Jersey who moved to the United States from Gaza nine years ago, \nremained in the Hudson County Correctional Center. He has been detained 19 months.\nHANY-10/21\n\nOn Wednesday, in the first decision in the country to find the government's use of secret evidence against a \ndetained immigrant unconstitutional, U.S. District Judge William H. Walls ordered Kiareldeen released. The same \nday, attorneys for the Immigration and Naturalization Service got a temporary stay to keep him in jail.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Judge Leonard Garth of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the stay will be \nconsidered by a three-judge appeals panel Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nKiareldeen was arrested on a student visa violation, then denied bail based on secret evidence. The government \naccused him of meeting with one of the World Trade Center bombers and threatening Reno. During immigration \nhearings, Kiareldeen successfully rebutted those allegations, an immigration judge ruled.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals agreed Oct. 15, finding the government's allegations to be unsubstantiated \nhearsay.\n\nWhen INS attorneys blocked Kiareldeen's release Wednesday by obtaining a stay, his attorneys pressed his \nrelease on constitutional grounds with District Judge Walls. In a strongly worded decision Wednesday, Walls wrote \nthat the \"INS' actions unconstitutionally damaged Kiareldeen's due process right to confront his accusers.\" \n\nWalls said the government's unwillingness to provide information not only to the immigrant, but also to judges in \nthe immigration system denied Kiareldeen his right to a fair hearing.\n\nWalls' decision was hailed as a significant step in the fight against the use of secret evidence being waged by \nimmigrant and civil rights groups nationwide and by almost 50 members of Congress who have proposed \nlegislation to ban its use.\n\nAbout 20 immigrants, almost all of them Arab, are being detained on secret evidence alleging they have ties to \nterrorists. They include Tampa resident Mazen Al-Najjar, who has been held in a Bradenton jail more than two \nyears.\n\n\nA ruling in the 3rd Circuit would not be binding on all secret evidence cases, but certainly would be influential, \nlawyers say.\n\nIn the immigration system, Kiareldeen may yet be given bail so he can leave jail. A decision on that issue is pending \nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals. The board's actions are separate from those in federal courts.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nBLACK AND WHITE PHOTO; Hany Kiareldeen\n"}
