{"title": "27 Businesses In Montgomery Fined by INS; Feb. Immigrant Roundup Draws $154,000 in Levies", "body": "\nThe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service imposed fines totaling more than $ 154,000 yesterday on 27 food \nservice businesses in Montgomery County for hiring illegal workers and other violations.\n\nThe fines, announced at a news conference in Baltimore, were the result of a February roundup in which the INS \narrested 75 illegal workers at 30 restaurants, bakeries and delis in Bethesda, Rockville and other Montgomery \nlocations. Officials said a follow-up investigation revealed that employers at 27 of those businesses knew they had \nhired employees not authorized to work in the United States.\n\n\"We are aggressively pursuing employers who do not comply with the law, especially those who knowingly hire \nillegal workers,\" said Benedict Ferro, director of the agency's Baltimore District. \"Employers who intentionally hire \nillegal workers take job opportunities away from legal workers, including the large legal immigrant community in \nMontgomery County. We are committed to restoring those job opportunities for legal workers and punishing \nemployers who knowingly violate the law.\"\n\nIn addition to illegal hiring, the businesses were cited for failing to meet federal documentation and verification \nstandards required of all employers.\n\nTopping the list with the most violations, officials said, were: American City Diner, of Bethesda, with fines of $ \n17,350 for 82 employment verification violations, one knowing illegal hire and two arrests; La Parisienne Bakery \nInc., of Rockville, with fines of $ 13,650 for 55 verification violations, three knowing illegal hires and five arrests of \nillegal immigrants; and East End Cafe, of Bethesda, with $ 6,800 in fines for 22 verification violations, one \nknowing illegal hire and two arrests.\n\nThree of the businesses were fined for second violations: Parioli Ristorante, of Bethesda, was fined $ 27,800; \nMoby Dick House of Kabob, of Bethesda, was fined $ 12,500; and Ichiban restaurant, of Gaithersburg, was fined $ \n8,600.\n\nSeveral owners and managers of the raided restaurants were reached by telephone last night, but none was willing \nto comment on the fines or arrests.\n\nPenalties for knowingly hiring an unauthorized worker can range from $ 250 to $ 10,000 per employee. Fines for \nfailing to meet documentation and verification standards can run from $ 100 to $ 1,000 per employee.\n\nThe day-long series of raids, dubbed the Big Chill by immigration officials, extended from Bethesda to Gaithersburg. \nIts targets included delicatessens, bagel shops, sit-down restaurants and McDonald's franchises. Agents inspected \n47 food establishments and detained 83 immigrants, eight of whom were released; INS officials said about half of \n\n\nthe illegal immigrants arrested in the raids have left the country voluntarily or have been deported, while the rest \nare undergoing deportation proceedings.\n"}
