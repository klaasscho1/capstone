{"title": "Mud-Hut Muddle: Visas Denied for Museum Workers", "body": "\nOn this red-white-and-blue national holiday, we bring you a simple news story to assure you that our borders are \nsafe from immigrants coming over to work on construction projects and build things in 'murca. Even when it's a \ncouple of mud huts. Even when it's for a museum. Even when an actual U.S. senator gets involved.\n\nSee, you probably thought that there were, like, millions of immigrant men and women in this country legally or \nillegally, gainfully employed in the construction trades. You may have noticed entire groups of said workers at \npickup sites around the Washington metropolitan region, looking for daywork. You may have read stories about this \nas being sort of an issue.\n\nTo which we can only respond: Not if the U.S. consulate in Nigeria can help it!\n\nThe Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia is finding this out the hard way. As Deputy Director Eric Bryan explains it, \nthe outdoor museum in Staunton was looking to add a couple of 18th-century African mud huts to its collection of \nhousing that various American ancestors once might have lived in. This would be an addition to the German exhibit, \nthe Irish exhibit, etc., etc.\n\nThe museum tries to bleed authenticity. It features original buildings that have been dismantled in their home \ncountries, brought over to the commonwealth and restored. The German exhibit, for example, dates to the 1600s \nand is from the village of H\u00c3\u00b6rdt. It is there to show American schoolchildren on field trips the casual freedom they \nenjoy to not live in a town with an umlaut in its name.\n\nNo, actually, the exhibits are to \"increase public knowledge of the diverse Old World origins of early immigrants to \nAmerica, of how these immigrants lived in their homelands, how they came to America, and how the way-of-life they \ncreated together on the American frontier has shaped the success of the United States,\" the museum's Web site \nsays.\n\n\nTo recognize the ancestry of African Americans, the museum staff went to western Africa to search out what the \naverage family might have lived in before slave traders showed up. They came up with a simple mud hut with a \nthatch roof.\n\nWorking in Nigeria, they got a consultant to vet several workmen who were conversant with the old ways and \nimplements. This resulted in three apparently impoverished rural men, all apparently over the age of 45, who were \nfrom the Igbo region of the country, Bryan said. They had never left the country before.\n\nThe museum sent letters of invitation, asking them to come over this summer and build a compound of three huts \nand a boundary wall and then return home. They helped them get Nigerian passports.\n\nThe office of Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) supported their visa applications by making the U.S. consulate in Nigeria \naware of the importance of the museum's project, Warner's spokeswoman, Bronwyn Lance Chester, said \nyesterday. (No one made the men's names available because of privacy concerns.)\n\nApplications were filed about three weeks ago, Bryan said. There was confusion. And then the word came down: \nRejection!\n\nThe Associated Press yesterday quoted U.S. consulate official Debra Heien as saying one of the men couldn't \ndescribe the building project and another filled out his paperwork incorrectly. She said two of them were unable to \nmake a living.\n\n\"They ruled 'denied' because the interviewers did not think these men showed sufficient socioeconomic ties to \nNigeria in order to assure their return,\" Bryan said.\n\nNow the museum is scrambling to get their consultant and an architect familiar with the old ways to construct the \nexhibit. The materials -- the tools, the thatch for the roof -- are already en route. The buildings will be in place by the \nend of the year, Bryan said. They'll even have real goats wandering the compound, of the same breed that would \nhave wandered such courtyards 200 years ago.\n\nAnd so our little story ends this way: Real mud, real thatch, real goats, no real rural workmen.\n\nSomehow, we are not surprised. Bryan sums up the state of modern America this way: \"We were naive in assuming \nthere wouldn't be any problems.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE; Frontier Culture Museum Of Virginia; The Frontier Culture Museum in Staunton planned to re-create these \nNigerian mud huts.\n\nIMAGE; Frontier Culture Museum Of Virginia; A drawing of the mud huts planned for the Frontier Culture \nMuseum, which was unable to hire workmen from Nigeria for the project.\n"}
