{"title": "Undocumented Workers and the Law", "body": "\nRegarding the Jan. 15 Metro story \"Bill on Migrants Splits a Town With Few\":\n\nIt's not that Taneytown wants to ban legal migrant workers, who for years have come to this area to pick fruit.\n\nThe town wants to ban illegal workers.\n\nFederal law states that  anyone working in this country must have the legal status to do so. If an employer is found \nto employ  someone who does not have work authorization, the employer can be fined and the worker deported. \nBut since our government does not adequately enforce this requirement, it is up to local communities to create \nguidelines for employers. This does not make these local governments wrong; it makes them right for wanting to  \nsee the laws of the country obeyed.\n\nTaneytown is not the only  jurisdiction that has put this problem on the table. As long as the federal government \ndoes nothing, this will be a growing problem for Americans, whether native-born  or immigrant.\n\nWe all need to stand up and obey the laws of our land.\n\nSONDRA EATON\n\nCamp Springs\n"}
