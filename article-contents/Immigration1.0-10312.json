{"title": "AGENCY STEPS UP INQUIRIES ON FOREIGN STUDENTS; MIZZOU HAS BEEN ASKED FOR DATA ON 1,300 AT ITS CAMPUS", "body": "\nEven before President George W. Bush proclaimed Monday a crackdown on U.S. visas for foreign students, some \nU.S. colleges and universities were already feeling the squeeze.\n\nJim McCartney, interim director of the International Center at the University of Missouri at Columbia, said the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service made a special request to his office about 10 days ago for data on each of \nthe campus's 1,300 foreign students.\n\nMcCartney said the agency asked for copies of each student's visa d ocuments plus a transcript, the student's \ncurrent program and number of credit hours being taken. To comply within the agency's two-week deadline, \"We've \ngot three people who aren't doing anything but standing at the copy machine,\" McCartney said.\n\nSt. Louis University has received since Sept. 11 \"moderately more\" calls than usual from the immigration agency, \njust checking to see whether individual students are enrolled, spokesman Jeff Fowler said.\n\nThe agency long has had the legal right to certain types of information about foreign students, and colleges are \nobliged to keep it and give it to the agency when it asks. Administrators who work with foreign students at \ncolleges in the St. Louis area say the agency has always asked for the information - periodically. They also say \nthey are hearing on their professional grapevine that the immigration agency has been extra active in requesting \ninformation in the past seven weeks.\n\nAgency spokeswoman Elaine Komis would say only that, because of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the agency \nhas been seeking information that it had not sought before.\n\nMU's McCartney said he had \"no notion\" how the agency was choosing schools for scrutiny or why it had selected \nMizzou.\n\nBert Barry, director of international services at Webster University, said the school had been \"fortunate - knock on \nwood - that we haven't had such a request\" from the immigration agency.\n\nStudent visas have come to public attention since Sept. 11 because two of the terrorists involved in the attacks \nmay have used them to enter the country initially. Barry and his counterparts at other colleges say the immigration \nagency's current system for tracking foreign students is so full of loopholes that holders of student visas can \neasily enter and stay without ever registering for a class.\n\n\nToni Liston, international student services adviser at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, said the \nimmigration service has never had \"the money, the computers, the wherewithal\" to monitor foreign students. She \nsaid its current system suffers from lags of two to four years.\n\nNotes\n\nAMERICA RESPONDS; Reporter Susan C. Thomson:; E-mail: sthomson@post-dispatch.com; Phone: 314-209-\n1315  \n"}
