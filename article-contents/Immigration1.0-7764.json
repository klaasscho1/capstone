{"title": "Taking Away Rights: Where Do You Stop?", "body": "\nJim Panos's column misses the point. The bumper sticker in its regrettably crude terseness is a growing reaction to \nthe increasing flood of immigrants who, as soon as they arrive, insist on the use of their own language at our \nexpense.\n\nBilingual and multilingual education, the provision of court interpreters, the publication of government documents in \na multiplicity of languages and even the administration of the citizenship oath in a language other than English all \nserve to balkanize our country, to reinforce national, cultural and behavioral differences among various immigrant \ngroups and ultimately to sow the seeds of our own destruction. And all of us taxpayers pay heavily for this privilege.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with immigrants preserving their language, culture and practices, but let them do it at their \nown expense, not ours.\n\nIt is about time that the United States formally declared English as our official language and restricted all official \nproceedings to that language. Until that time I would alter the bumper sticker to read: \"If you don't speak English -- \nlearn, or get out!\"\n\n \n\nHEINZ ROSEN\n\n Huntington\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
