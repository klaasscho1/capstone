{"title": "DEPORTATION AFTERMATH: A BOY'S TEARS HIS FATHER WAS AMONG 67 PEOPLE ROUNDED UP IN YORK AND SENT HOME.", "body": "\nIt is a child's classic nightmare - a parent suddenly taken away without explanation.\n\nFlavio Lopez is living it. The 4-year-old boy has awakened crying several times a night since his father was \ndeported to Mexico last week with a group of other illegal immigrants, according to Isabel Colon, the boy's \nguardian.\n\nFlavio is one of at least seven children left behind when the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service raided \nthe Fypon Inc. plant in York County last week, rounding up and deporting 67 suspected illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Flavio kept asking me if his father had died,\" Colon said. \"After I got him to understand that his father was in \nMexico, he started packing his clothes and his toys and said he wants to go to Mexico to be with his father.\"\n\nAn INS official said the separation of parents and children was unintentional.\n\n\"Any alien who said they had children in the United States, we processed them and released them on their own \nrecognizance,\" Charles Zemski, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia, said. \"If they didn't tell us, we didn't know it.\"\n\nThe INS ordered the raid on the plastic-ornaments factory in Stewartstown after receiving a tip about the group of \nundocumented workers there, said Henry J. Brattlie, deputy district director for the Philadelphia office of the INS.\n\nSixty-one workers were from Mexico, four from Belize, and one each from Ecuador and Guatemala, Brattlie said. \nTwelve were women.\n\nBrattlie said 48 Mexican nationals agreed to return to their country immediately and were deported Friday. The \nothers requested immigration hearings.\n\nFypon owner William F. Poole said if his firm had illegal employees, it was\n\nbecause the workers used fraudulent documents. No charges have been filed against the company, Brattlie said.\n"}
