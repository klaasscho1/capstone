{"title": "IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS SEEK TO DEPORT AIDE TO SHEIK", "body": "\nTHE IMMIGRATION and Naturalization Service will attempt in hearings beginning today to deport a top aide to \njailed Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is in jail for plotting to blow up New York landmarks.\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the aide, Nasser Mohammed Ahmed, is arguing that if his client is sent back to Egypt he \nwould be tortured and murdered.\n\nAhmed, an electrical engineer who lives in New York, was arrested Tuesday by immigration agents after he \nentered a federal building to attend a conference with an immigration judge.\n\nAn immigration spokesman said Ahmed was arrested \"as a result of new information that has been brought to our \nattention.\" He would not elaborate.\n\nAhmed had been free on a $ 15,000 bond while contesting charges that he had overstayed his visa.\n\nUnder provisions of a new anti-terrorism bill signed by President Bill Clinton last week, immigration authorities can \nnow more easily deport foreigners suspected of terrorism.\n\nAhmed's attorney, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said his client was named as an unindicted co-\nconspirator released by the government last year during the trial of Abdel-Rahman and nine of his followers. They \nwere convicted in October of plotting to bomb the United Nations and other landmarks in New York City.\n\nAccording to court papers filed by the defense, \"A principal defense to his deportation is the fact that he would be \npersecuted, tortured and murdered if he was turned over to government police in Egypt and is entitled to political \nasylum in the U.S.\"\n\nRamsey said Ahmed also regularly visits Abdel-Rahman at the federal prison medical center in Springfield, Mo. \nAhmed has been Abdel-Rahman's translator since 1992. During the sheik's trial Ahmed served as a translator and \nparalegal for Abdel-Rahman.\n"}
