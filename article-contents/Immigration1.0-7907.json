{"title": "THE ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE: THE HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER;Newspaper in Sea of Outrage Over Coverage of Elian Case - Correction Appended", "body": "\nThe first e-mail message opened at noon today by Tom Fiedler, the editorial page editor of The Miami Herald, \nbegan, \"I am ashamed of The Herald -- focusing your front page on the tragedy of little Elian.\"\n\nThe front page of the newspaper's Sunday issue was dominated by the word SEIZED in three-inch letters. The \nphotograph of the boy, smiling with his father, was next to it, and below, across the page, was the now famous \nphotograph of an armed agent confronting the family friend who held a clearly frightened Elian Gonzalez in his \narms.\n\nMr. Fiedler was beginning one more day of absorbing outrage at the newspaper, which is wrestling with the \nbiggest and most emotional local news event since the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. On Saturday, after agents \nof the Immigration and Naturalization Service took the 6-year-old child from the home where his Miami relatives \nwere keeping him, 500 emotional e-mail messages and faxes poured into The Herald, sometimes at the rate of one \na minute.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, The Herald's journalists have been walking barefoot over the shards of pent-up resentment \nthat litter this poly-lingual, poly-cultural, poly-angry place. For the new editor and almost new publisher, the forced \nmarch of Elian coverage -- 1,000 articles and counting -- is a chance to rebut the longtime criticism that The Herald \nshrinks from tough, fair and comprehensive coverage of Miami's powerful Cuban-American majority. Or a chance \nto give critics the evidence they crave. Or both.\n\n\"It is such a huge story and a story that a portion of the population has such a fixed view of that it's almost \ninconceivable that The Herald could cover it in a way that satisfies the audience in Miami,\" said James M. \nNaughton, the president of the Poynter Institute, a journalism research and training organization in St. Petersburg, \nFla. \"It's an opportunity to say: That's not our standard. We're going to cover it in a way the community deserves \nand hope that we cover it in a way that is always respected, if not always accepted.\"\n\n\nAlong the way, however, the newspaper is being buffeted by attacks from within and without. Its newsroom of 400 \npeople, which is 21 percent Hispanic, 12 percent black, 2 percent Asian-American and 65 percent non-Hispanic \nwhite, is growing accustomed to -- though not necessarily comfortable with -- open second-guessing of coverage, \nsecond-guessing that often breaks down along ethnic lines.\n\nLast week, the black columnist Robert Steinback was answering e-mail messages from Cuban-Americans angry \nabout the gulf between Little Havana and the city's other ethnic enclaves.\n\nIn general, Mr. Steinback said, his critics offered variations of the theme: \"Who are you to talk to us? You should \ntalk to your own people.\"\n\nAn article one week ago by Manny Garcia, profiling Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, mentioned everything \nfrom his mercurial behavior and his two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol to his fierce affection \nfor Elian. It brought its Cuban-American author 100 e-mail messages on Monday. \"Half said, 'You're anti-Cuban, a \nbad Cuban,' \" Mr. Garcia said. \"The other half said, 'You're a suck-up for your own people.' \"\n\nRecent polls provide graphic evidence of the ethnic chasms among Herald readers. While nationally, a CBS News \npoll in mid-April showed that 58 percent of Americans said Elian should be returned to his father, a Herald poll the \nfirst week in April showed far greater polarization here. While 83 percent of Cuban-Americans thought the boy \nshould remain in Miami, 76 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 92 percent of blacks thought he should be returned \nto his father. Among non-Cuban Hispanics, 55 percent said the boy should remain in South Florida.\n\nThose polled in Miami-Dade County represent the bulk of the readership of The Herald, whose daily spring and \nsummer circulation is about 314,000, and whose winter vacation-season numbers rise to about 340,000 daily.\n\nThat does not count The Herald's Spanish-language sister newspaper, El Nuevo Herald, which mostly uses its own \nreporters' material and tends to frame its coverage with partisan flair. On Saturday, El Herald sold out 25,000 \ncopies of an eight-page, 25-cent special issue bearing the headline \"!Que Verguenza!\" (How Shameful!) \nsuperimposed over the picture of Elian facing the agent with an assault rifle.\n\nThe back page of the issue had a full-page picture of Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, sobbing.\n\nCarlos Castaneda, the editor of El Nuevo Herald, is pleased with both the coverage and the way it has pumped up \nhis circulation, whose street sales have risen between 750 and 2,500 copies over the average. For the six months \nended in March, El Herald's circulation was 96,897, an 8.4 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.\n\nAsked whether the coverage in the special issue was objective, Mr. Castaneda said the paper mirrored its readers: \n\"The people have reacted that way all around. It's how the people feel. We are interpreting the feeling of our \nreaders. A newspaper has to reflect the feeling of its readers.\"\n\nSince January, the English-language Herald has written so many articles that it will have to cut back its news space \nlater in the year to meet its budget.\n\nEarlier this year, the editors sent Frances Robles, a reporter of Puerto Rican heritage, to Cuba for six weeks to \ncover the boy's hometown. Ms. Robles, who had no visa because the Cuban government opposes visas for Herald \njournalists, was eventually detained by the police, interrogated for five hours, then sent home.\n\nSince Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, arrived in Washington more than two weeks ago, Ms. Robles, who is \ncovering him, has received e-mail messages from Cuban colleagues chastising her for not asking tough questions \nof him, even though the Cuban government's dislike of The Herald makes Ms. Robles an unlikely candidate to get \nan interview with Mr. Gonzalez.\n\nThe assistant managing editor, Mark Seibel, said in an interview on Thursday: \"People think if you just explain \nthings more, cover them more, people will understand. But that's where I talk about this in terms of articles of faith.\"\n\n\n\nOn the issue of Elian's future, he said \"there is noncommunication, a disconnect.\" To Cubans, he said, the decision \nto keep Elian from his father and a Cuban future \"is obvious,\" but \"to Anglos and African-Americans it is not \nobvious; this is a difference of belief.\"\n\nEvery article, every headline, must pass through the filter of two prevailing beliefs. For instance, when Herald \nreporters assigned to check out Lazaro Gonzalez's background failed to turn up the convictions for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol, \"we were accused of hiding this information by some people unsympathetic to the Miami \nfamily,\" said Martin Baron, who became The Herald's executive editor on Jan. 10, after nearly three years as an \nassociate managing editor of The New York Times.\n\nThe Herald, which has since covered those issues, has also been criticized for failing to look into the source of the \nmoney supporting the array of lawyers for Elian's family in Miami -- reporting that is under way, Mr. Seibel said.\n\nThose are seen as sins of omission by people unfriendly to the claims of Lazaro Gonzalez. But some Cuban-\nAmericans take as sins of commission the Herald exclusives about the frequent stress-related hospitalizations of \nMarisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin and primary caretaker, or the $1 million Miami has had to spend because of \nthe protests.\n\nOne article, by Meg Laughlin, a respected feature writer, brought internal complaints, which reached Mr. Baron and \nMr. Seibel. One of the articles described out-of-town journalists' fondness for quoting a Florida International \nUniversity professor abhorred by conservatives for saying Miami had some characteristics of \"a banana republic.\" \nThe piece quoted the professor, Dario Moreno, angering some of Ms. Laughlin's colleagues, who said the news \ncolumns would have been better off without his views.\n\nJudy Miller, the newspaper's city editor, said in an interview that she was \"very proud\" of the newspaper's \nwillingness to take a hard look at the issues and claims surrounding the controversy.\n\nProminent, though not alone, among the internal critics is Liz Balmaseda. Ms. Balmaseda, whose commentaries \nabout Haitian and Cuban issues won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983, is Cuban-American. She declined to discuss her \ncriticisms in detail, saying \"We have conversations about our coverage.\" She has high-profile and prominent \nfriends in the Cuban community; she is on leave working with the actor Andy Garcia on an HBO film about the \nCuban-born trumpeter Arturo Sandoval. Sometimes a commentator, sometimes an internal critic, sometimes a \nreporter, she is also seen by some as a partisan, and was photographed taking part in an April 13 prayer circle \noutside the Gonzalez home in Little Havana, along with the singer Gloria Estefan.\n\n\"I'm a columnist,\" said Ms. Balmaseda, who has favored keeping Elian in Miami. \"I didn't start out to make a \npolitical statement. Prayer is very personal. It's a personal conversation with God, and only God knows what I'm \npraying for.\"\n\nMr. Baron said he had talked with Ms. Balmaseda about the incident, adding, \"I told her I thought it was \ninappropriate and we should maintain our distance.\"\n\nOn another front, Mr. Baron addressed the concerns of some journalists, instructing his lieutenants to tell their staffs \nto guard against insensitive comments on the Elian matter. In an interview, he said that while wisecracks were a \nnewsroom staple, \"this is one where people are in close contact with families, and it's very personal.\" He added, \n\"Their families have left an authoritarian regime, and they take it very personally.\"\n\nNegotiating the brittle sensibilities, in house and out, has been a strain, people in The Herald's newsroom agree. \nOne who does not show it, however, is Alberto Ibarguen, who is the publisher of The Herald and El Herald and to \nwhom both Mr. Baron and Mr. Castaneda report. In his job about 18 months, he said he was pleased with The \nHerald's down-the-middle coverage and as pleased with the more subjective alternative offered in El Herald. The \nvariety, he said, \"is just what I want.\"\n\n\n\nA slightly more distant observer, Michael McQueen, a former assistant city editor at The Herald who is now \nchairman of the journalism department at Florida International University, said: \"I think the paper is doing pretty \ngood on the Elian story. It is so explosive. Everything you do is going to be wrong.\" He added: \"The output is fairly \ngood, fairly balanced, fairly free of tilting one way or another. I don't know how they've done it.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nCorrection\n\nAn article yesterday about The Miami Herald's coverage of the Elian Gonzalez situation misstated the year in \nwhich Liz Balmaseda, a Herald columnist critical of the paper, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.
