{"title": "METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY;Verdicts Mixed in Trial Over Immigrant Beatings", "body": "\nA Union County jail guard was convicted yesterday of failing to report the beatings of illegal immigrants brought to \nthe jail in 1995 after a disturbance at a detention center. Another guard was acquitted of charges that he \nparticipated in the beatings.\n\nThe convicted guard, Joseph Werthmann 3d, is to be sentenced for official misconduct on July 10 and faces up to \n10 years in prison, said Robert O'Leary, the first assistant prosecutor of Union County. The other guard, Edward \nEinhorn, was acquitted in the five-week trial.\n\nThe two were the last of 12 guards to be charged in the beatings, which occurred after about 300 immigrants \nrioted over conditions at the Esmor detention center in Elizabeth, which reopened under new management last \nyear. Six guards pleaded guilty to official misconduct last month after three others were convicted. The 12th guard \ndied in a car crash.\n\nMr. Werthmann's lawyer, Blair Zwillman, said the conviction would be appealed. Mr. Zwillman said the guard who \ntestified against his client, Sultan Holmes, failed to file a report himself and lied on the witness stand to avoid \nprosecution.\n"}
