But we \nshouldn't discard them or ignore them.\"\n\nSen. Eric Schneiderman, the Manhattan Democrat who helped craft the bill, admitted it's possible the guilty plea \nexception could help legal immigrants avoid deportation, but he said that was not the intent. He noted that illegal \nimmigrants face automatic deportation.\n\nHe said it would have been unconstitutional to offer those who plead guilty different sentencing alternatives to those \nwho don't.\n\nMeanwhile, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly blasted the repeal of the Rockefeller drug laws at a City Council \nhearing.\n\nKelly ripped provisions that would allow a judge to seal certain felony or misdemeanor convictions.\n\n\"You'll be able to hide your felony background from an employer,\" he said.\n\n\nklovett@nydailynews.com\n"}
