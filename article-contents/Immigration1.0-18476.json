The conviction \nmay be grounds for deportation. An immigration judge several years ago decided not to deport de la Rosa, 33, a \ncook who lives in Ambler with his wife and his toddler son, both U.S. citizens.\n\nThe old conviction, for which de la Rosa was sentenced to three to six months of house arrest, became an issue \nagain because of the publicity surrounding the rape case. De la Rosa was picked out of a photo line-up by the \nvictim of a rape July 18 in a Chinatown SEPTA station and turned himself into police. He was later cleared by a \nDNA test.\n\nThis morning, his lawyers told immigration judge Charles M. Malloy that they agreed with the facts of the case - that \nde la Rosa was a non-citizen convicted of an aggravated assault in 1999 - but also stated that they disagreed with \nthe legal conclusion that aggravated assaults inherently involve intentional acts of violence. If they do, then that \nwould make de la Rosa's crime one of \"moral turpitude\" and, so, grounds for deportation.\n\nThe judge scheduled a hearing on the case for March 14, 2006.\n\nBy Gaiutra Bahadur\n"}
