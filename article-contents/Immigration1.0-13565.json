The Turkish armed forces have already \nstarted doing this by neutralising around 4,000 terrorists.\"\nThe ambassador said that according to the 'Right to self-defence' article of the UN Charter, the 'Operation Peace \nSpring' is justifiable and de jure. \n\"President Erdogan spoke to the US and Russian presidents about the Turkish intentions concerning the ongoing \nPeace Operation. We spoke to the UN and the Secretary-General of NATO, and also delivered an oral memo to the \nSyrian consulate in Turkey, where we explained that 'Operation Peace Spring' is entirely intended to put an end to \nthe terrorists and bring back the targeted area to Syrians,\" he said.\nHe added, \"The operation taking place on the 411-kilometre length of Turkish borders is a direct threat to Turkey. In \norder to avoid any harm to civilians, we are only targeting shelters, coves and military equipment of terrorists.\"\nAbout the Arab position on the ongoing operation, he said, \"Unfortunately, there isn't a united position within the \nArab world and we find the accusations of some of the opposing Arab countries un-explainable and unacceptable.\"\nThe ambassador, however, denied diplomatic actions against any of the countries with a clear opposition to \n'Operation Peace Spring' and remained hopeful of a successful peace operation.\nWithout any specific timeline, the ambassador said the 'Operation Peace Spring' would continue until it achieves the \ndeclared objectives.\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/59/157109411302.jpeg\n\nTurkish operation in Syria to boost border security, says envoy\n"}
