Wilder, a member of parliament, lives \nunder 24-hour police protection and is facing prosecution for \u0153incitement to hatred and discrimination because of \nhis anti-Islam film.\n\nThe 17-minute film accuses the Quran of inciting violence, juxtaposing verses of the Quran with violent images of \nterrorism, the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and virulent speeches by Muslim imams in a montage that links the Islamic \nfaith to support for terrorism.\n\nDutch television refused to air \u02dcFitna as it was released online in March 2008 where it generated intense anger \namong Muslim communities and attempts by several governments to censor the film. Al-Qaeda even issued a fatwa \nagainst Wilders,\n\nOne of the co-sponsors of Thursdays screenings refused to comment on the accusation that the film is anti-Islamic \nand equates Islam with terrorism, suggesting that people should decide for themselves if the film incited hatred.\n\n\u0153The best answer to any question about the film is to watch the film yourself, Christine Brim, senior vice-president \nof CPS, told AlArabiya.net.\n\nWilders was prevented to from entering Britain earlier this month, where he hoped to show his film in the British \nparliament, because British authorities said his presence in would pose a \u0153genuine, present and sufficiently \nserious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society.\n\nThe Center for Security Policy headed by a former advisor to Ronald Reagan, Frank Gaffney, and advocates an \nAmerican foreign policy of \u0153Peace through Strength with a primary goal combating the ideology of Islamist \nextremism.\n\nCAIR reaction\n\nhttp://www.redstate.com/paul_murphy/2009/02/25/the-right-green-alternative-to-the-stimulus/\nhttp://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/02/26/67303.html\n\n\nThe Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on Kyl to invite Muslim \nrepresentatives to offer a balancing perspective to the screening.\n\n\u0153It seems that Senator Kyl is oblivious to the fact that there are Muslims in his own state who will take offense at \nthis cheap anti-Islam publicity stunt designed to promote a person who is under indictment for inciting religious \nhatred, said CAIR-AZ Executive Director Ahmad Daniels.\n\n\u0153Geert Wilders is just one of many self-promoting Islamophobes traveling the world in search of attention for their \nhate-filled views. We ask that Americans of all faiths ignore Mr. Wilders, thereby depriving him of the attention he so \ndesperately seeks. Wilders has the right to spew his hate, but he does not have the right to a taxpayer-funded \nplatform in the United States Congress.\n\nWilders was in Washington for the screening and to promote a new initiative by IFPS, which he heads, \u0153to protect \nfree speech from laws that criminalize any criticisms of Islam or the doctrines of Sharia, to be launched Friday at the \nNational Press Club.\n\n\u0153Its not our position that people should be kept out of the country for\n\ntheir views but it doesnt mean you have to give them a platform, paid for by the taxpayers, CAIR National \nCommunications Director Ibrahim Hooper, told AlArabiya.net, adding that the closed-door screening meant no \nmedia or public access to the event.\n\n\u0153Why do they have to hide it if theyre so proud it? he added.\n\nSeveral attempts by AlArabiya.net to seek comment from the Senators office went unanswered.\n\nSenator Keith Ellison, the only Muslim member of congress, refused requests from AlArabiya.net for comment on \nwhether he would attend the screening and what he thought about the film.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: TB [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Chorus of \u02dcFairness Doctrine Fans Adds Another\n\nOhio senator supports \u02dcgoals underlying government speech rules\n\nSen.

Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Tuesday introduced a bill seeking to reform the way the \nPentagon buys weapons systems. The ultimate goal of the bill is to rein in the ballooning costs of high-tech \nweapons and, eventually, to establish fixed-price contracts for most weapons systems, according to Levin.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: JD [|Return to headlines]\n\n           EPA Says Farm Dust Requires Regulation\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u201d Nothing says summer in Iowa like a cloud of dust behind a combine.\n\nBut what may be a fact of life for farmers is a cause for concern to federal regulators, who are refusing to exempt \ngrowers from new environmental regulations.\n\nIts left some farmers feeling bemused and more than a little frustrated.\n\n\u0153Its such a non-commonsense idea that you can keep dust within a property line when the wind blows, said Sen. \nCharles Grassley, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee who still farms in northeast Iowa.\n\nUnder rules imposed in 2006, rural areas would be kept to the same standards as urban areas for what the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency calls \u0153coarse particulate matter in the air.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Pork Producers Council had petitioned the government to \nprovide an exemption to farmers. They argued that evidence of harm caused by dust in rural areas hasnt been \ndetermined.\n\nBut the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington ruled Tuesday that the EPA had already provided the evidence \nnecessary to determine farm dust \u0153likely is not safe.\n\nMichael Formica, a lawyer for the pork council, said this means farmers now face the daunting task of proving a \nnegative \u201d that the dust is not harmful.\n\nFormica said his and other groups will consider a further appeal.\n\nFarmers said they will be hard-pressed to meet the standards.\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to the EPA, Grassley wrote that compliance would be impossible because of the dust \nproduced in farmers day-to-day activities.\n\nGrassley also has noted that because many rural roads are not paved, particulate readings could be affected by \nwind gusts that constantly change.\n\n\u0153After all, God decides when the wind blows, not Chuck Grassley, he said.\n\nBut the EPA said the regulation was overdue.\n\nEvery five years, the Clean Air Act requires the agency to review the newest scientific information and recommend \nchanges to its standards.\n\nhttp://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jqPoP1YkyGaiacWbQU6fqd0WaSvAD96JT0400\n\n\nIn 2006, the EPA determined larger particles in the air than previously thought were a danger to the public. The \nincreased threshold covered air mixes that occur in rural areas.\n\nEPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn said the changes are not just a matter of regulating dust. They serve the publics \nwell-being and, regardless of whether someone lives in a rural or urban area, the threshold for unsafe levels of dust \nin the air must remain consistent nationally.\n\n\u0153Its health-based, she said. \u0153We dont look at a particular industry. The goal is to protect public health.\n\nWhen counties reach \u0153non-attainment levels, it becomes a states responsibility to bring the county back into \nacceptable levels.\n\nMilbourn said various options exist for states, such as retrofitting buses that run on diesel engines.\n\nBut farmers insist the regulation will affect their operations and eventually their bottom lines. And they said unlike \nfixing a bus, they have few options for limiting dust from their fields and roads.\n\nRoger Zylstra, a director with the Iowa Corngrowers Association, said if left alone, farmers can compete worldwide. \nBut regulation could impede their success.\n\nHe said there seems to be a disconnect between farmers and policymakers.\n\n\u0153Many of the people that are making the rules, it feels like they really dont know what (farming) issues are, said \nZylstra, a Lynnville resident who has worked on a farm for 35 years.\n\nZylstra said its hard not to get frustrated.\n\n\u0153We think weve met the demands that have been put upon us and lo and behold, we have new and even more \nstringent demands. It seems really unrealistic.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Ex-CAIR Leader Starts New Front Group\n\nAhemd Bedier who last year had \u0153stepped down as the Executive Director of the Tampa Bay office of The Council \non American Islamic Relations, has now started up a new front group called The United Voices of America to help \nadvance his Islamic agenda\u00a6\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: http://islaminaction08.blogspot.com/|Islam in Action [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Join Nearly 40 Nationwide Tea Parties Across U.S.\n\nAmericans say \u02dcenough is enough, unite to protest spending\n\nAmericans are saying enough is enough to extravagant government spending and throwing nearly 40 tea parties \nacross the nation to protest.\n\nhttp://islaminaction08.blogspot.com/2009/02/ex-cair-leader-starts-new-front-group.html\nhttp://islaminaction08.blogspot.com/%7CIslam\nhttp://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=90055\n\n\nKellen Giuda, a laid-off architect, is organizing his own New York City tea party.

Mr. Wilders has defended the film and his positions by saying in interviews, \u0153I dont hate Muslims \u201d I hate \nIslam.\n\nIn an interview with the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck on Tuesday, Mr. Wilders said:\n\n\u0153I have nothing against Muslims. But my point is, that the Islam is a totalitarian ideology that should be compared \nnot so much with other religions but with other totalitarian ideologies \u201d like communism or fascism.\n\nMr. Wilders appearance on the Beck program was one of several stops on a media tour of conservative outlets in \nthe United States. He has posted video of that interview and links to many blog posts and Web site articles about \nhim on his own blog.\n\nAt least one congressman has publicly opposed his visit to Washington. Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who \nis Muslim, compared the screening of \u0153Fitna on Capitol Hill to showing the infamously racist film \u0153The Birth of a \nNation at the White House. In a statement, Mr. Ellison said the movie compares Islam to Nazism, and added that he \nwas disappointed by Sen. Kyls decision to screen it in the Capitol:\n\n\u0153I am a strong advocate of First Amendment free speech.

The City of Helsinki examined the sense of security in the city felt by \nlocals and visitors, and the results are published today, Tuesday. The last such comprehensive assay was made in \n2006.\n\nAnswers from respondents on such matters as the sense of safety they feel in public transport \u201d buses, trams, the \nMetro \u201d were much the same as in 2006.  For example, around 60% felt that travelling on the Metro in the evenings \ncontained either a moderate or strong element of insecurity.  Roughly half had the same views when out and about \nin the city centre after dark, but nearly 80% felt safe in their own residential area regardless of the time of day.\n\nWhat was new and surprising to the compilers of the study was the residents opinions on the influence of \nimmigrants on city safety.  Of those who felt that things had got worse on the security front, no fewer than 70% \nlisted immigrants as a reason for the development, even though this was not included as a specific alternative on \nthe questionnaire sheet.  Respondents were troubled by the increasing number of immigrants. Immigrants were \nalso associated in the minds of those taking part with crime and disturbances.\n\nThe Citys Johanna Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, project manager at the Safety and Preparedness Co-ordinating Division, reported that \nthe results had surprised the survey team.  She estimated that the recent prominent media coverage of matters \nrelating to immigrants may go some way towards explaining the outcome.  \u0153Whatever the reason, this is such a \nstrong signal of the citys mindset that a good deal of work will have to be done to respond to it, said Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 on \nMonday.  \u0153If we do not intervene in possible problem-areas now, the situation in a couple of years could be very \nserious.\n\nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4 feels it is critically important to avoid a situation where different areas of the city have a starkly different \ntone.  \u0153We do not want problem suburbs in Helsinki, into which people are afraid to go.  Aside from concerns \nabout immigration, the Helsinki residents expressed worries over marginalisation, passive indifference, the lack of \nany sense of community, street violence and the threat of it, the security on public transport, and road safety in \ngeneral.  The survey was taken by 765 Helsinki residents and visitors.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Greece: Escapes and Ladders by Paschos Mandravelis\n\nAccording to a police statement issued in the wake of Wednesdays grenade attack on the premises of an \nimmigrant support network in Exarchia, the suspects left the scene in a vehicle bearing \u0153unregistered [false] \nnumber plates.

Or that he might have thanked the \nBritish taxpayer for writing a blank cheque for his housing, medical treatment and legal fees, despite his being an \nEthiopian with no home or family here. Instead, this latest, lucrative asset to the human rights industry spoke of his \n\u0153betrayal by his \u0153home country \u201d and sued.\n\nWhy did we make this man our problem? Seemingly for both diplomatic and humanitarian reasons. David Miliband \ntold me this week that he felt it would have been harsh to abandon a man whose temporary residency expired while \nhe was in detention \u201d even though he left Britain for Afghanistan eight years ago. It is generous to see this man as \nour responsibility. But it is disingenuous of the Government to suggest, simultaneously, that its conduct has been \nwhiter than white.\n\nhttp://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/camilla_cavendish/article5811310.ece\n\n\nMr Mohamed is an Ethiopian whose asylum application was refused in 1994 but was later granted leave to remain \n(a routine ploy to cover up our sham removals policy). His various accounts of why he went to Pakistan and \nAfghanistan are laughable. Yet he was detained without trial for seven years, an outrage to justice. And there \nseems little doubt that he was tortured. possibly with tacit British agreement. His claims that Britain was complicit in \nhis rendition by the US to Morocco and Afghanistan were given force by yesterdays astonishing admission by the \nDefence Secretary that Britain had handed two terror suspects to the US for interrogation in Afghanistan in 2004. \nThe Government has previously denied any part in extraordinary rendition. What other guilty secrets is it hiding?\n\nThe truth is that both government and human rights groups have taken liberties with reality. The only people to have \nprofited are evil-doers and scroungers.\n\nThe government finds itself boxed into a very uncomfortable corner by the Human Rights Act, the human rights \nlobby and its duty to protect us from terrorism. The Human Rights Act has forced ministers to protect foreigners who \nhate us, at taxpayers expense. So we cannot return anyone who might face torture, hostility or even substandard \nmedicine. The human rights lobby has made a mockery of asylum law and the Geneva Convention, leaving us \ntrapped in endless deportation battles. And as a consequence the Government has distorted fundamental principles \nof justice to protect national security.\n\nBecause those people might threaten our own citizens, we have suspended our 400-year-old rule of habeas corpus \nto incarcerate some without trial. One is Abu Qatada, who arrived here on a false passport in 1993 and whose \ndeportation to Jordan was finally sanctioned by the law lords last week. Six countries have warned that he is \ndangerous. It would surely have been better to have sent him to Jordan for trial, than to have keep him interned. But \nhe will continue to escape justice: he will fight for many more years on legal aid.\n\nThere have there been similar contortions over torture. For three years ministers have been busily winning \nassurances from countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Algeria that deportees will not be mistreated. Amnesty \nInternational regards these \u0153memoranda of understanding as worthless. The effective prohibition on deportation \nhas driven ministers to a dishonest compromise.\n\nThis compromise does not bother some other countries that are signatories to the European Convention on Human \nRights. France has been happily deporting terror suspects to Algeria for years. It does not regard the possibility of \ntorture at one remove as seriously as it would regard torture carried out by its own operatives.\n\nSome see that as pragmatic. Others believe that exposing someone to the risk of torture by others is as \nreprehensible as carrying it out. That is the official position of the British Government. But that implies four things. \nFirst, the memoranda of understanding cannot be used. Second, terror suspects cannot be removed, so should be \nfreed from legal limbo and given UK citizenship. Third, even the faintest sniff of British complicity with American-\nsponsored torture is abhorrent and must be outed. Ministers cannot pretend to find torture wholly abhorrent while \nadmitting to collusion in rendition.\n\nThese three things lead to a fourth. We must accept that we will henceforth rely on the Americans, the French and \nothers to do the dirty work of saving some British lives. I say this because, although the argument is sometimes \nmade that torture does not work, my conversations with security people over the years suggest otherwise. The \nHouse of Lords neatly pointed up this reality when it ruled that information that might have been provided under \ntorture is inadmissable in court, but that governments can use that information if it could save lives.\n\nThe world is not as international law would like it to be.

According to some schools of \nmedia ethics, leaving out basic information like the identity of the \u0153who amounts to uninformative reporting on the \none hand, or deliberate deception on the other.\n\nMoreover, omitting a persons name from a story can also leave readers wondering exactly what facts the reporter \nactually has in hand, and what may be conjecture.\n\nWhile there are many 32-year-old German women in Sweden for example, there is only one Christine Sch\u00fcrrer.\n\nBut Britt B\u00f6rjesson, a professor of media ethics at Gothenburg University, explains that the practice has more to do \nwith Swedish culture than any attempt to alter the truth or muddy the facts.\n\n\u0153Sweden is a small country with a small language and with a tradition of reaching consensus, she says.\n\n\u0153Its something in our culture. When television stations or newspapers step over the line [in naming suspects], \nreaders react and complain that its not ethical.\n\nAccording to B\u00f6rjesson, the practice of not publishing suspects names began as an effort to protect young people \naccused of less serious offences from long-term public ridicule.\n\n\u0153The point was to give them a chance to come back and become good citizens again, she says, adding there is a \nsense in Sweden that keeping criminals personal details confidential not only helps against recidivism, but also aids \nin defendants receiving a fair trial.\n\nWhile Sweden does have laws protecting individuals from defamation, suits by people claiming that newspapers \nhave violated the law are rare.\n\nMoreover, there are no provisions in Swedish law specifically prohibiting newspapers from publishing suspects \nnames.\n\n\u0153Its not illegal. We just think its an expression of proper journalistic ethics, says B\u00f6rjesson.\n\nThe two main sections of Swedish legislation outlining press freedoms primarily address protecting free speech, \nand Swedens law on personal data protection has exceptions for details published for journalistic purposes.\n\nBut the slim chance of facing retribution in a court of law hasnt kept most Swedish dailies from erring on the side of \ncaution when deciding whether or not to publish names, as instructed by the set of rules outlining accepted \njournalistic practice in Sweden.\n\nThe rules stem from an early attempt at self-regulation first developed by Swedens National Press Club \n(Publicistklubben \u201d PK) back in 1923.\n\n\n\nIn 1965, the Swedish Union of Journalists (Svenska Journalistf\u00f6rbundet) formally adopted a code of professional \nconduct, with the Press Ombudsman (Allm\u00e4nhetens Pressombudsman \u201d PO) being added in 1969 to help \nadjudicate cases when newspapers were suspected of failing to live up to the ethics code.\n\nThe codes provisions on publishing names are quite clear, admonishing journalists to exercise extreme vigilance.\n\n\u0153Give careful consideration to the harmful consequences that might ensue for persons if their names are \npublished. Refrain from publishing names if it might cause harm unless it is obviously in the public interest, reads \none section of the code, known as \u0153The Rules of the Game (Spelregler).\n\nOther clauses emphasize the importance of not \u0153violating the privacy of individuals and refraining from subjecting \nindividuals to undue publicity \u0153unless the public interest obviously demands public scrutiny.\n\nB\u00f6rjesson likens Swedens press ethics rules to a protocol, the interpretation of which fluctuates over time and \nwhich has evolved over decades of discussion in newsrooms and in society at large.\n\nResponsibility for maintaining the code rests with a joint committee consisting of the union, the press club, the \nNewspapers Publishers Association (Tidningsutgivarna), and the Magazine Publishers Association (Sveriges \nTidskrifter).\n\nBut while the interpretation of the rules may change, the wording of the rules is rarely altered.\n\n\u0153Their meaning and how they are interpreted can change without changing the actual wording of the rules, says \nB\u00f6rjesson.\n\nShe points to the mid-1980s as a time when the pendulum had perhaps swung the farthest away from publishing \nthe names of criminal suspects.\n\nSo strong was the resistance among Swedish newspaper editors toward publishing names that they refused to \nname Christer Pettersson, the man suspected of committing one of the biggest crimes in the countrys history \u201d the \nmurder of then-Prime Minister Olof Palme.\n\n\u0153No one published the name of Palmes suspected killer until the start of his trial, which was months after hed been \narrested, explain B\u00f6rjesson, adding that the decision by Swedish papers to finally publish Petterssons name was \nnews in and of itself.\n\nSince then, publishers have relaxed a bit in their interpretation of the press ethics rules.\n\n\u0153Today we print the names and identities of some criminals, usually particularly vicious criminals who are a danger \nto society. But still, we withhold the identities in most cases, says B\u00f6rjesson.\n\nB\u00f6rjesson also questions how much value Swedes place on learning a suspects name.\n\n\u0153What would we do with that information anyway? Its not interesting, she explains.\n\n\u0153Why should we care? As a reader, I dont need to know.\n\nShe admits, however, that there are cases where knowing the name of a suspect is relevant, such as a case \ninvolving a teacher at a local school or an offence committed in ones own neighbourhood.\n\n\u0153But in those cases, there are other ways to get that information for anyone who is interested, explained \nB\u00f6rjesson, pointing to Swedens strong tradition of openness with public documents.\n\n\n\nSweden is considered the first country in the world to have enacted modern freedom of information legislation with \nits Press Freedom Act of 1766.\n\nThe act served as the genesis of that what is commonly referred to today as \u0153offentlighetsprincipen (\u02dcThe Principle \nof Public Access) which stipulates that \u0153every Swedish citizen has the right to access public documents, according \nto the current constitution.\n\nThe constitution also guarantees that people who leak confidential documents to the media are protected from \ncriminal charges.\n\nWhats more, its the person who undertakes any effort to unmask the identity of a leaker that may instead be subject \nto prosecution.\n\nB\u00f6rjesson believes that Swedens tradition of openness is part of the reason why publishers resist printing names, \nand part of the reason why Swedes are so willing to accept the omission.\n\nBefore the advent of the internet, publishers of Swedens morning newspapers had a special role in the \ndissemination of information to the public. They were, according to B\u00f6rjesson, \u0153journalistic guides for the whole \nindustry and the country.\n\nHowever, as it has become easier to get information from other sources on the internet, the status of newspaper \neditors had been somewhat diminished.\n\nBut that hasnt stopped some editors, like Thorbj\u00f6rn Larsson at Dagens Nyheter, from sticking to traditional ethical \nprinciples, even if the practical effect is limited.\n\n\u0153The argument that \u02dcits on the internet, so we should print it has been around for 15 years and has yet to gain any \ntraction, explains B\u00f6rjesson.\n\nAs a result, Swedish newspapers can exercise a great deal of discretion when it comes to deciding what to publish.\n\nAccording to Daniel Westman, an expert on IT-law at Stockholm University, the new media landscape poses a \nnumber of challenges for Swedens press freedom rules.\n\nHe believes its time to consider a facelift for both the journalists code of ethics and Swedish law.\n\n\u0153Suddenly we have a situation where publishers should also look at what sort of information other newspapers or \nindividual websites have published with respect to personal information, he says.\n\n\u0153Currently, the degree to which a publisher is responsible for looking at what others are doing when making his or \nher own decisions about what to publish hasnt been dealt with satisfactorily.\n\nHe adds however, that no matter what sort of new rules Sweden eventually puts in place, they may ultimately have \nlittle impact.\n\n\u0153If everyone can easily publish information on the internet via servers placed in other countries, then it may \neventually not matter which of Swedens rules apply because there will be limits to how they can be enforced, he \nsaid.\n\n\n\n\u0153At some point, everything will end up on the internet if someone wants it there.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Why the CIA Has to Spy on Britain\n\nOn the night of the Mumbai attacks I spoke to an old security source of mine, who has friends in SIS, MI5 and \ndefence intelligence. There was only one thought on the minds of our security chiefs that night: \u02dcAre they British?\n\nIn the bar of the Travellers Club and the pubs and tapas restaurants of Vauxhall Bridge Cross, drink was taken in \ndouble and treble measures amid grim assumption that the terrorists would turn out to have links to the UK. It was a \nfair assumption since, where international terrorism is concerned, Britain is no longer part of the solution; we are \npart of the problem. Where once we exported football hooligans, now we are among the worlds most prolific \nsuppliers of Islamist extremists. Mercifully, the Mumbai terrorists had no discernible link to the UK. But as the \nindustrial-scale intelligence arse-covering exercise groaned into action that day, no one would have been surprised \nto discover that another suicidal cell of British militants had slipped through the net.\n\nServing and former intelligence officers on both sides of the Atlantic say that the UKs status as a hotbed of militancy \nand an exporter of terror means that obtaining intelligence, once a by-product of good international relations, has \nbecome a goal as much as an instrument of foreign policy. Take one recent example, the case of Binyam \nMohamed, the British resident recently returned from Guantanamo Bay. Trying to discern the truth from David \nMilibands public pronouncements on the affair has been a little like preparing an intelligence assessment \u201d the \npublicly available facts are sketchy and the true motives of the participants are concealed behind layers of cant, \nhypocrisy and not a little squirming embarrassment. The foreign secretary allowed critics to assume he is lying \nwhen he claimed the US threatened to cut off intelligence-sharing if the full details of the torture meted out to Mr \nMohamed in a CIA black prison were laid bare in the High Court. Mr Miliband was more content with the suggestion \n(accurate as it happens) that he was concealing evidence of British complicity in the interrogations rather than admit \nthat British intelligence has become dependent to an unprecedented and embarrassing degree on the CIA, a \nrelationship he could ill afford to threaten\u00a6\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: Tuan Jim [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Croatia: Full Support for EU Adhesion From Paris\n\n(ANSAmed) \u201d PARIS, FEBRUARY 19 \u201d \u02dcFull support from France over Croatias adhesion to the European Union \nwas expressed today by Prime Minister Francois Fillon during a meeting with his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader, \nwith the hope that Zagreb would participate \u02dcas a full member in the NATO summit in April.

The tough talk comes from Peter \nJacob, national secretary of the National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP), speaking about the agreement \nbetween the local government and the Taliban. It allows the introduction of sharia \u201d Islamic law \u201d in exchange for a \nceasefire in the district of Malakan, which includes the Swat valley, in the northwest part of the country on the \nborder with Afghanistan. The agreement was signed yesterday by the government of the North-West Frontier \nProvince (NWFP) and the Taliban militia group Tahrik-e-Nifaz Shariat Muhammadi (TNSM).\n\n\u0153We think that the more space we will give to fundamentalism, the more they will try to gain from this strategy, \nPeter Jacob stresses to AsiaNews. He recently returned from a visit to the NWFP, and emphasizes that the \nagreement \u0153is a tactical step of the provincial government to resolve Islamic militancy in Swat. The human rights \nactivist met with various local political leaders, and explains that \u0153sharia is an emergency medicine to resolve the \nsituation of tension, but if this does not produce the desired results, \u0153there will be strict action against militants \nthere.\n\nPeter Jacob says, however, that he is sure that the areas where Islamic law is introduced will not see a Taliban \nregime like the previous one in Afghanistan, because the ruling liberal Awami National Party is confident about the \nagreement. \u0153But of course as the result of sharia law implementation, the first casualties would be women and \nreligious minorities, because the freedom of women and other faiths would not be tolerated.\n\nAccording to the latest information, the delegation of the TSNM, headed by the leader Sufi Muhammad, has come \nto the Swat valley to verify that the peace agreements are being respected. During his stay in the area, mullah Sufi \nMuhammad will try to convince the mullah Fazlullah \u201d head of the Taliban militias in the Swat \u201d to lay down his \nweapons in exchange for the introduction of Islamic law.\n\nPakistani president Asif Ali Zardari has not yet signed the document ratifying the peace agreement: he will sign it \nonly after it has been ascertained that the ceasefire is being respected in the Swat, in the district of Malakand, and \nin the areas that have recently seen fighting between the military and the militias.\n\nThe North-West Frontier Province has for some time been the theater of a massive campaign by the Taliban, who \nwant to introduce sharia and Islamic courts. The Swat valley fell into the hands of the Taliban in the autumn of \n2007; the army immediately launched a vast offensive to regain control of the territory. An initial agreement, which \nprovided for the introduction of sharia, never went into effect.

On Wednesday, the TV network MTV3 sought out the opinions of all of the government \nparty groups on the reasons why immigration has \u0153exploded. \u0153The more Finns can be kept at work for a longer \ntime, the easier immigration can be kept under control, Kalli said.

He denied that he had meant to suggest that immigration \nwould be somehow undesirable, adding that there must be \u0153as many work-based immigrants as needed.
