{"title": "MORE COUPLES MARRYING TO TRY TO AVOID DEPORTATION", "body": "\nWith an April 1 deportation deadline looming, marriage bureaus are being swamped with couples who are either \nreally in love or just in love with America.\n\nHundreds of sweating, edgy couples, some holding hands, waited in a stifling hot corridor of Manhattan's city-run \nmarriage office recently to get a $ 30 license that for some holds the key to freedom.\n\nAs tempers exploded around them, overwhelmed security guards blocked the door that leads to the red-carpeted \nmarriage \"chapel\" as the horde pushed and screamed to get ahead.\n\n\" 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!\" a woman who gave up yelled above the mix of foreign languages as she escaped through \na sea of Sikh turbans, dreadlocks, saris and even a few corsage-adorned, white wedding dresses.\n\nThe tougher immigration laws make it easier to deport illegal aliens unless they can prove that being forced to \nleave would result in \"exceptional and unusual hardship\" to a family member who is an American citizen or \npermanent legal resident.\n\nThe overall crackdown on immigration also might have something to do with the surge. With federal benefits being \ncut off even for legal noncitizens, people in the country on temporary visas apparently feel that marrying a citizen \nor legal resident will put them on safer ground.\n\nMarriage to a citizen does not guarantee legal residency. Couples must prove later to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service that they are together for real - an ordeal that prompts some to carry photo albums and love \nletters into their interviews.\n\nAmid such hopes and fears, the number of weddings in immigrant communities is soaring. In Manhattan last month, \nthere were 2,109 marriages, an 88 percent increase over the same time last year.\n\nIn the Miami area, 2,532 marriage certificates were issued last month, up from 1,973 from January of last year.\n"}
