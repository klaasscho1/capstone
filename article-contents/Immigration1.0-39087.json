{"title": "This Land is Our Land: America's Diversity is One of its Greatest Strengths, Especially in Congress.", "body": "\nAIN Update\n\nIn a tweet posted Sunday, July 14, the president suggested that several progressive Democratic congresswomen \n\"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" before they proceed with \nrecommendations on how to fix America.\n\nThe group of congresswomen to which he can be assumed to be referencing, due to their recent dominance of the \ncongressional news cycle, includes Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; Alexandria Ocasio-\nCortez, D-N.Y.; and Rashida Tlaib D-Mich.\nOf these women, only one, Rep. Omar, was born outside of this country. All of the women mentioned are citizens of \nthe United States.\n\nTo dismiss the ideas of the people's elected representatives based on their ethnicity or race is antithetical to the \nvery core of America's system of government. The House of Representatives is a system created to represent the \ngreat diversity of this country's population. Claiming that these elected congresswomen should not be participating \nin governing discussions due to their race or ethnicity runs counter to America's founding principles.\n\nThe president's statement should not be entertained, tolerated or dismissed. Representatives, senators and other \nelected officials and public servants, regardless of party affiliation, need to address the concerning racist \nundertones of this remark and work to reaffirm America's commitment to protect, respect and be a home to all of its \ncitizens.\n\nThe post This Land is Our Land: America's Diversity is One of its Greatest Strengths, Especially in Congress. \nappeared first on R Street.\n"}
