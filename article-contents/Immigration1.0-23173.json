It is not thanks to Doug Ford \nthat Ontario is soon to become a financial wasteland, rather it was 15 years of reckless Liberal spending that has \nbrought Ontario to its knees. Civic esplanade or not, people like Mr Weeks need to get their facts straight and stop \nblaming Doug Ford for having to clean up another Liberal disaster.\n\nJason Martin, Belle River\n\nShare Your Views\n\nSend letters to the editor to letters@windsorstar.com( letters@windsorstar.com ).
