{"title": "'Pit Bull' of the House Latches On to Immigration", "body": "\nRepresentative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. has no tolerance for illegal immigrants, either in his political life or \npersonal life.\n\n  ''My housekeeper in Wisconsin was born in Wisconsin,'' says Mr. Sensenbrenner, the Republican congressman \nand chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. ''My housekeeper here is a naturalized U.S. citizen from \nNicaragua.''\n\n Mr. Sensenbrenner is so loath to risk dealing with illegal immigrants that when his Cadillacs need cleaning, he \nprefers do-it-yourself car washes that require tokens. ''They don't have Montezuma's picture on the front of them,'' \nMr. Sensenbrenner says of the tokens.\n\n  He is sitting in his Capitol Hill office dominated by two life-size portraits of himself. He looms heavily here, as he \ndoes in the thick of the national debate over immigration in which he has defied President Bush's plans for reform \nand arguably holds more sway than anyone else in Congress. A bipartisan irritant from a state nowhere near the \nMexican border, he has outsize influence on the fate of the country's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.\n\n  In each portrait in his office, Mr. Sensenbrenner appears regal and contented -- in contrast to the rumpled and fed-\nup image he conveys in real life. He is commonly described as ''prickly,'' ''cantankerous'' and ''unpleasant.'' And this \nis by his friends.\n\n  ''I would describe Jim as -- what's a nice word -- how about 'idiosyncratic'?'' says Representative Dan Lungren, a \nCalifornia Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \n\n  Mr. Lungren equates Mr. Sensenbrenner's leadership to something the Green Bay Packer guard Jerry Kramer \nsaid about his coach Vince Lombardi. ''He treats us all equally,'' Mr. Lungren says of Mr. Sensenbrenner. ''He treats \nus all like dogs.''\n\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner, 63, can be neutrally described as a Washington piece of work -- a big-bellied curmudgeon \nwith a taste for old Caddies, pontoon boats and enormous cigars. He is equally at home discussing policy minutiae \nor the details of his Dalmatian's recent intestinal problems. His honking voice and Upper Midwestern enunciations \nmake him one of the most mimicked politicians on Capitol Hill. (''Noooo interviews in the hallway'' is a familiar \nrefrain as he blows past reporters.)\n\n  One could dismiss him as something of a cartoon, except that Mr. Sensenbrenner has been a feared and vital \ncharacter in some defining political dramas, like the Clinton impeachment, the passage of the USA Patriot Act and \n\n\nthe current legislative donnybrook over immigration, an issue that he calls his toughest in nearly four decades of \npublic life. \n\n  He has approached the matter with characteristic stubbornness, righteousness and, of course, brusqueness. He \ndelights in placing himself above the chummy niceties of Washington. (On the subject of his crotchety nature, he \nsmiles big and becomes almost giddy -- most unSensenbrenner-like.) \n\n  His conservative populism and maverick tendencies play well in a state that has elected political outliers including \nSenators Joseph R. McCarthy and William Proxmire. They also suit the solidly Republican district outside \nMilwaukee that first elected Mr. Sensenbrenner in 1978.\n\n  But he does not always suit the House Republican leadership, many Senate Republicans and the Bush White \nHouse. He has been the chief promoter of the House's ''enforcement first'' approach to immigration overhaul, \nemphasizing border security, criminal penalties for illegal immigrants and sanctions against employers who hire \nthem. The president and the Senate have favored a package that offers illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.\n\n  In recent weeks, Mr. Sensenbrenner has refused to yield on anything, derided what he calls the ''amnesty'' of the \nSenate bill and warned that he is willing to walk away without a compromise. He says his views have been \ninfluenced by the flood of immigration-related cases coming through his office and what he sees as the failure of \nprevious immigration reform efforts he has worked on.\n\n  He is known as one of the toughest negotiators in Congress, which invites another canine metaphor from a \ncolleague. ''Sensenbrenner is a pit bull,'' says Representative Ric Keller, a Florida Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee. ''And the Senate negotiators he's up against are wearing Milk-Bone underwear.''\n\n  During a 50-minute interview that feels, at times, like a lecture, Mr. Sensenbrenner says:\n\n  ''You have to be prickly to prod people into accomplishing something.''\n\n  ''I've adopted a philosophy of telling it like it is.''\n\n  ''I've been referred to  as a difficult child.''\n\n  ''If you go along to get along, you don't get anything accomplished.''\n\n  For as much as Mr. Sensenbrenner decries the impulse to ''go along to get along,'' he also pays close attention to \nwhat is said about him. This is underscored by how wary colleagues are of speaking on the record about him. \n\n  Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who has been mentioned as a possible successor as Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, said he would gladly talk about Mr. Sensenbrenner. But later, a spokeswoman for Mr. Smith \ncalled to demur, saying, ''It's not the right time for us to comment.''\n\n  To a surprising degree, Democrats on the committee praise Mr. Sensenbrenner for his fairness, efficiency and \nwillingness to heed the concerns of the minority party. He has also been lauded for spearheading an extension of \nthe Voting Rights Act.\n\n  ''The House leadership has relied on me to do some very difficult jobs over the years,'' says Mr. Sensenbrenner, \nwho served as a House manager during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial and whose six-year stint heading \nthe Judiciary Committee will end in January.\n\n  He clearly enjoys being a high-profile committee chairman -- even his wife of 29 years, Cheryl, calls him Mr. \nChairman (''but only when she's mad at me,'' he says).\n\n  He is easily annoyed when his authority is disregarded. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for instance, \nrecently promoted a compromise immigration plan that would have focused on enforcement and border security \n\n\n\nfirst, then carry out the more contentious changes. Asked about the McCain proposal, Mr. Sensenbrenner stares \nblankly and flips his hand dismissively. \n\n  ''McCain has not called me to propose that,'' he says, even though the notion had been widely discussed on \nCapitol Hill. It is as if no such possibility could exist until the House chairman was personally informed of it. \n\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner goes on to say that he has no relationship with Mr. McCain, with whom he served two terms in \nthe House in the 1980's. ''There's some senators who come back from whence they came, and McCain is not one \nof them,'' Mr. Sensenbrenner says. ''When he left, we never saw him again.''\n\n  ''I deal with Specter,'' he adds, referring to Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n  When asked what it is like to negotiate with Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Specter pauses for several seconds. Then he \nsays, ''He is a lot more cordial in person than his reputation.'' \n\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner projects the self-assurance of a lucky man. He reaped a fortune from a great-grandfather who \ninvented the Kotex sanitary napkin. He won $250,000 in 1997 on a lottery ticket he purchased while buying beer. \nHe lists assets of almost $11 million, according to public filings.\n\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner was born in Chicago, graduated from Stanford University and, while at college, worked as an \naide to aRepublican congressman. After earning a law degree, he began an uninterrupted political career that \nstarted in the Wisconsin Assembly and landed him in the United States House of Representatives at age 35.\n\n  Not given to navel gazing, he prefers, he says, to spend time on his pontoon boat on a Wisconsin lake, smoking \nbehemoth cigars imported from Honduras or the Dominican Republic. The family Dalmatian, Solomon -- also known \nas Stinky -- comes along, too.\n\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner concludes with an aside about Stinky -- specifically, the case of giardia that the dog picked up \na few weeks ago, which requires Mr. Sensenbrenner to force-feed Stinky four pills a day. This is not easy. \n\n  But the chairman says he picked up a strategy from a guy he met in the beer tent of a church festival. He places \nthe pills in the dog's throat, and blows in his face. Stinky then swallows them. ''I'd never tried that before, blowing in \na dog's face,'' Mr. Sensenbrenner marvels.\n\n  He has never tried it with a senator, either. ''I have given them pills that don't taste very good,'' he says. ''I've done \nthat.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: Representative F.
