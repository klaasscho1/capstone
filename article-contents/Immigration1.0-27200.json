{"title": "Area Immigrants Sending Food to Home Countries; International Shortages and Price Increases Prompt Micro-Level Relief", "body": "\nJovy Mark showed up at Manila Oriental, a Falls Church grocery that doubles as an agent for Filipino shipping \ncompanies, lugging two hefty boxes destined for relatives in the Philippines. Inside: Four 25-pound bags of \nJapanese rice, purchased at a Korean supermarket in Virginia and about to make a trip back to Asia.\n\n\"They are really short of rice over there,\" said Mark, 59, a nanny who lives in Manassas. \"My brother said the [price \nof] rice is going up. So what I did, I said, 'All right, I'll look for rice that is cheaper over here.' \"\n\nAs the United Nations met in Rome last week to discuss shortages and high prices of food and international \ncharities scramble to help the nations hardest-hit by the global food crisis, some immigrants in the United States \nare providing their own version of food aid. They are paying to have provisions delivered to hungry relatives at \nhome.\n\nFilipinos in the Washington region say the unthinkable has become fairly common in recent months: Migrants are \nstuffing sacks of rice into care packages known as balikbayan boxes and shipping them to the Philippines, where \nshortages have led to soaring prices and rationing. Area immigrants from Haiti, where skyrocketing prices have \nsparked riots, are boosting orders of food from U.S.-based money transfer agents. The orders are plucked from the \nshelves of warehouses in Haiti and delivered to recipients within hours.\n\nThese blips on the global food shipment landscape, of course, are not going to lift poor nations out of crisis. In \ninterviews, immigrants from several countries said most of their compatriots are sending more money, if \nanything, to help relatives deal with food costs.\n\n\"That would be too expensive!\" said Celestin Njibeck, about shipping food to his native Cameroon, where high \nprices have also triggered civil unrest. He was rolling napkins at the Silver Spring restaurant he manages, which is \nstruggling with food cost problems. Njibeck is considering raising menu prices.\n\n\nIn fact, the Filipino and Haitian food deliveries say more about country-specific systems to transfer immigrant \nearnings than about shortages in those nations. Remittance researchers say immigrants from nearly all countries \nsend money home, a flow estimated to be as much as $300 billion a year, most of which is used to buy food. Only \nsome immigrant groups also have well-established systems for the transfers of goods, said Manuel Orozco, a \nremittance expert at Georgetown University.\n\nAmong them is the Filipino practice of sending 23-by-20-by-17-inch boxes packed with U.S. products, which are \ntypically shipped for a flat rate of about $100 no matter what's stuffed inside. Another is the Haitian food transfer \nsystem, a method experts say has never taken off in other nations. Both are now facilitating family-level food aid.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Jimmy Alazi paid $107 at Taptap Inc. on Georgia Avenue in the District, a one-desk office \nwhere Haitian expatriates can select from a product list that includes 24 cans of tomato paste ($42) and one live \ngoat ($76). Alazi had chosen basics for friends in Port-au-Prince: 55 pounds of rice, three gallons of cooking oil, 25 \npounds of black beans, 20 packets of spaghetti and 27.5 pounds of sugar.\n\n\"When you send money they can use it for other things,\" said Alazi, 38, a Fort Washington insurance agent. \"I want \nthem to eat.\"\n\nAt Esther Express, a Silver Spring agent for the Haitian remitter Unitransfer, food transfers have doubled in the \npast three months, owner Rony Pierre said. At Taptap, an agent for the Miami-based Caribbean AirMail, food \ntransfers have tripled in that time, according to owner John Boursiquot.\n\n\"Almost 90 percent of the people that come here, they say people are hungry, so they have to send food instead of \ncash,\" said Boursiquot, who counts himself among those driving the trend. On Monday, instead of transferring the \n$300 he usually sends to relatives in the southern city of Jacmel, he sent $100 in cash and $200 worth of \ncomestibles.\n\nOfficials at Forex, a top Filipino shipping company based in Alexandria, began noticing more rice in balikbayan \nboxes earlier this year. So the company launched a special offer to \"demonstrate our social conscience,\" said \nfounder Jaime Cari\u00c3\u00b1o: For a limited time, immigrants in the United States can ship 25-pound bags of rice -- no \nneed for a box -- for $15 each. About 1,200 bags have been sent each month for the past three months, the \ncompany said.\n\nIf sending rice to the Philippines rings of carrying coals to Newcastle, some Filipino community groups agree. The \nNational Federation of Filipino American Associations is encouraging immigrants to send money instead, noting \nthat although rice is expensive in the Philippines, it is available.\n\nBesides, rice prices have shot up stateside. A 25-pound bag of the Thai jasmine rice preferred by Filipinos hovers \naround $20, up from about $12.75 six weeks ago. And shipments take at least a month to arrive (although when \nthey do, the deliveryman snaps a photo of the happy recipient with the box and mails it to the sender).\n\nBut to those sending rice, it makes a certain sort of inevitable sense. The Philippines is the world's biggest importer \nof rice, which accompanies three meals a day and sometimes serves as a snack. Rice is \"like a religion,\" Manila \nOriental shopper Rudy Mendoza said. Nearby hung a poster pitching the Forex special, which exhorted shoppers in \nTagalog to \"Help the Rice Crisis in the Philippines.\"\n\nMost customers deem it more economical to send rice in balikbayan boxes, said the store's food service manager, \nChristie Zerrudo. She is preparing a box of clothes and canned goods, anchored by two 25-pound bags of jasmine \nrice. It will be a surprise for her brother, who operates a tricycle-for-hire in Manila and who recently told her the rice \navailable there tastes bad.\n\n\"It just breaks my heart. I said, 'Don't eat it,' \" Zerrudo said. \"I told them, 'I'll send you a bag of rice.' \"\n\n\n\nMaila Mabolo, a chef who lives in Suitland, has sent two installments of rice to Manila. Her brothers complained \nthat government-subsidized rice, which is rationed and offered at about 20 cents per pound, gives them \nstomachaches. Better-quality commercial rice goes for more than twice as much.\n\n\"My brothers are going to the line for three hours, and they will get only three kilos,\" said Mabolo, 37, as she piled \nboxes of mangoes into her trunk outside Manila Oriental. \"I'm not going to let my brothers struggle, doing like that.\"\n\nFor Arnedo Valera, a Fairfax lawyer and executive director of the Migrant Heritage Commission, sending rice is \"a \npolitical statement.\" If Filipino customs agents see it, he explained, they will have yet more evidence that Filipino \nexpatriates, who sent home nearly $15 billion in 2006, are keeping the Philippines humming.\n\nAfter a visit to Haiti in December, when prices were on the rise, Remy Darisme stopped shipping a monthly box of \nfood to Haiti.\n\nHe upgraded to a barrel, which he fills with oil, powdered milk and cereal purchased at Costco. He sends it through \nEsther Express, which also offers a cargo shipping service. In April, as food riots broke out, he dispatched two \nbarrels to friends and relatives.\n\n\"We are here. We've got health. We can work,\" said Darisme, 50, a Silver Spring taxi driver. \"We've got to think \nabout them. \"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE; Photos By Katherine Frey -- The Washington Post; Some immigrants are responding to news of food \nshortages in their home countries not by sending money but by shipping out food.
