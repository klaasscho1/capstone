{"title": "CITY'S STILL GROWING BY POPULAR DEMAND", "body": "\nThere are now 8,084,316 stories in the Naked City.\n\nNew York City's population grew by 76,038 between the 2000 census and last July, estimates from the Census \nBureau released today show.\n\nSuburbs in Orange County and the Hudson Valley reported sharp population gains as commuters went looking for \nless expensive houses.\n\nThe state's population passed the 19 million mark for the first time in history even as upstate cities and counties \ncontinue losing people, according to census estimates.\n\nBuffalo lost 1,965 people for a 0.7% decline, Rochester lost 0.4%, Syracuse 0.3% and Albany 0.2%, according to \nthe census estimates. With 19.16 million people, New York remains the nation's third most populous state, behind \nCalifornia and Texas.\n\nDespite the popular 1950s TV series \"Naked City,\" New York was never a city of 8 million stories until 2000.\n\nThe city's population, reflecting continued immigration and population spurts in Queens and on Staten Island, \ncame in at 8,008,278 in 2000.\n\nRecent figures show that more people are moving out of the city than moving in. But thanks to the rate of births \noutpacing deaths and foreign immigration, the overall population is growing.\n\nThe bureau said three places in Orange County - Kiryas Joel village and the towns of Monroe and Montgomery - \nare the state's fastest-growing municipalities.\n"}
