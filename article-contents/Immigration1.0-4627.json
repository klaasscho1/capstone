{"title": "American Nativism Has 19th-Century Roots", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAnthony Lewis notes that the American \"strain of nativism\" dates back to \"at least the 1850's\" (column, Oct. 3). It \nis rooted even deeper in the psyche and practice of American politics.\n\nOne should note the Naturalization Act of 1798, which increased the residency requirement for citizenship to 14 \nyears from 5, and the Alien and Sedition Acts of the same year, which authorized the deportation of those \nimmigrants who were deemed dangerous to the safety of the country. These acts were subject to the discretion of \nthe executive branch and could be loosely interpreted in the time before a strong judicial branch.\n\nMr. Lewis urges a less ambivalent system for immigration, one separated from party and bureaucracy. But history \nshows that an American immigration policy devoid of political ambiguities and nativist attitudes is a fond hope \nunfounded in reality.\n\n \n\nTIMOTHY M. ROOD\n\nEast Hampton, N.Y., Oct. 3, 1997\n"}
