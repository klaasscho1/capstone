{"title": "U.S. TRIBUNAL GRANTS ASYLUM IN GENITAL MUTILATION CASE", "body": "\nThe highest administrative tribunal in the U.S. immigration system granted political asylum Thursday to a 19-year-\nold woman from Togo who said she had fled from her homeland to escape having her genitals cut off.\n\nThe decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in the case of the woman, Fauziya Kasinga, is the first to \nrecognize the fear of genital mutilation as a legitimate ground for asylum.\nThe rite is practiced on millions of women in 26 African countries.\n\nThe ruling sets a precedent that is binding on the 179 immigration judges across the country. The few who have \nhandled such cases have been divided in their rulings.\n\nThe board, part of the Justice Department, rejected the argument of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nalso part of the department. The immigration service had argued that, although genital mutilation should be a \nreason for asylum in carefully defined circumstances, Kasinga's case should be sent back to an immigration judge \nto consider what the immigration service said were inconsistencies in her story.\n\nImmigration law calls for asylum to be granted to people who can show that they have a well-founded fear of \npersecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group.\n\nThe ruling, written by the chairman, Paul Schmidt, said genital mutilation as practiced by the tribe to which \nKasinga belonged, the Tchamba-Kunsuntu, constituted persecution.\n"}
