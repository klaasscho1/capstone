Paterson pardoned \nyesterday in an effort to save them from deportation.\n\nMario Benitez, 58, the assistant director of finance for City University of New York's Graduate School and University \nCenter, oversees a budget of more than $60 million and is a respected community leader in Riverdale.\n\nBut the native of the Dominican Republic was still considered \"deportable\" under federal immigration law because \nof his 1988 drug conviction. The father of four was overjoyed by news of his pardon.\n\n\"I feel reborn,\" said the ex-Navy man, who earned an accounting degree and passed the CPA exam while serving \nseven years at Attica.\n\n\"If you work hard and do the right thing, good things come your way. I'm very happy.\"\n\nAlso pardoned was Kevin Auyeung, 32, of Brooklyn, who founded a cellular communications company after \nserving a five-year stint for a 1996 robbery.\n\nBecause of his felony conviction, immigration agents placed Auyeung in an immigration detention center in 2006. \nHe was forced to close his thriving business but can legally work again thanks to the pardon.\n\n\"I'm proud of him,\" said Auyeung's father, who bought his son a beginner's computer manual and a Chinese-\nEnglish dictionary to study in prison.\n\nPaterson also issued pardons for Darshini Ramsaran, a former Queens resident who is being held in an \nimmigration detention center; Sanjay Broomfield of Long Island; Marlon Oscar Powell of Westchester County, and \nDeborah Salako-Nation, formerly of Westchester County. He also granted clemency to June Benson, 44, who \nserved 20 years on an accessory-to-rape charge.\n\nPaterson said his pardons were meant to address \"shortcomings\" in inflexible federal immigration laws.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n \n\nGov.
