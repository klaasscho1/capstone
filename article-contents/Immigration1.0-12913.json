{"title": "National Briefing Southwest: Arizona: Criticism Of Border Patrols", "body": "\n     Representative-elect Raul M. Grijalva said he planned to ask for a federal investigation of private groups that \npatrol the Mexican border, trying to deter illegal immigrants. \n\n\"These militia and vigilante groups bring a racist and anti-immigrant perspective,\" Mr. Grijalva, left, said. A \nTombstone newspaper publisher, Chris Simcox, has started a recruitment drive for his border patrol group, Civil \nHomeland Defense. He has denied accusations of racism, saying that the presence of armed civilians on the \nborder is meant to reduce drug dealing and other criminal activity.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto \n"}
