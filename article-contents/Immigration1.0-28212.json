{"title": "California: Pastor Accused In Visa Scheme", "body": "\nImmigration authorities accused a California pastor  of helping foreigners fraudulently obtain student visas and of \nhanding out phony diplomas at a fake graduation ceremony on a campus where they never attended class. The \npastor, Samuel Chai Cho Oh, 65, faces a charge of conspiracy to commit visa fraud for allegedly charging \nforeigners cash to help get them student visas on the premise that they would attend the Christian university he \nowns in Fullerton. But more than 100 students from countries including South Korea and Japan never took classes \nat California Union University, which served as a shell for them to stay in the country legally, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement officials said. The authorities said Mr. Oh received $40,000 to $50,000 a month in the \nscheme. Adriaan F. van der Capellen, Mr. Oh's lawyer, said his client was not guilty. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
