The committee will come to order. Welcome all. I believe we--yeah--yeah, we more than have a \nquorum here, so we are in good shape. And we will now markup H.R. 2500, the National Defense Authorizing Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2020. My opening remarks are going to be mostly procedural, just let everyone know what's coming \nand how we're going to handle it. One thing off the top, we are--Mr. Thornberry and I have agreed we're going to be \non the clock as well so you should start that little thing over there and I will keep-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman, can you get the mic a little closer. We can't hear you. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry. Whenever my back goes out, it seems like the microphone requires me to be as absolutely close \nas is humanly possible. Welcome, as I was saying Mr. Thornberry and I have agreed to be on the clock as well. we \nare going to try to move through this as expeditiously as possible, but I want to emphasize one--one big point. \n\nThis--this committee, I think has an incredibly bipartisan tradition and a tradition of understanding how important it is \nfor us to pass this bill. We work together to get that done and I know we've got a lot of work to do. We want to try to \nget through it but the number one most important thing to me is that we have a fair and open process on--on both \nsides of the aisle. This is a very bipartisan process. I want to keep it that way, which means we may disagree in the \nend. \n\nI mean I think Mr. Thornberry said it best a couple years ago, you will never have a National Defense Authorizing \nAct we're you don't have at least a half-dozen things in it that you really don't like. It's a large bill, that's the nature of \nit. But I want to have open fair debate, go over the amendments. Now you have that vote and sometimes you lose \nthat's the way it goes. But I want to make sure that the process is fair to both sides and to all members. \n\nSo if any point during the process you don't think you know what's going on, you think something's happening that \nhasn't been clearly explained, we will take the time and make sure that we clearly explain it and give you the \nchance to say your piece. Now I will say, just because you have five minutes, doesn't mean that you absolutely \nneed to use five minutes, every single time. We have a lot of amendments. This is going to take a long time. The \nhouse floor is not cooperating because we're going to have a bunch of amendments over there as well. \n\nSo, the extent that we can move through this quickly, you to make your points quickly, that is appreciated. But not--\nnot required. As I said, it's more important to make sure that you feel like you've had the chance to say your piece, \nmake your arguments, and that everyone feels like the process was fair before we vote on the amendments. Now I \nthink this is an incredibly important piece legislation, every single year and as all of you know and have heard we \nhave passed it 58 straight years. It's not often easy but we always get it done and I'm confident we will again this \nyear. \n\n\n\nAnd for all the different little pieces that are in this bill, the things you don't like, the things you're working on, we \nshouldn't lose track of the big picture. Always in this bill there are critically important things, that we all agree on. \nSimple fact, a 3.1 percent pay raise for the troops. If we don't pass our bill, they don't get paid. They don't get that \npay raise. \n\nWe have military construction projects in here that are crucial to probably pretty much all of our districts and much \nof the country and just a couple of issues that I know that we're working on. Sea Power Subcommittee has 11 new \nships including three submarines a year in it that are really important to our National Security on Readiness. We \nhave provisions in there to deal with the housing crisis that I know we've all heard very much about that is affecting \nthe quality of life for our troops to create a tenant Bill of Rights. To get those issues addressed so that our \nservicemembers can feel comfortable that their families are taking care of while they're doing their jobs. And there's \na whole laundry list of other issues that are incredibly important. \n\nAll that set I--I know we have differences you know both on a bipartisan basis and on a partisan basis. We'll debate \nthose differences and we'll get to, I think what a satisfactory endpoint is and create a good piece of legislation, to \ntake care of her troops and meet our national security objectives, so. I look forward to working with all of you and \nwith that, I will yield to the Ranking Member Mr. Thornberry, for his opening's remarks. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I would like to start by thanking you for all of your work to get us to \nthis point and for what you just said about a commitment to a bipartisan fair process. Sometimes it's frustrating, \nsometimes it's long, sometimes it's messy, but that is democracy. I understand that transitions are not easy. That--\nand--and I certainly understand even after 58 straight years of getting it done that doesn't mean it's easy to pull all \nof this together. \n\nAnd--and I want to start by--by thanking you for all that you for all that you have done to get us to this point. I also \nwant to just take a minute to thank members. One of the advantages of sitting in one of these two seats is you get \nto sit through all the hearing, and all the briefings, and hear all the questions, comments, that come from members. \nAnd--and I have to say it is all--it is all just about without exception encouraging to me. Because I think we have \nsome tremendous talent in the members who have been added to this committee. I know that there are perceptive, \nsincere efforts to try to understand what's best for the country and best for the troops. Some very good suggestions \nhave been made and--and so I appreciate the--what members have done to get us to this point. \n\nSeveral of us had the opportunity last week to go to Normandy for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day celebration. In \nbetween events, we had the opportunity to go to a museum, where there was a temporary exhibit of Norman \nRockwell paintings focused on the four freedoms. And in just a second, I hope in that one of the posters that I've \nfound over in the corner will come up. This is something Rockwell painted it in the midst of World War II. It says \nobviously Let's give them Enough and On Time. As you can see his torn shirt as he's manning his machine gun in \nthe war. That's our job. Giving him enough and on time. \n\nAnd as the chairman outlined, we have been able to do that together. I went back and did a little research. I only \nwent back 30 years. But in 24 out of that 30 years, three members or fewer, opposed final passage of our bill. One \nyear in 1991, there were 12 members opposed. But in the vast majority, it wasn't just bipartisan, it has been \noverwhelming. \n\nAnd--and again, we should not take that for granted, that's not easy. That requires both sides bending, \ncompromising, trying to find a way forward together, rather than standing on a presumably perfect bill. As chairman \nsaid, I've never been happy with any of the bills that I voted for and 25 years here, including the ones with my \nname. But I think the--the overwhelming desire to--to be together and what we do has overcome our differences. \n\nI've got to confess at the beginning, I have some worry of the possibility of a partisan outcome this year. There's no \nsurprise about some of my concerns involving topline, a lot of the strategic deterrence issues, going too far on the \nborder, Gitmo, etc., we'll debate some of those. But I guess the real point I want to make is we have a chance to \nstay together. We have a chance to make this bill better. We have a chance to come up with not at 57 to 0 \noutcome, maybe 55 to 2 or--or something like that. And as we go through the day, I just want to encourage \n\n\n\nmembers to bend over, lean into the ability for us to come together. This is a high calling. This has a strong tradition \nof doing that and I hope we can fulfill that tradition this year with our responsibility. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you, appreciate that and I was remiss in my opening remarks. I wanted to thank the ranking \nmember, not just for his work this year, but for his four years as chairman and he set the tone, in terms be working \nin a bipartisan way towards getting the bill done. So, I appreciate that working relationship a great deal. \n\nSo, before we begin, I've got some preliminary announcements. To sort of lay out the rules for how we go forward \nand then we will get started. The order of consideration for today's markup will follow our subcommittee structure. \nWe'll begin with the first--the subject matter falls under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on Tactical Error Land \nForces, then on Intelligence and Emerging Threats, Sea Power, Readiness, Military Personnel, Strategic Forces, \nand Then the Full Committee. \n\nIf a member has an amendment that involves the jurisdiction of other committees, we request that that member \nbefore he or she offers the amendment, have a letter from the respective committee chair indicating that their \nwaiver of that right of referral. I oppose the same requirement before including language in the underlying mark. I \nremind members that this approach has been the practice of the committee for many years. It is done so that we \ncan proceed directly to the house floor, without our being sequentially referred to other committees. \n\nAlso, it is the practice of this committee that amendments involving additional spending must identify suitable \noffsets. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. \n\nTHORNBERRY: I--after consulting carefully with the parliamentarians, it--I must object to the last sentence that you \nread. I do not--because they tell us if we don't object now, then there is an implied unanimous consent. \n\nSMITH: Fair. \n\nTHORNBERRY: So, I do--I object to the last sentence that you read. I--there is not agreement on that this year. You \nand I have talked about a variety of the reasons for that, which we can go into as you want. But at this point I think it \nis essential that I lodge an objection and make it clear there is not unanimous consent for the limitation on \namendments involving additional spending without suitable offsets. \n\nSMITH: Fair enough and--and duly noted. I mean skipping through all of this traditionally any amendment that has a \nreferral to another committee would--would cause our bill to go to that committee and we've agreed that those \namendments, if we don't vote on them, there rolled out of order. Similarly, we during the entire time I've been on this \ncommittee have never accepted an amendment that did not have a suitable offset. And by suitable by the way they \nare--there are sort of two flavors of money on this committee. One is discretionary and one is mandatory. \n\nSo, if you offer a mandatory increase, you have to have a mandatory offset. You can't offset mandatory increases \nwith discretionary. But basically, this is the argument over $750 billion versus $733 which we will have. We--we \nhave had disagreements in the past on what the top line number is. We have never in my time on this committee \nallowed amendments to not have suitable offsets and it is not my intention to allow them this year. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: But I-- I understand the objective--objection. \n\nTHORNBERRY: And I--and I don't mean to debate it now. I just want to make it clear, in every year in the past, \nthere has been agreement on that point. I--I--it's essential for me to put in the record now, there is not agreement on \nthat point this year, for a variety of reasons. Which you can--we can talk about now or later if you want to. But just to \nclarify so that the record is clear. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Fair enough. We also must--getting back to where I'm at on my script here. Members must not offer \namendments that could result in a point of order against the bill on the House floor during its consideration. \nPursuant to the guidelines on submitting amendments sent to the members offices last week, we will not permit any \nearmarks also in the National Defense Authorizing Act. It is the chair's intention operated under the five-minute rule. \n\nAs we get late in the evening, sometimes we try to limit that more. We can have that discussion we get there. That \nrequires unanimous consent, if we are going to get off of the five-minute rule. Without objection, members have five \nlegislative days which--within which to submit written statements into the record, so ordered. \n\nBefore beginning with the subcommittee reports and following consultation with Mr. Thornberry, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the provisions contained in the reports of the subcommittees, and the chairman's mark which includes \nfull committee provisions be considered for the purposes of this markup as original tax (INAUDIBLE) H. R. 2500 \nand that these provisions be considered as having been read and that the bill being open to amendment at any \npoint. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. \n\nAnd without objection the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. We'll try to press through but will also \nmake judgment calls about when we need to break. With that, we will proceed with the mark and first up is the \nCommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces and we would now receive the report of the subcommittee on tactical \nair and land forces pursuant to committee rules 17, and in consultation with the ranking member. We will postpone \nall of the recorded votes and the amendments to this particular subcommittee of our (INAUDIBLE) consideration of \nall amendments to this subcommittee mark have been concluded. \n\nAnd let me just quick clarify a point on that. In terms of manage your schedule, believe it or not, you're not all going \nto sit here for the entire 15 hours that we are marking up. We hold the amendment votes until the end the \nsubcommittee mark. There are however two set--exceptions that. If there is an amendment to an amendment, that \nmust be taken at the time. Now, we'll try to give you a warning when that's coming up so they should make your \nway back here for that vote. \n\nSecond exception is if there were procedural votes, those procedural votes also happen immediately. So, you need \nto keep your eye out for those too, because those will happen quicker. But the amendments themselves will be held \nthe end of the mark. \n\nAll right. I will now recognize the gentleman from--from New Jersey, Mr. Norcross, for any comments he would like \nto make about his mark. \n\nNORCROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members have before them Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee \nMark as well as those programs within our jurisdiction including in the chairman's mark. I'd like to start by thanking \nall the members for their contributions and participation in the hearings, the briefings we held this year. As well as \ntheir help--in building this package--that we have before us. \n\nI especially want to thank the Ranking Member Mrs. Hartzler for her cooperation's in this bipartisan mark. Both her \nand her staff of being gracious and extremely helpful through this process and truly appreciate the commitment to \ncontinuing bipartisan tradition we probably uphold on this subcommittee. This is a shared cooperation help us focus \non what is truly important that we deliver Defense Authorization Act that does as much is possible for the radius of \nmodernization of our nation's air and land forces. \n\nThe mark before us today supports the department's budget request at the same time increasing our oversight of \nthe department's largest, most complex, risky, and expensive program. One--specific area of interest for the \ncommittee has been the Army's massive line by line program evaluation better known as Night Court. This is the \nlargest review the Army has ever gone through and has an impact on every member that sits here today and all \nthose who sit in Congress. This deep dive warrants a deep thoughtful review. But being deliberate, careful, and \nthorough with their budget priorities today. Confidence about future strength and the ability of the Army is stronger \nthan ever. \n\n\n\nThat same delivered careful and thoughtful consideration was applied to our budget and the programmatic \nrecommendations you'll see before you today. We use a $733 billion overall discretionary budget based on sworn \ntestimony from military officials that the $733 is the amount that we give our forces a competitive advantage based \non capabilities, development of Russia and China by 2025. In fact, the Chairman and the Joint Chief General \nDunford said the $733 is completely informed by the analysis conducted by the military, for a path of capability \ndevelopment. \n\nAs such our package not only improves the ability for oversight but protects the taxpayer, supports our troops, and \ncertainly the American industrial base. The Tactical Air and Land Forces Provision, comprehensive oversight, \nimproved weapon capabilities for peer and near-peer competitors, and addresses known and participated--\nunanticipated capabilities act was a significantly long-term investment to overcome. \n\nBriefly I want to touch base on a few of these issues the subcommittee's recommendations for those programs that \nyou have before us today. Number one. The mark provides for 12 additional F-35A Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft. At \nthe same time, it increases the oversight of the F-35 Aircraft Modernization Block number 4 upgrade, to make sure \nyou monitor the efforts to achieve affordable production and sustainment cost. Our or objective is to ensure the \nprograms achieve real cost savings while developing and feed--feeling much-needed fighter as both take--tactically \ncapable and affordable. \n\nAlso, the mark fully supports the president's budget request for the F-15EX program. However, we are also \nrecommending additional oversight by including provision that designates the F-15EX as a major acquisition \nsubprogram requiring documentation and acquisition strategy. Our recommendation would fully fund the Marine \nCorps CH-53K, the King Stallion program for six aircraft. But also requires quarterly updates from the Navy on this \nprogram because of schedule cost and others. We must better understand and monitor this aircraft's technical \nmanagement problems and find solutions that take into account the taxpayer. \n\nSubcommittee we also recommends funding for advanced procurement for the CH-47F Chinook Block II program is \nalso recommended four funding as requested for the Army Aviation program, the Blackhawk, the Apache, the Grey \nEagle in the mark would require the Army to create an aviation's strategic plan and modernization roadmap that is a \ncohesive, achievable, and affordable long-term plan for Army aviation's. \n\nAnother major program is additional funding for the Reaper Unmanned Aerial System, U2 continues to get \nupgraded, \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry. The gentle--gentleman's time has--has expired. I don't want to set a bad-- \n\nNORCROSS: Yep, so that's (INAUDIBLE) for that. \n\nSMITH: Precedents right out the door here, so. We--all right. The chair now recognizes the ranking member on the \nTactical Air Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Missouri, Ms. Hartzler, for five minutes. \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Chairman Norcross for his leadership. He's been great \nto work with and I appreciate the spirit of bipartisanship that he has displayed in building this mark. And also, I thank \nall of the members of the subcommittee for their active participation this year and all the subcommittee's efforts. \nAlso, I went to express my thanks the entire subcommittee staff for their support, their hard work throughout this \nprocess. We truly have a bipartisan staff and appreciate you. \n\nIn building the mark, the subcommittee conducted oversight on approximately $102 billion in program budget \nauthority for Fiscal Year 2020. I believe the subcommittee's proposals take the necessary actions to appropriately \naddress the importance of modernization and through oversight works to ensure acquisition strategies are aligned \nwith the National Defense Strategy. \n\nI am especially pleased that the mark includes proposals related to Air Force Fighter Force Structure Challenges. \nBased on testimony before this committee by Senior Military Leaders and the Office of the Secretary Defense it \nappears clear to me that we will need a highly capable mix a fourth-generation and fifth-generation aircraft through \n\n\n\nthis decade, complementing one another in order to meet the objective--objectives of the National Defense \nStrategy. \n\nThe mark rightfully supports and is committed to the F-15EX and the F-35 programs, while also including the \nappropriate level of balanced and reasonable oversight related to both programs. These oversight proposals will \nprovide us with the necessary information we need to help to ensure the Air Force will feel the required high low mix \nof fourth and fifth-generation tactical fighters. Enabling the delivery of required capacity while also continuing crucial \ninvestments needed to rapidly transition to fifth-generation capability. \n\nThe mark appropriately provides oversight on the requirements and acquisition strategy--strategies for providing \ncritically needed vehicle active protection systems for combat and tactical vehicles. Given what we've learned from \nsubcommittee briefings and hearings regarding current and emerging threats, specifically the proliferation of anti-\ntank guided missiles and rocket propelled grenades, I think the provision is needed and timely. \n\nI'm also pleased the mark continues the committee's oversight of the department's plans and efforts to mitigate \nphysiological incidents in Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force aircraft and fully supports the budget request in these \nareas and I encourage everyone support of the subcommittee's mark. However, the question of overall funding \nlevels this bill would provide to the Department of Defense remains a significant concern. \n\nSenior commanders including General Dunford, Secretary Mattis, and acting Secretary Shanahan, have testified 3 \nto 5 percent real growth in the DOD budget is essential to maintain readiness recovery and our competitive \nadvantage over peer adversaries like Russia and China. General Dunford further clarified stating quote we actually \nidentified that as the minimal necessary to make sure we could do what must be done by 2025. Given these \nstatements, I remain concerned about the overall defense top line and what impact this will have on readiness \nrecovery. Now is not the time to go backwards. \n\nI strongly support Ranking Member Thornberry's amendment to increase the top line, to reflect what is necessary, \nto continue the progress, and the process of restoring readiness for our military. This amendment takes a balanced \napproach in providing the necessary funding required to maintain our competitive advantage while also still \nensuring accountability and oversight. I yield back. Thank you. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Does anyone else have for comments on the Tac Air Mark? Hearing none, we will move on to \namendments and we will now consider En Bloc Package number 1 and the chair recognizes Mr. Norcross for the \ntedious process of reading through all of the amendments that are in En Bloc Package number 1. Mr. Norcross. \n\nNORCROSS: Mr.--Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Package number 1 consisting of the \namendments that have been worked through an improved by the minority. En Bloc Package number 1-- \n\nSMITH: So, ordered. \n\nNORCROSS: Are we good? All right. Amendment number 28, by Ms. Speier, directing a brief on the--contributions-\n- \n\nSMITH: I apologize. I skipped one important part. Those amendments will now be distributed. I believe they will \nshow up on your handy-dandy little computer there. We good? Have they been distributed?

Without objection the amendments are considered as read and the gentleman is recognized for \nfive minutes for the purposes of explaining the En Bloc Package. \n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) We just-- \n\nMORAWETZ: Actually, I think we're to do that. Sorry. Does--any--any discussion on the amendments? Hearing \nnone. Mr. Norcross, would you like to make a motion? \n\nNORCROSS: Make a motion to approve as read. \n\nSMITH: Is there discussion?

I'm pleased to present the \nIntelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee's Portion of the Fiscal Year 2020 Natural \nDefense Authorization Act. \n\nI want to first begin by extending my sincerest thanks and appreciation to the Ranking Member Stefanik for her \noutstanding bipartisanship and her support for the sound transparent collaboration between the both of us and--our \nsubcommittee staffs as well as the members of--on the subcommittee. \n\nI also want to thank Lindsay, Bass, Jessica, Josh, Pete, Eric, Jason, and--and Caroline, and our military legislative \nassistants, and fellows Lee, Jared, Courtney, and Cheryl without whom this mark would certainly not have been \npossible. \n\nAnd let me go on by saying this subcommittee mark reflects our steadfast commitment to ensuring that the \nDepartment of Defense plans for, invests in, and matures the relevant war fighting and deterrence capabilities to \nmaintain our technological edge, protects and secures our supply chain, capabilities information, and in postures \nthe joint force effectively against current and future threats. \n\nThe mark maintains the budgetary top line of approximately $51 billion within the IETC topline early to need, \nredundant, and unjustified request have been reallocated to invest in burgeoning requirements. For instance, $175 \nmillion has been provided to the department for investments in next-generation information communications \ntechnology or 5G. we also increase funding for critical technologies and capabilities such as additive manufacturer, \nhypersonics, education programs, and top security and cyber--in the cyber workforce. \n\nThe mark also observes funding for basic and applied research both of which have been consistently underfunded \nby the department. We are turning that around. Recognizing the challenges of--of foreign intelligence services \ntargeting academic institutions. We provide $3 million for establishment of a collaborative body comprising leaders \nfrom government, science, and security agencies, universities, and industry to increase threat information sharing \nand address counterintelligence concerns. \n\nOur subcommittee--hours subcommittee's oversight activities tied to--to this issue identified that universities require \nmore robust assistance from the federal government and insight into the nature of the threats that they face in order \nto protect their research and intellectual property while maintaining an open and collaborative research \nenvironment. Additionally, the mark creates stronger alignment of technology the development with policy \nformulation to ensure smart investments and timely adoption merging capabilities. It champions improvements to \nthe workforce and infrastructure of our DOD laboratories and promotes the diversity and representation of minorities \nand women in the department science and technology enterprise. \n\nThe mark also continues to support successful STEM education programs. The subcommittee also increases \nfunding for the cyber security workforce by $10 million. Additionally, provisions have been included to synchronize \nefforts and leverage best practices across the department relating to network, industrial base, military installation, \nand weapon system cyber security. \n\nThe mark strengthens the existing reporting requirements for sensitive military operation--operations in cyberspace \nto complement cyber policies and strategies recent--recently released by the department. It also establishes new \nmechanisms to make the existing oversight framework more robust. This includes a stronger annual reporting \n\n\n\nrequirement with the--the detail necessary like tools, costs, and--and authorities in order to conduct proper oversight \nof cyber operations. This is a--a level of detail that the committee does not currently receive. But one that is clearly \nnecessary given the ever-increasing threat that we face in this domain. \n\nFurther, the mark also requires congressional notifications for any authorities delegated by the president to the \nsecretary for military operations in cyberspace. \n\nMoving on the mark continues to build on the subcommittee's previous work to ensure our special operations forces \nremain a professional, agile, ready force postured for high-end missions and in part by limiting their use for missions \nmore--more aptly suited for our conventional forces. Recognizing the--the--also the tragic threefold increase of soft \nsuicides in 2018. Additional funding has been provided to SOCOM for suicide prevention-- \n\nSMITH: And I'm so sorry if the gentleman could--could summarize. His--his five minutes are up. \n\nLANGEVIN: Very good. I--I'm very proud of the mark that we have before us, Mr. Chairman. I--it--it--the last thing \nthat I'll say is that it--the reestablishment of the intelligence with emerging threats and capabilities strengthens \nsubcommittee's oversight functions to consistent application of threat security considerations across the entire year \nof portfolio. This is a good mark. I thank my ranking member for bipartisan support and cooperation. It's been a \npleasure to continue to work with her, as well as the subcommittee members, and our staff. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The chair now recognizes the ranking member on the Subcommittee of Intelligence and--and \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities, gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Stefanik, for five minutes. \n\nSTEFANIK: Thank you, Chairman Smith. I want to start by thanking ITC Chairman Jim Langevin for his leadership \nand all of the members of the subcommittee for their attendance and participation in the hearings and briefings \nconducted this year. We have explored important issues as a subcommittee in a collaborative and bipartisan \nmanner. I'd like to highlight three broad themes that I am supportive of within this subcommittee mark. \n\nFirst. I am pleased that the mark is active in all areas of our subcommittee's jurisdiction to include the addition of \nintelligence oversight within the subcommittee, as was done previously in the 113th Congress. The mark continues \nour focus on emerging technologies including manufacturing technologies that are fundamental to our \nadvancements and scaling of hypersonic weapons and directed energy. We included an emphasis on basic \nresearch and the important contributions that universities and Department of Defense laboratories provide to our \ncollective national security. \n\nI also support the emphasis on capabilities for our special operations forces including recommendations for \nadditional funds in support of the preservation of the force and families program and as in years past we are again \ninitiating important oversight reviews to be conducted by the Government Accountability Office in critical areas such \nas electronic warfare, special operations forces, cyber security, and adversarial advancements in emerging \ntechnologies. \n\nMr. Chairman I'm also pleased that this mark includes a provision to extend the National Security Commission on \nArtificial Intelligence. I sponsored section 1051 of last year's NDAA that created the commission to consider the \nmethods and means necessary to advance the development of AI Machine Learning and Associated Technologies \nto comprehensively address the national and defense needs of the United States. The commission is off to a \nrunning start and frankly I have never seen a federal commission move so fast with such urgency and with \ntremendous backing from government and industry alike. Their forthcoming recommendations to this committee \nand indeed our nation will help us maintain global leadership in AI research, prepare our citizens for an AI enabled \nfuture, and ensure international competitiveness and cooperation. \n\nAs a second broad theme this subcommittee mark continues the tradition of robust and bipartisan congressional \noversight of current and sensitive military operations and activities including cyber, counterterrorism, and \nintelligence operations. As I've said many times before continued oversight of sensitive and ongoing military \noperations is a central role for this subcommittee. \n\n\n\nMany of the congressional oversight frameworks that this mark commands were put in place several years ago by \nthen Chairman Thornberry, as well as myself, and Chairman Langevin in a bipartisan manner. So, I am pleased that \nwe are advancing and modifying these frameworks to further enhance our strong committee oversight of the \ndepartment. \n\nAnd third this subcommittee mark provides a solid foundation for many of the crosscutting issues we will discuss \nlater today: including 5G information and communications technologies, security as a function of \ncounterintelligence, supply chain integrity, and many other important areas. Equally as important during today's full \ncommittee debate, we will discuss the overall topline funding levels that this year's NDAA will provide for the \nDepartment of Defense. \n\nOur committee has heard from former Secretary Mattis, acting Secretary Shanahan, and senior commanders \nincluding Chairman Dunford that 3 to 5 percent real growth in the Department of Defense budget is essential to \nmaintain readiness recovery and our competitive edge over peer adversaries such as Russia and China. I firmly \nbelieve that this subcommittee mark sets the right trajectory to support a strong defense topline, to ensure military \nsuperiority for our men and women in uniform. But to stay the course it should be reinforced with the additional \nfunds for 5G and artificial intelligence. As called for within Ranking Member Thornberry's amendment that takes our \ntop line to $750 billion. \n\nFinally, Mr. Chairman. Let me also take a moment to thank the dedicated professional staff members of our \nsubcommittee and in particular Peter Villano, Jason Schmidt, and Eric Snelgrove, from our minority team. As well \nas Lindsay Kavanaugh,  and the entire majority team. Thank you, again, Chairman Smith and thank you to each of \nmy colleagues on the subcommittee for your hard work this year. This is a strong subcommittee mark and I urge my \ncolleagues to support. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Are there any further discussions on the subcommittee mark? Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I want to take just a moment first to thank Chairman Langevin and Ranking Member \nStefanik, for their work. This subcommittee is one that both you and I have chaired in the past, very challenging but \nthey've done a very good job. I want to take a moment to just highlighted a caution for members that touches on \nthis subcommittee and a number of other subcommittees. Later in the mark there is a mandatory saving achieved \nby requiring Department of Defense to move to a new Internet Protocol address. I know this is boring but just bear \nwith me. \n\nSo, the--the old address are--are something called the Internet Protocol version 4. The new one is six. The \nunderlying mark says you got to sell all the fours and move ever body to six and it achieves some mandatory \nsavings by doing so. The Department of Defense says we can't possibly do that it. It require--it in--incurs security \nrisk. There's--we have no idea about how to move, much less if there's any real savings to be achieved. I think the \nsubcommittee did exactly the right thing by having GAO study this issue, look at how the department can move, and \nsee what savings might be achieved. \n\nThe reason I want to highlight for members is there are a number of provisions--as--as the chairman said earlier, if \nyou're going to spend mandatory--spend money, you got to have mandatory offsets, and this is the mandatory \noffset. There's a lot of mandatory spending that most of us think is a good idea, like Afghan SIVs for example, which \nis a challenge every year. A number of things but if the savings aren't real, then the spending can't be real. \n\nNow we're going to work our way through this, consultant working with the department through conference. I just \nwant people not to get too far out ahead of assuming that these say--that this is possible, and that the savings can \nbe achieved--before we--there is the time to really understand how to get from here to there. So again, I like the \nsubcommittee did the right thing. I just want to--express a caution because it is largely the subcommittees \njurisdiction that deals with this. So, the numbers don't assume that all that spending can take place. Thank you, I \nyield back. \n\n\n\nSMITH: That is a very reasonable point. We'll--we'll work together and that you know pay forwards are sometimes \nmore of an art than a science and we do want to make sure we get them right, so will continue that discussion as \nwe move along in the process. Any further discussion on the subcommittee mark? Mr. Carbajal. \n\nCARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. chair. I just wanted to take some time to thank this committee for supporting DOD \nacademia research partnerships. DOD academia research programs provide clinical research that ultimately \nprovide for our war fighters with the most revolutionary capabilities. Educational partnership programs and \nuniversity affiliated research centers have successfully promoted university lead collaborations between universities \nindustries and DOD to conduct breakthrough research and assess DOD in maintaining technological superiority. \n\nThese partnerships promote growing the next generation of innovators and provides an avenue for them to engage \nin advanced, collaborative research and innovation with the military services. Simultaneously DOD is able to \ntransition its research into--into technologies, our war fighters need in a cost-efficient way. Advances in areas such \nas biotechnology, nanotechnology, and rocket propulsion will continue to play a vital role in advancing war fighters' I \nperformance, along with sustaining our nation's technological edge. \n\nI believe this is an area we must continue to diligently invest in and encourage my colleagues here to go and \nexperience the incredible talent and work, the students of this nation have to offer. It is absolutely amazing. So once \nagain, I thank this committee for providing robust support for university lead research programs, with DOD. Mr. \nchair, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Any further comments? It is now in order to consider En Bloc Package number 1 and the chair \nrecognizes Mitchell--Mr. Langevin, for the purpose of offering the En Bloc Amendment. \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Package number 1. Consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered and will the clerk please distribute the En bloc amendments. I think we're all \nclear now these on--these amendments are showing up on your computer and being distributed. I miss the old days \nwhen like five or six interns had to jump up and pass paper out all over the place and at the end of the day, we had \na stack of paper two feet high. But this is much more efficient. Mr. Langevin, you may now discuss in detail the En \nBloc Amendment, Package number 1. \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En Bloc Package number 1 is comprised of the following: Amendment \nnumber 54, by Mr. Bacon, regarding the DOD strategy to leverage AI enabled robotics in support of soft in CBR and \nenvironments. Amendment number 11--116R1, by Mr. Brown, to amend section 1603 of the NDAA for FY '14 by--\nextending the commercialization of dual use technologies.

And finally, Amendment number 208, by Ms. Slotkin, expressing support for Modeling and Simulation \nin the Development of--of Ground Vehicles. \n\nSMITH: Is there any further discussion on the En Bloc Amendments? If not, the question is on the adoption of the \nEn Bloc Package number 1 offered by Ms. Langevin. So many are as in favor will say Aye? \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Opposed? The Ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. It is now in order to consider En Bloc Package \nnumber 2 . The chair recognizes Mr. Langevin for the purposes of offering En Bloc Package number 2. \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Package number 2 consisting of \namendments that have been worked and improved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute En Bloc Amendment? Without objection, the \namendments are--without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And the gentleman is recognized, for \nfive minutes, for the purposes of explaining the En bloc amendment Would work improved with minority objections \nordered the clerk pleased ship with the En Bloc Amendment. \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The En Bloc Package number 2 is comprised of the following: Amendment \nnumber 233R1, by Ms. Stefanik, that provides New Personal Management Authorities to the Joint Artificial \nIntelligence Center to Recruit Experts in Science and Engineering. \n\nAmendment number 234R1, by Mr. Stefanik, to enable the military services for a term of three years to use up to $3 \nmillion appropriated for procreation for operations in maintenance to carry out cyber operation's peculiar capability \ndevelopment projects.

That's okay. Ms. Houlahan, please, go ahead. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nHOULAHAN: Thank you and to the ITC leadership for support of Amendment 323. Earlier this year, I met with some \nof our special operations leadership and they told me about the challenges that they have faced in getting \ninnovative technologies on contract fast enough for the war--for their war fighters. And as a member of the small \nbusiness committee, I know just how important it is to SBIR and STTR and the program to be able to help our small \nbusinesses work with the government and meet emerging challenges. \n\nThis simmered--this amendment creates a pilot program that will help SOCOM spend some of its SBIR and STTR \nmoney faster so that we can bring these technologies to our special operators before they get snap up--snapped up \nby bigger companies. I thank you very much for the opportunity to present this a men--amendment and thank you \nagain, Chairman Langevin and I yield back. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Thank you. Any other discussion? If not, the questions on the adoption of the En bloc package offered by \nMr. Langevin. So many as in favor will say Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted, and it is now in order to consider En Bloc Package \nnumber 3 and the chair recognizes Mr. Langevin for the purposes of offering En Bloc Package. \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, thank you. We will next consider En Bloc Package--let me--I'm asking you consent to \ncall up En Bloc Package number 3 consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the \nminority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc Amendment and without objection \nthe amendments are considered as read. The gentleman is recognized, for five minutes, for the purpose of \nexplaining the En Bloc Package. \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, En Bloc Package number 3 is comprised of the following: Amendment number 312R1, \nby Mr. Gallego, directs the Department of Defense to produce a report on the--the Benefits and Feasibility for a \nCenter of Excellence Dedicated to Pathogen Analysis. Amendment number 463R1, by Mr. Kim, directs the--the \ncontroller general of the United States to conduct an assessment of roles, missions, and responsibilities of the office \nof the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. \n\nSMITH: Is there for the discussion on the En Bloc Package? Not questions on the adoption En Bloc Package \nnumber 3 offered by Mr. Langevin. All those in favor say Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye \n\nSMITH: Opposed? The Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted and now the chair recognizes Ms. Stefanik--well \nsorry. We'll now consider--we will now consider law number 232 which is an amendment by Ms. Stefanik for what \npurposes does the gentlewoman seek recognition \n\nSTEFANIK: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the \namendment. And the gentlewoman is now recognized to discuss. \n\nSTEFANIK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment would change the name of the Undersecretary of Defense \nfor Intelligence to the Undersecretary of Defense Intelligence and Security. This was a proposal that came over \nfrom the department, approved by the interagency, and accurately reflects the current role of the USDI as the \nprincipal advisor to the sector for both intelligence and security matters. In fact, important context for this is that this \nvery committee led the effort--effort in the FY '19 NDAA that assigned the USDI the responsibility for the overall \ndirection and supervision of personnel, physical, and industrial security and the protection of classified information \nand controlled unclassified information. \n\nIn other words, the USDI is already performing security functions at the direction of the defense committees and this \namendment would simply update Title 10 to accurately reflect this. This is exactly the kind of legislative proposal \nthat should've been included in the underlying bill and it's not clear to me why the majority chose not to include it in \nthe bill we are marking up today. There are other good bipartisan and security-related provisions in the IETC mark \nthat Chairman Langevin and I were able to include and given the multiple security-related incidents that have \nresulted in tragic loss of life, unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and acquisition of sensitive \ngovernment information by foreign intelligence services. All of which have been briefed in detail to this committee. \nThis legislative proposal seems all the more urgent to me. \n\nI believe that all of my colleagues in the committee would agree with me that the protection of personnel, \ntechnology, and infrastructure is one of the highest priorities of the Department of Defense. The men and women in \n\n\n\nuniform deserve nothing less. Members of this committee deserve the opportunity to legislate and vote whether or \nnot a senior Department of Defense official should be held responsible for the security matters of the department. \n\nBy voting on this amendment, members would've had the opportunity to say that there should never be another \nEdward Snowden disclosure to cause immeasurable harm to national security and I am confident that we would all \nagree that there should never again allow a well-intentioned military recruitment program like the MAVNI to be \nexploited by hostile intelligence services giving foreign intelligence officers unparalleled placement and access that \ncompromised our military services. And most importantly members of this committee deserve to be able to vote but \nthere should never be another undetected insider threat like Nidal Hasan who murdered 12 soldiers and one civilian \nat Fort Hood Texas. \n\nUnfortunately, since this DOD legislative proposal was not part of the underlying bill and due to a point of order, I \nam forced offer and withdraw. But I do want to express my sincere disappointment that we were not able to include \nthis within the subcommittee or full committee mark despite requests to do so. Since the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence majority refused to provide a waiver and while I certainly understand sequential referral \nand the importance of waivers by outside committees. I can say as a crossover member of the HIPSC that I \nwould've much rather have legislated on this issue in this committee on the House Armed Services Committee. \nInstead of seeding our jurisdiction over the Department of Defense and allowing HIPSC to object to this very \nreasonable legislative proposal from the Department of Defense. \n\nMoving forward we will continue this discussion with our colleagues given the important role of security in a leading-\n-in enabling the DOD to provide for the common defense of this nation and with that I withdraw my amendment and \nyield-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: Will the gentlewoman yield before she withdrawals? \n\nSTEFANIK: I will yield to Ranking Member Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you. I--I--let me just say I agree completely with Ms. Stefanik's point. If--if this committee \ncannot rename an Undersecretary of Defense, then I think there is far too restrictive a view of sequential referral. \nWe have exclusive jurisdiction over the organization of the department just because intelligence is in the name does \nnot mean he goes to another committee. And I'm--I'm concerned about that and I just wanted to emphasize the \npoint because it affects all of us and all of our ability to do things within the department. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Let me just say you know that there are growing pains in terms of getting into the new majority and \none of the growing pains that we have had is some of my fellow committee chairman don't necessarily understand \nhow the sequential referral thing works in terms of our committee and I can assure you I have worked hard to try to \nget to an understanding with them about. It is but a more difficult process that should've been and will continue to \nwork on that. We-- it should be easier than it is. I apologize. This one was not brought to my attention. I have had to \nspeak to Mr. Schiff and a bunch of other people, a bunch of different things. It happened at the staff level. We're \nnew to the majority. They don't understand exactly what is necessary in this waiver. I cannot imagine that they have \nany sort of big, huge substantive objection and we can talk about per--perhaps adding this on the floor and whether \nor not we can--can get there on that. And I'll work on this sequential referral and for the future if any of you are \nhaving any problems with sequential referral, let me know and we'll--we'll try--try to make it work better than it has. \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSTEFANIK: I appreciate the chairman's support and I look forward to having this vote on the floor, as an \namendment. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Thank you. \n\nLANGEVIN: Will the gentlelady yield and may I be recognized? \n\nSTEFANIK: I yield, Mr. Langevin. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Actually, I--I recognize Mr. Langevin, for five minutes. \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--want to thank Ms. Stefanik for offering the amendment which raises many \nimportant points with (INAUDIBLE) mostly which I agree with and I hope to be able to work with you between now \nand when the bill goes to the floor to perhaps make the necessary changes and--and we just wanted to--because to \nbroader understand the--the word intern security and--and what it will have jurisdiction over. But as we get those \nquestions answered and we deal with sequential referral issue I hope that this is something that change we can \nmake. I look forward to working with the ranking member to--to make that happen. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The amendment is withdrawn. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin, for the purposes of making a motion. \n\nLANGEVIN: (OFF-MIC) Mr. Chairman, I--I move to adopt the subcommittee report of the subcommittee on--Mr. \nChairman, I moved to adopt the Subcommittee Report of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats \nand Capabilities as amended. \n\nSMITH: The question is on the motion and the gentleman from Rhode Island. All those in favor will say Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: All those opposed, no? The quorum being present, the Ayes have it. The motion is adopted and with that \nwe move on to our next subcommittee. \n\nThe committee will now receive the report on the Subcommittee on Sea Power Projecting Forces pursuant to rule \n17, in consultation with the ranking member. We will postpone all the recorded votes until the end. The chair \nrecognizes the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney, for five minutes. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to present the Sea Power and Projection Forces \nSubcommittee's Portion of the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to the full committee today. \nThis year's mark by the Sea Power Panel is a continuation of many years of bipartisan work and I want to recognize \nand thank Ranking Member Wittman, for his unwavering commitment to strengthening the Navy, Marines, and Air \nForce's ability to respond to the challenges and threats of today. \n\nAs we have in previous years, we applied rigorous review and analysis to the portions of the president's budget \nrequest under our jurisdiction. The adjustments we need to get to this point are far less a reflection of any kind of \ncap or restriction to the defense budget. But instead applied good budget sense to save taxpayer dollars while \npreserving core priorities. Indeed, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Dunford testified before this committee \nearlier this year that a $733 billion top line is quote completely informed by the analysis that we did for the path of \ncapability--development. \n\nWe intend to file that analysis in this committee by marking to the $733 billion top line. This year we also benefited \ngreatly from the input of new members of this subcommittee whose intelligence, energy, and diverse life experience \ncontributed greatly to today's mark. The mark authorizes a shipbuilding budget of just over $22 billion for 11 battle 4 \nships including three Virginia Class submarines, three DDG 51 Arleigh Burke destroyers the first guided missile \nfrigate, one LPD Flight II Amphibious Ship through incremental funding authority, one TAO-205 oiler, and two \nTowing, Salvaging, and Rescue ships. \n\nOur subcommittee has working for the last few years to press the Navy and DOD leadership to increase Virginia \nClass submarine construction to address the looming shortfall in our undersea force which today stands at 51 and \nwill be at 42 by 2026. After apposing our efforts last year, the president's 2020 budget embrace the work of the \nsubcommittee and the full committee from last year by requesting three Virginia Class submarines. In testimony \nthroughout the year we heard how important additional submarines above the two a year build rate would be to \nmitigate the submarine force structure shortfall and help to the rest the Columbia program is it ramps up production \nin the coming years. \n\n\n\nOur mark authorizes the resources necessary to achieve this important goal. Our mark also explicitly rejects the \npresident's baffling proposal to cancel the plan refueling of U.S. aircraft carrier Harry Truman. A proposal that would \nhave squandered $538 million of sunk refueling cost already made in a critical ship less than halfway into a service \nlife. A plan that was not supported by the Navy's four structure assessment or statutory carrier requirements. Our \nsubcommittee continues to address necessary reforms related to Navy collisions in the Pacific in 2017, by including \na new requirement that will better align the training of our sailors and officers to receive--that they receive with \nsystems actually installed aboard their ships. \n\nI want to emphasize our work in a critical aspect of our nation's security. The recapitalization of Sealift and Maritime \nresponse capability. In this mark we have taken action by including a long-term reauthorization on Maritime Security \nProgram, creating a new Tanker Security Program to help secure our nations--our military's fuel supply, in \nestablishing a new build domestic Sealift vessel program. This mark also rejects the administration's effort to cut \nfunding for the Maritime Academy Training Ship Program which is critical to training the pipeline of Mariners needed \nto support our Sealift capability. \n\nThis mark also recommends strong support for production forces per--priority such as the KC-46 Refueling Tanker \nand the B- 21 Long-Range Bomber. Once again, our mark also recommends expanding meter--needed propeller \nand propulsion upgrades for our fleet of legacy C-130 H aircraft. Despite the Air Force's frustrating unwillingness to \ninvest in the safety and efficiency minded upgrades. As is--as is--cost congresses constitutional obligation we \nexpanded our oversight authority over the B-1 fleet readiness, B-52 reengineering, and the new Air Force One \naircraft to name just a few. \n\nI'm also glad to see that report languages will be in this year's bill and has important provisions that will provide \nMaritime support to our partners around the world. Specifically, language that requires an evaluation of Ukrainian \nnaval capabilities and how the U.S. can augment those capabilities. This kind of support is critical particularly in \nlight of the fact that the United Nations tribunal for the law the Sea Treaty voted 19 to 1 just a couple weeks ago. \nRebuking Russia's unlawful seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels who are operating in international waters and \nthe--continued imprisonment of 20 Ukrainian sailors in a Moscow prison which the UN tribunal ordered them to \nrelease. \n\nAltogether we are presenting another strong bipartisan mark that I fully expect to become part of a strong full \ncommittee mark of the Fiscal Year '20 NDAA. None of this that I present today could be possible without the \nsupport of dedicated staff that has worked tirelessly to produce it. Phil McNaughton, Kelly Goggin, Dave Snicky, \n(SP) and Megan Handle. We are all grateful to their expertise and support that all of you have provided in the \nprocess of creating and advancing this mark forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Sea Power Subcommittee, Mr. Whitman, \nfor five minutes. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Sea Power Rejection Forces mark is a good mark and I want to \nespecially thank Chairman Courtney for his leadership of the subcommittee. He's done a spectacular job and he's \nbeen exceptional in developing a good mark in a very difficult budget environment. He's--this has been made \nexceptionally more difficult by the requirement that he mark below the amount that the Department of Defense \nasserts they require in order to do the job we asked them. And with--as such I'd like to reiterate that Chairman \nCourtney has done an exceptional job navigating these perilous waters. I'd like to thank him in the staff for \nextraordinary work. \n\nThe Sea Power Mark includes an authorization for 11 ships and generally supports the administration's request for \naircraft. It reaffirms congressional support for aircraft carriers and rebuffs an administration request to not refuel \nUSS Harry S Truman CVN-75 a mistake that has since been corrected. Moreover, it continues our broad bipartisan \napproach to supporting the Merchant Marine and specifically authorizes the Maritime Security Program and \nauthorizes a new 10 Ship Tanker Security Program. \n\nIt continues strong development support for the Columbia Ballistic Missile Submarine Program and the B-21 Rater \nBomber Program. There is much goodness in this mark. What is in the mark, makes sense but when put together \n\n\n\nwith budget tables we have a different story. The drive to reduce the overall defense top line by $17 billion has \nsignificant carnage. Including a reduction of over a half a billion in submarine construction. A reduction of almost \n$400 million in aircraft carrier reconstruction and almost $200 million in aircraft carrier refueling. A reduction of \nalmost $100 million in destroyer construction and the complete elimination of a fleet oiler. \n\nOn the innovation side we limited efforts associated with the Navy's Large Unmanned Surface Vessels Program \nand Navy's Critical Development of Anti-Mined Warfare Programs. As to weapons, we also included significant \nreductions in the latest Standard Missile Program, NATO C-Spero, and lightweight torpedoes. \n\nAs I reflect on this mark, I'm reminded of Charles Dickens book, A Tale of Two Cities. The book opens with the \nfollowing quote it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of \nfoolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season \nof Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. My friends this mark is replete with very good \ninitiatives and some very onerous omissions. I'm hoping as we continue through the day today that we can all make \nthis overall mark into a bipartisan spring of hope and that we avoid the late-night winter of despair. With that, I yield \nback the balance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Well that certainly was more dramatic than the previous statement, so. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWere you sensing that the room was getting a little maybe board-- \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nTry to jazz it up a little bit. I appreciate that. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nI--this is something that were going to debate quite a bit and will try not to make this argument too often. But I--I do \nwant to offer a couple comments about the $733 billion, $750 billion thing, since that has been a theme of every \nsubcommittee comment to date. When General Dunford testified, you know when the fighter came out last year, \nthey projected $733 billion for FY '20. That is that is what the Department of Defense had asked for my back in FY \n'19 and let me just say that the real sort of--actually it wasn't the winter of despair thing here. \n\nIt's been a while since it will run until two cities and I confess did not listen to everything comment there. The real \ntale of despair was from 2011 through the deal we got last year, when who as everyone here knows and everyone \nhas commented, we had I think for four government shutdowns, countless CRs, and a level of uncertainty did drive \nthe readiness crisis at the Pentagon and--and there's bipartisan responsibility for that. I'm not making that as a \npartisan point. One thing that we have agreed on in this committee is the importance of getting the Department of \nDefense a clear set number, getting it to them by October 1st, so they know how much money they have to spend \nand are prepared to go forward. That's critically important and we've made a lot of progress on this. \n\nSo, if you're argument between $750 billion and $733 billion, I can certainly see an argument. I can't see a winter of \ndespair over the fact that we've gotten up to $733 billion when the budget cap number is, I believe $576 million. We \nhave had a significant increase in defense spending last year, the year before that, and now into this year and when \nGeneral Dunford testified, he said that they rigorously went through their budget to come up with the $733 million \nnumber and to make sure they spent the money they needed to. \n\nNow it is a 2.4 percent increase over the budget and yes, we've have heard you need to keep it at inflation 3 to 5 \npercent. I will point out, inflation is actually 2 percent, it's not 3 to 5 percent. Wherever the 3 to 5 percent number \ncame from, I don't know, but that's not inflation by--by any particular measure and also very importantly General \nDunford said that it is a--I think 2.9 percent increase in war fighting capability. Not everything in the Pentagon needs \nto be increased and part of what I think is important and again it is not meant in a partisan way, is to make the \nDepartment of Defense efficient. I think every single member of this committee can have a lot of examples of where \nthe DOD has wasted money shamelessly. \n\n\n\nAnd we've got the scandal involving--I forgot the name of the company now, that was just blatantly overcharging for \nall manner of different parts, for years. Now-- now shame on the company for having done that. They ought to be \nheld accountable. They probably ought to go to jail. But who in the Pentagon was paying that money? Who in the \nPentagon was saying oh, sure, will give you $5000 for a--you know a screw? and if you simply give them another \n$17 billion, up which is not gone through the rigorous analysis that the $733 billion went to, it is my legitimate \nconcern that money will likely be wasted. That the Pentagon will not efficient with the dollars that they are given. \n\nSo, we're going to have this debate and we're going to have it throughout the night. But I've heard those comments \nand I just don't want members to get the impression they were somehow cutting the defense budget because we \nonly increasing it by 2.4 percent. There is a debate to be had. It's not anyone winter of discontent or some dramatic \ncut. Hopefully we're getting past the days of the CRs and the uncertainty. We'll give them a clear budget. A clear \nbudget they've plan for, for about a year. So, you know a good debate to be had but let's not act like you shouldn't \nbe able to defend the country for $733 billion. That's a fairly significant amount of money. Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just respond to a couple of the points that you raised. The ideal \nthat the Pentagon really wanted $733 billion and $750 billion was foisted upon them is false. There were a variety of \nnumbers that were talked about in the press, $733 billion, $700 billion, a variety of things. I was personally present \nin the Oval Office with the president, the vice president, the chief of staff, the national security advisor, Secretary \nMattis, and others when the in the discussion--and Senator Inhofe chairman in the Senate, when the discussion \nwas had about what would be the appropriate number for the appropriate budget request for the administration to \nmake on defense this year. \n\nAnd--and it was the agreement of everyone that the benchmark of 3 percent real growth, 3--3 to 5 percent above \nwhatever the rate of inflation is, that that is what is required in order to continue to repair readiness and to not fall \nfurther behind in critical areas from the Russians and--and the Chinese. By the way that 3 to 5 percent real growth \nwas endorsed by the National Strategy Commission which contains which included six Republican--six appointees \nof Republican, six appointees of Democrats and they unanimously endorsed that number. $750 billion is the closest \nrounded number to a 3 percent real growth. That's where it came from. That's what the Pentagon request is and \nthat's what's been endorsed by me think of a lot of the folks that many of us respect. \n\nIt is all by the way the number to which the Senate Armed Services Committee marked. So, just think about this we \ngo into a conference with the Senate where they have $17 billion more than we do plan, we're playing on their \nplaying field. If we don't have our own priorities which are there to match with theirs. And I--I worry that we talk \nabout 3 percent like it's some number that you pull out of the air. One of the reasons in the amendment that I would \nhave prepared, one of the reasons that I have specifically listed exactly where would go, is so that you can see it's \nnot 3 percent. \n\nIt's real things. For example, an aircraft carrier gets delayed a year if the underlying market at $733 million is the \nway that--that it comes out. Hypersonics. We have cut what the administration with the Defense Department \nrequested and we're behind in hypersonics. We did--the underlying mark does not include a--any money to repair \nthe hurricane damage on Tyndall, Offutt, on Camp Lejeune, and Cherry Point. I put that--that--there is nothing for \nthat in FY '20 starting October 1st. \n\nSMITH: Will the gentleman yield, on that point. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Of course. \n\nSMITH: I would be happy to include that. We--we don't have to do that because they passed the emergency bill that \nfunded $1.6 billion of the $2.3 billion that was there. It's already funded and they also in the appropriations bill we \ndon't have the projects from you for the extra $700 million, get them back to us, and then we'll do that. The only \nreason that's not in the mark is because the appropriations committee didn't. \n\nNow, when we started this process as you all know, we had not passed the disaster relief package that we passed. \nWe passed it. So, we are funding those things, just not in this bill. But they are being--being funded. \n\n\n\nTHORNBERRY: Well, we are funding them for FY '19. What we're working on his FY '20, that starts October 1st. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) \n\nTHORNBERRY: No. But--but you can't fix everything that needs to be fixed at these installations by the September \n30th. You have to have an authorization for the next phase of construction. \n\nSMITH: And--and I'm sorry but they--they don't half to spent $1.6 billion by September 30th, either, so-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: No--no, I understand but--but they also--but $1.6 billion does not fix them, does not make them \nwhole. \n\nSMITH: But again, we can talk further about this. But it is not an effort to cut. The--the money is there and were \ntrying to get it right. It's--it's not an effort to not fund those things and this--this bill--this bill does not make it any less \nlikely that those things will be funded. That piece of it is not--not accurate. The rest of what you're saying, \ndebatable. By this does not--this does not prevent the funding of--of those (INAUDIBLE--) \n\nTHORNBERRY: Well I--I--I want--I want to get my--my point is there are real concrete things that is the difference \nbetween what we can do for our troops and what we can do for the nation at $733 billion versus $750 billion. And--\nand then we have specifically laid them out on where that money would go. It's--it's not liked a number out of the air. \nIt is and--and one other key point, everything that's in my amendment is either a part of the president--the \nadministration's budget request, or an unfunded requirement that has come over from the Pentagon. This is--this is-\n-there's no extra stuff, no lightning rod issues in there. Its core defense needs that--that are in there. \n\nLet--let me make one more--one last point. You--you say, we give them $17 billion--the argument is made, I'm \nsorry. That if we give them more money, they're just going to waste it. So, the argument--so the--the--the logical \nconclusion is we cut money, they get more efficient. We saw what happened when they cut--when--when the \nDefense Department--when the defense budget went down 20 percent, accident rates went up to the highest level \never. \n\nAnd--and I completely agree with you Mr. Chairman, it has been a bipartisan effort to repair and rebuild our military. \nBut the notion that you don't get what they want and that's just going to squeeze out waste, and that has empirically \nbeen proven not to be the case. In fact, what happens is we still ask more and more of them, without giving them \nthe resources they need to do the job, and unfortunately, they suffer the consequences. \n\nSo, I hope we can get to a place where we can discuss the specifics of this amendment and the difference that it \nwould--it would make for our troops. \n\nSMITH: Well we're--we're not cutting them by 20 percent. I would agree with you, if we were doing that. And I just \nwant to clear one point, I am not for a second saying that the Pentagon is not asking for $750 billion. I mean I fully \nimagine that if we allowed them to the Pentagon $800 billion. Probably even more than that, if they had the chance. \nSo, I--I am not saying that the Pentagon is not asking for the $750 billion. I just am saying that we don't necessarily \nhave to accept what they ask for, so more to come. \n\nWe will now consider En Bloc Package number 1 and the chair recognizes Mr. Courtney, for the purposes of \noffering the En Bloc Amendment. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My friend, Mr. Whitman, quoted Charles Dickens. I'm going to quote Monty \nPython and now for something completely different. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nMr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Package number 1, consisting of amendments that have \nbeen worked and approved with the minority. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc Amendment? Without objection, \nthe amendments are considered as read. The gentleman is recognized, for five minutes, to discuss the \namendments. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En Bloc package number 1 is comprised of the following: amendment by \nMr. Banks, directing a briefing from the Navy regarding Force Structure, amendment by Mr. Garamendi, regarding a \nreport from the Navy on reducing dependence on for its--Foreign Flag Vessels, amendment by Ms. Hartzler, \nregarding a briefing on B-2 DMS, and amendment by Mr. Waltz, regarding a briefing on Strategic Weapon Systems, \nan amendment by Mr. Bergman, regarding a report and briefing on Amphibious Shipbuilding, an amendment by Mr. \nMoulton, regarding a report on Swarm Attacks, an amendment by Ms. Luria, regarding the Navy's OFRP plan, an \namendment by Mr. Courtney, regarding occupational safety, an amendment by Ms. Cheney, regarding a report on \nC130-Hs, an amendment by Mr. Gallagher, regard--regarding B-52 Engine Sustainment, an amendment by Mr. \nKelly, regarding C-17 Sustainment. \n\nSMITH: Is there any discussion on the En Bloc Amendments? Mr. Banks. \n\nBANKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In 1940 that chairman of the House of Naval Affairs Committee Carl Vinson, \nintroduced the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Congressmen Vinson's portrait hangs on the wall of this committee chamber. \nThough it was pre-World War II this bill eventually passed the House of Representatives by an incredible vote of \n316 to 0. This bill increased the size of the Navy by 70 percent. Authorizing billions of dollars to fortify our national \ndefense and to pursue maritime supremacy. This increase was made just in time. As in less than three years the \nUnited States would join World War II and the strength of our Navy was the backbone that led to Allied Victory. \n\nI believe we are in an equally dangerous situation today, as what we were in 1940. We are engaged in both a great \npower competition with Russia and China while also facing increased threats from around the world. I think as most \nof you agree the National Defense Strategy is a Maritime Strategy. That--that's why I'm really proud to have a \nprovision based on the Five Oceans Navy Strategy that introduced earlier this year, included in this package, that \ncalls for a larger long-term force structure and holds this administration accountable to address these challenges \nand specifically focus on the need for presence in the Arctic and the importance of submarines. \n\nAs the administration has failed to meet their commitment of making any progress at all toward building a 355 ship \nNavy. I'm thankful that this committee recognizes the necessity of a strong and powerful Navy--Navy and hopefully \nwe can continue in Chairman Vinson's footsteps, preparing our nation for whatever lies ahead. With that, Mr. \nChairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the En Bloc Amendment? Hearing none, the adoption on the En bloc--the questions \non the adoption of the En Bloc Package, all those in favor say Aye? \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. We will now consider log number 493, by Mr. \nCourtney, and I recognize Mr. Courtney--well, sorry, for what purpose does the gentleman from Connecticut seek \nrecognition? \n\nCOURTNEY: I have--an amendment Mr. Speaker, at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment and without objection we will dispense with the reading of the \namendment and the chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut, for five minutes, to discuss the amendment. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you. Mr. chairman, this amendment clarifies a provision in the mark regarding the Air Force \nOne program and as I mentioned in my opening remarks one of the things our subcommittee has been doing is \ntrying to exercise more oversight with a whole variety of different programs regarding Air Force One which is part of \nour projection forces mission. \n\nFor example, earlier this year, we learned of the fact that the Air Force was proposing to spend $25 million on the \nrefrigeration system for the existing fleet of Air Force--two Air Force One aircraft. Even though by the time that \n\n\n\nwould have been installed the shelf life of those planes would be about three or four years. We raised this issue \nwith the secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson our former colleague, and to her credit she looked into it and--\nand canceled that $25 million expenditure. Which again really didn't add up in any just common sense wise. \n\nWhat this amendment does is also look at the new contract for the new replacement Air Force One planes, which \nare was signed last July 2018. Again, it was a fixed-price contract for $3.9 billion. Credit to President Trump. He \nnegotiated a deal good deal with Boeing to get these two planes that were supposed to go to a Russian airline that \nwent bankrupt. But again, within that contract it has over and above language which basically allows the fixed price \nto be really almost rendered moot in terms just additional add-ons. And as we saw with refrigeration this is not just \nspeculation, this--this is actually is a trend that is unfortunately we have to keep an eye on. \n\nSo, there are two provisions that are in the over and under. Again no one would dispute the fact that if there's \nadditional cost regarding essential core functions of the Air Force One in terms of communications equipment, \nkeeping the plane secure, making sure that it can perform its critical mission in terms of the you know commander-\nin-chief for our country. Again, if there are needs to go over and above you know that is definitely something that we \nrecognize and protect. \n\nHowever, there are other less essential items regarding the paint and interior decorating of the plane. Which again \nwe know there's a lot scrolling around out there about ways that we may see a different looking both interior and \nexterior Air Force One. Again I--I would just note for the members during this in--within the contractor is a process \nfor developing the paint for the exterior of the plane. There is in fact a committee that has been working and has \nsubmitted different versions, which is basically to keep the plane exactly the way it is, to maybe make some \nmodifications and a more extreme modification which showed that advisory committee rejected option three and \nsupported options one and two. \n\nAgain, the president will have an opportunity to make some--some suggestions and changes to--to the plain but we \ndo want to keep this within the parameters of the existing contract process so that again were not creating \nadditional costs for the operation of the plane. Additional paint can add weight to the plane. Additional fixtures inside \nthe plane can also add you know cost to--to the--in delays to the--to the delivery of the plane. I think any of us who \nhave flown on Air Force One and had that opportunity knows that it is a well-appointed plane and it's--it will be a \nwell-appointed plane when the new ones a rollout in 2025. \n\nAnd again, what we're trying to do is just to make sure that the over and above clause provisions of the Air Force \nOne contract does not become basically a backdoor for the--the program to hemorrhage in terms of additional \ncosts. Again, this amendment clarifies that point. It was legitimate question that was raised by my colleague Mr. \nWittman, that again it was too broadly written when it came out of subcommittee in the mark and again hopefully at \nleast at this particular modification would be one that everyone can agree. We're--we're making more precise in \nterms of what are fewer essential aspects of the--of the new Air Force One and with that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Wittman. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I will have to oppose this amendment and I--I want to go back to the things \nwe did last year in FY '18. Specifically, in Section 211, that sections entitled Cost Controls for Presidential Aircraft \nRecapitalization Program. In there we had already locked in the configuration and cost control. So, things were--\nhave already been set and what if--if we're talking about now making a change since we are already well into the \nprocess of configuring the aircraft, of pricing the materials for the aircraft, and acquiring materials for the aircraft \nthose things the Air Force says will create severe cost and schedule risk to the VC-25B program. \n\nSo, if for talking about saving cost, this actually really doesn't achieve that. We are very specific and last year's \nmark about how those things take place. There're also significant things that happened along the process. If you \nlook at how you integrate systems in an aircraft, there's complexity there and remember the requirements of this \naircraft was written back in the 1980s. So, you can expect based on that requirement and what we see today you \ncan expect that there will be changes. This amendment unfortunately creates a problem with that. It creates a \nproblem for us to integrate what needs to be done to the aircraft and creates additional costs that come along with \nthat. \n\n\n\nAlso, this is in addition to what's already existing now, which is a reprogramming slow down. The request of \nhundred $41 million to be reprogrammed has not been acted upon. So, if you combine this element of now getting \ninto restrictions on the acquisition elements of the aircraft along with the slowdown of dollars that come towards \ngetting this aircraft up and going under construction and--and system integration. We see a whole realm of things \nthat create cost--I think cost increases and schedule increases. So with that I would--I would have to oppose this \namendment because I do think that it was adequately addressed last year with very specific cost controls and with \nvery specific configuration elements about how we lock that in and that's why we have a fixed-price contract \nbecause of the certainty created with that. \n\nBYRNE: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Byrne. \n\nBYRNE: Thank you sir. I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from Connecticut. He and I worked together \non a lot of things, but I look at this amendment and it looks like an attempt to just poke at the president. Every year \nin the Trump administration, we've had to debate amendments that strike directly at the office of the president. Prior \nto 2017, I don't recall attempt to block things like paint colors. The President negotiated a great deal that has led to \n$1.4 billion in savings for new Air Force One's. The over and above clause exists in many DOD contracts and is \nused to anticipate changes with new equipment and address integration challenges that couldn't have been \naddressed in the original contract. \n\nWe all have enough experience with procurement to know things always come out and it's good to have some \nflexibility to handle it. My colleagues will try to argue that changes in paint and trimmings add to the cost of the \naircraft. However, their solution has many unintended consequences that could derail the whole program. Reducing \nthis over the and above clause to only paint colors and trimmings trivializes the role of this clause just because the \nmajority wants to impede the president at every turn and has nothing to do with advocating responsible government \nor advancing the interests of the American people. \n\nThese things just don't belong in the halls of Congress and we owe it to the taxpayers to get to work on real--\nissues. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) discussion on the amendment? Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: I think were dancing around the reality here. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nThis amendment is pretty clear. It deals with let's see relating to aircraft paint scheme, interiors, and livery. Well \nthis get right to the heart of the matter here. The Air Force One plane is iconic. It is known throughout the world. It \nhas been the representation of the power of the United States, the power of the president. It is used in diplomatic \nand in international relations as the United States has arrived. It is the symbol, along with the flag, and a few other \nthings of this nation and there has been discussion hopefully mostly in jest. But maybe not the scheme that is the \nvisual scheme of the airplane is to be changed. \n\nThis amendment goes to that and it says if such an idea actually does exist it's going to come back here for review. \nMy personal view of this is, Air Force One represents this nation. The world knows what it is when the president \narrives. This president or any other president and this plan is going to be around for the next 20 to 30 years, so let's \nkeep that in mind and if someone wants to change its appearance, it schemes, then we ought to have a say about. \nPersonally, I think we ought to stay with what we have. \n\nNow with regard to livery. I'm not sure this has to do with saddles and things of that sort bridles in the like which is \nprobably the way I would describe livery but, nonetheless. I suspect that's interior fixtures. They're going to be good, \nprobably the best. Are they going to be gold-plated? I hope not. But if somebody wants them to be gold-plated, \ncome back here and tell us why it ought to be that way. We've had issues about this in the past. This amendment is \nso simple. It basically says spend your money wisely on interiors, and livery, and the scheme of the plane. If \n\n\n\nsomebody wants to change it, come on back here and let's talk about it. That's basically it, so why are we debating \nthis? It's a good amendment. Thank you, Joe, for introducing it. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) hearing this, all in favor will say Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nWITTMAN: Mr. Chairman, I asked for a recorded vote. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) Recorded so is repressed and we will (INAUDIBLE) \n\nWITTMAN: Yes. Mr. Chairman, I have a--a motion at the desk. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) The clerk will (INAUDIBLE--) \n\nWITTMAN: Or amendment at the desk I should say, excuse me. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) Without objection (INAUDIBLE) the chair recognizes the gentleman to discuss. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is the counter to--to--to Mr. Courtney's amendment and again I--I--I \nhave tremendous admiration for the chairman and the--and the work that he does. This is only one of a tiny area \nwhere there might be some differences of--of opinion. This amendment just strikes the language that includes paint \nand interior finishes on the configuration control. Again we--we talked about already having those cost controls in \nplace. I think the arguments and debate have been had in the previous debate on Mr. Courtney's amendment and \nagain I present this to the committee for their consideration. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) Mr. Courtney. \n\nCOURTNEY: Just very briefly. Again, just when the contract was signed last July, again what was part of that whole \nsort of document and--and package was a report called the Phase 2 Aircraft Livery and Paint Study Final Report. \nThat was actually prepared in 2017, because this thing had been ongoing since the President--again as I am the \nfirst to acknowledge cut a good deal with you know just the purchase of just the--the basic planes for $3.9 billion. \n\nAgain that's a report which if I really any members really want to take a look at it you're more than welcome to \nbecause you will see that we are not handcuffing the Air Force and Boeing into exactly the same version of the \nplane in--in that was the Air Force One that's been replaced. There is some flexibility in there and terms of making \nsome modifications but it's within basically the parameters of the contract and that does not require over and above \nspending and--and really that's really the crux of this is that you know as we saw with the refrigeration the--this \nprogram can--can spiral out of control in terms of extra costs--significant cost which even again Secretary Wilson \nhad to intervene to--to cease and stop when she was act--when she was the Air Force Secretary. \n\nSo again, with a--the greatest respect for my friend the Ranking Member, again I oppose this amendment and again \nallow this--contract to--to continue to move forward. By the way if there is an over or above expenditure in these \nareas that's going to slow the--the production and delivery of the plane. This thing is moving along right now with \nthe report that I mentioned earlier and--and that will keep this plane's delivery on track. Which by the way needs to \nactually happen? The--the existing plane is old and needs to be replaced. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Just a quick comment on this. We're--we're really not trying to poke the president on this. In \nfact, as I understand it these planes are not even going to be delivered until late 2024-2025. This--this president is \nnot going to fly on this plane, under any circumstances. So, it's as I understand it, we are simply trying to exercise \nour oversight responsibilities to try to save the taxpayers money, but. \n\nAny further discussion? All right. We are now done with the mark and we will move-- \n\nJOHNSON: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) vote on this one. \n\nSMITH: Oh, I'm sorry. What order do we go? We have two amendments, do we--is the last first or is the first first? \n\n\n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) Call (INAUDIBLE) \n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) Voice on Wittman first. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Ah, we're going to vote on-- \n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) No voice. \n\nSMITH: Oh, sorry. Good point. I was assuming something. All those in favor of Mr. Whitman's amendment will say \nAye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no? \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it and the amendment is defeated. And it is now in order to consider the \namendments which we delayed process on. (OFF-MIC) Were done with amendments correct? So, were going to \nproceed to those amendments where a roll call vote was ordered. I believe there was one and that is the \namendment by Mr. Courtney, number 493,--sorry, I'm kind of ad-libbing at the same time read and that doesn't \nwork. The committee postponed further proceedings on that amendment which is a log number 493, offered by Mr. \nCourtney, and were now going to resume those proceedings and the question occurs on the amendment and the \nclerk will call the role. Again, this is Mr. Courtney's amendment number 493. Everybody with me on this? Questions, \ncomments, first rollcall. All right. Let's go. The clerk will call the role. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Chairman, votes aye. Mr. Thornberry? \n\nTHORNBERRY: (OFF-MIC) No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Thornberry, votes no.

The clerk will report the tally, whenever she is ready. \n\nCLERK: Chairman, on this vote the ayes are 31 and the no's are 26. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut, Mr. Courtney, for the purposes of a motion. \n\nCOURTNEY: Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt the subcommittee report of the Subcommittee on Seapower and \nProjecting Forces as--as amended. \n\nSMITH: Questions on the motions from the gentleman from Connecticut? All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? The quorum being present, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. \n\nThe committee will now receive the report of the subcommittee on readiness pursuant to Committee Rule 17, and in \nconsultation with the ranking member. We will postpone all of the recorded votes on the amendments to this \nparticular subcommittee mark until consideration of all members of the subcommittee mark has been completed-- \n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) Have you ever seen-- \n\nSMITH: And gentleman from the chair recognizes the California, Mr. Garamendi, for any comments he would like to \nmake. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Chairman Smith. It's an honor to offer the Readiness Subcommittee Portion for the mark \nfor the full committee's consideration. I'd like to start by thanking my colleague Congressman Doug Lamborn, the \nranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, for his partnership in developing the subcommittee's mark. I also \nlike to thank the members both Democrat and Republican who worked hard on this offering substantial \namendments and suggestions and a big thank you to all of the stuff that worked on at it. \n\nThe jurisdiction of the greatest subcommittee is broad, touching on topics related to military training, maintenance, \nlogistics, operations, infrastructure, and civilian personnel. The mark is therefore before the members takes a \nnumber of steps uphold this committee's responsibility to conduct oversight and provide appropriate funding and \npolicy authorities to support the readiness of the forces. In the interest of time I will focus on three key areas the \nsubcommittee addressed in the mark. \n\nFirst, fixing the problems associated with the management and oversight of military family housing. Second, \nrequiring the Department of Defense to plan for the threats posed by climate change and third, addressing drinking \nwater contamination resulting from fluorinated compounds used around military installations. At the beginning of the \n\n\n\nCongress, the Readiness Subcommittee heard great testimony from the spouses of servicemembers who detailed \ntheir experiences with the management, the oversight, and the conditions of privatized military housing. \n\nTo direct the issues that been raised this mark authorizes an additional $148.8 million to hire additional personnel to \nstrengthen the oversight and management of military family housing. Also establishes a tenets Bill of Rights for the \nresidents and it prohibits the use of nondisclosure agreements in connection with entering into the continuing or the \ntermination of leases. I'd like to thank my colleague Ms. Speier, for many of--the suggestions that are now in this \nmark. \n\nWith respect to climate change two years ago this committee was first to acknowledge the threat of climate change \nposes to national security. Building on this mark, the requires the military to begin planning for the threats posed by \nclimate change. It requires installation master plans to identify and plan for climate vulnerabilities and to develop \nmitigations. \n\nIt limits the department's ability to spend planning and design funds until it begins the process of updating building \nstandards for military construction to promote energy, climate, and cyber resiliency. It requires all proposed military \nconstruction projects to consider potential long-term changes in environmental conditions and increasingly frequent, \nextreme weather events. In addition, the mark authorizes $190 million, 40 million more than in the budget request \nfor the department's energy resilience and conservation investment programs. \n\nOn drinking water contamination in fluorinated compounds, the mark supports the department's remediation \nactivities and puts policies in place to eliminate future sources of contamination. Specifically, the mark provides an \nadditional $121.3 million in environmental restoration accounts four remediation activities and authorizes the \nNational Guard to access The Fence environmental remediation accounts for the purpose of addressing \ncontamination related to poor for native carbon chemicals. \n\nIn addition, the mark prohibits the release of fluorinated firefighting foam at military installations accept in cases of \nemergency responses and bands the department from using fluorinated firefighting foam after 2029. In addition, \nthese--to these issues the readiness subcommittee continued its vital oversight. For example, the mark authorizes \n$256 billion, $8.8 billion increase over fiscal 2019 authorizing levels for operation and maintenance accounts. \n\nI am almost out of time so I'm going to let it go at that to say we spent a lot of time on the readiness issues and they \nwill be in the version of--the written version of the report. I'm proud that the funding authorized by the legislative \nprovisions in the readiness mark. I believe the mark ensures Congress fulfills his overnight--oversight responsibility \nand enhances our readiness goals and drives the department to plan for and take action against long-term threats. \nAgain, I want to thank Ranking Member Lamborn for his partnerships. All the members of the subcommittee for \ntheir contribution and I urge my colleagues to support the mark. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The ranking member on the readiness subcommittee, Mr. Lang--Mr. Lamborn, is now \nrecognized for five minutes. \n\nLAMBORN: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we consider the readiness subcommittee's \nportion of the mark, I would like to also thank my colleague Chairman John Garamendi, for his leadership and for \nthe bipartisan way in which the subcommittee completed our mark. I would also like to thank our hard-working staff \nfor their contribution. \n\nOur men and women in the armed forces deserve the very best training, equipment, and support that we as a \nnation can provide. I believe it was Omar Bradley who said amateurs talk about strategy, professionals talk about \nlogistics. So, what we do in readiness is critical and I appreciate that. As a nation again faces the challenge of great \npower competition, we have to ensure that our forces are stronger and better trained than our adversaries both \ntoday and tomorrow and it is truly an honor to be here today making that happen. \n\nFirst the good in the mark. We have done some great work in areas that are important to our servicemembers and \ntheir families and to the communities that neighbor our military installations. This mark with among other things \ndirect the Department of Defense to report on steps being taken to improve availability and accountability of F-35 \n\n\n\nparts, fund all of the military construction projects submitted by the service chiefs in their unfunded requirements \nlist, prohibit the use of nondisclosure agreements in privatized military family housing, and direct military to have a \nTenets Bill of Rights for residents, improve the resilience of military installations without imposing unreasonable \nbureaucratic requirements, direct the United States Transportation Command to prepare a business case for the \nproposed award of the global household goods contract, and require the establishment of an Advisory Council to \nensure the voices of all stakeholders including servicemembers and their families are heard. \n\nGiven the scope of that contract, I also believe it is prudent for the government accountability office to review that \nbusiness case analysis. And finally, the mark directs the Department of Defense to be all use of fluorinated \nfirefighting foams by 2029. It prohibits uncontrolled release of these foams, except during emergencies. \n\nNow the areas in the mark where we have to do better. The services have made significant headway to recover lost \nreadiness since we began to increase funding in 2017. Regrettably this mark does not support the $750 billion top \nline in the president's 2020 budget request. The mark does not fund almost $2 billion requested in key readiness \naccounts for operations, depo-maintenance, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization activities. \n\nRegrettably the mark does not provide $2.3 billion to fund disaster relief for 2020 to make badly needed repairs at \nTyndale and Offutt Air Force bases in Camp Lejeune. The mark also fails to restore $3.6 billion for military \nconstruction that will be diverted to address the crisis on our Southwest border. On the border, Customs and \nBorder Patrol or CBP, apprehended over 132,000 people at the Southwest border last month alone. \n\nIt is indisputable that we have a crisis on our hands in CBP is overwhelmed. Not only have we in Congress failed to \naddress the loopholes in our immigration laws that draw people here illegally. We have also failed to provide law \nenforcement with the resources they need to manage the crisis. \n\nAll that being said there are many good things in this mark. We will be debating more those issues later in the day. I \nwould recommend adoption of the readiness mark and I look forward to a robust debate on the funding top line and \nthe made--the major omissions that are still in the mark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime. \n\nSMITH: For the discussion? I was just coming quickly, again. Since the--the readiness numbers came up on \nemergency the funding. We--we are 100 percent going to fund the emergency needs for disaster relief and as \npointed out, we passed the Disaster Relief Package with $1.6 billion, which fulfills the needs. There's a request in \nthere for the additional $700 million that they say what they need it for exactly and when they give us those projects \nwe'll moving forward. But when it comes to the emergency relief this--this committee has never done emergency \nfunding. It goes to through appropriations process and we'll work their appropriators to make sure it gets done. But \nI want to make sure that everyone on this committee knows we--we are funding that--that relief without question. \n\nFurther--further discussion on the Readiness Mark? Hearing none, we will move to En bloc package number 1 and \nthe chair recognizes Mr. Garamendi for the purposes of offering the En Bloc Amendment's. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Package number 1, consisting of \namendments that have been worked out with the approval of both the majority and the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk--(OFF-MIC) both sides of the paper--please distribute the En \nBloc Amendments and without objection, the amendments are considered as read. The gentleman is recognized for \nfive minutes to discuss the En Bloc Package. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Amendment number 1, by Mr. Turner, which regard--with regard to the \nU.S. Air Force basing processes. Amendment number 78, by Mr. Cook, concerning the sale of electricity from \nalternate energy and cogeneration production facilities. Amendment number 94, by Ms. Torres Small, regarding \ncommunity--excuse me, Ms. Torres Small, regarding community infrastructure and electric cooperatives. \nAmendment number 131, by Mr. Wittman, regarding planned reductions to fire emergency services at military \ninstallations. Amendment number 147, by Ms. Horn, regarding Working Capital Funds for Military Construction \nProjects. Amendment number 155, by Mr. Garamendi, regarding Army Reserve Military Construction Projects. \n\n\n\nAmendment number 156, by Mr. Garamendi, regarding the Department of Defense's Efforts on Corrosion \nPrevention. Amendment 199, by Mr. Mitchell, regarding the Army's potential for fielding commercial off-the-shelf \nrinse systems for tactical aircraft. Amendment number 204, by Ms. Slotkin--Slotkin, regarding Aqueous Film \nFoaming--Aqueous Film Forming Foam Prevention Training Exercises-- \n\nSMITH: Say that five times fast \n\nGARAMENDI: And please, no three in a row word. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nAmendment number 258, by Mr. Norcross, regarding or requiring a Standard for Sustainment Cost. \n\nSMITH: Is there discussion of the En Bloc Amendment? \n\nGARAMENDI: Who wrote that? Film foam-- \n\nSMITH: Sorry, I've got a bunch of hands up here. Ms. Torres Small. \n\nTORRES SMALL: Thank you, Mr. chairman. My amendment seeks to modify the definition of community \ninfrastructure to include not--not-for-profit utilities. First authorized in last year's NDAA, the Defense Community \nInfrastructure Pilot Program plays an important part in preserving military readiness by giving the secretary of \nDefense the ability to invest in infrastructure on or near an installation. That's because as an installation grows \nmany resources used by the military and the surrounding communities are often pushed beyond capacity. This \nincludes roads and bridges, schools, emergency services, and utilities which supply essential safety resilience and \nreadiness for our sick servicemembers. The program recognizes the critical role of community infrastructure and \nhelps communities fill the funding gap to make investments which enhance quality of life. \n\nHowever, the program only allows for funds to be applied to projects owned by states or local government. This \nmeans that a key provider of services to our military installations not-for-profit, profit member owned utility service is \nalso known as cooperatives or co-ops. Electric co-ops serve more than 50 percent of the country's land mass and \nare particularly important in rural areas including those that host military installations. Electric co-ops are a vital \npartner to the installations that they serve, and we will hinder the rest--readiness and resiliency of those installations \nif we do not provide co-ops with the same resources to maintain and upgrade their electrical infrastructure. \n\nExpanding the definition of community infrastructure to include not-for-profit member owned utilities is necessary to \nthe readiness and resilience of our military installation--institution--installation. I appreciate the committee's support \nof the amendment in the En Bloc Package. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) \n\nLAMBORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll just speak briefly on log number 204. I'm a Cosponsor with \nRepresentative Slotkin on this amendment and I have a community that was affected and is being affected by poor \nfluorinated compounds used from firefighting foam and of Fountain Colorado is the very devastated by this chemical \nand has had to take a tremendous number of financial steps to try to mitigate that damage. So, it is good that we \nare codifying the existing policy that in training exercises this substance won't be used anymore. \n\nIt can be used in needs to be used until we find an alternative for true emergencies. But for optional kinds of \ntraining, we're not going to use it. So that's what this amendment does. It's a good one and I would urge its support. \nThank you and I yield back. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) En Bloc? Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: A question for Mr. Lamborn. Are you the one that wrote two, three-F words in a--in a row here? \n\n\n\nFilm forming foam \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nLAMBORN: (OFF-MIC) (INAUDIBLE) \n\nGARAMENDI: Specifically, to cause me to tie my tongue up. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nYield back. \n\nSMITH: All right. If not, the question is on the adoption of the En Bloc Package offered by Mr. Garamendi. So many \nof us in favor will say aye? \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. It is now--yeah--will now consider log number 324, by \nMs. Haaland, and for what purposes does the gentlewoman seek recognition? \n\nHAALAND: Thank you, chairman. I would like to put forth my amendment to strike-- \n\nSMITH: For future reference all you have to say is I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nHAALAND: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Very go. We will learn together. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWill the clerk please distribute the amendment? And without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the \namendment and the gentleman is recognized for five minutes to discuss her amendment. \n\nHAALAND: Thank you, chairman. The federal government has an obligation to consult with tribes based on--Indian \ntribes based on the trust responsibility of the government to government relationship between our federal \ngovernment and Indian tribes. This is a relationship established the treaty negotiations and executive orders and \nupheld by many federal court decisions. Tribal consultation is not an optional or discretionary matter for agencies to \nwaive. As we've seen previously in other federal agencies minimal efforts have been set forth to conduct tribal \nconsultation which varies from agency to agency. \n\nThis clause is struck from the amendment to further prevent arbitrary decisions by federal agencies when it comes \nto consultation requirements. It establishes consistency and removes subjective determinations on the meaning. \nTribes are sovereign nations and the federal government has an obligation to uphold the trust responsibility which is \nnot a power reserved for a singular individual. Tribal consultation honors the government to government relationship \nthat the United States has with tribes to detail early tribal involvement that implicates tribal interests. If impacts to \ntribes or treaty rights are identified late in the game. It is often extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to \nmeaningfully and sufficiently mitigate the impacts. \n\nThis leads to unanticipated cost and delays which could be avoided with proper tribal consultation the provision \nenhances oversight of the committee will be made aware of potential impacts, the work being done to medicate \nthose impacts, and an estimated cost of mitigation at the time of the budget request. And with that I would \nencourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? \n\nBISHOP: Yes. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Mr. Bishop. \n\nBISHOP: Thank you. Look this particular amendment actually takes--strikes the only limitation effective that you \nhave in the underlying base language that has been added to this particular bill. And here's the problem Ms. \nHaaland is exactly right in wanting to have consultation. Consultation is a good. It's just the underlying language as \nwell as this amendment, does not provide the methodology for getting there. \n\nIn fact, we suggested that not only should they be consultation with the Native American tribes but also consultation \nwith states and local governments as well and unfortunately the majority staff on the resource committee would \nallow us to debate that issue. They would give a waiver for that only for this particular language which is sad there \nis consultation mandated now under the Nepal Law. It has to happen. \n\nThe problem is there is really no definition of what constitutes consultation and how you go about it. Which is why it \nwould be good to actually talk about this entire issue together in the larger broad you actually deal with states and \nlocal governments as well as Native American tribes and that's where the methodology comes in. It is not actually \nadded in the rest of the base bill for this. It also has a couple of lines that are extremely problematic because in the \nbase that's--that's--that is here it says you will have to have consultation for any potential adversarial impact to tribal \nlands.  \n\nSadly, an element is has ever defined here or anywhere else what an adversarial act actually is and we're not even \ntalking about a real adversarial act, it's the potential of an adversarial act. In addition to not only the--the tribal lands \nthat are easily defined but to other lands culturally connected to an Indian tribe. Which may or may not be part of \ntheir traditional lands. It may or may not be part of a reservation. it could be thousands of miles away.  \n\nOnce again, the language is there, the concept is good, the idea is good. but we have missed in the definitional \nprocess which is going to provide all sorts of problems in the future. that's why the Department of Defense is \nsupposed to this entire concept because it is ambiguous language that is going to provide more litigation in the \nfuture. providing this kind of ambiguous language allows any jerk lawyer and for the attorneys who were present I \napologize for being redundant the ability simply to sue at will \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWhich means what we really should do is go about this and try and--and narrow down the language so we can \nactually say what consultation means and what it does not mean. \n\nSMITH: Will the gentleman yield--yield, for just a minute. \n\nBISHOP: Can I--let me finish this and-- \n\nSMITH: Okay, I just wanted to-- \n\nBISHOP: Because I do want it to--to yield to Ms. Haaland for the last minute, if I could? \n\nSMITH: Okay. well I actually I think we can resolve this but go ahead.  \n\nBISHOP: Now, what--what I'm saying is we have this problem when we put what we understand and yet that \nlanguage is not clear. So, when the antiquities act was passed it was clear they were debating whether antiquities \nact power should be given the president to authorize monuments for 360 acres or 640 acres. And then someone \nsaid well you might want 800 so let's just do the smallest area reasonable. The last net designation was for 1.3 \nmillion acres. Same thing happened on the Clean Water Act when we talked about Army Corps of Engineers having \nwetland mitigation on anything that is on a navigable river.  \n\nThe They all knew what navigable rivers were--unfortunately some of the wetland regulators had said well I have an \nirrigation canal in my district and even though it would have to go uphill 30 degrees to actually make it to the Great \nSalt Lake, it could percolate into the aquifer and bubble over to the Great Salt Lake. Therefore, we have a right to \nactually--we have a right to regulate that. It comes because the language is not specific.  \n\n\n\nNow, here's what I would like to propose. This can easily pass this committee, it could probably even pass on the \nfloor but it will be something that will be marked as a controversial political issue that will go into the conference \ncommittee and it will have a difficult time of doing that unless we can all agree on both sides on what the language \ncan be to solve this particular problem. So, I would actually like to yield to Ms. Haaland to see if she would be willing \nto take-- \n\nSMITH: I could take a stab (INAUDIBLE) \n\nBISHOP: I'll yield to the Chairman to see if he would be willing to take this off the table for now so we can work on \ncoming (INAUDIBLE) some language-- \n\nSMITH: Yeah.  \n\nBISHOP: That would be acceptable everyone on the floor. \n\nSMITH: Yeah, I believe that is reasonable and I can probably--Ms. Haaland you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it \nsounds to me like there is the possibility of getting to good here. But we got to cross jurisdictional issue and its--\nand once we get to the floor, we eliminate that little pain in the butt problem and can work through that. It strikes me \nthat we would be better off not having votes on these with an agreement to work together majority minority to get an \namendment on the floor that can resolve the issue. Or am I missing something? Ms. Haaland. \n\nHAALAND: Thank you, chairman. I would just like to say that tribal consultation has been in the--I mean we've been \ndebated that for centuries and--and I also would like to say that tribes do not have the same status as state \ngovernments or local governments. I mean in fact I would just like to point out that we're sitting on Indian land right \nthis minute. So, I believe that tribes of--of any other--entity in this country-- \n\nSMITH: Right. \n\nHAALAND: Deserve to be consulted and this actually is not ambiguous it just strikes One, two, three, four, six \nwords from--from-- \n\nSMITH: I--I don't-- I could be wrong but I don't think Mr. Bishop is saying that your amendment is ambiguous, I think \nthat he is saying that the underlying language is--is ambiguous. And so, your amendment does--doesn't affect that \nand I will completely acknowledge by the way that in any negotiation around there's tribes are different from state \nand local governments without question. It must be handled differently.  \n\nI'm just thinking that we can get to a better place on perfecting the entire amendment and not just this piece of it if \nwe were to withdraw your amendment, Mr. Bishop's, and then negotiate. Let me also say that we have the option if \nthere's not a satisfactory resolution to that when we get to the full committee portion of this mark that we can revisit \nthe issue and if you want to offer an amendment. If we don't get to a satisfactory resolution, we can offer that at the \nfull committee later on tomorrow morning. Sorry-- \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nNot to be a pessimist there but is--is--is that amenable. Can we work on that for a little bit? \n\nHAALAND: That--Yes. Yes, chairman that-- \n\nBISHOP: Mr. Chairman.  \n\nHAALAND: I'll withdrawal it, for now. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Well, thank--thank you. \n\nBISHOP: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Yes, Mr. Bishop. \n\n\n\nBISHOP: Okay and I appreciate what you're trying to do and accomplish because this is an area that does not have \nto be a controversy. I think we're all talking about. However, I will emphasize that the language I just read that is \nproblematic to which the Pentagon opposes is in the base bill, the base mark. \n\nSMITH: I--I--Yeah. I--I said-- \n\nBISHOP: So, I'll be more than happy if-- \n\nSMITH: Great. \n\nBISHOP: If Ms. Haaland wants to--withdraw her amendment, to withdraw my amendment to strike the entire thing \nunder the understanding that we will still work together-- \n\nSMITH: Done. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman.  \n\nBISHOP: Before it comes before us to solve the problem. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: We're--a we're rapidly marching into an important part of the underlying market self. Ms. Haaland's \namendment deals with a very narrow piece of the--of the law--existing law and the mark that we have before us. \nShe basically is talking about when the military must engage with the-- \n\nSMITH: John. \n\nGARAMENDI: Local tribe. If I might?  \n\nSMITH: Yeah. \n\nGARAMENDI: I am very much opposed to changing the underlying mark. Now Ms. Haaland has removed her \namendment, that's fine \n\nSMITH: Yeah. \n\nGARAMENDI: But to now change the underlying mark would be troublesome.  \n\nSMITH: Right and We--we--we--we will not do any of that without--without your--your approval, without question. \n\nGARAMENDI: I would appreciate that. \n\nSMITH: But like I said it just seems to me like we have the possibility at least of having a broader discussion and \nmay be getting us in point and if we don't, we'll--we'll take another swing at it later. But there's a lot of detail here to \nwork out so we'll task the staff to get to work on that and see if we can't--can't accomplish that. So, we'll have both \nof those amendments withdrawn, without objection. \n\nBISHOP: Once again under the assumption-- \n\nSMITH: Yeah. \n\nBISHOP: Again, Mr. Chairman, that we will work to try and fix the underlying language that is the problem. \n\nSMITH: Right. Yeah, now we--we will try. I--the only thing I want to be clear about is I cannot guarantee you we will \nsucceed but we--we will try. \n\n\n\nBISHOP: And I appreciate that immensely. Once again realizing that if we don't succeed in coming up with a \ncommon language this will be decided in conference committee where then passage would be very problematic. \nEspecially with the Pentagon's opposition to it. \n\nSMITH: Okay. So, we are now I believe going to En Bloc Package number 2. Chair recognizes Mr. Garamendi for \nthe purposes of offering the En Bloc Amendment. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc Amendment  number 2 \nconsisting of amendments that have been worked out by both the minority and the majority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc Amendment? Without objection \nthe amendments are considered as read. The gentleman's recognized for five minutes. Before he speaks, there is \noh, joy a procedural vote on the floor, so as soon as were done with this En Bloc Amendment we will break. There \nwill eventually be lunch, over there. If you could go and vote and come back as quickly as possible, we'll start back \nup. But we're going to get through this En Bloc first.

Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry I would like to thank you both \nand also staff for working with me to address--actually I'm--I'm--I'm seeing that I might be slightly out of order, Mr. \nChairman.  \n\nSMITH: That's all right, fine. No discussion, all those in favor En Bloc number 2 say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? The aye's have it. The amendment is adopted. We are now going to take a brief recess. We can \nall go over and vote and then we will resume. We are in recess. \n\n(RECESS) \n\n[*]SMITH: And we are now going to consider En Bloc Package number 3 and I recognize Mr. Garamendi for the \npurpose of offering the En Bloc Amendment. John? Hello? \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, my mother told me not to eat fast. \n\nSMITH: Oh, sorry. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nGARAMENDI: Ten seconds. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up on En Bloc Package number \n3 consisting of amendments that have been worked out and approved with both majority of the minority. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc Amendment? Without objection, \nthe amendments are considered as read. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, Amendment number 73R3 by Mr. Larsen on the Firefighting Property Program. \nAmendment 77R1 by Mr. Cook on Delivering Two Low-Time Serviceable FA-18s to the--to NASA Armstrong Flight \nResearch Center.

Amendment 381 by Mr. Kim regarding \nthe Testing of Installations Energy Resiliency Systems. That completes the En Bloc. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) is there further discussion on the En Bloc Package? Hearing none (INAUDIBLE) motion--I'm \nsorry, Ms. Torres Small. \n\nTORRES SMALL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak quickly on my amendment directing the Secretary of \nDefense to provide a report on the State of Unexploded Ordnance on Indian Reservations. Many tribal lands in the \nUnited States were formally used as test sites for explosive weapons. Greatly affecting the safety and well-being of \ntribes now living on these lands. These hazardous materials present both a safety risk to those living on Indian \nreservations and environment--environmental risks to the land itself. \n\nIn my district, many tribes including the Laguna, Akamai, and Sunni Pueblos, Mescalero, Apache, and Navajo \nNation are already doing the work of removing unexploded bombs from their lands with little to no help from the \nfederal government. The cleanup and removal of--unexploded ordinances left by the military is a federal \nresponsibility. Getting this report will help the committee understand the full extent of that obligation and guide what \nfinancial resources should be provided to the tribes for ordinance removal. Mr. Chairman thank you and I yield \nback. \n\nSMITH: Is there any further discussion on the En Bloc Amendment. Mr. Kim. \n\nKIM: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment here is dedicated to preparing for a threat they cannot be \nstopped. It's dedicated to preparing for a threat that in my district unfortunately we know all too well. Natural--\ndisasters in both size, scope, and frequency are on the rise and we've seen it through flooding this year at military \nbases across our country. And the people in my district have seen it in the aftermath of super storm Sandy. \n\nThis amendment would require the execution of three additional black start exercises on joint military installations \nbetween now and September 2020. These exercises simulate the loss of power systems often incurred during a \nmajor natural disaster. They are a critical component of base resilience and provide a measure of security against \nthis growing and debilitating threat. \n\nFurthermore, this amendment would encourage best practices sharing among facilities to ensure that we can learn \nfrom our successes and our mistakes. Every time we learn, we become more resilient. Every time we become more \nresilient, we save money and ensure our readiness. I hope you join me towards this end and support my \namendment. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Further discussion? If not, questions on adoption the En Bloc Package offered by Mr. \nGaramendi, all those in favor say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. It is now in order to consider En Bloc Amendment \nPackage number 4 and the chair recognizes Mr. Garamendi for the purposes of offering the En Bloc Amendment. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Without objection--oh, that's your task. Let me get mine. I ask unanimous \nconsent to call up En Bloc Package number 4 consisting of amendments that have been worked on by both majority \nand minority and they have agreed. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc Amendment? Without objection, \nthe amendments are considered as a read. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes to discuss the En Bloc \nAmendment. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Amendment 475 \nregarding Direct Hiring Authorities for Certain Civilian Employees. And Amendment 497 to change the date of a \nreport related to the Defense Access Roads Programs. And that completes the En Bloc. \n\nSMITH: Yeah, is there further discussion on this En Bloc Package. Hearing none--so members in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Aye's have it. The amendment is adopted. If there are no further amendments, the chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi, for the purposes of offering a motion. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I moved to adopt the subcommittee report on readiness as amended. \n\nSMITH: The question is on the motion, all those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? (INAUDIBLE) being present to the aye's have it and the motion is adopted. And we move on. I \nalways like to point out that I remember my first time on this committee. They handed me the little sheet there and \nthere were like eight things we had to do, and I looked up and we were like two hours into it and we were done with \nfive of them and I was like cool, this is going to go quick. It's not actually the tougher stuff comes later but we are off \nto a good start. \n\nSo now, we receive the report on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel. Pursuant to Committee Rule 17, the \nconsultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all the recorded votes and the amendments to this \nparticular subcommittee marked into consideration of all the amendments to this subcommittee. The mark has \nconcluded. \n\nAnd the chair recognizes the chairwoman from the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Speier for \nany comments she would like to make. We're switching out the staff, if someone leaving there could start the clock \nbefore they go. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The military personnel subcommittee mark was adopted unanimously last \nweek, reflecting the bipartisan nature of this effort and its inclusive of many member's priorities. Ranking Member \nKelly, I want to thank for his contributions to this bipartisan effort. Provisions included in this mark and military \npersonnel provisions found in the full committee will continue to improve the lives of military service members, and \njust as importantly, their families. \n\nItems addressed by the military personnel subcommittee include funding, 3.1 percent pay raise for our service \nmembers, authorizing the department's request for end-strength, authorizing credit for reservists who serve on \n\n\n\nactive duty under Section 1234--12304B, to count towards the reduction eligibility age for retirement, and \nstandardizing new mother deployment policies at 12 months post-partum. \n\nThe mark includes several provisions to bolster the department's spousal employment promotions program, \nincreases the reimbursement amount for state licensure and certifications to $1,000 and increases access to quality \nand affordable childcare. These small authorities do make a difference for our service members and their families. \nMy visit to military installations across the country show that our service member families also make sacrifices for \nour nation and we commit to providing the care that our military families need and deserve because together, they \nserve. \n\nThe mark also continues the committee's efforts to provide support for victims of sexual assault by designating \nspecial victims counsel paralegals to assist SVCs in caring for their clients, and also expands the SVC program to \ncover eligible domestic violence victims. The mark authorizes expedited transfers to another military academy for \ncadet and midshipmen survivors of sexual assault and requires regulations for implementations of a safe to report \npolicy at military service academies, which allow sexual assault victims to report sexual assault without fear of \ndiscipline or minor collateral misconduct. Our commitment to taking care of service members and their families \nincludes ensuring quality healthcare. \n\nTo that end, this subcommittee mark includes several provisions addressing the quality of care in military treatment \nfacilities, the continued reform of the military health system, and mitigating health hazards such as lead and mold in \nmilitary housing. The full committee mark includes a provision to ensure service members have access to \nprevention and pregnancy services without having to worry about affording a co-pay when visiting a civilian network \nprovider. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I believe this mark responsibly funds the Department of Defense for fiscal year \n2020. The $733 billion is what many of my colleagues in the minority publicly requested in December. \n\nThis mark funds the end-strength of services requested and can responsibly execute without leaving billions of \ndollars on the table to be reprogrammed for non-defense items instead of addressing critical readiness issues. \nOnce again, Mr. Chairman, the staff worked in a bipartisan manner to develop the mark. I want to acknowledge the \nstaff's efforts. Craig Green (SP), Dave Cacheti (SP), Glenn Deal (SP), Jamie Jackson (SP), Dan Senate (SP), \nDanielle Staggs (SP), as well as my personal office staff, Mitch Hotberg (SP), Benjamin Broadmeadow, and \nHeather McCaslin (SP), who allows worked in a collaborative and professional manner. And with that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: (INAUDIBLE) Gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Kelly for five minutes. \n\nKELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, first of all, echo Chairwoman Speier's comments the hard work and \nbipartisanship shown by the staff. You guys were exceptional, each and every one of you on the staff--professional \nstaff here. The military subcommittee mark was adopted unanimously last week, reflecting the support and \nparticipation by all members of the subcommittee. The provisions adopted by the subcommittee build on important \nreforms established in the last Congress and provide our war fighters, military families, and retirees the necessary \nbenefits and support that they have earned. To highlight just a few items, the subcommittee recommends increases \nin end-strength for the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and an extension of special pay-in bonuses for service \nmembers in high-demand fields. \n\nAdditionally, it would require the Department of Defense to establish a common comprehensive service record of \ncomponent service members that will serve as definitive proof of service. The mark would also continue the \ncommittee's considerable work over the past several years aimed at improved spouse employment and childcare \naccess. The mark would increase the authorized reimbursement for spouse licensure from $500 to $1,000 and \nwould require the department to analyze whether the license reimbursement rates are sufficient. It would also \nexpand eligibility for the spouse tuition assistance through the My Career Advancement Program. \n\nThe mark addresses the persistent issue of military childcare access by requiring the department to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of the adequacy of on-post childcare, including the waitlist at all military installations and \nwhether additional financial assistance for childcare is required. It would also allow surviving spouses of fallen \nservice members to receive a stipend for childcare expenses. Finally, the proposed mark would continue to build on \ncritical reforms from the last Congress, including refining sexual assault prevention and response programs, \n\n\n\nproviding enhanced oversight of military health system reforms, and improving service member's access to \nbehavioral health. \n\nDespite the solid bipartisan work that went into the subcommittee mark, I'm very concerned that these important \nprovisions will be undercut by a proposed $1.23 billion cut in military personnel funding. This is a cut to the account \nthat pays for service member's pay, sustenance, bonuses, and retirement. I hope that we, at some point during the \nmarkup, have a debate on why these cuts have been proposed. In the meantime, I want to thank Chairwoman \nSpeier and my colleagues on the subcommittee for their considerable work on this mark and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you and just to be clear, member's pay is not being cut. It's being increased by 3.1 percent. Is there \nany further discussion on the mark? The hearing, then, will now consider on block package number one, and the \nchair recognizes Ms. Speier for the purpose of offering the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: En Bloc package one is comprised of the following amendments-- \n\nSMITH: --I'm sorry. Actually, there's one step we have to go on that. This is where you have to ask unanimous \nconsent to call it up. Sorry they don't have the proper paper in front of you there. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number one, consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the on block amendment. Without objection, \nthe amendments are considered as read. The gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of \ndiscussing or explaining the on block amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En Bloc one is comprised of the following: Amendment 060 by Ms. Davis, that \ndirects a report on Army active component support of the Reserve component. Amendment 092 by Ms. Torres \nSmall that would direct the SecDef to provide a report on providing maternity leave to the National Guard and \nReserve components. Amendment number 101 by Mr. Brown, that provides a casualty assistance officer to the \nfamily of ROTC graduates that have not yet reported to their first duty station in the event of their death. \n\nAmendment 011 by Mr. Turner directs the (INAUDIBLE) to submit a report of the feasibility of appointing a guardian \nad litem to represent minor victims of alleged sex-related offenses in the military courts martial process. \nAmendment 033 by myself, that creates public database with service general and flag officers, including \nbiographical information. Amendment number 014 by Mr. Turner that requires a special victims counsel be made \navailable to victims not later than 48 hours after a request for such. \n\nAmendment number 017 by Mr. Turner that increases the number of digital forensic examiners in military criminal \ninvestigation organizations. Amendment number 042 by myself that establishes a panel tasked with reviewing the \nability of the board of corrections of military records and discharge review boards to promptly process cases. \nAmendment number 103 by Mr. Brown that directs the SecDef to include questions about supremacist activities, \nextremist activities, and racism in command climate surveys, workplace and equal opportunity survey, and \nworkplace and gender relations survey. \n\nAmendment number 161 by Mr. Cook, that limits funds from being used to consolidate the defense media activity \nuntil a period of 180 days from enactment of this act. Amendment number 168 by Mr. DesJarlais, that requires the \ndepartment to submit report reviewing its policies permitting military personnel to use education benefits for non-\ntraditional, cyber-related educational programs. Amendment number 169 by Mr. DesJarlais, that requires the chief \nof the National Guard Bureau to provide a report on the National Guard's role space activities. \n\nSMITH: Now, further discussion of the En Bloc package. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Mr. Thornberry. \n\n\n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I--I want to just appreciate the work of this subcommittee and I certainly support the \nEn Bloc package. I take time just to make absolutely clear that what Mr. Kelly said a few moments ago is absolutely \naccurate. The underlying--the personnel accounts in the chairman's mark are $1.2 billion dollars less than the \nadministration requested. We can talk about whether it's justified or not, that's fine. But, it is a lower amount and--\nand that is one of the accounts that I seek to restore later today. I yield back. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: As I recall--as I recall, a couple of months ago, the president and the secretary of Defense \ntransferred a billion dollars or so out of the Army personnel account to transfer to some sort of security--I think it \nwas a wall on the border. Are we talking about the same billion dollars here? \n\nSMITH: The gentleman yields back, and that is part of our argument and part of my point about how--I mean, look, \nas the Chairman alluded to, when we cut the pentagon by 20 percent overnight without warning, that had a \ndevastating impact. There's no question about that, but we're not talking about cutting them 20 percent. \n\nWe're talking about increasing them 2.5 percent, and they're talking about increasing (INAUDIBLE) 3.5, 3 percent--\nsomething like that, a little bit more. So, there's a difference here and it is concerning that the pentagon was able to \nfind $3.6 billion dollars, including a billion dollars out of the personnel account after we had authorized it to go to \npersonnel for some other purpose. \n\nAnd it's just--money at the pentagon, it's not a zero-sum game. Efficiency matters and how they spend it does \nmatter, and I think that it's a valid point. The president took a billion dollars out of personnel and nobody seemed to \nmind. So, we--we need to be careful about the specifics on that. Further discussion on the En Bloc package? \nHearing then--all those in favor will say Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The En Bloc package is accepted and it is now in order to consider En Bloc \npackage number two. And the chair recognizes Ms. Speier for the purposes of offering the En Bloc package. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number two, consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc amendment without objection the \namendments are considered as read and the gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes. \n\nSPEIER: The En Bloc package number two is comprised of the following. Amendment number 061 by Ms. Davis \nthat directs the report on expanding tri-care benefits to include coverage to allow for medical treatment for sexual \ndysfunction related to sexual assault or harassment. Amendment number 062 by Ms. Davis that would direct a \nreport on access to healthcare services for reserve and National Guard who disclose sexual assault. \n\nAmendment number 106 by Mr. Brown, that provides a death gratuity to the family of ROTC cadets in the event of \ndeath between the time they have taken the oath, but have not reported to their first duty station. Amendment \nnumber 107R1 by Mr. Brown directs DoD to make the DD form 214 computable and machine readable. \nAmendment number 194 by Mr. Carbajal that directs SECNAV to coordinate with the Navy medical department to \nassign personnel to the Marine Recruit Training regimen at each recruit depot who are capable of determining \nwhether a recruit requires urgent care.

Chairman (INAUDIBLE) and Ranking Member Thornberry, I wanted to thank \nyou and your staff for working with me to include language in this end-block that directs the Secretary of the Navy to \naddress the lack of medical personnel within the recruit training regimens at the recruit depots. Currently, the recruit \ntraining regimen personnel do not possess training or equipment to evaluate recruits who are ill, nor are they able to \ndetermine whether an ill recruit needs emergent care. \n\nMy amendment directs the Secretary of the Navy to work with the Navy medical department to assign medically \ntrained personnel to the recruit training regimen at the Marine--at the Marine Corp recruit depots. This individual \nneeds to possess sufficient medical and training equipment to evaluate sick recruits and needs to be capable of \ndetermining whether a recruit requires emergent care. \n\nThe language also requires the Navy to ensure that such personnel is available after business hours in order to \nprovide the course of action for managing sick recruits. These recruits are young men and women who have \ndecided to serve their country voluntarily and we have a responsibility to take care of them. When there is a recruit \nwho has been ill all day and at night--and unable to function, there should be someone on staff who is medically \naware enough to initiate emergent care. \n\nWe should not be leaving sick recruits to only be watched by their fellow recruit fire watches on duty. That is \nirresponsible and our Marine recruits deserve more. Furthermore, I want to thank the committee for including \nanother one of my amendments that requests the inspector general to conduct an assessment of the deaths of \nrecruits at the Navy and Marine Corps training bases and the effectiveness of the current medical protocols on \nthese bases. \n\nAs you all know, we have a number of incredibly unfortunate losses within the Navy and the Marine Corps recruit \ncommunity. I believe it is critical to look at the causes of these deaths and go back and look at where we may have \nfailed and where we can improve in terms of medical care for our recruits. As I have said before, we have no bigger \nresponsibility than to take care of our most valuable assets, which are those men and women serving in our military \ntoday. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Hearing none. Question is one the adoption of the En Bloc package offered by Ms. \nSpeier. So many as are in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. It is now in order to consider log 044 RI by Ms. \nSpeier. For what purpose does the gentlewoman seek recognition? \n\nSPEIER: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the \namendment and the gentlelady is recognized for five minutes. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colleagues, I am speaking in support of this amendment to create a pilot \nprogram--a four-year pilot program wherein an office of the chief prosecutor would be created making binding \nreferrals, special victim's offenses in our military service academies to the superintendents. The academies are \nfacing a sexual assault crisis and we are asleep at the wheel. \n\nThis isn't a new crisis, we just tricked ourselves into believing it was getting better. It has not. What you see on this \nborder right in back of me are just a series of articles that have appeared over the last four to five years of one \ntragedy after another. One scandal after another at the academies. \n\nThe number of sexual assaults at the military service academies has more than doubled, I repeat, doubled from 327 \nto 747 from 2013 to 2018. Over that time, reporting rates decreased from 16 percent to 12 percent. Last academic \nyear, 1 in 6 women at West Point and the Naval Academy were victims of unwanted sexual contact. As were 1 in 7 \nat the Air Force Academy. Last year, half of all the female cadets and midshipmen at the academies were severely \nor pervasively harassed. None of them--none of them reported it. Unsurprisingly, only 45 percent of all female \ncadets and midshipmen trust that their academy leadership would treat them with dignity and respect if they were to \nexperience sexual assault. \n\nWhen the military released its latest report, it said--it set a familiar pattern, headlines blared out an alarm, Congress \nexpressed concern, and the academy superintendents testified in front of this committee to say there's a real a \nproblem and that \"one assault is too many.\" I don't know how many times we must go around this hamster wheel \nbefore we realize we're stuck on it. I don't doubt for a second the commitment of the superintendents to combating \nsexual assault, but they don't necessarily have the right tools. My amendment creates a four-year pilot program. It's \nan experiment. It's a tool, potentially, to create accountability, improve the credibility of the military justice system, \nand increase reporting. \n\nThe superintendents would still be in charge of combating assaults at the academies of the military justice system \nthere and of sexual assault trials specifically. The superintendents just wouldn't make prosecution determinations in \nassault cases. Last February, General Williams told the military personnel subcommittee that his most important \ntools in fighting assault were \"setting tone and expectations.\" He'd still have them, but instead of the \nsuperintendents making prosecution decisions, an objective, independent, experienced prosecutor would make a \nbinding recommendation to them. If the superintendent disagreed, he could appeal the decision to the Department \nof Defense general council. \n\nThis change would make the system more just. Commanders oftentimes have conflicts of interests between the \nsurvivor, accused, and the unit. Even when they handle this responsibility well, the fact that commanders have this \npower is complex sex--special victim's cases, undermines the credibility of the system. Though commanders have \nstaff judge advocates, I've heard from one that the lawyers look out for the interests of their clients, the \ncommanders, when making recommendations and not the fairness of the system. My long-standing belief based on \nresearch and conversations with survivors is that if objective prosecutors made prosecution decisions instead of \ncommanders, more survivors would come forward and trust the military justice system. \n\nThis amendment offers a bold step to address the problem of assault at the academies, but again, it creates a four-\nyear pilot program so that we can observe, learn, and inform future policy. Since the academies are non-operational \neducational institutions, there would be no impact on readiness or lethality, but since cadets in midshipmen are in \nthe age group with the highest assault prevalence, we could reliably test the model. The same old approach simply \nhasn't worked. We owe it to the future leaders of our armed forces to ensure they aren't educated in an environment \ncharacterized by pernicious and pervasive harassment and assault. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Mr. Turner--sorry, I don't know. \n\nUNKNOWN: You looked at me both. I went with him. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Sorry, I'll pick you first next time. \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute amendment at the desk. \n\nSPEIER: You know about this? \n\nSMITH: What's that? \n\nSPEIER: Benjamin, do we know anything about this? \n\nUNKNOWN: We have it to pass out. \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, it's been arranged already for it to be passed out. \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman, I want to make a comment on this. I mean, Mr. Cisneros over here. But before we do \nanything further, I'd like to make a comment on this amendment if I could. \n\nSMITH: Once Mr. Turner's been recognized, we--we have to address the substitute amendment. Ms. Speier, if I \nmay inquire for just a second, have you seen the substitute amendment? \n\nSPEIER: I have not. \n\nSMITH: Okay. We're going to take a brief recess until we can figure out what's in the amendment and give people \nthe opportunity to make an informed discussion on what it is. I'm sorry, if I could bring everybody back in. \nApparently, the- the amendment is not showing up on people's computers? The substitute amendment. Can we--\nyeah, I'm pretty sure whatever you're showing me is not going to--okay. We're going to distribute the amendment \nbut, what's wrong with our wonderful computer system here? What's that? \n\nOkay. Alright, we'll take the amendment and pass it out the old-fashioned way and give people a chance to look at \nit. We're going to come back into order and so I can ask the staff some questions and I'm sorry guys, if you could sit \ndown in front of me here so I can see the staff. Ruben, guys--when a substitute amendment is offered, isn't--is the \nauthor supposed to give you enough copies for all of the members or how does that work? I thought that was part of \nthe requirement of offering an amendment? You gave 57 copies out? \n\nOkay, I still don't--what's log 505? This seems like a summary of the amendment, not actual legislative text. \n(INAUDIBLE) okay, I guess it is. It's just written sort of oddly. Okay, well, we can--we can--we can learn as we talk \nabout it at any rate. So, Mr. Turner, why don't you take a stab at explaining it? \n\nTURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sorry about the procedural issues. This is actually how we were instructed to \ndo this. I know trying to get technology to work and everything to work together. I want to first begin by thanking \nChairman Speier for her dedication and commitment to the issue of sexual assault in the military. We first met \nduring the Sundance preview of the movie Invisible War that two of my community members appeared in and that I \nwas in that was really the--a--a launch of the whole country's understanding of the crisis of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. \n\nThis is a very difficult issue for all of us. It's very emotional as we deal with issues of how to we assist victims. \nSexual assault violates the very nature of someone's human rights. We focused on three different areas:  \nprevention, prosecution, and protection. To give you a little history, what we did 10 years ago, is that we tried to \nform a bipartisan sexual assault prevention caucus for the purposes of vetting and working and continuously trying \nto strive on this issue. \n\nSo, I want you to know that over the past ten years working with Congresswoman Mickie Sherrill, working with \nCongresswoman Susan Davis, Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, the bills that we've passed for the past ten years \ninclude the Strong Act, the Be Safe Act, the Military Act, the Support Act, the Protect Act, the Be Heard Act, and the \nPersist Act, and this year it was the Stop Act. Every year we have done a bipartisan group of substance of \nlegislation and some of the things that we have accomplished together--this committee, because we have worked \n\n\n\ndiligently on this issue, is we've raised the profile of sexual assault prevention response officers, we required \nimproved case data collections, we created the sex--the victims' advocates for counsel. We did special training for \nsexual assault victim advocates. We allowed for victims' application for unit transfer. \n\nWe've created the defense advisory committee on investigation, prosecution, and defense of sexual assault. In all \nof these, we've worked in conjunction with the Senate, and we've worked in conjunction with this committee so that \neverything was on a bipartisan basis. Taking this out of the chain of command has been something that has been \nstudied as early as 2014, and all bipartisan commissions and panels that have reviewed this have recommended \nagainst this. Now, this is a pilot program, which I would say is even that much more risky because what we have \nhere is the criminal justice system. You know, I told you we have prevention, prosecution, and protection. \n\nProsecution is the toughest one because it's the criminal code. So, you start changing the criminal code and you \nhave cascading effects down to how even a--an accused is handled, how an actual perpetrator is handled. So, the \nconcepts of doing a pilot program is even that much more raising the bar of our cautiousness. We shouldn't do this \nbased on anecdotal issues. Certainly, not newspaper articles. We have been thoughtful. We have been substantive. \nWe have studied this and in every way that we've moved forward, there are a number provisions in this bill that are \nbipartisan. \n\nThis--this would not be one of them. Now, what my amendment does, and I didn't just come out with this out of thin \nair. This actually takes virtually the provision that was in the Senate bill this year. They took up and debated this \nissue. All the bills that I read to you that we have done on a bipartisan basis, Congresswoman Susan Davis and \nmyself, and Mickie Sherrill. Laura Sanchez, all were adopted and became law with support from the Senate. So, we \nhave not done this as just one house or even just one party. Bipartisan, bicameral. \n\nSo, what I have done is provided us an opportunity a substitute amendment that allows us to adopt the same, \nvirtually the same provision that the Senate has so that when we go to conference, we will take up this matter \ntogether. And what it says is, just recently, in our--in the legislative changes that we've made, we have changed \nportions that affect the chain of command. Some of those just went into effect January 2019. So, we'd be changing \nit already without even giving real opportunity for some of those changes to take effect. So, this amendment takes \nthe Senate language, it's already in their bill, and says let's take a look at this again. Let's get empirical data. \n\nLet's get empirical understanding on a bipartisan basis, bicameral basis as substantively, what do we need to in \nthe criminal justice system with respect to this issue, rather than just making a surgical pilot program that could \naffect both victims and those who are accused. So, I would--I would ask for the support for this amendment. I \ncertainly want to just one more time, tell you how much that I greatly appreciate Chairman Speier's commitment to \nthe issue of sexual assault in the military. We've got a number of things that we've worked on together, but this is \none where we should adopt this substitute. Thank you. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you and just to be clear on this, the underlying amendment is bill language, the substitute is report \nlanguage. Is that correct? Can anyone take a quick stab at what the difference is between report language and bill \nlanguage? Well, that's not encouraging. \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, if I could-- \n\nSMITH: --Well, actually, at the moment I'm trying to see if the staff can give me a shot. \n\nCLERK: Yes, sir. The bill language would direct the department to actually execute. This directive report language \nbasically has them do a study. The bill is a law. Directive report language tells you-- \n\nSMITH: --I'm sorry. We can't hear you. Speak up. \n\nCLERK: The bill is, if it's passed into law, it becomes law. They have to do it. Directive report language directs them \nto do something, they do it 99 percent of the time, but it's a report and it's not the same thing as a law. \n\nSMITH: (INAUDIBLE) clarification. And let me just say, Mr. Turner is correct. This committee has done a--a great \ndeal of work in a bipartisan way on the issue of sexual assault within the military. This particular issue has always \n\n\n\nbeen contentious and we've had debates on it before and we're having another debate on it here. And you know, \nit's bipartisan in terms of--you know, how people feel about it. I think Ms. Speier made the point that what we've \ndone over the course of the last ten years or so, has been a lot. \n\nIt is clear from the statistics that we're not there yet and frankly, I'm going to listen to the debate. I don't know how \nI'm going to vote on this, because I've--I've heard that--you know, taking it out of the chain of command is \npotentially problematic. On the other hand, you know, doing this as a pilot project to see if it does improve things \ngiven the problems we have might make sense. But, so all the members are clear here, we've worked together on \nthis. \n\nThis is just one where there is not agreement. There's not a bipartisan agreement, and there hasn't been during the \n6-7 years we've been talking about it. So, we're going to debate it here and see where we're at and this is the first \nsort of back and forth. Ms. Speier has the right to close on this, so she does--does have the right to speak again. \nBut who seeks recognition now? Mr. Brown. \n\nBROWN: Thank you--thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in opposition to the substitute amendment because I \nsupport the underlying amendment. First of all, I commend this committee long before I got on the committee, and \nthis Congress, in the efforts that it has taken to address sexual assault in the military. We have a problem in the \nfamily. This is our family. Sexual assault is horrific. The impact it has on the victim:  emotional, physical, spiritual, \nand otherwise. The impact on the community. \n\nWe have a problem in the family. We've taken steps to address it, but as Ms. Speier mentioned, we're not moving in \nthe right direction. In the larger force, sexual assaults are up 37 percent in the last five years. They've more than \ndoubled that in the service academies. I like the substitute amendment and the fact that the Senate has passed it \nand I hope we adopt it in Congress because we will have an opportunity to have both this substitute amendment \nbecause it's coming to us from the Senate in the pilot program. \n\nIf the amendment before us from Ms. Speier's was--was saying hey, let's take it away from all commanders, I'd \nhave some problems and concerns because I have. I'd say hey, maybe we should study it a little bit more, the \nimpact, but I disagree that the pilot program would have a cascading effect. I'm--I'm sympathetic (INAUDIBLE)--\nthat's not what this underlying amendment does. It addresses 3-6 convening authorities. The superintendents and \ncommodores at three academic institutions. One of the reasons it's often offered as to why we shouldn't take the \ncourt martial convening authority for sexual assault cases away from commanders is because commanders have \nthese large responsibilities. \n\nThey have to consider sometimes what may appear to be conflicting interests. For example, my unit is about to \ndeploy to Afghanistan, I've got to make decisions about what I'm--how I'm going to handle this accused. Do I do it \nnow? Do I do it later? The nature of the defense. I could decide, and it's my right as a commander, to do nothing \nbecause that person is a critical asset in a very important mission in Afghanistan. I cannot afford to lose him \nbecause if he doesn't go, I may lose 10 people in Afghanistan. This is not what we're talking about. \n\nThis is more kin to the relationship that you as the student has to your university president or the dean of college. \nThis is not a troop unit we're talking about. These are the service academies and while they train things like how do \nyou create unit cohesion and--and--and how do you impose and enforce discipline. That's to prepare them for when \nthey move to the troop unit. They are now in college. In fact, some people who graduated the service academies \nyears ago would bemoan the fact that the service academies look too much like a civilian university today than what \nthey looked like when--when you graduated from the service academies. But, that's what you have. \n\nNow, also in the underlying amendment, the only thing that it takes away from the superintendent and commodore \nis the decision of whether to go to court martial or not. And the decision by this chief prosecutor is we're not going to \ngo to court martial on this, the superintendent can still impose non-judicial punishment. Post-conviction, if--if the--if it \ndoes go to court martial, first of all, the superintendent can appeal it and that's in the pilot program. Post-conviction, \nall of the rights, if you will, the authorities that the superintendents have they continue to have. They can review it on \npost-conviction. \n\n\n\nIt's just the decision whether or not to go to court martial or not. It--we're not--we're not doing this to the Navy \nsecond airborne. The 10th mountain is not being impacted. Your favorite fighter wing and Marine group are not \nbeing impacted. That's why it is important to look at this substitute amendment when it comes over to us from the \nSenate, but why not pilot? We've got a problem in the family and we've got to fix it. So, we all know that sexual \nassault is terrible, but to me, it's even more egregious when it's committed by someone in the family and we've got \nservice members on service members, in this case, cadets on cadets. \n\nAnd I'll just close on this one fact, which I think is striking. In the last five years, where we've seen surveys show \nthat the number of sexual assaults are up at all the academies, including the Air Force Academy, there hasn't been \na single court martial at the Air Force Academy, there's been two against cadets at the Air Force Academy in \nBoulder and Denver. Something's wrong at the academies. We can fix this. We can at least begin to address it with \nthe pilot program. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank you. I--I'm in support of Turner's--or Mr. Turner's amended--amendment to the amendment. I hear--\nI respect--I like Mr. Turner and Ms. Speier. She is very admirable for taking this on. I've worked with her on multiple \ndifferent initiatives and bills on this, but I am very leery about undermining the court martial authority of our \ncommanders as I've been one for--for five different times. I think our commandants and our superintendents need \nto have the court martial authority. \n\nThis is part of command and my experience underlies this. I wasn't a commandant of the university, but I think--of \nthe academy, the principles are the same. In one of my commands, I inherited one of the worst sexual assault \nfrequencies in the military and I knew we had an emergency we got to work on it. So, I came up with a game plan \nand within a few months, we were able to lower that sexual assault to one of the best rates in the Air Force and we \nwere subsequently recognized for having the best sexual assault program in the entire Air Force. Court martial \nauthority was key to them. That was an essential tool that I used. I don't want to give that to someone else to tell me \nthat I have to--what I can do or what I can't, as a commander. \n\nChain of commands involves commanders, not lawyers, and I respect that Mr. Brown, but deciding the court martial \nauthority is the decision of a commander. That's not something you rent our or lease out to someone else. \nCommanders are responsible for the morale and discipline of their units or their academies, not a lawyer. So, I \nknow the leadership at most of our academies. Charles Sevaria (SP), I've known since he was a colonel. I can tell \nyou, there's no one more dedicated to fighting such assault than he is. He is passion--passionate on this. You will \nnot find a lawyer more passionate than Charles Sevaria (SP) in defeating court martial error.  So, I think we--any \nsexual assault, one is too many. \n\nWe have a problem on our campuses and we have a problem in our services. We have a problem in our society. \nSexual assaults, when the evidence is there, they need to be convicted. We need to put them--put them on trial and \nadjudicate them. We do not take the authority out of the commander. It will undermine the command authority of our \nsuperintendent and our commandants and they are the ones responsible for the morale and discipline of their units, \nnot a lawyer. Mr. Chair, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nCISNEROS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I seek to support the underlying amendment for Ms. Speier. I want to \nthank her for her leadership in addressing the sexual assault in the military and supporting survivors and I fully \nappreciate the importance of good order discipline and the authority of the commanding officer to maintain it, but I \nalso believe that vigorously and appropriately, investigating and educating allegations of sexual assault is crucial to \ngood order and discipline. \n\nThere's research out there that say woman cadets and midshipmen would be more likely to come out and to report \nincidences of sexual assault if there was somebody outside of the chain of command that they could talk to. That's \nwhat this pilot program does, it allows us to test that. It temporarily creates an office of the chief prosecutor who will \ntest an officer's ability to enable to service academies to vigorously and appropriately investigate allegations of \n\n\n\nsexual assault without implicating commanding authorities--I'm sorry, the commanders, authority, and good order \nand discipline. \n\nAs--as we know, and it's already been said, sexual assault at the academies is on the rise and something needs to \nbe done about it. This is a pilot program. It's something that needs to be tested to see if it could work. That's why \nI'm in favor of it and that's why I support it. We need to do something differently, because what we're doing right \nnow at the academies isn't working. So, I support this amendment and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. \n\nSMITH: Just to be clear, Mr. Cisneros, we're debating the substitute amendment from Mr. Turner. So, you support \nor oppose that substitute? \n\nCISNEROS: I oppose the substitute amendment.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Bishop. \n\nBISHOP: Thank you. Procedurally, to adopt the Senate language, it means it's done. It will not be subject to the \nconference committee's process. By com--by seeing anything else, who knows what will or will not come out of the \nconference committee report. I'd like to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Turner. \n\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just to want to respond to a few things. The chairman \nhad asked the question about report language versus non-report language. I think the staff can confirm that when \nyou do report language on a study, they are going to do the study. It's not like a compulsion or not compulsion. \nThey're not free not to do the study. It is compulsory for them to do and deliver the study. \n\nThe compulsory aspect of legislation versus this report aspect, and correct me if I'm wrong, that's why I'm directing \nthis to staff, is that this actually changes the criminal justice code. That's the compulsory aspect. Now, you can't by \nreport language change the criminal justice code. Now, I'm going to go back to why this is important not to do as a \npilot. You know, for all of us, just pause for a moment separate from the debate and just--just clear your head and \nthink. \n\nIf I'm going to make a change to the criminal justice code, what would I like? How about the opinion of an attorney? \nHow about the opinion of the Department of Defense? How about an opinion of those people that actually do those \nthings? The problem with an amendment like this with, again, all due respect to the chairwoman, because we--we \nboth have such great passion on this issue and I--I have such a strong record and she has such a strong record, is \nthat we don't have any of this. I mean, this is subcommittee chairman's perspective on what needs to happen to the \ncriminal justice code, and there's huge danger here. \n\nNow, the danger of the pilot is, is if you try to prosecute me under a pilot program, the first thing I'm going to argue \nis equal protection under the constitution. Why am I being treated differently than somebody else? We could \nundermine the very basis of the prosecutorial aspect of what's going--because we've not--we've not studied this. \nwe've not looked at what the impacts are. We don't even look if you can carve out from criminal justice a pilot \nprogram. I told you that there are three things that we've tried to do as this committee, and again, great legislation \nthat has made huge impacts is prevention, prosecution, and protection. \n\nDo a pilot program on prevention. Do a pilot program on protection. But, a pilot program on the criminal justice \nsystem, it is absolutely fraught with danger. Now, the other aspect of this, which the data shows when we studied \nthis in 2012--in 2014 with the bipartisan response systems panel is actually prosecutions under the criminal system \nversus the civil system are more. We actually do more under the criminal justice system in the military than occurs \nin the civil system. \n\nThe issue of increased sexual assaults either in reporting or in actuality, is one that you should focus on prevention. \nDoes anyone in this room actually believe that somebody's going to be prevented from perpetrating a sexual \nassault because there's a pilot program at the academies that are going to result in someone else handling their \nprosecution? No, this is training. This is communication. This is cultural shift. One of the things that we've tried to \n\n\n\ncommunicate with people is--is that--that not only is this such an ultimate violation of someone's human rights, but \nthe people who perpetrate this are criminals. \n\nAnd so, it's the culture around those criminals that needs to be changed so that they are not--they are not in a \npermissive environment, so third parties will come forward and report it, so other people will protect others. We \nshouldn't look at just, again, anecdotal responses on this.  we need to look for actual substantive advice as to what \nto do and in this, we do not have the requisite information that we would need to do a pilot program within our \ncriminal justice system. With that, I yield back to Mr. Bishop. \n\nBISHOP: I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Ms. Gabbard. \n\nGABBARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in opposition to the substitute amendment and support the \nunderlying measure. This one hits close to home for a number of reasons. You know, there's been a lot of talk \nabout legislation that's been passed, initiatives that have been put forward, commissions that have come together \nand made recommendations to Congress. But, the evidence in the reports that we continue to see come out year \nafter year show that the system that we have in place is not working. \n\nThe reports that acting Secretary Shanahan recently talked about that there's been a 38 percent increase in sexual \nassault in the military from 2016 to 2018 alone. One thing I want to note in the years that we've been debating this \nissue, especially in this committee, the commissions that are being referenced to my recollection, they represent \ngeneral officers, officers, or retired officers. Time and time again, we see a lack of representation coming from \nanyone in the enlisted ranks. No commands or majors coming forward, and yet, who's the number one target of \nsexual assault in the military? \n\nEnlisted female troops, aged 17-24, E3s and E4s. It is their voices that are not being represented, so time and time \nagain, we hear about--oh, we've got to protect command authority. I agree with that. I served both as an enlisted \nsoldier for five years up until being an E4, I went through OCS, commissioned as lieutenant, also served as a \ncompany commander. I respect the need for commander authority. But, I also understand what it's like to be an \nenlisted soldier where you don't feel comfortable going and speaking to that commander. I've served under \ncommanders who have done the right thing. I've also served under commanders who have not. \n\nWho have abused their power. Who have not fulfilled that responsibility they have to serve and protect their own \ntroops under their command, so I think the point here is, is we're looking for other solutions and other opportunities \nto make sure that the justice system that we have in place actually protects the victims of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. I think Congresswoman Speier talked about how, in our service academies, the statistics she mentioned, \nnone of those sexual assaults had been reported. None had been reported. Why is that? \n\nHow can talk about prevention unless these things are actually being reported? What I have heard from people who \nI know personally, is they have not reported their being a victim of sexual assault because they have no faith that \ntheir command will stand up for them. They have no faith in a fair transparent justice system that will not result in \nretaliation. That will not result in them being sequestered from their comrades. That will not result in them being \npointed out as saying, oh, she's one of those. Watch out. Stay away from here. She's a troublemaker. She causes \nproblems. \n\nShe--she is ruining the cohesion within the unit, when in fact, the opposite is true. It is the perpetrator of these \ncrimes who are violating the unit cohesion that is necessary in every single one of our units. Small units and large \nunits, so I can't speak strongly enough for Congresswoman Speier's efforts to look at other avenues to begin to get \nat heart of making sure that we, as service members, have a justice system that works for us. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) \n\nKELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I too am very passionate about this interests--about--about sexual assaults. \nIt's a very serious issue and we have to address it. But, this is not the right way. So, I speak in support of Mr. \n\n\n\nTurner's substitute amendment. You know, I've been blessed and fortunate to be able to see this problem from a \nperspective that very few people have because I have commanded at the 06 level. \n\nI've been at the court martial level in both the military--and I've also been a district attorney, and so I prosecuted on \nthe civilian side. And so, I think that is very unique skill set and I think that I have some value to add to the \ndiscussion. But, I'm I also had an undergrad in business and love statistics, love numbers. \n\nAnd so, one thing I know about marketing, and statistics, and polling, and those things is that if you want to get a \ngood representation--representative sample, you have to have that to start with. You can't use the academies and \ncompare them to the E3s, and E4s, and E5s that--that my fellow member talked about on the other side that we \nneed to protect, because they're not the same. The units are not the same. So, this is a--we start with a false \npremise. We start with a faulty sample. We start with a sample that is not representative of the military as a whole. \n\nThere is a whole lot difference in a college type environment with the top of the top kids who are all selected by \nmembers of Congress and all have just super stuff--there's a lot difference from those and kids who enlist and go to \nbasic training. The same basic training that I did. And so, I would say that if you're trying to use this as a pilot \nprogram, at least get a representative sample and the academies are not that. You know, and--and let me just say, \nthe Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, DoD, it is a social experiment. It is not a social experiment. These \nmen and women deserve the best of everything we can give them, because they're going down (INAUDIBLE). \n\nWe've got to protect those young E3s and E4s and that's whether they're male or female. We've got to protect \nthem from this coward called sexual assault. But, I can tell you as a prosecutor, as a DA who has been inside a \ngrand jury. Grand juries would not indict many, many of the sexual assaults that we now are prosecuted on the \ncommander's orders. They would not take the case up because prosecutors don't like to lose, they care about \ngetting re-elected, or they care about stats, or they care about their next job. \n\nAnd let me tell you, unless you've tried a sexual assault case, as a prosecutor, they're difficult. They're difficult--\ndifficult to try, even in the best set of circumstances. Especially when it's--but you know what, our military does \nthem, and we convict at a much higher rate than the civilian side and that is because the role of the commander. It \nis absolutely necessary that we not change the law to do something that is going to hurt all our soldiers, including \nthose that we're trying to protect. You know, at war college, they teach us when you do something, you don't just \nlook at what you're doing now. \n\nWhat are the cursory or the second and third order effects? Doing this pilot program without properly studying it. We \nare not properly looking and the second and third order effects and the people we may hurt may be the people \nwe're trying to protect. So, I go with this substitute amendment. Let's look at the report language as opposed to \nmaking it law and changing our code and if I can yield to Mr. Turner the balance of my time. \n\nTURNER: I just have one thing that I want to add. I mean, this is--this is, again, a very emotional issue. This is our \nattempt to support victims. This is about our service members, but this is not a gender issue and if it was a gender \nissue, all studies show--and I'm looking at the one from 2018, more men than women are sexually assaulted while \nserving in the military. Let's not make this a gender issue. This is a service member's issue. The study in 2012 \ncame out the same. This is a service member's issue. This is victims and human rights. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Important issue. I think we've--we've covered a pretty significant chunk of it. But, further debate? \n\nGALLAGHER: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Mr. Gallagher. \n\nGALLAGHER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield my time to-- \n\nSMITH: --Just a second, Mr. Gallagher, you have something other than debate? \n\nGALLAGHER: No, I just seek recognition. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Okay, we'll get you. Mr. Gallagher? \n\nGALLAGHER: Mr. Chairman, I yield my time to Representative Brown.  \n\nBROWN: And Mr. Chairman, I won't take five minutes. I just did want to address one issue. I'm not a constitutional \nlawyer, I did spend two years clerking at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which is the highest court \nin the military justice system. So, I did just want to address the issue of constitutionality. The military justice system \nalready differentiates between different types of soldiers, sailors, air men, and marines. \n\nFor example, enlisted are--have available to them a summary court martial, not available to officers. There's no \nconstitutional challenge to that. Enlisted have certain rights in terms of jury selection that officers don't have. \nThere's--there's no constitutional objection to that. Even in our civilian justice system, we treat juveniles differently \nthan we treat adults. The key thing is do--are they subject to the same substantive offenses and they are. This \ndoesn't change the substantive offenses. \n\nThe elements of sexual assault will be the same for a--a--an academy cadet as it would be for a solider in a troop \nunit and at the end of the day, do they get process--due process that is fair under the constitution? And this just \ndoesn't change that. So, I appreciate that the issue was raised, but I did feel compelled to address it that there's not \na constitutional issue here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further debate? Mr. Conaway. \n\nCONAWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Quickly, I have the pleasure and the honor of serving on the board of \nvisitors for West Point, and for the last several years, this topic has been absolutely top front and center at every \nsingle board meeting. The superintendents and the deans--this is a top priority of theirs, period. They're sincere \nabout it. They're--they're--couldn't give more attention to it. The frustration is, is this is--the students at our \nacademies are the best this nation has to offer. \n\nThey are screened for all kinds of things. There's an overabundance of eagle scouts in our academies. These are \nthe best we've got, and yet, we're still having this issue come up and it's (INAUDIBLE) frustrating that we can't stop \nthis. They don't police themselves. They don't have the discipline to be able to not let this stuff happen, and it is \nfrustrating. I worry, though, that a pilot project will be a self-fulfilling prophecy in that whatever is communicated in \nhow they want the pilot project to come out, that's what will happen. \n\nAnd I--and it may be a little distasteful to say this, but we're innocent until proven guilty and if someone's guilty of \nsexual assault, put them under the jail. I got that. But, there will be those who are caught up who are not guilty, \nwhose accused, and I worry that this special project--this special pilot project will overrun their rights to due process \nin a--in a quest to deal with something that there's not one shred of difference--of difference of the opinion on the \nimportance of getting--of getting this done and getting it fixed. Everyone shares that, but I just don't know that this \nis the solution that makes--that makes sense. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Is there further discussion on the substitute amendment? Mr. Mitchell. And don't be shy down there in the \nfront row, if you want to be recognized, let me know. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nNone of this like (INAUDIBLE). \n\nMITCHELL: Have you known some members to be shy over here? \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Just let me know. Go ahead. \n\nMITCHELL: Just a--a brief comment. We don't need to take five minutes. Last term, we made major changes in \ncriminal justice--we made major changes (INAUDIBLE) prison reform on a bipartisan basis. \n\n\n\nI'll note that we didn't do a pilot program, we didn't decide to see if it worked for four years, we actually made \nchanges to the current justice system. People expect fair and even-handed treatment in the current justice system. \nboth the accuser and the accused. To pilot and so see if it works out for you, we'll see if it gets it better, it--it is not \neven handed. \n\nI think this--I support the substitute because it was a process by which to look at all the factors involved. It was a \npretty difficult issue. I have a daughter in college right now. You don't think this troubles me? Absolutely. \n\nMy alma mater is Michigan State University. I had a staff member whose daughter was sexually assaulted by the \nphysician there. She tried to commit suicide. Trust me, I've hear--I've--this one troubles me a great deal but I think \nwe can't simply pilot the criminal justice changes and see if it works out. That is not what this nation is about. I \nsupport the substitute amendment and would urge everyone to pass it, thank you. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Bergman \n\nBERGMAN: Thank You Mr. Chairman and, you know, Stephen Covey, one of his seven habits is began with the \nend in mind and I believe that everyone on the committee knows that what we want to get to is the elimination of \nsexual assault. It's morally, ethically, and legally wrong, pure and simple. \n\nAs someone who's exercised command authority at all levels over a 40-year period, I know what it's like to utilize \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice to do the right thing for the right reasons and what that means, pure and \nsimple, for those of you who may not have had experience with that. You can take someone who's a perfectly good \nperson who just maybe had a bad day, and you can scare them to the point where they're straight and they're on \nthe straight and narrow. They didn't do anything wrong they just did something, shall we say based on their age and \nexperience, that as any parent or commander would do is basically scare them straight. \n\nOn the other end of that scale, you can really hammer the bad actors, and we do. That's the Command Authority \nand the latitude that commanders are given and exercise every day. As a commander, we had staff officers, we had \nlegal officers. We got all the advice and counsel that we wanted and if we didn't get enough, we asked for more. So \nthe system as it is set up today to make that commander effective, you want to give them more tools, not less. \n\nIn that command climate and setting that command climate, I would suggest to you that the two most important \npeople kind of like the parents in that unit are the unit commander and their command sergeant major. They set the \ntone for all levels whether you're an E-1 who's just come in the door or whether you're that senior general officer \nabout ready to go out the door. But that relationship and that command climate that is set by those two leaders \ngoes all the way down to the bottom because everybody looks up on who the leaders are. \n\nI believe that to go down the road of a pilot program would not in the end go towards the end in mind of eliminating \nsexual assault. Therefore, I rise in opposition. \n\nSMITH: Ms. Speier to close the debate. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This has been a very heartfelt debate I think on all ends and on all sides. To Mr. \nTurner, I know you have deep passion on this issue. I know that you've done a lot of work on this issue. I guess I \nwould have appreciated if you would have come to me before and told me about your amendment. \n\nBe that as it may, I want you all to think for a moment of your Academy appointees, the ones that you've appointed \nthis year. The brilliant young people with extraordinary talent that we then send to these academies with the \nexpectation that they're going to become the next leaders. There is something going on in the Academy culture that \nhas to change. \n\nThe number of women at the academy's is growing. It's almost at 30 percent at the Air Force Academy. So, it's \ngrowing at all the academies. This year, my three appointees were women. There is I think misinformation here. \nThere are far more women than men at the academies that are being sexually assaulted. It's different in the military \nsystem, but at our academies, there are more women that are being assaulted than men. \n\n\n\nMr. Turner talked about prevention and prosecution. Well, let me talk to you about prosecution. Of the 747 cases of \nunwanted sexual conduct at the academies in 2017/ 2018, only 13 cases were filed as criminal actions and only \nfour are currently resulting in conviction. So what--what about prosecution? That would suggest there's not much \nprosecution going on at all. \n\nAnd let me remind everyone that all the studies that have been done show that 93 to 97 percent of those who come \nforward to report are telling the truth. Most don't even come forward because they fear retaliation. But if they have \nthe guts to come forward, 93 to 97 percent are telling the truth. So let me remind everyone, this is the pilot, is a four \nyear pilot. If the Commandant does not like the recommendation by the special prosecutor, the commandant can \nappeal it to the general counsel of the Department of Defense. \n\nSo in terms of command control, that really isn't changing. And let me end by this. With all the improvements we've \nmade to the law, let me tell you what happened at West Point just a few weeks ago. One of the very few court \nmartials that took place, remind you that there are only four convictions recently. \n\nOf the one that went on at West Point where there was a sexual assault, where there was penetration, where the \nactual jury came back with a verdict that said that the perpetrator was guilty, it was appealed. And in the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, this appellate court has the power to reverse the lower court decision not based on due \nprocesses--due process grounds but by looking at the of--evidence again. \n\nWhen you haven't actually been there to observe the evidence, you're reading it from a document. And so, this \nparticular West Point cadet is going to be reinstated. So, let me just end by saying that like Mr. Turner, I have \nworked on this issue for a very long time. I have listened to every superintendent who has said to me, one sexual \nassault is too many. I have believed that they are working with all good intentions but it is not working. \n\nAnd when I see cadets, and I've met with so many of them who have been sexually assaulted, who are \nvaledictorians of their class, who were sexually assaulted at one of these academies and then they absolutely \ndissolved. They dissolved to the point where their grades suffered, they were having all kinds of emotional issues, \nand we have seen an incredible talent that has truly been destroyed. These are the best and the brightest in this \ncountry and we should expect the best from them. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Question is on adoption of the substitute amendment by Mr. Turner.

So, we've discussed this issue at great length so far today. We have witnessed more service members \nbeing sexually assaulted year to year but reporting rates of victims coming forward continues to re--remain woefully \nlow. \n\nWe cannot address the scourge the victims feel they cannot report the crimes committed against them out of a \nsense of fear for their own well-being. We need to remove the obstacle that prevents victims from coming forward. \nThe safety report amendment is necessary step towards eliminating these impediments to justice. \n\nSafe to report requires DOD to develop a policy that allows victims of sexual assault in our military separate from \nour academies because that's something that's already done at the Air Force Academy and something that we're \ngoing to be doing in the base bill for all academies. But in our military, we need to make sure that victims of sexual \nassault can come forward even if they may have been committing a minor misconduct at the time of the assault. It \nwill limit what actions the commander can take against the victim of sexual assault to a very narrowly defined set of \npotential misconduct. \n\nImproper use or possession of alcohol, consensual intimate behavior or fraternization, presence in out of bound \nareas, and whatever other minor misconduct the Secretary of Defense deems appropriate for minor misconduct. \nThis is not a carte blanche policy that enables victims to get away with misconduct. Fear of punishment for \nunderage drinking should not deter a junior service member victim from reporting sexual assault. Ranking \ndisparities or super visually improper relationships should not give offenders de facto immunity. \n\nThis is the policy that balances the considerations of justice and demands that a sexual assailant should not get off \nscot-free simply because they assaulted the victim in compromising circumstances. The safety report amendment \naddresses these concerns and empowers victims to come forward without fear of unwanted retaliation. \n\nThe policy has already seen tremendous success at the Air Force Academy and this year's NDA standardizes the \nsafe to report policies across the service academies but this would, as I said earlier affect the military as a whole. \nLet me just say, Congress woman Davis and I some years ago went to Lackland Air Force Base where 36 military \ntrainers MTIs had sexually assaulted more than 60 trainees. Remember that? And not one of those trainees \nreported it. Not one for fear of retaliation because they had ostensibly violated the UCMJ and some just because as \none said to me, when an MTI tells you to meet him in the storage closet, there's no question mark at the end of that \nsentence. \n\nSo what we want to do is create this opportunity for victims who have been placed in a compromising situation \nwhether it was the use of alcohol, whether it was because they were fraternizing with someone in their ranks that \nthey come forward and be not afraid to do so because of minor violations. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Is there further discussion on the amendment, Mr. Kelly? \n\nKELLY: Thank You Mr. chairman and I--I thank the chair--chairwoman for also introducing this amendment but I'm--\nI'm opposed to it. The services already do this but they need the flexibility to evaluate each case. And it may lead to \nthe difficulty in prosecuting sexual assault cases. And once again, as a former prosecutor or many other lawyers \nand a civil trial, there's nothing worse than going to a trial and having a defendant or a person on the other side on \nthe stand and not having all the information about the person that you're defending. \n\nSo they don't have to charge, you have prosecutorial discretion on those to start with but it's going to come out in \ntrial. and so what that does is it makes it much more difficult as a prosecutor when they know that they--that the \nperson does not have and the charges still coming out what they have and it makes it much, much more difficult. \n\n\n\nI--I go back to when I was a young lawyer and very--one of my very first trials and it was a divorce trial before I got \non the criminal side. And during that trial, my--my guy had sworn that he had not had an affair, had sworn up and \ndown, I had asked him every way you could have asked. \n\nAnd during the evidence, photographs came of him having his affair and he said, what are we going to do? And I \nlooked at him and I said, we're not going to do anything. You lied to me. I mean, I can't prepare a defense if I don't \nknow all the facts. And what I don't want to do again is harm the people we're trying to protect because that \ninformation will come out and whether--and it looks much better if a prosecutor said, I had discretion to charge, I did \nnot charge that person for the underlying alcohol offense, I did not charge with than--the underlying adultery with \nanother person or whatever that charge is. \n\nSo I think I'm opposed to the amendment although I think in theory, I think our prosecutors should absolutely and do \nalready absolutely not charge people who are a victim of a crime when it is a trivial crime. But I do think as they--I \nthink it ought to be discretionary not mandatory and with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Miss Hill, sorry. \n\nHILL: Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman's comments but I have to say that the--this language is incredibly \nimportant for a woman or any victim to be able to come forward and feel as though they can. One of the things that \nkeeps sexual assault victims from reporting is the fact that they feel like they might be considered to be at fault in \nsome capacity or that they are--they are in some way to blame or that they might be in trouble for whatever got \nthem into this--got them into the situation in the first place. \n\nSomething that happened to myself. I was sexually assaulted when I was 16 years old and in an underage drinking \nsort of situation and it is exactly what kept me from reporting for many, many years. And when you talk about \nhaving somebody in the military who not only is risking her personal reputation, her family knowing, etc, but her \nown--her own career and whatever is going to come next in her life. \n\nThe stakes are so much higher to have it codified in here that this is a safe space that you can bring forward what \nhas happened to you and that you can actually say yes, I'm coming forward about these things that I have done that \nmay not have been appropriate or--or, you know, within the code of conduct but it is still not right for me to have \nbeen sexually assaulted, and I still need to put the--put the perpetrator--hold him accountable. \n\nSo there is something so meaningful about just creating that language and about setting it aside and I hope that we \nwill consider supporting this amendment. Thank you, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank You Mr. chairman. And with all respect of the view of the ranking member on this, I have to agree \nwith the amendment. On the (INAUDIBLE) different commands, I think that this is a right direction to go. The Air \nForce Academy has started this and it's working. More victims feel free to come forward and most of them do have \na collateral minor offense that they're attac--that they're associated with. \n\nAnd this gives them the green light to come forward and I think it's working and we want victims to come forward \nand not to feel inhibited because of a potential threat of being convicted themselves or losing a stripe, and this is \nhappening, we know what's happening. \n\nRecently, I was contacted by an airman who said she was a victim of sexual assault. She came forward and \nthrough the court-martial process adjudication, the alleged perpetrator was found innocent but she ended up losing \na stripe because she was underage drinking, and I heard her story and I think she was telling the truth. I went to the \ncommander's commander's commander wrote a letter and as they reviewed it, they knew an injustice was done. \nThey restored her stripe and in doing so found two other cases and restored their stripes. \n\nI think this policy is taking us the right direction. So I commend the--I co--I commend the--the chairman for putting it \nforward. So I support it. Thank you. \n\n\n\nSMITH: (OFF MIC) \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Oppose. The ayes have it. It is now in order to consider En Bloc Package number 3. The chair recognizes \nMiss Speier for the purposes of offering the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number three consisting of \namendments have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection so ordered, will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc amendment? Without objection, \nthe amendment is considered as read and the gentlewoman is recognized to explain the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Thank You Mr. chairman En Bloc package number three is comprised of the following; amendment 109 by \nMr. Brown that requires the Department of Defense to determine if any forms contain racially instant--insensitive \nterms and provide a pan--a plan for modernization. \n\nAmendment number 119 by Mr. Brown that requires DoD to provide a brief on contraband cell phone use in military \nprisons. Amendment number 203 by Mr. Mitchell that adds the number of service members eligible for and \nparticipating in transition assistance counseling programs to the criteria that DoD is already required to report to \nCongress. \n\nAmendment number 211 by Mr. Langevin that requires an FFRDC study on barriers to military entry for English \nlearners including challenges with the SFAB, the effects of the such barriers on English Learner, military enlistment \nrates, and opportunities for DoD to address such challenges. Amendment 212 by Mr. Langevin that would change \nthe DoD Starbase program from a STEM program to a STEAM program to encourage creativity and innovation. \n\nAmendment number 221 by Mr. Kelly that directs the DoD to conduct analysis of the difference between default 3 \npercent and 5 percent TSP contributions in the blended retirement system and report the findings to the committee. \nAmendment number 238 by Miss Stefanik in the portion of the report to accompany HR 2500 titles spouse \nemployment programs, strike the following text unemployment and insert the following new text unemployment or--\nor unemployment and underemployment. \n\nAmendment number 251 by Mr. Byrne that requires the DoD to submit a report on expanding TRICARE specialty \ndrug network. Amendment number 263 by Mr. Bacon that requires DoD to brief the congressional defense \ncommittees on its implementation plan to reduce the negative effects of obesity related illness on service members \nand dependents. Amendment number 298 by Miss Trahan that creates a Defense Advisory Committee on the \nPrevention of sexual assault in the Armed Forces established and maintained by DoD. It also allows enlisted \nmilitary members to participate in the funded legal education program. \n\nAmendment number 303 by Mr. Moulton that requires every service member returning from a combat deployment \nto participate in a mandatory person-to-person mental health assessment within two weeks of returning home, and \nrequires those service members to participate in annual mental health assessments post-deployment. \n\nAmendment number 316 by Miss Houlahan that directs DoD to submit a report on the feasibility of the creation of a \ngrant or loan program to (INAUDIBLE) the initial cost of meeting state licensure requirements for childcare facilities. \n\nSMITH: That was a mouthful. That was--there's a lot of very long amendments, very--very well done. Is there further \ndiscussion on the En Bloc package? Mr. Moulton. \n\nMOULTON: Thank you Mr. chairman. Mr. chairman, I'd like to speak briefly on my mental health assessments \namendment. I want to share a quote, not from Charles Dickens but from President Grant, the civil war hero, who \nalso dealt with depression. I think is fitting as we debate the National Defense Authorization Act today. He said, \n\"the art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike at him as \nhard as you can and as often as you can and keep moving on.\" \n\n\n\nMoving on is something that many who see combat find to be one of the most difficult challenges they ever face. \nAnd as many of you know, I recently disclosed how I've managed post-traumatic stress since returning from Iraq. I \nhoped that by speaking up about how post-traumatic stress is treatable, that Americans will start talking about it too \nand that veterans and active-duty service members will get whatever help they need so that they too can move on. \n\nThat's a challenge because there's a stigma around seeking care for mental health issues. We can help break that \nstigma by talking about mental health care in Congress and by encouraging America to talk about it too. So today, \nI'm offering an amendment to start that conversation within our military. My amendment will require every active \nduty service member who has deployed to receive a mental health screening every year on active duty. And for \nservice members sent into combat, this amendment will require an initial screening within 14 days of leaving the \nbattlefield. \n\nThe goal is for mental health checkups to become as normal and routine as your annual physical or teeth-cleaning. \nCheckups you get regardless of whether you feel sick. And I think this is a good start. So thank you all for working \nwith me on this amendment, it will save lives and it will set an example for the nation. Thank you,Chairman, I yield \nback. \n\nSMITH: Thank you for the--further discussion on the En Bloc? If not, I'm sorry Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, I just very briefly want to touch on my amendment which makes them look at whether 3 \npercent mandatory contribution versus 5 percent on the blended Retirement System and I just want to make sure \nthat on the blended that--look at that and see and make sure that we're taking care of our soldiers who enlist, our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and make sure that we're doing everything we can from a command emphasis \nand as a Congress to make sure that we take care of those folks in their retirement and their TSP contributions and \nwith that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Further discussion? Hearing none, questions on adoption of the En Bloc package offered by \nMiss Speier. So members in favorable will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. Ayes have it. The En Bloc package is adopted and it is now in order to consider En Bloc package \nnumber four and the chair recognizes Mrs. Speier for the purpose of offering the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number four consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the En Bloc amendment? Without objection, \nthe amendments are considered as read and the gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of \nexplaining the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. En Bloc package number four is comprised of the following. Amendment \nnumber 010R2 by Mr. Turner that allows in the case of a member under the jurisdiction of a secretary of the military \ndepartment that has his or her pay continued until the date on which the member is determined fit for duty. \n\nAmendment number 036 by myself that requires DoD IG to include the already public names of senior officials who \ncommit misconduct and quarterly reports. Amendment number 058 by Mr. Banks that sets qualification \nrequirements for the interagency program office firm director and deputy director and instructs SecDef and SecVa \nto appoint them jointly. \n\nAmendment number 065 by Miss Davis that ensures election officials track and confirm the receipt of military and \noverseas absentee ballots. Amendment number 090 by Mr. Garamendi that requires the DoD to input any \noccupational and environmental health exposure and to service members records while deployed and mandates to \nthe DoD and VA retroactively update their health records based on the information contained in the burn pit registry. \n\n\n\nAmendment number 104R1 by Mr. Brown that adds STEM to GROTC curriculum. Amendment number 133 by Mr. \nCisneros that enables the secretary of Defense to create a pilot program that would allow states to establish or \nexpand a job placement program and related employment services for unemployed guardsmen, reservists, military \nspouses and veterans. Amendment number 157 by myself that reauthorizes the breast cancer research stamp for \neight years before it expires on December 31st 2019. \n\nAmendment number 195 by Mr. Carbajal that directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a strategy to recruit and \nretain mental health providers and a monitoring program that would assist in monitoring medication prescribing \npractices for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Amendment number 217 by Mr. Kelly that removes \nrestrictions of federal employees who are National Guard or reserves from purchasing TRICARE reserve select in \nyear 2030. \n\nAmendment number 230R1 by Miss Hartzler that expresses support for gold star family's day. Amendment number \n266 by Mr. Bacon demands the report and integration of information on environmental health hazards to include \nblast exposure of servicemembers and to assess the feasibility of allowing access to the DoD and VA. \n\nSMITH: Is there any further discussion on the En Bloc amendment? Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, very quickly on the amendment that I've proposed here. it builds upon work that Miss \nGabbard has done with regard to burn pit. It takes it a couple of steps further and requires that all environ---all \nexposure to environmental hazards be in the medical record of the service member and carried forward into their \nretirement so that the Veterans Administration would have that information available in the ongoing life of the \nservice member. \n\nIt's--it's an effort to try to attract and to provide the history, the exposure history and therefore the medical history \nnecessary to properly diagnose and treat ailments that might occur sometime in the future. I want to thank Miss \nGabbard for setting the foundation with the burn pit issue. And with that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion of the En Bloc package. Not questions on adoption of the En Bloc package. So many \nthat's in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. Ayes have it. En Bloc package is adopted. Such awkward language. We will now consider log \nnumber 451 by Mr. Moulton. For what purpose does the gentleman seek recognition? \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? No objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the \namendment. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes. \n\nMOULTON: Mr. chairman this amendment would complement my earlier amendment by providing DoD the \nresources to make mental health checkups routine not just for those who have deployed in support of combat \noperations but to everyone. I have heard many people point out lately that an average of 20 veterans kill \nthemselves in America every day. That's 20 today, 20 yesterday, and 20 tomorrow. And there's documented \nevidence that this total includes many honorable service members who have not actually been in combat. \n\nTo address this directly, I'm proposing a $500 million investment in military mental health care. To put that into \nperspective, this is about $200 million less than we spend on the military band which comes from the recruiting \nbudget and we could pick--pick a bunch of other offsets. But the amendment I'm offering would cut the A-10, a relic \nthat the Air Force itself wants to retire and that I would add lest anyone think I'm choosing this offset for convenient \npolitics would have negative impacts on jobs in my own district. \n\nIt would also cut funding for the littoral combat ship which is not capable of surviving combat. This need is urgent \nand it's up to us to find the money. Now, I understand that there are multiple points of order against this amendment \nand for that reason, I will withdraw it. But I hope that we can start this conversation and as this bill works its way to \n\n\n\nthe president's desk, I hope we can use the NDAA and our committees' bipartisan relationships to deliver for our \nservice members on mental health. \n\nI am committed to leading this effort and I look forward to working with the chairman, the ranking member to provide \nadditional resources for mental health care as we move ahead. With that Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: You withdraw the amendment, is that correct? \n\nMOULTON: That is correct, Mr. chairman. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. It is now in order to consider log number 308 by Mr. Gallego of what purposes does the \ngentleman seek recognition. \n\nGALLEGO: I think Mr. Chairman, I lay an amendment on the table. \n\nSMITH: Well, the court please distribute the amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading and the \ngentleman is recognized for five minutes to discuss this amendment. \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Seventy-eight million Americans live in ten states where marijuana is fully \nlegalized and additional 22 states have decriminalized possession of the substance and it keeps growing. Our \nnation's views on marijuana use are changing and the services have changed their recruitment process accor--\naccordingly. \n\nThe services can wear appropriate grant waivers to former users of marijuana who want to serve their country in \nuniform. And given our nation's recruitment crisis, I believe we need to fundamentally rethink the military's \nenlistment policies regarding marijuana. But I'm not advocating for that today in this amendment. I'm here to \nnarrowly ensure that every service branch has the same guidance on how to grant these waivers. \n\nSo the service secretaries can use their discretion--their discretion to grant a re-enlistment waiver to an individual \nwho use marijuana once a single time--single time outside of their service. The need for this amendment came from \nconstituent of mine who served honorably as a Marine, left the military and went back to school and eventually \nearned a law degree. He tried to join the Marine Corps as an officer. He wanted to be a Jag and checked every \neligible--eligibility requirement. \n\nBut my constituent answered truthfully when he was asked if he had used marijuana after separating from the \nmilitary--after separating from the military and he did, he use it once in a place and a state where it was legal for \nhim to use marijuana. And while the army would have granted him a reenlistment waiver, in the Marines, the \nindividual recruitment officer gets to the side, not the service secretary. And in this case my constituent was told he \nhad two choices. Walk away or lie. \n\nThat's right. An inspiring jag was told to lie in order to get around a Marine Corps policy. My constituent wouldn't do \nthat and so the Marines have one fewer excellent jag today because of that issue. \n\nThis discrepancy between the services is unnecessary and it's just bad policy. In the time when the services have \nhad trouble recruiting, we're training excellent candidates with stellar prior records in uniform away and haphazard \narbitrary manner. That's why I'm offering this narrowly tailored amendment to help establish uniformity and \nempower the services to use their discretion if they want to relist a former service member who has used marijuana \nsingle time as a private citizen. \n\nThere's ample evidence that the social and personal consequences are far worse for alcohol use than for marijuana \nuse. And take it for Marines on this committee, Mr. chairman, we would not be able to assemble a single Marine \nCorps regiment if we exclude everyone who's ever had a sip of beer or whiskey. At a time when a growing number \nof states are legalizing marijuana and medical cannabis, zero tolerance policy simply do not make sense. \n\n\n\nMr. chairman, my constituent is exactly the type of patriotic American that every member here would want \ndefending our country. There are more out there in all of our districts. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote for my \namendment so that we can ensure that they can continue to serve. Thank you and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the amendment. Mr. Moulton, I'm sorry I don't know what that meant. \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a brief comment because it's amazing to hear the story of Mr. \nGallego's constituent. When I showed up at a Marine Corps recruiters office, I didn't lie and I said I'd used \nmarijuana multiple times. I certainly wouldn't be sitting here today as a member of Congress if not for being in the \nMarine Corps and the fact that the standards were clearly different for me than they were for Mr. Gallagher's--\nGallego's constituent just shows why this amendment is necessary. With that Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Kelly, the designated killjoy. \n\nKELLY: Absolutely. You know, I--I agree for your guy--for the guy that you're trying to protect but the problem with \nthe amendment is that's not all it protects. When you read the amendment, it defends those for sale distribution, not \njust use--not just a user, the distribution. So if you distributed, 200 tons of marijuana illegally in another state, you \nwould still be eligible for a waiver. \n\nAnd just like if we don't trust people to use the waiver that they already have, then why would we trust those same \npeople to make that same decision that they can allow someone who sold 200 tons of marijuana which is a case \nthat I prosecuted in my district for distribution. And so, it is not narrowly enough tailored. Was it narrowly tailored, I \ncould support it. But we cannot allow felony convicted people for distribution of many--any weight of marijuana to be \nin our military service on somebody's request. That is just not acceptable. \n\nIf it was more narrowly tailored to misdemeanors or the things that were different and just used, I could support it \nbut I can't for the distribution and sale of marijuana no matter what quantity and with that I-- \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the amendment, Mr. Scott. \n\nSCOTT: Just briefly, I--I agree with what Mr. Kelly's saying. If it's a misdemeanor offense, that's very different than if \nit's felony offense. And so, I'll yield the--I yield my time to Mr. Brown. \n\nBROWN: Thank you. I--I don't want your time, I want my own time. \n\nSCOTT: Well, you can have four minutes and 45 seconds of mine. \n\nBROWN: Great. I'll take your time and then maybe I'll take my own but no thank you. \n\nSMITH: Austin, you're not doing me a favor. \n\nSCOTT: Yeah, I'm going to yield to Mr. Gallego but with the question though-- \n\nSMITH: Hey, guys, guys, whoa; stop everything. Fascinating discussion, I'm going to try to try to maintain control \nhere. So Austin, it is your time. What would you like to do with it? \n\nSCOTT: I will reclaim my time and yield it back to the chair, if that is the easiest-- \n\nSMITH: That would be awesome and I will recognize Mr. Brown to speak on the amendment. \n\nBROWN: Thank you Mr. Chair, can I get back that eight seconds that I--that you started? Now, look, the question--I \nmean and--and the comment is if you read the amendment it says that it's--it's permissive--it permits the Secretary \nto promulgate regulations. So it doesn't direct them. And when the secretary does permit them in the regulations, \nthey can address the distribution question. So I--I--I share your concern. \n\nI don't want to see that big drug lord, kingpin in our Marines Air Force or anywhere else but I think that--that--that \nwe can--that we can avoid that with the amendment. I yield to Mr. Gallego. \n\n\n\nGALLEGO: Well, in--in the spirit of bipartisanship because I am so bipartisan, I actually will take your suggestions \nand would like to enter that your men--my amendment and narrowly define it the way that you have both suggested, \nand I hope that we can do that in whatever process possible. \n\nSMITH: Okay. What--what--what you would like to do is offer a substitute amendment. Okay, unfortunately, you \nkind of have to have said substitute amendment. So what I'd like to do and I'm not sure if we can do this if we could \nwork on that substitute amendment and while we're working on that substitute amendment, suspend this one and \nmove on to the others and then come back to it before the conclusion of this mark. Unanimous consent to do that? \n\nAll right, so get working on that and we'll move on to the next amendment in the queue here and we'll come back to \nthis in just a few minutes. Next up, it is in order to consider log number 423. And I have my script in front of me here \nbut I know that I'm supposed to--this is offered by Mr. Wilson for what purposes does the gent--but--purpose does \nthe gentleman from South Carolina seek recognition? \n\nWILSON: Mr. chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Would the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the \namendment, the gentleman is recognized for five minutes to discuss. \n\nWILSON: Mr. chairman, I'm grateful to provide this important amendment to repeal the unfair offset to end the \nidentified widows tax. This is a dollar-for-dollar offset of payments between the DoD, survivor benefit plans, SBP, \nand the VA dependency and indemnity compensation DIC program. As a standalone bill, HR 553 has over 340 \nmembers from both sides of the aisle coming together to repeal the offset. \n\nSBP provides an important annuity to the surviving spouse of service members who died on active duty as well as \nsurvivors of retirees who were paid into SBP and died of a service-connected cause. Meanwhile, DIC is paid to \nsurviving families of veterans who died from injuries or disease incurred in the line of duty or disabilities com--\ncompens--compensable--com--compensable under laws administered by the Veterans Administration. \n\nCurrently, the law requires an unfair dollar-for-dollar deduction of DIC payments from SBP payments. This offset \nwipes out most or all of the SBP entitlement and affects approximately 65,255 widows and widowers. This \nsubstitution shu--of DIC for SBP is inappropriate. Families of men and women who paid the ultimate price for our \nfreedoms should not be subject to an unfair deduction of benefits because of the SBPDIC offset. \n\nThe time is now to repeal the offset and restore the benefits to our surviving families. As the legislation is pending \nand working with the chairman, I'm grateful to offer this amendment and now withdraw. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The amendment is withdrawn. Next up is log 043 by Miss Speier for what purposes--purpose \ndoes the gentlelady seek recognition. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the \namendment. The gentlelady is recognized for five minutes to discuss. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This particular amendment requires the Marine Corps to integrate basic training \nat Parris Island within five years and at San Diego within eight years. Fully integrating women is not only the right \nthing to do, it's also makes our military stronger. Our armed services have begun to reap the benefits of a military \nthat trains and fights in a gender integrated manner. \n\nGender integrated units have strengths at all male units lack. Women's diverse perspectives help units develop \ninnovative approaches to challenges, increase units mutual respect and focus and make them more lethal. Every \noperational role in training course in our military is gender integrated. Every course except for one; marine basic \ntraining. \n\n\n\nLet me repeat that. Every training program and every service at every level in every specialty including of course \ncombat infantry training in the Marines is gender integrated. Only Marine basic training is not. The army integrated \nit's basic in the 1990s. At Parris Island, male and female units trained in parallel. The closest the Marines have \ncome to integration there is incorporating a female platoon into a male company, but the Marines have told us \nplatoons are the building blocks for transforming recruits. So even they know this isn't true integration. \n\nIn 2015, the Marines we're the only service asked for a combat integration waiver which they justified with a bias \nstudy that was designed to demonstrate women's inferiority. For example, it compared experienced all-male units \nwith newly cre--newly created mixed units. When Congress asked them in FY 18, NDAA what changes and \nresources they would need to fully integrate all Marine basic training, they took a year and four months to write a \nthree-page report explaining why the status quo works. \n\nTo cap it off, they roughly estimated with no evident methodology that it would cost $200 million to construct \nbarracks to integrate at the company, not platoon level. A couple of months ago, I visited with young female \nMarines serving in recently opened combat positions. They are immeasurably brave, tough, and inspiring. Each one \nof them had stories of having to prove themselves time and time again to their male peers and superiors. \n\nOne went for months with a broken limb because she did not want to look like she wasn't tough enough. Having to \nbe the best Marines so no one could doubt that they were Marines, that they deserve to be there. The woman told \nme stories about the training their units received before they arrived. A primer on how to work with women without \nassaulting them. This would also be easier if Marines followed the advice of one of the young woman I met that day. \n\nTrained the way you fight. If platoons or transformational units, woman should be in them. Having men and women \nwork together from day one shows that they are equally Marines. These women sign up for a hard job and do so \nwillingly with eyes open. They deserve a chance to prove themselves alongside their male colleagues and to \nreceive the same treatment as male Marines. \n\nGiven the resistance in the Marines, Congress must take the lead. This amendment would give the Marines ample \ntime to make integration work logistically and prob--programmatically. I don't believe their cost estimate was made \nin good faith, but this lead time far longer than the services had to integrate actual combat units will allow the \nMarines to budget and build as needed. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. \n\nCISNEROS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. You know, as a sailor that went through boot camp, I understand how \nimportant it is that this part of the training. You know, all other branches of the military have integrated their basic \ntraining and there's no reason why the Marine Corps basic training can't be integrated as well. After all the Marine \nCorps has integrated, their Officer Candidate School training units at the company level, female candidates trained \nas all-female platoons alongside other all-male platoons and have done so for more than 15 years. \n\nJust this year in January, the Marine Corps also integrated a recruit training company at Parris Island for the first \ntime. And according to the marine corps officials, there was no problem with the integration at all. And even one of \nthe recruits stated in an article that he wasn't concerned about who was in the platoon or who was in the company, \nall he was trying to do was survive. \n\nTrue equality and cohesion can no longer wait. Men and women Marines worked together, they should train \ntogether as well. I want to thank Rep. Speier for her leadership on this issue. I strongly support this amendment and \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of its adoption. I yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: Any further discussion. Hearing none, all in favor of the amendment will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. The amen--you guys working out like the choir over there. The ayes have it. The amendment is \nadopted. A recorded vote is requested. We will hold this until the end of these amendments and then we will have a \nrecorded vote. it Is now in-- \n\nSMITH: (OFF-MIC) \n\n\n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, have you spoken? Have you-- \n\nSMITH: I apologize. You now need to say, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number five. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc number five. Consisting of amendments have \nbeen worked out and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection so ordered, the clerk will distribute the En Bloc amendment and without objection, the \namendments are considered as read and the gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of \nexplaining the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Thank You Mr. Chairman.

(OFF-MIC) On passage all those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no. The En Bloc package is adopted. Going to take me a second to get to the right page in the \nbook here. Oh no, we have another En Bloc. We will now consider En Bloc package number six. Chair recognizes \nMrs. Speier for the purposes of offering the En Bloc package. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number six consisting of amendments \nhave been worked out with the minority and approved. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, the amendments \nare considered as read and the gentlelady is recognized to explain the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Thank You Mr. chairman. This En Bloc package contains amendment number 018 by Mr. turner that \ndirects the secretary of each military department to carry out and report on a pilot program of defense investigators \nwithin the military justice system. Amendment 121--120R1 by Mr. Brown that directs the department to continue \nresearch into freeze-dried platelet technology. \n\n\n\nAmendment number 315 by miss Houlahan that direct SecDef to provide a briefing on the feasibility of establishing \na legally enforceable duty to intervene when a service member witnesses sexual misconduct.

Hearing none, question (INAUDIBLE) on passage of the En Bloc \nnumber six, is that right? All those in favor say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Oppose, no. The ayes have it. The En Bloc is adopted and next up, we will now consider log number 160 \nby Miss Speier. What purpose does the gentlewoman seek recognition? \n\nSPEIER: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment \nand the gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes to discuss. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This amendment is one to ensure survivors of sexual assault have access to \nemergency contraception at military treatment facilities. The Department of Defense already has a policy of \nproviding survivors with emergency contraception at MTFs. This amendment only codifies and makes this policy \nmore explicit to ensure that women have accurate information about emergency contraception and are offered \nemergency contraception upon request. \n\nThis amendment also clarifies that survivors have a right to confidentiality with respect to information and care \nprovided. With that, I yield back. \n\nHARTZLER: Thank You Mr. Chairman, I guess I have a question for the author of the amendment. As I'm just now \nreading it but is the victim of sexual assault also going to be counseled with other services that might be available to \nthem that would be supportive to them in the community like pregnancy care centers or others that would support \nthe women throughout but not potentially use Plan B which many people view as actually taking the life of the baby \nby preventing implantation. so are they going to be also counseled and other options that would be available to \nthem? \n\nSPEIER: Miss Hartzler, I'm actually not certain about that. When someone seeks emergency contraception it is \ntypically not to then carry that fetus to term. But if you would like, we can put this over momentarily and determine \nwhether or not counseling on having the child is part of providing emergency contraception. \n\nHARTZLER: They all--as you say, it's already current policy that they are provided this option. It is already current \nlaw I'm not really sure why we need this amendment but if we are going to explicitly codify that they need to be \nexplicitly counseled in--in plan B, I think equally they should also be counseled and other options of support that \nwould affirm life of both the victim as well as their potential baby if pregnancy should occur from this horrible \n(INAUDIBLE). \n\n\n\nSPEIER: Thank you Miss Hartzler, I've actually been enlightened in the last two minutes. And as it turns out, a \nwoman is counseled on all her options and only if she requests emergency contraception that she receives it. \n\nHARTZLER: Okay, is that what your amendment says? \n\nSPEIER: It just codifies the existing policy within the Department of Defense. \n\nHARTZLER: Okay, so would you support (INAUDIBLE) aside and adding the language to codify that they'd also be \ncounseled on other options as well? \n\nSPEIER: Well, it includes other options already. \n\nHARTZLER: What line is that on? \n\nSPEIER: Let's put this over and we'll come back to it. \n\nHARTZLER: Okay, thank you, appreciate that. \n\nSPEIER: We putti--Mr. Chairman, we're putting it over so that we can respond to Miss Hartzler's questions. \n\nSMITH: Okay. All right, so we'll do the En Bloc package and we're still waiting for the other amendment, if you're \nready as well. \n\nSPEIER: I think we have one more En Bloc. \n\nSMITH: Yes, we do. Hold on just one second, my lawyer's saying something to me I don't understand. Okay. I have \nto withdraw it right now. What will go on to--go up--we're going to--we're going to do the same thing we did on the \nmarijuana--sorry Cannabis Amendment. Take a timeout, see if we need to fix it and see if we can fix it and take it \nup, because you're wanting to--you're not wanting to withdraw your amendment-- \n\nSPEIER: No. \n\nSMITH: You're just wanting to understand better-- \n\nSPEIER: We want to clarify for Miss Hartzler what the existing policy is in terms of talking about all option. \n\nSMITH: Okay, you got about five minutes to do that. \n\nSPEIER: All right. \n\nSMITH: So we'll--we'll work on that. So we'll--we'll postpone consideration of that amendment, log 160 and we'll get \nonto En Bloc number seven. It is now in order to call up En Bloc number seven and chair recognizes Mrs. Speier for \nthe purposes of offering the En Bloc amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. chairman, thank you. I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc number seven consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved by the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. The clerk will distribute the amendment and without objection, reading will be \ndispensed with and Miss Speier is recognized for five minutes to explain the amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Thank you Mr. chairman. This package number seven has the following amendments. Amendment \nnumber 297 by Miss Trahan that would include children with a parent or parents in the National Guard or reserve--\nReserve Component in the military student identifier definition of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Amendment \nnumber 013 by Mr. Turner that requires commanders of sexual assault victims to notify the victim of key events and \ndocuments such events--and document such events in the military justice process. \n\nAmendment number 088 by Miss Gabbard that creates the military dental research program to improve military \nreadiness by supporting dental inquiries with military relevance and implications. Amendment number 281 by Mr. \n\n\n\nWaltz authorizes DoD to reimburse surviving family members of service members killed in action for costs \nassociated with transporting the remains to a National Cemetery. \n\nAmendment number 215R1 by Mr. Kelly that creates a pilot program for specialized surgical training partnerships \nbetween Armed Forces surgeons with public private or nonprofit organizations. Amendment number 066 by Miss \nDavis that protects servicemembers from forced arbitration in USERRA cases. Amendment number 289R1 by Mr. \nCourtney that adds a provision which prevents the Secretary of Defense from imposing a limit on transferability of \nGI bill benefits based on maximum number of years of service. \n\nSMITH: Is there discussion on the En Bloc amendment? Mr. Courtney. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to again thank the Chairwoman Speier for adding the GI Bill \nmeasure that's at the bottom there. Again, this reverse is a truly lousy decision by the Department of Defense last \nyear which restricted the transferability of GI bill benefits by a service member to their spouse or children who has \nserved longer than 16 years of service. Again, this decision which again was within the discretion of the Secretary \nof Defense, punishes those who have actually served in over a long period of time, maybe had married late or got \ndivorced and remarried and started a family later and cut them off from being able to--to get the benefit of the GI \nbills. Really special component of transferability of benefits. \n\nIf you talk to military service members they will tell you it is one of the most popular aspects of the GI bill to have \nthat option for--for themselves and their families. So again, the Iraq and Afghan war veterans of America are--are in \nstrong support of--of this amendment because again, it--it really, it--it's focused really on that population during that \nconflict. And I would note that with the help of Craig Greene (SP), we did run the traps with the Congressional \nBudget Office again. \n\nThis does not have--it was---it didn't score and that's great. So we can vote to move it forward and I want to thank \nMr. Takano from the Veterans Committee for waiving jurisdiction and allowing us to fix this. \n\nOne last point, the clock is still ticking on that order from the secretary of Defense. It goes into effect in July. I'll be \ncirculating a member--a letter to members asking the secretary to hold off implementation given the fact that we \nhave voted again to reverse that decision. And again, last year, we had a strong 90-member letter that was \nbipartisan protesting when this decision went through, and with that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the En Bloc? Hearing none, question-- \n\nMr. Chairman, I'm sorry Mr. chairman. \n\nSMITH: oh, yes, sorry, Mr. Waltz. \n\nWALTZ: Thank You Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank madam chairwoman for including this amendment and just \nto inform my colleagues, the current DoD policy when we lose a service member overseas is to only pay for one \nflight for that body to come home. So many families want to have a memorial service at home and then often, the \nservice member preferred to be buried in a National Cemetery or in Arlington National Cemetery. The current policy \nis that flight has to come out of pocket from the family. \n\nSo here is a family who just received that horrible knock on the door. And in order to carry out that service \nmembers' wishes to go to a National Cemetery and often they have their own wishes to honor him or her at home, \nthey have to come out of pocket. And in my own case, on a few occasions my unit passed the hat from downrange \nto pay for that service members flight. So I thank the chairwoman for including this amendment. \n\nI think we can still do better. This amendment only reimburses the family for the second flight rather than covering \nthe cost completely because apparently, it's a little too much of a burden on the Defense Department to provide a \nsecond honor guard and to provide a second ceremony. I find that egregious and plan to work with my colleagues \nto get that second flight fully covered, it's a drop in the bucket for overall that we're talking about here today and it is \na strategic issue to take care of the families of our fallen because it sends a message to everyone serving in terms \nof recruitment and retention. I yield my time and thank you. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Thank you for the discussion on the En Bloc? hearing non, all those in favor of En Bloc package number \nseven will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. The En Bloc package is adopted. We're now at the end here, so two things hanging out there. \nThe cannabis amendment is not ready as I understand it, so we're going to--we're going to punt it to the full \ncommittee and we'll deal with it there. Then, we have log 106 that was being debated and kind of got a do it or not \ndo it at this point. So we're going to restart that debate and I'll recognize Miss Speier to update us and where it's at. \n\nSPEIER: I--I would--I unfortunately didn't have a chance to find Miss Hartzler in the--in the outer room but I think we \nhave an unders--I have an understanding more specifically of what this provides. And this particular amendment \nwould codify what is existing law as it relates to counseling women on the FDA-approved options for emergency \ncontraception. And I would like to retain it as that and that alone. \n\nSMITH: Miss Hartzler, will you care to comment? \n\nHARTZLER: Well, we just starting to work on some suggested language that we would like to present to the \nchairwoman. We didn't have a chance to do that. I don't have a copy of it right now but basically-- \n\nSMITH: I have a suggestion. \n\nHARTZLER: Okay. \n\nSMITH: If Miss Speier is okay with it, we can take this up at the full committee level as well. \n\nSPEIER: Yeah, I'm happy. \n\nSMITH: So we'll punt that-- \n\nHARTZLER: That would be--that would be great, thank you. \n\nSMITH: We'll take time. We have one amendment. Now, we are at the conclusion of the mil-mil pers (SP) markup. \nWe had one amendment that was listed for a vote. This was log 043 by Miss Speier and could you--could the staff \nremind us what it does before we vote on it? \n\nCLERK: It's integrating Marine Corps, Mr. Chairman \n\nSMITH: Ah, yes. This is the amendment that would require the Marine Corps to do integrated training as the rest of \nthe military does now. (INAUDIBLE) So I think we know what it is and the clerk will call the roll. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith. \n\nSMITH: Aye \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith votes aye.

There are no further amendments. So it is now in order and the chair \nrecognizes the gentlewoman from California, Miss Speier, for the purpose of offering a motion. \n\nSPEIER: So chairman, I moved to adopt the subcommittee report of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel as \namended. \n\nSMITH: Questions on the motion from the gentlewoman from California, so many as in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed. Quorum being present, the ayes have it, the motion is adopted. And we're moving on. The \ncommittee will now receive the report of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces pursuant to Committee Rules 17 in \nconsultation with the ranking member will postpone all of the recorded votes and the amendments of this particular \nsubcommittee (INAUDIBLE) consideration of all amendments to the subcommittee marker have concluded. And the \nchair recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper for any comments he \nwould like to make. \n\n\n\nCOOPER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. As we move into discussing the portion of the chairman's mark which arguably \nhas the heaviest responsibility of any in Congress or the world because authorizing nu--nuclear weapons means \nthat the fate of the nation and the planet is literally in our hands. \n\nI would like to thank the subcommittee members on both sides of the aisle for their many contributions to the \nstrategic forces mark. We value their ideas and priorities and we look forward to having a debate on these issues at \nthe full committee level. \n\nI would like to thank our indispensable staff especially Leonor Tomero (SP), Sarah Mineiro (SP), Maria Vastulo \n(SP), Grant Snyder (SP), and Zack Taylor (SP), who worked tirelessly over the past week to come up with \nbipartisan agreements on many of the issues and amendments included in this portion of the bill. \n\nI remember the subcommittee and full committee knows that the most important duty of our government is to \ndefend the nation and the number one priority of our Defense Department is to maintain safe secure reliable and \neffective nuclear forces. This subcommittee has long--a long tradition of bipartisanship and continuity \ncommensurate with our heavy and often technical responsibilities. As others have mentioned, regarding the top-line \ndebate, I would like to quickly quote my strategic forces ranking member who along with 70 other Republican \nmembers in a letter signed last December said \"we the undersigned strongly urge you to uphold your commitment \nof $733 billion to restore our nation's military as you complete the fiscal year 2020 president's budget.\" \n\nThis mark does exactly that. In a similar vein, the Chairman's mark upholds our commitment to nuclear \nmodernization. For example, it funds the National Nuclear Security Administration at 4.3 percent increase over last \nyear's appropriation. This includes a $608 million increase to the NNSA's weapons activities programs. It also \nincreases funding for nuclear command and control. There are undoubtedly areas where we disagree but as I \nmentioned last week at subcommittee level, an overwhelming majority of the strategic forces portion of the \nchairman's mark represents continuity with the policies of this subcommittee, with every presidential administration \nof both parties going back many decades. \n\nThat should reassure Americans and our allies because the last 75 years have brought remarkable peace and \nprosperity to the world. Regarding some areas of contention, starting with low yield, the last 60 years of nuclear \ndeterrent strategy was based in part on the U.S. Strategic Nuclear Submarine Force. The most survivable leg of the \ntriad never being used as a tactical nuclear platform. Members know that I'm not arguing against low yield weapons \nthemselves. We already have a large number of low yield nuclear weapons available and hundreds deployed, but \nfor our air assets, not our submarines. \n\nThis mark also increases security by mandating military-to-military dialogue to reduce the risk of nuclear \nmiscalculation, reducing the risk of inadvertently pre--precipitating an unintentional nuclear war, should be a \nbipartisan and urgent effort. \n\nRegarding plutonium pit manufacturing, we prioritize reaching 30 pits per year as soon as possible by 2026. As a \nrecent Institute for Defense analysis study noted, achieving this skill will be extremely challenging and plans to build \ntwo sites at the same time could put the entire plutonium effort at risk. We must set up NNSA for success and \nminimize risks and avoid wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. \n\nAs arms control treaties continue to be challenged by this administration, the smart continues the long-standing \nU.S. participation in the Open Skies Treaty. This 1992 era, George H.W. Bush Treaty, has enabled the United \nStates together with our NATO allies and partners to hold Russia to account in the face of Russian provocations \nsuch as the Russian takeover of Ukrainian naval vessel in the Black Sea. \n\nOn this topic, I'm happy that we are working with the minority on a compromise that continues to support this treaty \nand addresses concerns raised by the minority during last week's subcommittee mark. In addition to open skies, the \nchairman's mark requires the department to provide this committee information on post INF weapons system \ndevelopment and plans for moving forward with renewal and/or negotiation on new start. \n\n\n\nThis mark also focuses on near-term priorities for developing hypersonic weapons in a way that avoids increasing \nthe risks of miscalculation. It directs the Secretary of the Navy to only pursue development of systems that can be \nlaunched from surface ships rather than submarine unique development. \n\nWith regards to missile defense, this mark continues bipartisan efforts initiated over the past several years to \nincrease capacity, capability, and reliability of our homeland and regional missile defenses. For the third year in a \nrow, this mark directs and funds the department to develop a space sensor that will track hypersonic threats in \ncoordination with the newly established space development agency, an Air Force as they look to deliver a resilient \nproliferated low Earth orbit constellation. \n\nLastly, the mark updates national missile defense policy consistent with the 2019 missile defense review, stating \nthat defense of the United States includes missile defense against threats from rogue nations and reliance on the \nnuclear deterrent to deter attacks--attacks from near-peer adversaries. \n\nSMITH: I apologize. The gentleman's time has expired, if you could wrap-- \n\nCOOPER: I'm almost done Mr. Chairman. There's a lot in our mark here. \n\nSMITH: Fair enough. \n\nCOOPER: I'm--I'm reading as fast as I can. It further increases oversight and accountability for programs of the \nmissile defense agency to ensure fly before you by principles to remain intact for both the SM-3 block 2A and the \nRKV and remove several arbitrary deadlines mandated by Congress to deliver capability regardless of technical \nmaturity or testing conducted specifically in space. On space, the space Corps will be brought up a full committee \nlevel but we look forward to having a successful deliberation on the strategic forces section of the mark. I thank the \nchair for his patience. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. the chair now recognizes the ranking member of strategic forces subcommittee gentleman from \nOhio, Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I too want to thank our staff Sarah and Leonor and Mr. Chairman I want to \nthank you for your efforts and your assistance in our work. You made a comment early on when you convene this \ncommittee that you wanted to ensure the long-term bipartisan legacy of this committee and I think your work on this \nsubcommittee mark is--is showing that and--and I appreciate Mr. Cooper's renewed flexibility as we try to find a \nbipartisan result. \n\nI think people aren't aware that, you know, I was very disappointed in the subcommittee mark. I've been on the \ncommittee 18 years, I've never had a subcommittee mark that went by a partisan vote. Every Republican member \nvoted against the subcommittee mark. There are three basic policy principles and I just want to go over those for \neverybody who's not on subcommittee so that you understand what these debate issues work. It's not just minor \nissues, they're actually go to the heart of some of the policy issues that we deal with here on the committee and I \nthink each of you want to understand those as we go through this debate. \n\nNow, a couple of them I think in the end will be resolved. I've--in working with the chairman and Mr. Cooper, I think \nthey've been pulled up to the full committee, it might be resolved but I want to go over what they are so you \nunderstand that this is not just a--a partisan division, these are actually true policy basis upon which those true \ndisagreement I think even some of you will find that--that you agree that these are troubling. \n\nThree provisions that were in the committee, I think expressed very different values than this committee or \nCongress has adopted in the past, then each of you must ask yourself, do these represent your own values or not? \nThe first is that this bill actually said the subcommittee mark, that the United States would concede are--concede \nour sovereign right to determine if we stay in a trait--in a treaty to third party nations. \n\nBasic policy; do you think that is okay or not, that we're going to be in a treaty and we're going to concede our \nsovereign authority to other parties to decide if we stay in or not? What's even worse is if you knew that one of \n\n\n\nthose parties was Turkey, that's right. The original provision in the subcommittee mark would have Erdogan having \na say as to why not we stay in the--in the--in the treaty itself? \n\nThe second value is are you for unilateral disarmament of the United States or not? I mean, it really is that simple; \nunilateral or not. Now, the opposite, the--the other options besides unilateral courses, bilateral or multilateral, and I \nthink we're all for multilateral and bilateral. That's treaty, That's where we go to our adversaries and we say, there \nare weapon systems we don't want to have or we don't want you to have. We're going to enter into a treaty to \neliminate them. \n\nNever do we go down the path where unilaterally we say that we're going to disarm ourselves especially in the area \nwhere our adversaries possess weapons that are similar. The problem with going down the path for unilateral is that \nonce you go there, when do you stop? Do you then say it's okay for Congress to eliminate the triad? Is it okay to \ncontinue to--to do unilateral disarmament or should we empower ourselves to pursue bilateral and multilateral? \n\nNow, this is not just an issue are you for nukes are against nukes because we're all against nukes, we all want a \nworld where there are not nukes. But the difference between getting our adversaries to the table and in by \nlegislation, eliminating our own weapon systems is extreme. \n\nThe third is--is do we interfere in international military and State Department Affairs by requiring by law that \nmeetings occur with our adversaries? Why--why would we by law say our adversaries have to sit down with--with \nour military counterparts without regard to their behavior? Who they meet with should be based upon a myriad of \nissues none of which should be determined by legislation? \n\nNow, as everyone who has said during each of these subcommittee marks, we are--we continue to be concerned \nthat this does not meet the 3 to 5 percent real growth that is required in order to sustain what we've been able to \naccomplish in rebuilding our military, General Dunford, Secretary Mattis secretary--Secretary Shanahan have all \ntestified that we need 3 to 5 percent growth. \n\nThere are additional amendments that will come forward where we're seeing this overall funding in this area where \nthere's a 138 million that's below the president's budget levels in DoE weapons, a 19 million in the Navy strategic \nsystem programs for W76 to development, 10--103 million to ground-based strategic deterrent program below the \npresident's budget level. All of that are funding issues that we're going to be having a debate on and we're gonna \nhave a debate on also with ranking member Thornberry's amendment. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. further comments on the subcommittee mark. I want to comment to something that Mr. Cooper \nalluded to or didn't allude to, he said of in the reading. I want to be sure everyone caught this. It was actually a letter \nthat was, I believe led by Mr. Turner and had 70 Republicans signing on to it, and it was sent in February urging \nthat the Department of Defense uphold their commitment of $733 billion to restore our nation's military as you \ncomplete the fiscal year 2020 president's budget. \n\nCuts the defense spending will have disastrous consequences for our military readiness as was proven by \nsequestration, completely agreed. Recently, the congressionally directed Commission on National Security Strategy \nwarned, you know, basically a cut below 733 would be problematic. This was back when the president had mused \nabout doing a $700 billion defense budget instead of 733. \n\nNow, I fully understand that at the time, you were trying to prevent it from going down to $700 billion from 733. \nHowever, if in fact the 3--3 to 5 percent figure you've been quoting has been around for a long time, so if in fact, you \nwere of the opinion that 733 was as disastrous as you are now saying that it is and that had to be 750, I fail to see \nwhy back--because March 26 was the date of that letter--why on March 26 that it wouldn't have occurred you to say \nnot only is going to 700 ridiculous, but the 733 was wrong in the first place. \n\nSo as of March, even the Republican leadership on Armed Services issue said gotta have 733, and I would say at a \nminimum. That means at the point of whether or not going to 750 is crucial to national Security's at least debatable \nbecause again, if 750 was so important, why wasn't--why weren't you all aware of that in March when you implored \nthe president to keep it at 733? \n\n\n\nAgain, admitted that it was 733 instead of 700, but you could have said 750 then and we will--we will have this \ndebate further but that's the point that Mr. Cooper was making in the letter that he was referencing to. Mr. \nThornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would simply say in response whether it's 733, 750, one needs to look \nat what it buys. And--and Mr. Turner laid out specific cuts from the administration's request in this area which are \nnot just abstract numbers or political newspaper stories but real capability. And so when we get to the point, we will \nhave a list of specific ships and planes and research and strategic capability including nuclear weapons complex, \nthe Minuteman III replacement. \n\nIt's--it's hard, concrete things we can do or things we cannot do, and I think that's what we need to focus on more \nthan a number that is floated back and forth in the Washington parlor game. I yield back. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: I'm curious about a couple of things. First of all, no one that I'm aware of in this, well on the dais, \nDemocrats, Republicans has talked about unilateral disarmament, no one. So let's get that straight, let's get that \non the record. We do debate whether a particular piece of equipment or weapon is necessary at this time. I would \nalso point out that a couple of the nuclear bombs that are under discussion are being delayed for reasons \nspecifically the B2112. Money not necessary now because of some delays in the development of it. \n\nThere's no reason for us to put money into that at this time because of the development of it. Similarly, with some of \nthese other weapons systems that are under discussion here. I will point out that there was $2.3 billion taken out of \nthe Department of Defense's current budget program--current operations to fund a border wall. Presumably, that \nmoney was to be used for something necessary but is not now going to be used for--but is now for a different \npurpose. \n\nWith regard to the other issues about the use of low-yield weapon on a nuclear-armed submarine, it would be \nunwise as Mr. Cooper said to take our fundamental strategic defense and turn it into a tactical system. \n\nSo but any case, the bottom line of this is that this particular mark adequately deals with the defense of this nation \nand does not put money into programs that are not current or necessary at this time. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Inconveniently, the Government Oversight Committee is holding a vote right at the moment and Mr. Cooper \nis on said committee. I think we can do--well, it may take us a minute to find someone who can do the En Bloc \npackage. We can do the En Bloc package but to get in any substantive amendments beyond that, we're going to \nhave to wait. \n\nJohn, you want to take over the honors there? Is there some staffer who can help Mr. Garamendi get--get the \nproper words in front--hey you've heard me stumbling through this all morning. We all need help on this. So get--\nget the terminology down here correctly if we can show him the right page here. Somebody got that? \n\nSo I will do my part which is we will now consider En Bloc package number one and the chair recognizes Mr. \nGaramendi for the purpose of offering the En Bloc amendment. \n\nGARAMENDI: (OFF-MIC) Due to the extraordinary staff work, I'm now prepared to deal with this, Mr. chairman. \n\nSMITH: Okay, you're up. You're asking-- \n\nGARAMENDI: I ask unanimous consent to call En Bloc package number one consisting of amendments that have \nbeen worked out with both the minority and the majority. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Without objection so ordered, the clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, the amendments \nare considered as read and the gentleman is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of explaining the En Bloc \namendment. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The En Bloc Amendment number 1 is comprised to the following; \nAmendment number 122 by Mr. Brown to--concerning the reallocation of funding for wide area surveillance--\nsurveillance and procurement to research development, test and evaluation efforts. Amendment number 141 1 by \nMr. Rogers concerning a report on commercial and space-based radiofrequency mapping. Amendment number 182 \nby Mr. Cooper regarding repeal of the requirement for a commission on electromagnetic (INAUDIBLE) attack and \nsimilar events. \n\nAmendment number 183 by Mr. Cooper regarding authorization of appropriations for the national security--National \nNuclear Security Administration, the NNSA. Amendment number 184R1 by Mr. Cooper regarding an independent \nstudy on the risks of nuclear terrorism and nuclear war. Amendment one--number 193R1 by Mr. Carbajal regarding \nrequest for the annual assessment of the basic--annual assessment of the ballistic missile defense system. \n\nAmendment number 393 by Mr. Lamborn regarding compatibility of the DoD systems with complementary \ncommercial satellite ground architecture. Amendment number 427 by Mr. Wilson concerning an amendment to \ndirective report language regarding excess plutonium disposition that mentions funding priorities of the NNSA at the \nSavannah River Site. Amendment 429R1 by Mr. Wilson regarding an increase in the Defense environmental \ncleanup account by $25 million for the Savannah River risk management operations. \n\nSMITH: And just--just be clear, somebody told me that--that you missed number 209, is that correct? Amendment \nlog 209, I want to make sure they're all read. Oh, okay, 209 is not--not part of this. Okay, is there further discussion-\n- \n\nGARAMENDI: I would be very, very surprised if I were to make a mistake. \n\nSMITH: Yeah, so would I. Is there further discussion on the En Bloc package? Hearing none, quest--question \noccurs on the En Bloc package. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. Ayes have it. The En Bloc package is adopted and we are now in recess pending Mr. Cooper's \nreturn. Don't go too far. I confess I don't know exactly how long that's going to be. So hopefully just about five \nminutes but we'll see. \n\n(RECESS) \n\n[*]SMITH: We will reconvene. We have one house cleaning item before we get back on to the amendment train \nhere. In the previous--in the first on block, Log 209 was supposed to be removed from it, but it actually wasn't. So, \nwe wound up voting it in when we didn't mean to. So, basically, I need unanimous consent to remove Log 209 from \non block package number one. I talked to Mac about this but Mac's not here. It was--we were talking about a \nunanimous consent-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Okay. All right. No objection, so ordered. All right. Now we're back. There we go. Now in order to \nconsider Log number 024 by Mr. Turner. For what purpose does the gentleman seek recognition? \n\nTURNER: An amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we'll dispense with the reading and the \nGentleman is recognized to explain his amendment. \n\n\n\nTURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, I want to thank you for your efforts on--trying to find bipartisan \nsolutions. This amendment was an attempt at a bipartisan solution on the low-yield nukes because it was to provide \nlanguage that hopefully the minority and majority could use to--to negotiate. It's clear, however, that that's--that's \nnot going to happen. \n\nThe purpose of this language as a start was to indicate that the secretary should certify to us that there's no real \nalternatives to the W76-2. And just to get everybody refreshed that they know--but since we've taken a break--this \nis about the W76-2 which is a low-yield missile that's being placed on nuclear--on our submarines. It's in response \nto Russia and Ruska's--Russia's escalation of the nuclear doctrine of escalate to deescalate. \n\nI wanted to clear up a few things bef--about the discussions that we'd had previously. This is a unilateral \ndisarmament. It's unilateral because we get nothing for doing it. We are calling back our nuclear weapons that on a \nbipartisan basis we funded and authorized to be configured and placed on our submarines. It does not increase the \naggregate number of our nuclear weapons. It actually replaces big nukes. \n\nAnd so, when Mr. Cooper says it weakens our triad, it's because he's saying that every silo on the sub should have \nbig nukes, no little nukes. But that's part of what our overall debate's going to have to be about. And I think we \nshould move on to that debate, and therefore I rem--I withdraw this amendment to concede to the debate that we're \ngoing to proceed with--with Ms. Cheney's amendment, which would strike the provision. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: The amendment is withdrawn. It's now in order to consider log number 406 by Ms. Cheney. And for what \npurpose does the Gentlewoman seek recognition. \n\nCHENEY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute the amendment without objection. We'll dispense with the reading and the Gentlelady is \nrecognized for five minutes. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thanks very much to Chairman Cooper and to Ranking \nMember Turner. Unfortunately, we were, as the ranking member said, unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on \nthe strategic force's subcommittee mark. And that was indeed a sad day for us on that subcommittee. \n\nMy amendment, Mr. Chairman, would restore the authority of the Department of Defense to deploy the low-yield \nvariant of the SLBM, the W76-2 warhead. Our adversaries are developing and deploying low-yield nuclear \nweapons. And the credibility of our deterrence requires that the United States have a proportional response \navailable to discourage any potentially devastating miscalculation. \n\nLow-yield weapons are critical to our security because they give us a credible deterrent. Russia's confidence that if \nthey were to strike us, we would have the capability and the will to respond in a proportional manner makes a strike \nby the Russians less likely, not more likely. Mr. Chairman, this is why the 2018 nuclear posture review included the \nrequirement that the United States develop and deploy the low-yield submarine launched ballistic missile as soon \nas possible. \n\nThe NPR highlighted how critical this capability is to close the deterrence gap and provide credible response \noptions to Russia's escalate to deescalate doctrine. These warheads and missiles are already produced. NNSA did \nan impressive job in FY19 with little to no additional cost or impact on other programs. Prohibiting the deployment of \nthe W76-2 wastes millions of dollars that the NNSA and DOD have already spent working to produce these \nweapons. \n\nAdditionally, putting a halt to this program incurs several million more dollars' worth of lost costs due to contract \nobligations. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is also directly in support of our NATO partners in Europe, something I \nknow my colleagues on this committee say they are committed to. It is entirely possible that Russia's threat with \ntheir low-yield weapons would be against NATO conventional forces, not against the sovereign United States alone. \nTherefore, it would be inappropriate and destabilizing if we were not to have an appropriate response, because our \nallies would then begin to feel they needed to look elsewhere for assurances. \n\n\n\nSome of our colleagues on this committee have argued that low-yield weapons are destabilizing despite the fact \nthat we have had these weapons in our arsenal since 1945. What's destabilizing is the chairman's remarks on \nMarch 12, 2019. And I quote, \"If the Russians launch a nuclear weapon at us, and we don't have anything but a \nbigger nuclear weapon, well then we launch the bigger nuclear weapon. That's what we do.\" Close quote. That is \nbrazen, it's irresponsible, it's completely inappropriate. \n\nLow-yield nuclear weapons are a crucial part of our deterrent capability. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nPaul Selva, said quote, \"A proportional reaction to an enemy's attack is actually a righteous and reasonable thing to \ndo. If all you have is large-yield weapons and you're trying to answer a low-yield attack, answering that with a \nconventional weapon is likely not going to have a deterrent value.\" \n\nMr. Chairman, my amendment would simply say that we are not going to prohibit the deployment of these weapons \nthat are crucial to our nation's security. I therefore urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment so that we can \ncontinue in a manner in which we provide for the defense of the nation in a bipartisan way as we have for so many \nyears on this committee. And with that, I yield back. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, may I make a parliamentary inquiry? \n\nSMITH: You may. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I--I think it's a badge of honor for all of us that we have an open markup. My inquiry \nis if this debate requires it, have arrangements been made for the committee to move to a classified session in \norder to discuss fully the--this amendment. \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nTHORNBERRY: And that would be upstairs in 2212? \n\nSMITH: That's a good question. \n\nUNKNOWN: Sir, I think until about five or six, we have HBC space reserved and then it would be the (INAUDIBLE) \nbeyond whatever that time is. So, we've got space coverage for the entire night. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Okay. So, we--we have a place to go should it be required. That--that was my question. \n\nSMITH: That's what my lawyers tell me, yes. \n\nTHONRBERRY: Thank you. \n\nSMITH: Just in quick re--response to that. I--I don't think there is anything brazen, irresponsible, or whatever other \nwords we used about advocating for us having a deterrent to nuclear war. What the purpose of my remarks was, we \nneed to make it clear to our adversaries, Russia in particular in this case, that if they use a nuclear weapon, they \nwill pay an enormous price for it. And I can't believe that the Gentlelady is opposed to that--to making it clear to our \nadversaries that if they hit us, we'll hit them back harder. There's nothing wrong with that. That is clear deterrence. \n\nAnd the goal of all of this--and I think we do agree on this--is to stop anybody from even thinking that they can un--\nunder any circumstances launch a nuclear weapon and have it have a good outcome for them. My point on the \ndeterrence is to say that, well, the Russians will launch the low-yield and if we don't have one, they know we won't \ndo anything because we won't want to be disproportional. \n\nMake no mistake about it, low-yield is a bit of a misnomer. It implies sort of--you know--well, it's a low-yield nuke. It's \nstill a nuke with the destructive capacity greater than the nuke that was dropped on Hirosh--Hiroshima. So, if this is \nlaunched, it is going to set off a very destructive war. We want to discourage them from even thinking about \nlaunching it. \n\n\n\nAnd in that regard, I don't think there's any wrong with u--anything wrong with us making it clear to our adversaries \nthat you launch a nuclear weapon, we're going to consider it nuclear war. We--we have all the options on the table. \nNow I will point out that as Mr. Cooper has pointed out, we have other low-yield nuclear weapons. \n\nThere is--you know--a low-yield response is possible. But, I'm sorry, I take the--the somewhat tough stance that we \nshould not tell our adversaries that--you know--we're going to measure how large the nuclear weapon you just \ndropped on us or allies was and make sure that we don't respond in a greater way. I don't think that's an \nappropriate way to do deterrence. \n\nI don't have any problem with us--the nuclear weapons we have being a deterrent to anyone launching a nuclear \nweapon against us. And for--for other reasons, we believe that the low-yield nuclear weapon here, putting it on a \nsubmarine--now again, keep in mind, we're not saying no low-yield nuclear weapons. We're saying putting it on a \nsubmarine is a mistake. And we have had this debate. Mr. Turner, I think, was the one who said we've supported \nthis in a bipartisan way. Many of us have opposed this from the start. This is not a change in position. \n\nYes, there are some Democrats who support it. I'm not one of them. That's why we put it in the mark. Mr. Cooper's \nnot one of them either. So, that's why we're having this debate. We do not think it is the proper approach to start \ntalking about a proportional response, because it plants in peoples' minds the idea that there's somehow an \nacceptable nuclear war. I don't believe that there is. \n\nI think we need to make it clear that under no circumstances we will allow that. And if the Russians think they can \nquote, \"escalate to deescalate\", we need to make it clear every second of every day that they are dead wrong about \nthat. Escalation leads to escalation, so don't even think about doing it. And with that, I yield to Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: I thank the chair for yielding. My colleagues who are not on the subcommittee should know that we \nliterally have hundreds and hundreds of low-yield nuclear weapons. Many hundreds of which are deployed. But it's \nall by the Air Force. If we don't do what's in the mark, this will be the first time in history that our strategic assets--\nour nuclear submarines--have been used for tactical purposes. \n\nIf we stop deployment now, we won't have wasted any money. It's probably a good thing we have the new warhead \ndeveloped and in production. But it hasn't been deployed. The two primary risks you face if you deploy these so-\ncalled low-yield weapons on submarines are one, you fire the weapon, the submarine is exposed. Two, there are a \nlimited number of missile tubes, and to use one of these very precious tubes for a low-yield weapon is something \nwe have never done before in all the decades we've had nuclear weapons. \n\nSo, why risk the most survivable, the most precious leg of our triad with this actually fairly new idea. You know, we \nhave the weapon developed. It's available. But let's not deploy it now. At least not without further thinking on this \nimportant topic. So, it's a very important and fundamental principle in nuclear doctrine that we not to deploy this \nweapon on a strategic asset. \n\nMITCHELL: And would the gentle chairman yield to me for just one second-- \n\nSMITH: I'd be delighted. The--the one thing I--I'd point out is--you know--in our mark here, we fully support the B21. \nWe fully support the Columbia class nuclear weapon. We fully support the LRSO, which there has been some \ncontroversy. We are spending a lot of money on nuclear deterrents in--in this mark. This is the one area where we \ndisagree. Mr. Mitchell. \n\nMITCHELL: Thanks, Mr. Chair. The clock needs to be reset, sir. It's at 4:40. Thank you. Believe it--at--first, let's \ngrant that--and we have the intelligence that low-yield nuclear weapons exist. They exist with our adversaries, and \nthey're in a growing number. So, while we may not wish to consider that there's--it's a tactical weapon, our \nadversaries do. \n\nWhat level of naivete are we going to have to think that, in fact, because we don't think it is or should be used that \nway that our ad--adversaries will not? Deterrence is based on believability. Your opponent has to believe that in fact \nif they deploy a low-yield nuclear weapon, say in Eastern Europe, that we would have--that our nation would have \n\n\n\nthe willingness to take out multiple cities in Russia in response. I'd ask people in this audience, how many people \nbelieve that is the case? \n\nWe delude ourselves with the idea--well, I'm well aware you do, Mr. Chair. And I think you're erroneous. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWe delude ourselves with the idea that we would respond in that manner. I find it ironic, given that when we \ndeployed a sub in response to issues with Iran, there was a great deal of yelling about escalation. But we'll say in \nthe case of a tactical nuclear weapon used by Russia will instantaneously escalate to deescalate. It--it doesn't make \nany sense to me. It's nonsensical. \n\nDeterrence is based on believability and if your--your adversary does not believe you it doesn't matter what you \nthink. And it doesn't matter when the moment of time they use it--and we're at a disadvantage. The irony is we \nwould have less tonnage. Think about that. We would actually be reducing our nuclear tonnage, our nuclear impact, \nif we had to use anything. It would exist to be less of it in the world and somehow, we're opposing that. It's \nastonishing to me. \n\nSo, I support the amendment. I urge people to think about this because this is one of the most important things we \nwill do tonight. Of all the other discussions we will have of how it is we offset a threat--right now it's more Russia, \nbut you don't think that threat is growing with other nations? It absolutely is. \n\nSMITH: Will the gentleman yield for a question? \n\nMITCHELL: I would like to yield to Ms. Cheney and then I'll yield. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry, who did you yield to? \n\nMITCHELL: Ms. Cheney. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Ms. Cheney. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you very much. You know, Mr. Chairman, what matters is not what we think, it's what the \nRussians think. And for us to be in a situation where the suggestion's made that somehow those of us who are \narguing about the importance of low-yield nuclear weapons as part of our deterrence are not arguing in favor of \ndeterrence is just simply wrongheaded. \n\nWhen you--when you look at the approach that the Russians would take in terms of the likelihood that they would \nbe calculating that the use of a low-yield nuclear weapon on a battlefield, for example, in Europe, and they listen to \nthe kinds of comments we've heard in this committee, they will make the calculation--you know--of course not. If \nthey--if it comes down to it the United States is not going to deploy a larger weapon in response to that sort of a \nlow-yield attack. \n\nSo, for us to be in a situation where we're saying the responsible thing, the--the thing that's necessary for our \nnational security is to have deployed a low-yield weapon that in fact they--they do not destabilize. They make a \nstrike by the Russians or by any of our adversaries less likely, not more likely. And the argument that the chairman \nis adopting simply would take us down the path of saying one--one nuclear weapon's enough. One nuclear weapon \ncan destroy the world. And I've heard the chairman say things that approximate that. And the notion is-- \n\nSMITH: --Seriously? \n\nCHENEY: Well, Mr. Chairman-- \n\nSMITH: --(INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nCHENEY: --The notion--it's--it's my time, Mr. Chairman-- \n\n\n\nMITCHELL: --It's my time, actually-- \n\nCHENEY: --It's actually Mr. Mitchell's time but he's yielded to me. But the notion that somehow we are making \nourselves less secure because we want to have available in our arsenal every possible response that is going to be \neffective in the most clearheaded way, in demonstrating both our will and our capability to respond to keep \nourselves safe and to keep our adversaries safe. It's crucial that we do that and--and it's unfortunate that the \nmajority has chosen to zero this out in terms of the submarine-based missiles. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Mitchell. \n\nGAETZ: Yield for a question? \n\nSMITH: You have (INAUDIBLE). \n\nGAETZ: So, if you grant the premise of your statement, Mr. Mitchell, that it's only what the adversary believes, not \nwhat--what we believe, is it your contention then that if the adversary sees a tactical nuclear weapon, a low-yield \nnuclear weapon, by the United States in--in--that's useable, that then will increase the frequency--or, the likelihood \nthat that will be used rather than a strategic weapon that would have a greater yield. \n\nMITCHELL: I think you have allies that have to depend upon you standing up to defend them if they're--if they're--if \na tactical nuclear weapon is used against them. You have to have people that believe that in fact you have the \ncapability to do that and you have the willingness as a nation to do that. We've gone this long without a full-scale \nnuclear weapon because our adversaries have believed--war--because our adversaries have believed that they \ndon't want to have that trade-off. This is a different level trade-off-- \n\nSMITH: Gentleman's time has-- \n\nMITCHELL: --And we have to have our adversaries believe-- \n\nSMITH: --The gentleman's time has expired-- \n\nMITCHELL: --That we will not do that. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: This argument is missing the point of the amendment and the point of the weapon itself. The \nchairman has very clearly pointed out that a low-yield is really a very, very large explosion. Extraordinarily \ndevastating. And we have a lot of no--low-yield weapons deployed in Europe today. Been there for decades. \n\nSo, with regard to tit for tat on a low-yield very, very large explosion, we're perfectly capable of doing that. This \nargument--really, an amendment and the mark itself deals with the way in which that weapon would be deployed. \nNot that it doesn't exist; it does exist. The--as the Chairman, Mr. Cooper, said a moment ago, it's been built. At least \nif--at least one, perhaps more have been built. \n\nThe question is how is it going to be used and deployed? That's the point of this mark, and that is the point of this--it \nshould be the point of this debate. And that is, are we going to for the very first time take the most valuable of the \nstrategic deterrent that we have, which is the submarines--and I've heard from Ms. Cheney and Mr.--and--and from \nour colleagues on the other side. It is the deterrent that's important. And certainly, the Chairman has pointed that \nout. \n\nThe deterrent is ultimately the strategic value of the submarines, which would lose that value by deploying a low-\nyield weapon on a ballistic missile; one of the valuable tubes that Mr. Cooper pointed out. Furthermore, when that \nmissile is launched, that submarine's location is known. Can it scoot away fast enough? Well, consider the range of \nthe missile. And the likelihood that an adversary is not so far away. Which is probably going to be the case. The \nstrategic deterrent is gone. \n\n\n\nThe chairman could not be more correct. Nor, Ms. Cheney, could you be more correct. This country has been and \nis today willing to use a nuclear weapon as a counterattack. Therefore, a deterrent. Nobody's backing away from \nthat. Nobody. Now, the notion of a tactical nuclear war has got to be beyond the imagination, and it should be. Not--\nexcuse me, absolutely incorrect Garamendi. \n\nA tactical nuclear war should be clearly in our imagination. We should clearly understand exactly what it is. It is a \nnuclear war. Small-yield, low-yield makes no difference. If it is a tit for tat nuclear war it is a god-awful situation. We \nshould never go there. And for planning to go there with a--a strategy of escalate to deescalate--which apparently \nRussia has, and by the way the United States had for more than 30 years in Europe--is--you know--like, the end of \nthis thing. \n\nSo, what we're talking about here is how will this weapon be deployed. And to use it on a submarine, which is the \npoint--which is the language in the mark--we think is inappropriate. With that I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--for the--for the freshman, the people who have been on this committee for \nthe first time, I want to take you back to a couple places. \n\nFirst off, let's begin by saying this is not going to become law. Let me take you to the place of an understanding of \nwhat we do in this committee and what we do on the House floor has to go over to the Senate. And you need 60 \nvotes, and this is not going to become law. Let me take you there. You know that. \n\nThe second place I want to take you is to the place where you were standing before a community forum and only \nyou were standing there in your very first time as a candidate, and you had to answer questions to your constituents \nas to what you believed. And at that time, if someone had stood up and said, \"I--do you believe in the unilateral \ndisarmament of the United States?\" You'd have said no. You'd say, \"I believe that we should do treaties. I'm all for \nnuclear reduction of weapons but they should be by treaty.\" If we have something, we should bargain it away, we \nshouldn't give it away. \n\nNow, the third place I want to take you is--is the--when you were standing there in that community forum and people \nwere asking you what you believed, if they asked you--if they told you, \"There's a nuclear weapon that I particularly \ndon't like, and I'd like for you to eliminate it. I'll give you a list of some of the things that you'd believe you want, \nwhich is why Mac Thornberry, our ranking member, asked about classified. You'd say, \"Well, before I place myself \nin the position of commander, I would want to know what is Russia doing in its current exercises with low-yield \nnuclear weapons, and how are they deploying them?\" That's noble. It's classified; you should get that briefing \nbefore you make this decision. \n\nThe second is, what are Russia's weapons? What really do they have? The third--and, by the way, this is a red \nherring you're hearing over here about we have low-yield nuclear weapons, we don't need this low-yield nuclear \nweapon. Because Mr. Garamendi, Mr. Cooper, and even our chairman can't tell you what the true answer is of, \n\"Well, how long does it take before those other weapons are deployed?\" \n\nNow, on non-classified basis we can say, well it's not immediate. It's not the same. It's the reason why I offered the \nprevious amendment that said let them certify that there is no other additional option. We'd have to go classified for \nyou to know--and you'd be shocked how long it takes. Now, why is that relevant? Back to the things that you would \nrequire that you know as that person sitting in the community forum when you were running for office. \n\nThe BBC just recently did a--a program on World War III. And you know how they started it? They started it with \nRussia nuking one of our aircraft carriers with a low-yield nuclear weapon. All right? Now let's think how long is it \ngoing to take the United States to respond to a low-yield nuclear weapon to one of our aircraft carriers in a \nproportionate response if you vote to ban this weapon. How long? And if there's a nuclear exchange, we don't have \nto worry about the issue of, like, we're going to reveal where one of our subs are. \n\n\n\nThere's all kind of bad things, as Mr. Garamendi said, already happening. Another thing that you'd want to know \nthat's classified is--is what--what do we do--what are we planning? What are the commanders--what does the \nSecretary of Defense believe that we would do with this low-yield nuke that we don't do with everything else. You \nshould know that. In a classified session, you should demand that you know, well, what would we do with this? If I'm \ngoing to ban this as an option, shouldn't I know what that option was going to be? Because this is our families, this \nis our country. \n\nThis is, like, the very basis of us having an adversary who's attacking us. You'd want to know about Zapad; you'd \nwant to know what Russia just did in their nuclear weapons exercises. You'd say, \"I want to know on a classified \nbasis.\" Now, you'd also want to know that this--this discussion that they keep saying over tactical and strategic, \nwhat does that mean? \n\nWell--you know--for this type of weapon it's actually a little unclear. Because tactical and strategic can mean small \nnukes or big nukes. It can mean long distance nukes or short nukes. Typically, when we think of tactical, we mean \nboth small and short. These are not small and short, they're the same distance as the ones that are in this--this \nsubmarine. We've just made them small. \n\nSo, if--and again, in a classified setting we'd actually ask somebody, well what would happen if they nuked our--our \naircraft carrier? Do we take out Moscow? Or do we take out a group of their battleships with a low-yield nuke? And--\nand then, is that where we stop and hope because they're escalate to deescalate, which is their nuclear policy--I \nbelieve that all of you should have a classified briefing of what is Russia's nuclear policy. Because we actually know \nand for--our intelligence community knows what they would do, what they intend to do. It's knowable. You should \nknow that. \n\nWhen you stood there in that community forum and you answered those questions saying that you would exercise \nyour vote as an independent person, you would say, \"I need to know all those things.\" Now I would just ask that we \nshould study this. We should look at this. You should demand all those answers. But you should not vote to \nunilaterally ban a nuclear weapon of which you know nothing about, nothing how we'll use it, nothing how it protects \nus or defends us. And we should support Ms. Cheney's amendment because this actually goes to a significant \namount of body of strategic thinking from--from all of the Department of Defense that we need to support. I yield \nback. \n\nSMITH: The Gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Courtney. \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I--I think it's important to remember, again, we are not talking about \nbanning these weapons. We're--what we're talking about is banning the deployment of these weapons on \nsubmarines. Okay. \n\nThe first patrol of our sea-based nuclear triad started in 1959. The 41 for Freedom--which was the first class of \nSSBNs--again were launched from my district in Groton, Connecticut. And for 70 years they have been the big \ninsurance policy for this country, which basically says, \"If anyone is stupid enough to fire a nuclear weapon at our \ncountry in any way, shape, or form, we have a second strike capability that you don't know where it is.\" \n\nI mean, that's--that's really what Admiral Rickover, when he--again, was a genius--and sort of figured out that we \ncould--we could create a nuclear deterrent on a platform that, again, the enemy could not detect. And for 70 years \nwe have had strategic high-yield missiles on those boats so that the message was crystal clear. There--there was \nno ambiguity about what those subs were capable of doing. And frankly, their batting average has been pretty good. \n\nThe 41 for Freedom class was replaced by the Ohio class. And again, we have had strong bipartisan support to \nrecapitalize that program with the Columbia class--class of nuclear submarines. Which, again, is in our budget and \nwhich we are funding and, again, bipartisan. Mr. Wittman and I have been working on this for 10 years in a robust \nway to make sure that that essential platform, which carries about 70 percent of our nuclear warheads, is still going \nto continue the great work that they've been doing year in and year out for--for our country. \n\n\n\nIf we start mixing and matching the--the missiles that those boats carry, the other piece of--you know--this question \nabout well, we have to think about what the Russians are thinking--the--the question is is that, if you've got a boat \nwith some low-yield and some high-yield, and--and that missile gets fired, how does the--how does the enemy \ndiscriminate in terms of what's coming at them? \n\nI mean, the fact of the matter is is the notion that you can control a nuclear war by--by--you know--being able to--\nyou know--regulate or moderate the--the--the yield of--of the weapon that you're firing--when things are happening \nin--in--in an instant, really defies logic. And that is why--you know--George Shultz--you know--many experienced \nfolks who served during the Cold War really feel that--have--have articulated the--the point of view that this low-yield \ninitiative on submarines--not across the board, but on submarines--is folly. \n\nAnd I would just--you know--add another point. Which is that--you know--we're starting to get into a situation where \nanti-submarine warfare is getting more and more sophisticated. The ability of our enemies to--to find subs is still far \nfrom perfect. I mean, the--it's--they are still the most effective stealth that are out there right now. But it's getting \nbetter. \n\nAnd the fact of the matter is, James Schlesinger, who served under two Republican presidents, Nixon and Ford, in \nthe middle of the Cold War said it best when he just said that, \"When you--as soon as you fire you expose the \nboat.\" And so, the whole value of that strategic deterrent, the second-strike capability that has warned off our \nenemies for 70 years is gone. One--once you fire that. And if it's a low-yield missile, I mean--what--what's--how \ndoes that make sense, in terms of the decision that's being made? \n\nAgain--so, for 70 years we've had that policy. Last year we had the nuclear posture review that came out from the \nadministration that, again--this is a big change that they're proposing about putting low-yields on submarines. And \nwe really had zero debate last year. I mean, there was a--a brief flurry that took place. \n\nAnd what this mark does this year is it says, \"You know what, we're--we're not going to rush into this. We're not \ngoing to put these missiles on these subs. We're not going to change 70 years of strategic policy for this country \nwithout thinking this through in terms of how--how much safer does it make us, and really, what does that do in \nterms of possibly degrading the value of our sea-based leg of the triad? \n\nAgain, I support the mark and I respectfully--you know--and I realize, Ms. Cheney, she's a serious member and has \nput a lot of thought into this. But frankly, deploying those missiles is--is, in my opinion, going to reduce the value of \nthe sea-based leg of the triad and in fact lower the threshold for a nuclear exchange happening in the future. Which \nwe--which, again, we all, I think, are in agreement we want to avoid. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Dr. Desjarlais. \n\nDESJARLAIS: Thank you, Chairman. And--you know--thanks to all the members who've spoken up on this. I think \nit's a very, very important issue to debate. And I think that both sides have brought up great points. \n\nI've heard the Chairman mention twice that the response is simple. If a low-yield nuclear weapon is used against us \nor allies, we simply hit them with a large-yield weapon. And I don't think it is that simple. Because we don't know \nwhat we don't know. We don't know what Russia thinks. \n\nI've heard two members say that--that there really is no such thing as a low-yield, that these are the size of the \nbombs dropped on Hiroshoma--Hiroshima or Nagasaki, which were 15 to 20 kiloton. In fact, weapons can be made \nmuch smaller than that. So, let's just assume for a minute that the Russians do try out their theory to escalate to \ndeescalate, and they carry out a strike somewhere maybe any--Eastern Europe, Western Europe, or maybe in \nSyria. And it kills 4,000 people, because we really don't know what the damage would be. \n\nSo, if you're the person sitting in the White House and you have to make that decision to launch a large-yield \nnuclear weapon that's going to kill four million or more, what's the next step going to be? I mean, what choice does \nRussia have? You're probably going to escalate the crisis. \n\n\n\nNow, on the other hand, if you had to decide that there was a--a small scale nuclear attack--and there can be a \nsmall nuclear attack depending on where it is and how it happens and--and the Russians know that you will \nrespond in kind, then that possibly could deescalate. We don't know the whole escalate to deescalate. We're not in \ntheir minds. We don't know what they're thinking. \n\nBut we have to be prepared for what they might think. And I think that the--Ms. Cheney's amendment is correct and-\n-and should be supported because we have to prepare for the unknown. We know how we think, but we don't know \nhow they think. \n\nAnd I don't think that it would be as easy of a decision as the chairman indicates to launch a large-scale retaliation \nagainst something that--you know--that would potentially end the world as we know it. So, I think that we need to \nkeep on the path. We need to deter with our own low-yield system. And respectfully, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Just to be clear, I in no way think any of this is an easy decision. Did not say that, do not \nbelieve that at all. Anybody on this side want to debate? \n\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. \n\nSMITH: Ms. Davis. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know we all have great respect for Secr--former Secretary of Defense James \nMattis and--and you're all aware. I mean, I think what he--I don't think, as he said and I quote, \"I don't think there's \nany such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any nuclear weapon used at any time is a strategic game-changer.\" \nAnd if we can ask the question--if you can ask the question and not get a good answer for yourself, what happens \nnext? What is the result of that? \n\nThen--you know--I think we have to re--have a different frame of mind as we look at these questions. There's just \nno question that--you know--you--I--I would call it a baby nuclear weapon. Is that what we're thinking about when \nwe think about limited nuclear war? And that somehow that's not going to have the--a response? That wouldn't be \nso damaging whether it's in our country or in a country of our allies? \n\nSo, I--I don't know why we're--we're pushing so hard to think that we're ready to make the decision about this. I \nthink that the language that's being suggested here signals that we--you know--we've--we've got a plan for this and \nthey ought to have one too. They ought to have one that's harder than ours. And we know--we know we already \nhave--you know--weapons that--that are so lethal that there's everything in the world that can be achieved from that \nthat is horrible to our--to our world. \n\nSo, why is it that we're so anxious, we're so excited to be able to--to have a--deploy these missile warheads on \nsubmarines that we know are devastating? It's--I'm--I'm concerned that that's the--you know--we're not able to \nanswer that question. And I don't think anybody can at this point. If you've got a bet--if you've got a good answer \nfor that, then I think you need to share with us what you think that will be. What happens next? \n\nThat's an important--that's an important question that any commander ever has to answer. We have--we have \ncertainly many, many low-yield nuclear weapons. And we are--have been modernizing them at great expense. If the \npresident ever needed to use what is considered a low-yield nuclear weapon, he has those options. He has them \ntoday. And presidents before him have had them. \n\nInstead, we want to sort of escalate this discussion to a point that I think brings us to a far worse place than we are \nin today. So, I-- \n\nCOOPER: --Would the gentlelady yield? \n\nDAVIS: I yield. \n\nCOOPER: I appreciate the gentlelady's contribution to the debate. I think one aspect of the debate that has not \nbeen covered yet is that America's conventional capability, not nuclear, is by far the best in the world. \n\n\n\nSo, often we don't even have to consider nuclear weapons because we can have the same destructive force \nwithout using them. And that really is due to the precision weaponry that we have and other technical advantages. \nSo, it's really not a fair question to say nuclear-nuclear. We can respond in almost unlimited dimensions with non-\nnuclear weapons. In fact, that's probably one of the spurs that encourages poorer nations. Since our conventional \ncapability is so exquisite and so expensive to develop, they almost feel forced to develop nuclear weapons just so \nthey have some way of responding. \n\nSo, that's an aspect of our firepower that hasn't been acknowledged so far in the debate and I think we should \nacknowledge that, because that is one of the many ways in which our Pentagon excels, really to the superior \nadvantage of our country in a far greater capacity than any other nation on Earth. I thank the Gentlelady for yielding. \n\nDAVIS: I thank the Gentle--I thank the Gentleman for adding to that and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Gallagher. \n\nGALLAGHER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think though, that the line of argument advanced by Ms. Davis would \nnegate the line of argument advanced by Mr. Courtney. In other words, if there is no meaningful distinction between \ntactical or low-yield nukes and strategic, larger nuclear weapons, then we shouldn't have the concerns about mixing \nand matching them on subs. But my primary arguments in favor of Cheney's amendment are not along those lines. \n\nI just would say first, in response to the argument that we don't need to expand potential options for low-yield use \nbecause we have larger nukes, I would say that doesn't work. Because--and this really gets to the problem of \nstrategic deterrence, and it's why there was such an important shift in the national defense strategy. Ultimately, that \nputs the onus of escalation on us, right? \n\nIn order for this to work, we have to believe--our adversaries have to believe credibly that we are willing to escalate \nto nuclear Armageddon. We certainly have the capability to do so, but whether this president or a future president \nwould be willing to do so, that is an open question. Luckily, few--only one president has been forced to confront that \nvery momentous decision. \n\nSo, the whole point is to give presidents options below that in order to deescalate, and to put the onus of escalation \non to our adversaries. In other words, if you're bringing a flamethrower to a knife fight, you have to be willing to \nemploy the flamethrower. And this gets to the second point, which is this shift contained within the national defense \nstrategy from deterrence by punishment, particular an overwhelming reliance on strategic deterrence by \npunishment, to deterrence by denial. \n\nFielding the capabilities that will allow us to deny our adversaries their preferred military strategy in near real-time or \nat least degrade them. And by opposing Cheney's amendment, you are in essence opposing the most \nconsequential shift contained within the national defense strategy. And I would say in response to Mr. Cooper's \nargument, this idea that the conventional balance of power is in our favor; that may be true at the present moment, \nbut that balance of power has been trending in the wrong direction for the last two decades. \n\nIf you doubt that, just look at the Chinese response to the Taiwan Strait crisis--Taiwan Straits crisis in 1996 and \neverything they have done to dramatically improve the conventional balance of power ever since. The final thing I'd \nsay is that I actually think Ms. Cheney's advancing what is the bipartisan pos--position. Because the nuclear \nposture review was clear in saying that this was a good move. And they also argued in NPR that quote, \"A low-yield \nSLBM warhead--an SLCM--will not require or rely on host nation support to provide deterrent effect. They will \nprovide additional diversity in platforms, range, and survivability and a valuable hedge against future nuclear \nbreakout scenarios\" unquate--unquote. \n\nThis is important because it gets to some of the arguments Mr. Courtney made about not wanting to put these \nthings on subs. Well, our aircrafts are likely to get smoked if they are on European runways in the unfortunate \nscenario we're considering here. And so, I would also say this is bipartisan because former Obama Secretary of \nDefense Ash Carter has gone on record saying, \"My views are reflected in the latest nuclear posture review.\" \nMeaning that supports Cheney's amendment. \n\n\n\nJim Miller, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy during the Obama Administration argued that Secretary of \nDefense Jim Mattis' 2018 nuclear posture review offers continuity with the past U.S. policy and plans, including \nthose in the 2010 NPR. It deserves broad bipartisan support. It's proposal for a low-yield SLBM weapon, and a new \nnuclear tipped sea-launch cruise missile are sensible responses to changed security conditions, especially Russia \nand North Korea. And so, I would urge my colleagues to support Cheney's amendment, which I believe to be a \nthoroughly bipartisan amendment. And I'm happy to yield the minute I have back to Ms. Cheney if she'd like it. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Gallagher. The majority seems to think that stability is served by limiting \nAmerica's capabilities here. I hear no distinction being made between a nuclear capability in the hands of the \nRussians or our adversaries and one in our own hands. The nuclear posture review, which was completed under \nSecretary Mattis, makes clear that we need this very capability. Assessments of our adversaries' capability shows \nthat the Russians have an active stockpile of up to 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons. \n\nSo, I would urge particularly the freshmen on this committee--I would echo what Mr. Turner said. Before you cast \nthis vote, you better be sure that you are fully briefed and fully aware of all of the classified information that is \navailable about our adversaries' capabilities, about the capability that we need that our military has requested. And I \nhave tremendous respect for my colleague Mrs. Davis, but I'd say asking what the plan is requires a classified \nbriefing. And it is absolutely irresponsible for us in this committee to sit here and say we are going to limit the \nmilitary; we are going to prevent them-- \n\nSMITH: --Gentlelady's time has expired. Gentlelady's time has expired-- \n\nCHENEY: --We're going to prevent them from this capability without seeking that classified information and \nmaterial, because it is there. \n\nSMITH: And, let me just make a point here. We've had classified briefings on this subject matter. And I think to in \nsense imply that we haven't is--is very incorrect. I'm reasonably certain every single member of this committee has \nreceived classified briefings on this subject over the years. You know--a whole lot of hands up here but Mr. \nWittman, you were next on my list. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I--in listening to my colleagues, I agree with several points. First of all is \nthat both a low-yield and high-yield nuclear weapon, both very devastating. Both have their own level of deterrence. \nBallistic missile submarine, extraordinarily effective. \n\nIt is the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad. For our adversaries, that creates a tremendous amount of \nuncertainty. And when you combine that with the uncertainty about whether there is a low-yield or high-yield nuclear \nweapon on board, that uncertainty equals much stronger deterrence. That is communicated in the nuclear posture \nreview. It's to say let's put more uncertainty in the minds of our adversaries, and when we do there's an even \nhigher level of deterrence. Especially as our adversaries are building broader and more in-depth capabilities. \n\nWhether it's conventional or nuclear, how do we make sure that we have the calculus in our favor? We make sure \nthat we have more options there that create more uncertainty on their part where they will say, \"You know what, we \nbetter not do this because we're not quite sure if one of these low-yield nuclear weapons is going to be on board \none of their ballistic missile submarines. Which, by the way, we have a very hard time identifying where they are.\" \nVersus putting it on other platforms where they know exactly where it is. \n\nThose are elements of what this nation has to do in the modern era of great power competition. It is critical for us to \ndo this. Taking options off the table weaken us. Taking options off the table do not create the full scope of \ndeterrence that we need to keep our adversaries not only at bay, but make sure that their decision making is always \nin the realm of saying no, we are not going to do that because we know what the result will be from the United \nStates. Or, we think we'll know. Or, we are too uncertain to take the chance. That's truly what this is all about. \nThat's what the debate ought to be. And I hope that my colleagues on the other side see it for that. \n\nI want to make sure that we provide every opportunity for our leaders in the Pentagon--for our combatant \ncommanders to say, \"You know what, we've created just enough uncertainty out there with our adversaries to \n\n\n\nwhere we have now prevented a war.\" Strength through deterrence, uncertainty creates the deterrence, that's what \nthis is all about. Ms. Cheney's amendment allows us to do that. And it is critical for our nation to have this happen. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Scott. \n\nSCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I won't take the full five minutes. But I would just point out that Ms. Cheney's \namendment does not deploy the weapons. Ms. Cheney's amendment does not deploy the weapons. And I'd love \nnothing other than to be sitting there passing legislation taking the options away from the Russian and Iranian and \nother countries' military leaders. But if there's one thing I've figured out in my time in Washington, I trust our military \nleaders to make these types of decisions more than I trust Congress to. \n\nI would just point out to my colleagues and friends the Cheney amendment does not deploy the weapon. But \nwithout the Cheney amendment, we are taking options away from the United States military leaders. And I just--I--I \ndon't understand why we would want to take the options away from our military leaders. \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman-- \n\nSCOTT: --I yield the remainder of my time. \n\nSMITH: Could we get an idea from leg counsel whether the gentleman's interpretation of the amendment is \ncorrect? It's not my understanding. I always look very awkward here, but yeah. I don't know if this is a parliamentary \nthing or more just a matter of debate. But did--what exactly does the amend--the amendment do? \n\nSCOTT: The amendment strikes the prohibition on availability of funds for deployment. But it's availability of funds, \nnot mandating that funds be spent or deployed-- \n\nSMITH: --Okay. That--that's understood. All right. Mr. Banks. \n\nUNKNOWN: He left the room. Mr. Waltz. \n\nSMITH: No, I'm sorry. Mr. Banks is not here. Mr. Waltz. And I--I will say--good debate. We're getting to the point \nwhere we--we need to wrap it up. So, if we could move--move through it, that would be great. \n\nWALTZ: Quickly, Mr. Chairman, then. I think it is--and again, I would encourage everyone to receive--I--I'm not sure \nthat everyone has received the classified brief and briefings on Russian nuclear posture and intentions for use. \n\nBut it is completely plausible, and I would daresay likely, that the Russians could use low-yield nuclear weapons--\nwhether it's a foreign city, Western Europe, carrier strike group--with the assumption that the United States would \nnot launch a high-yield nuclear weapon in response. I think that is a likely assumption that the president of the \nUnited States, from either party, would not launch that escalation in response to losing a carrier strike group. \n\nThat's what the Russians believe. That's what they are banking on. That's what makes us less safe. And we need \nto have this capability. And then, secondly, the low-yield nukes that we do have are not nearly as easily deployable \nand survivable as those coming from a ballistic missile submarine. So, I--I would just encourage everyone to take \nthose two pieces into account. I yield my time-- \n\nCOOPER: --Would the gentleman yield? \n\nWALTZ: --Ms. Cheney, I think you're fine. And I'm done. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry. Can someone claim some time over here? Mr. Cooper wants time. Mr. Langevin. \n\nLANGEVIN: I am happy to yield my time to Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: First, let me say I value the gentleman's service, and I was particularly impressed with your jump \nrecently on the--celebrating D-Day. I hope your parachute wasn't as old as your uniform. \n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWALTZ: It opened. \n\nCOOPER: Remember, in the event--in the awful event of a Russian attack, we have hundreds and hundreds of low-\nyield weapons. In fact, with greater flexibility, greater accuracy, pretty much greater everything. So, the only \nquestion is whether a token amount on a new platform--a strategic platform--makes sense, including for the sailors \non the boat as well as for the security of our country. So, that's really the question, is where do you put them on a \nboat? \n\nSMITH: Mr. Keller. \n\nKELLER: Just very briefly, we're not just talking about one potential adversary though. We're talking about all \ncurrent potential adversaries and future potential adversaries. So, whether we're talking about--we're not just talking \nabout Russia. We're talking about Russia, China, any country that now has nuclear weapons or the ability, including \nsome groups that aren't countries. \n\nSo, our response has to be tailored to each and every one of those. And with that, I yield the balance of my time to \nMr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Thank you. You know--this--this is really not fair to our new members. It's not fair because every person \nwho's not a new member has voted to do this. Every person on this committee who is not a new member voted for \nthese weapons to be configured and deployed. So, this is only the new members that are being put in this position \nof having to vote for the very first time on a nuclear weapons issue where no one likes nuclear weapons, and \neverybody wants nuclear weapons to--to--to not exist. I'd love that world too. But they're being done so without the \nproper information. \n\nI'm certain when you had that community meeting, you never said, \"I'm going to vote how Mr. Cooper tells me when \nhe tells me that--that the other weapons that we have that are low-yield are better.\" Well, they're the same as \neverything we have on our subs. They're the same. Same as everything we have on our subs. \n\nSo, I guess everything in our subs, whether big or small, it--it's--is bad. It--it is not--is not--is not of high quality. But it \nis. But--but the question is--and I'm going to tell you this, because Mr. Garamendi is a very, very good friend of \nmine. And Mr. Garamendi and I had the presentation on the classified briefing of what it would take, how long it \nwould take for those low-yield nuclear weapons to be deployed. And I was shocked. And I can tell you Mr. \nGaramendi was pissed. \n\nAnd I could tell you--what--what do you think it would take to shock me? An hour? A week? Weeks? How long do \nyou think it would take me to shock me? I can't tell you, because we're not in classified session. But this is why it's \nnot fair. The chairman said that we've had classified briefings. Not one of you have--because this committee--well, \nnot--this committee has not had briefings in the committee on the Russian Zapad exercises and their nuclear \nweapons component. \n\nThis committee has not had--no, I don't mean not one of you as an individual. I mean not one of you participated in \na committee briefing. Because the committee has done this. Individually, there are a couple of us that have. But \nmost of us have not. A briefing on the deployment of--of Russia's nuclear weapons. \n\nDo--have you--have we had a committee briefing at what's at Kaliningrad? We didn't. We did not have a comm--a \ncommittee briefing at what--at the missiles that are in Kaliningrad. We did not have a committee briefing as to how \nlong it take--the briefing that Mr. Garamendi and I had, we have not had a committee briefing on how long it takes \nfor the low-yield that everybody who wants to do this tells you are instantly available and are available today. I wrote \nthe words down. It's not true. \n\nNo one has had the classified briefing of what would we do with these. You know, there's a battle plan. There's, like, \na whole thing where people have planned well if this happens, we'll do this; if this happens, we'll do that. That's--we \nshould review all that before we have a debate, before we put ourselves in the commander's position. \n\n\n\nIt is not fair for all of the people who are new to--without these classified briefings that would give them the \nsubstantive information to be able to make this decision--to make a decision contrary to what everybody already on \nthe committee has made in the opposite. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: I am concerned about our ability to fully discuss the issues involved here in an open session. But--\nbut--but I will say this. It seems to me, the essence of the argument, supporting the underlying provision is--since \nwe already have a number of low-yield weapons, what we don't want to have are low-yield weapons on a survivable \nplatform. And--and it kind of goes back to what Mr. Scott said. Why we would want to take away options for \nourselves while adversaries have a full range of options does not make sense to me. \n\nNumber of references have been made about the Russians. So--so, I think we can say in open session what we \nhave are low-yield weapons on air platforms. Well, we--again, can't get into detail. But Russian air defense system \nare pretty formidable. And--and--and so, I think the idea behind the nuclear posture review was have a full range of \nweapons on the delivery syst--on a full-range of delivery systems, or at least a fuller range of delivery systems. And \nthat increases the credibility of our deterrence. \n\nAgain, why would we not want to have a weapon on a survivable platform? I--you know--I've--that's--that's hard to \nunderstand. Two other points that I don't think really have been talked about. Number one, our allies support this \ndeployment. Now, y'all think about the storm and drum we have had about trying to get our allies to do more, about \ntrying to keep NATO together, our alliances in the Pacific, et cetera. \n\nOur allies support the deployment of this, and so we're going to sit here and say y'all may have stick--stuck your \nneck out, but we're going to backtrack on it? That has ramifications. Thir--lastly, the other thing that has \nramifications--and this is what I am particularly concerned about is we can't talk in here about the status of this \nprogram. \n\nI--somebody said we didn't really have a debate about this last year. No, we did. And a decision was made, and this \nprogram has gone forward. And it would be one thing--I think a mistake--to say we're not going to begin this \nprogram. It is a completely different and more serious thing to say we have begun this program and now we're \ngoing to backtrack. \n\nNow--now remember, our nuclear deterrent's not just about us. There are lots of countries all over the world that \ndepend on the credibility of our nuclear deterrent. And once we make a decision and move forward with that \ndecision to backtrack on that has severe implications. \n\nSo, I think that the gentlelady's amendment is exactly right. We need the full range of options. We need the \nconfidence of our allies. We need to be able to take a decision and move forward with it. This--the underlying \nprovision would undercut all of those things and I think be a significant step in the wrong direction. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Carbajal. \n\nCARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, you don't need a classified briefing to understand that Russia and the \nUnited States have thousands of different types of nuclear weapons that could destroy this world over a thousand \ntimes. What we're doing here is discussing yet another--another grade or category of conventional nuclear \nweapons. For me, it's so simple. But maybe it's so complex I'm missing it. I--it--for me it just boggles my mind. I \nthink that the deterrents are already there. The fact that we have all these weapons that already exist and we're \nfighting over yet another category of nuclear weapons. I just don't understand it. Mr. Chair, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. To--to close--close the debate, I think this has been--you know--with one exception, a very \ngood, robust, and--and fair debate of a difference on policy. I--I do take issue with the notion that somehow, we're--\nwe're too ignorant to make this decision. Well we weren't too ignorant to make this decision when this committee \napproved building the weapon. So, basically, because we don't know enough, we just have to stand back and let \nthe Pentagon do--do what it wants. That is not the way I interpret our job. Our job--if that was the point, we should \n\n\n\nall go home. What the hell are we doing here? Pentagon knows better than us. You know, why do you guys have all \nyour amendments, all things--but why are we even talking about it? Now, I will completely grant that there's \nsometimes you can agree with them. But the idea that you can't possibly support going against a low-yield nuke--\nnuclear weapon, because basically you're too stupid to make the decision is something that I--I very strongly reject-\n- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Mr. Chairman, would the Chairman yield-- \n\nSMITH: --Whether you're a new member or an old member-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Because no one said that-- \n\nSMITH: --I'm sorry, I gave you a lot-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Right, that's fine. But no one said that-- \n\nSMITH: --Of time-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Let's be clear. No one said that-- \n\nSMITH: --Well, indeed, yes. But it was heavily implied. And I'm sorry I used stronger language there because I was \na bit frustrated by--by the way that was presented. It was said that basically you don't know what you're doing. You \ndon't have sufficient information to make this decision. Which is--you know--I-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --It comes that way-- \n\nSMITH: --Dramatize it a little bit by saying the too stupid thing. But it kind of gets to the same point. I 100 percent \nreject that. We have had classified briefings. I think the freshman members are very knowledgeable in a hell of a lot \nof ways. They know more than some of us who have been on this committee for a long time. We are perfectly \ninformed to make this decision. \n\nNow, those are good arguments on both sides. But for heaven's sakes, don't--don't not--don't base your vote on the \nfact that you're too ignorant to do it or if you do, you should probably give up your job. So, I believe we have been \ninformed. We know what we're doing. And we're not going to simply yield to the Pentagon because they know more \nthan we do. That's the purpose of civilian oversight of the military. \n\nThere have been a lot of arguments made here, but I think as you hear this debate go back and forth, the most \ntroubling aspect of the low-yield nuclear weapon is it makes people seriously contemplate an acceptable nuclear \nwar. And that's what a lot of this debate was about. Okay? \n\nWe're going to make a calculated decision, they launch a low-yield nuke, we'll launch a low-yield nuke, we'll be able \nto contain it. And if the whole point of our nuclear arsenal is to deter a nuclear war from ever happening, when you \nstart walking down--my opinion is that this debate essentially makes our point. And having put this in--in our mark to \nnot deploy this weapon. \n\nOnce you start walking down the road of talking about it, our adversaries are going to listen to that conversation. \nAnd they're going to say, \"Okay, if we launch a nuke there's--it's possible we could manage it. We--we could have \nan acceptable nuclear war.\" And at the end of the day, our support for the underlying provision in opposition to Ms. \nCheney's mark is because that is exactly what we are afraid of. Is to make it clear that there is not an acceptable \nnuclear war. \n\nAnd for the life of me, I can't really understand why it is that we--apparently in a classified brief we can be told \nexactly what the Russians are thinking. And we'll know exactly what they're going to do. We're going to have perfect \ninformation on that. As you can tell from my tone of voice, I don't believe that. We're not going to know for sure what \nthe Russians think. They're going to lie to us a lot. And we've got to sort of pull--pull it apart. \n\n\n\nBut, on the other hand, we don't think we can convince them that it is our position--our deterrent position--that if you \nlaunch a nuclear war, you better not count on a proportional response. You better understand that if you do that it \nwill lead to severe consequences for you. Why would we tell them, okay if you do that we'll--we're going to try \nmanage our response so it's at an acceptable level for you. And there's people in this committee room who have \nfought in wars. I haven't. But I don't think when you're going up against your adversary, as the bullets are flying, \nyou're going, \"Gosh, I want to make sure that my response is proportional.\" No. You want to win by overwhelming \nforce. \n\nAs we always say on this committee, United States military, we don't want a fair fight. We want our adversary to be \nclear on the point that we're going to kick their ass if they take us on. So, why we're obsessing about a proportional \nresponse I don't know. And the concerning part of it is, again, it begins the discussion down the road that there is an \nacceptable nuclear war. There's not. \n\nAnd at this point in most audiences, I reference the 1982 movie War Games, where the computer simulated and \nfound out, \"Yeah, no matter how you start this it ends with complete obliteration.\" That's what we're trying to avoid. \nWith that, although we--sorry. I shouldn't turn off my mic right when I'm going to do that. The question occurs on the \namendment by Ms. Cheney. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: And that we will have a recorded vote. A recorded vote is ordered. We will suspend it to the end. Next up is \nMs. Cheney again. And I'm pretty sure this is an important piece that you--I'm pretty sure it's the same debate we \njust had. So, if we can move through it more quickly. But we're going to consider Log 397R1 by Ms. Cheney. For \nwhat purpose does she seek recognition? \n\nCHENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will please distribute the amendment without objection. We'll dispense with the reading and the \nGentlelady is recognized for her amendment. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this amendment restores the funding necessary for the SLBM \ndeployment--the W76-2s. You know, we heard a lot in the last debate about nuclear obliteration and about the \ninstability in the world in which we live. And--you know--what I fail to be able to understand and find extremely \ntroubling is that the majority's response to the growing instability and threat complexity we face around the globe is \nto disarm America. \n\nYou know, my colleagues on this committee say they're not for unilateral disarmament. But as I pointed out before, \nwe--we live in a world where the Russians in fact have 2,000 of these non-strategic nuclear weapons. And so, the \nidea that somehow the way to avoid miscalculation or to avoid instability is to make sure that America cannot \ndeploy this low-yield nuclear weapon is simply a blaming American first irresponsible approach to this. \n\nWe live in a world where the Cold War concepts of deterrence are outmoded. A world in which those concepts are \ninsufficient to provide for our security. And yes, it is simple, and it is easy to say, \"Oh my gosh, nuclear weapons are \nhorrific. We all agree they're horrific. We've all got plenty of nuclear weapons.\" That is absolutely unsustainable \nindefensible and irresponsible. I agree with the Chairman that this committee has crucial oversight obligations and \nresponsibilities. \n\nWe are not carrying those obligations out if we simply say, \"Nuclear weapons are bad, therefore we must make \nsure the United States does not have access to the full range of capabilities we know our adversaries have.\" We \nknow that Russian nuclear strategy is escalate to deescalate. We know that the Russians hope that a limited \nnuclear excla--escalation will give them an advantage. We must guard against that. The point of making sure that \n\n\n\nwe have funding for and the authority to deploy these weapons on submarines is to raise, not lower, the nuclear \nthreshold. \n\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I take issue with the idea that anybody on this side of the aisle called anybody on this committee \nignorant. Nobody said that. What we did say was, members of this committee who are not on the Strategic Force \nCommittee, members of this committee who have not voted on this issue before, members of this committee who \nhave not taken part in all of the briefings that Mr. Turner mentioned need to be aware that they are being held \naccountable. \n\nSimply cannot effectively and responsibly conduct the oversight that's necessary here, have to go home and \nexplain to your constituents why you cast a vote to disarm the United States, to disarm the United States unilaterally \nin a circumstance in which our adversaries have these weapons without the full access to information that is \navailable in those briefings. I think that that is the epitome of failing to live up to our obligation of effective and \nresponsible oversight on this most important set of issues probably that any committee in this Congress deals with \nand addresses. \n\nSo, my amendment that we're discussing now, Mr. Chairman, would restore the funding for these crucially \nimportant weapons along with the authority that we need to restore from my previous amendment. And with that, I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment and I yield back. \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. If I may. I will quickly note, first of all, the idea that deciding not to deploy a low-yield nuke \namounts to unilateral disarmament I think is a slight overstatement. Our nuclear arsenal is still going to be really \nrather robust, whether we deploy this or not. It is true, we're taking this one option off the table. But, talk about \nunilateral disarmament's a little bit over the top. \n\nAnd again, I--I will say, I think the members are fairly well informed. But also, it's a curious argument to basically \nsay, \"You know, since you're not well informed you have to agree with me.\" Th--this issue's tough, I'll grant you. \nThere's a lot of information here. \n\nBut no matter how much information you have, you have to make a decision one way or the other on what is a fairly \ncritical--and I will agree on this, this is an important decision in terms of where the United States is. I am confident, \nagain, that this committee is smart enough, intelligent enough to make that decision. Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to speak in opposition to the amendment. \n\nSMITH: Go ahead. \n\nCOOPER: As the chairman has ably said, the loose talk here in this committee about unilateral disarmament, or \ndisarming America is completely wrong. And worse, it's irresponsible. And I know some people on this committee \nare running for higher office, but I think people on the subcommittee will recall that I tried my best last week to have \na debate on these issues at the subcommittee level where more people were able to go to the briefings than at the \nfull committee level. Because many people are not even on the Strategic Forces subcommittee. \n\nBut the gentlelady will recall, despite my efforts, there was only one amendment offered. It was your amendment. \nAnd it was a combination of four different amendments. And there was zero debate when we had a wonderful \nopportunity to have a debate on these important issues. I support briefings. I support knowledge. I want full \ncommittee understanding. But loose talk at the full committee level, after many hours of markup, is not the best way \nto achieve a sensible national defense policy. \n\nMany of us from the South think that--you know--being a hawk isn't a bad thing. But don't give hawks a bad name. If \nyou accuse anybody who's in favor of any moderation, including most Republicans and most presidential \nadministrations in recent years--men like George Shultz, for example. And others--James Schlesinger--you go \ndown the list. What the modern Republican party is talking about is a clear departure from 60 to 70 years of sound \nnuclear strategy. So, let's not go overboard here. \n\n\n\nAnd there's been a lot of discussion about our freshman members. We are proud that they're on the committee. I \nthink that I have been to virtually every briefing that the Strategic Forces committee has had for at least the last \nseven years. Every secret briefing. And nobody's trying to pull any wool over anybody's eyes here. I do think if you \nlook at the W76-2 that that is such a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of our overall nuclear forces. It's not even a \nrounding error. \n\nSo, to make this the be all and end all of U.S. nuclear strategy is completely misleading. It might be a nice new \nfeature. And I personally am glad we have developed the warhead and it is in our stockpile, and it is available for \nuse. But let's not endanger the lives of our sailors and our precious nuclear submarines. And let's not disclose to \nour enemies and potential enemies around the world that these rascals have been deployed. We don't have to do \nthat at least at this stage. We are ready. We are prepared. We can do this if we need to. \n\nSo, I'm glad we're prepared. But this extra step the gentlelady is doing with her largely redundant amendment is--is \npretty remarkable. So, I wish the gentlelady success in her future efforts, but-- \n\nCHENEY: --Would the gentleman yield? \n\nCOOPER: --I will not yield to the gentlelady. The gentlelady had the chance last week in subcommittee to help us \nhave an informed debate on these topics-- \n\nCHENEY: --The gentleman is casting aspersions on the substance of my amendment and on my-- \n\nSMITH: --Ma'am. I'm sorry, we--we do have to keep things in order here. That--you--there'll be plenty of people \nwho'll give you time, and you should have time. But it's Mr. Cooper's time. \n\nCOOPER: No one on this side--no one on the committee--no one in Congress that I'm aware of has ever mentioned \nthings like unilateral disarmament, or disarming America. So, those wild accusations are just wrong and as I say, \nirresponsible. We should project an image to the world right now--because our adversaries and potential \nadversaries are watching, and if they see such a loose and uninformed debate, if they see such divisiveness in the \nCongress of the United States, that only gives them hope. \n\nLet's not give them hope. Let's show that we are adults, that we are responsible, that we can measure our \nlanguage and together do the right thing for the country. I see that my time has expired. I thank the Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: What is not wild and irresponsible is the fact that the underlying mark takes away an option. Now, \nit's not total disarmament. But it takes away an option and the--to me, the most concerning underlying theme of this \nwhole debate is that we're the problem. \n\nIn other words, if we restrain ourselves, then the world will be safer. If we take an option away from u--ourselves, \nthen somehow nuclear war is less likely to happen. We're the problem. And I do not believe that's the case. I \nbelieve that we ha--as we develop more options, survivable options, then we increase deterrence and decrease the \nchance that a nuclear weapon will ever be--be used. \n\nBut the--this underlying notion that we've got to tie our own hands, and therefore the world will be safer goes to the \nheart, I think, of what many of us are concerned about with this amendment and with an overall approach to \ndefense. I believe we need to be strong. \n\nI believe we need to have more options, not fewer. And I believe we need to increase the uncertainty of our \nadversaries or potential adversaries, not simplify their calculations. I think in a lot of ways that's the bottom line to \nthis. And I hope that our colleagues will vote to be stronger with more options rather than blame us for the \nproblems. \n\nCROW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know--with all due respect to our colleague from Wyoming, many of us have \ndedicated our lives to the--the--the defense of this country and would never do anything that we thought would \n\n\n\njeopardize that and put our countrymen and women and our count--our country and the world at risk. And certainly, \nmany of us have thought about this issue long and hard. \n\nBut when it comes to matters of existential existence--you know--it falls directly within the purview of this committee \nand Congress. You know, many decades ago our country made a decision to reserve the decision to use these \ntypes of weapons to our elected political leaders. Because we believed that it was important to reserve matters of \nexistential existence and risking this type of war to those who were elected by the people of this country. \n\nSo, there is a history and precedent to reserving matters of these issues to this body. And that's why I think it's f--it's \nimportant that we understand that and that we don't just default to giving options when it comes to matters of these \nweapons to our military leadership. So, I do believe in this instance that the risk of destabilization that these \nweapons cause, the uncertainty that they would cause and the risk of starting another arms race is greatly \nconcerning to me. And I certainly will not be supporting this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. All right. Votes have been called on the floor. I am 100 percent confident that we can complete \nthis debate in time to go over and vote. So, it's been a robust debate. It's been a healthy debate. I'm going to--I'm \njust--I'm trying to encourage us to wrap this up quickly so that we can go vote and be done with this--this debate \nand move on to the next one. Ms. Stefanik. \n\nSTEFANIK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this committee deserves to hear a response from Ms. Cheney, so I \nyield my time to the gentlewoman from Wyoming. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you very much, Ms. Stefanik. You know, I think that this--this--this issue--I--I appreciated very \nmuch Chairman Cooper, the way that he began our convening meeting in the subcommittee on strategic forces \nwhen he talked about this issue as being the single most important issue our strategic forces--that any \nsubcommittee in Congress deals with and addresses. \n\nAnd I think that's the exa--that's the kind of treatment this issue deserves. I think it's completely uncalled for for Mr. \nCooper to suggest that somehow there's loose talk going on or to suggest that there are somehow political \naspirations. Unless Mr. Cooper is announcing here today that he is seeking higher office--which, I would say this is \nan inappropriate place for him to make that announcement--he ought to stay with the facts. \n\nAnd I can only imagine--perhaps he can't argue the facts if he's going to go to personal aspersions and questioning \nthe motives of the people who are having this discussion, and my motives for offering this amendment. With respect \nto unilateral disarmament, it is unilateral disarmament. By definition. This is a capability that our adversaries have. It \nis a capability that--that they have the ability to deploy, that they have deployed. And it is a capability--my \ncolleagues in this committee on the Democratic side of the aisle are suggesting that the global stability and security \nrequires we not let the United States have the funds or the authority to have this capability. \n\nSo, that is both unilateral disarmament by definition, and it is also blame America first by definition. Now, I think this \nis a crucially important issue. I think it's one we ought to be debating and discussing, and I think it's one we ought to \ndebate based on facts. And we ought to not go down the path of somehow suggesting that there are ulterior \nmotives here. \n\nAnd frankly, I think we ought not go down the path of saying we need to hurry this up and move it along as the \nchairman did. This is a really important issue. And those of us on this side of the aisle who are suggesting that our \ncolleagues need full information, that our colleagues need to be fully informed are simply saying you need to \nrecognize and understand if you have not had the briefings about what our adversaries can do, and if you have not \nhad the briefings about the capabilities that our military has requested, and if you have not had the briefings about \nthe plans for the use and the deployment of these weapon systems, then you need to recognize when you're \ncasting this vote, you are doing it without full information. \n\nThere is nothing political about that. We're not playing games. We're simply suggesting to you that you've got to \nhave full information. That's why I've offered this amendment. I simply do not believe, and I think it's highly \nirresponsible to suggest, that the world is more safe if our adversaries have a capability that we do not have. And \n\n\n\nthis committee takes every step to prevent the United States from having that capability. That's absolutely wrong. \nWith that I yield back. \n\nSTEFANIK: Reclaiming the balance of my time. I yield the balance to Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: I just want to make it clear after Mr. Cooper's comments, I've served on the Strategic Forces Committee \nfor 18 years and that subcommittee has never had the briefings that we just discussed that'll be necessary for \ndetermining whether we should recall a nuclear weapon. I yield back. \n\nSTEFANIK: Yield back to the Chair. \n\nSMITH: All right. Thank you. I think we have concluded the debate on--on this amendment. It is a very important \namendment. We have--have been debating it for an hour and I think that's--that's important. Don't wish to rush that. \nIf there are points that haven't been made, certainly want to be able to make them. But I think we have had a robust \ndebate and both sides have had the opportunity to make their arguments. And with that, all those in favor of the \namendment will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: In the opinion of the chair, the no's have it. Roll call is requested. We'll have a role call. And now we have \n13 votes on the House floor. So, we'll probably be getting back here in about an hour. Do try to come back as \nquickly as you can, particularly if you have amendments coming up. Thank you. \n\n(BREAK) \n\nSMITH: The committee will come to order. There is in fact a quorum, but most of it's eating in the anteroom. We're \ncounting them, because I know there's a TV in there and they can hear us. All right. We are continuing with \namendments to the strategic forces mark. Next up is Log 006 by Mr. Turner. For what purpose does Mr. Turner \nseek recognition? \n\nTURNER: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute the amendment without objection. We'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. \nMr. Turner is recognized. \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, let me know when I should start. \n\nSMITH: You're recognized. \n\nTURNER: Oh, great. Thank you. The--this amendment--it is problematic in that it's prescriptive and--I mean, it's \nlegislatively requiring that--you know--our--our Secretary of Defense, on a mill to mill basis undertake discussions \ndirectly with adversaries but without any preconditions, without any basis of--of--of protocol as to the discussions. \nAnd--you know--this really isn't our task, first off, to--to set about determining what meetings the Secretary of \nDefense should have, but even--even beyond that, I mean I--with the way this bill is going, I can see this going this \nway. We say that the Secretary of Defense must establish a senior working group for the purposes of engaging in \nmilitary and military discussions with counterparts from governments of covered foreign countries to reduce the risk \nof miscalculations, unintended consequences, or accidents that could precipitate a nuclear war. And those \nmeetings are supposed to happen with Russia and China. \n\nSo, with the way this bill is going, this could go this way. We have representatives that sit down with our Russians. \nOur Russians said, Comrade, I am so glad that your Congress is banning your nuclear weapons. So, I don't really \n\n\n\nhave a whole lot of threat. If I just wait you out, perhaps you'll lose more. Maybe the nuclear triad will go next. \nThank you so much for meeting with me. \n\nBut, no, I mean seriously, all aside, and I'm glad the chairman smiled because I--I was being--being tongue in \ncheek. The--the--the concern here is, is that we--we--we shouldn't start this process of engaging in requiring \nmeetings that typically have very strategic diplomatic basis. I mean there's a reason why you reward someone with \na meeting or not reward someone with a meeting, what its subject matter is or it's not. And so, just to start down this \npath of prescriptively requiring that these meetings happen by legislation is--is--is certainly not called for, and I \nthink, you know, cert--is--is also contrary to what we normally think of are--are diplomatic channels and meetings. \n\nNow, the other aspect is, I had offered an amendment to this to say, hey, a lot of this happens anyway. A lot of this \ngoes on. Perhaps we just have an--an annual report on this so we could provide oversight, because I mean ra--\nrather than demanding that these people undertake military tomit--military discussions, perhaps we should start with \nan annual report to us that gives us oversight from which we could affect it and--and encouraging it in--in getting \ngreater fidelity as to what the subject matter is that they're discussing. \n\nSo, it is a motion to strike absent the fact that our amendment that would have turned it into an oversight function \nwas denied. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. And I know we've negotiated a lot of different things back and forth, and part of the problem is, \nobviously, we don't have time to have everyone in the room. I don't actually think your last point there is completely \ncrazy. I--I think it's--it's possible that that sort of discussion, if those dialogues are going on. Now, I think this is \ndifferent overall, and I disagree with the main thrust of your--your argument that, you know, we shouldn't force these \ndiscussions. Broadly speaking, when you're talking about diplomatic negotiations, I--I would tend to agree. You \ndon't know what the preconditions are. \n\nWe're talking a very discreet area here, and that is just to make it clear that we understand each other as well as \npossible so that we don't accidentally misunderstand and stumble into nuclear war. And it--it's kind of ironic that on \nthe last amendment, there were many arguments, I will grant you. But, one of the biggest arguments was, you \nknow, we can't know what the Russians think we think, okay? \n\nYou know, we can add this deterrent policy that we'll launch this weapon if they launch, but we can't know if they \nbelieve us or not. Well, it strikes me that if we were meeting with them on a regular basis saying, look at me. \nBelieve this. This is what we intend to do, that that would sort of clear up the problem you had with the first set of \namendments that somehow, you know, our deterrent--they won't believe us, that we're going to use a--a--a slightly \nlarger nuclear weapon than the one they used on us. This is a great opportunity to make them believe us and to \nmake sure you eliminate that communication. \n\nNow--and I'm also in conversations with the Pentagon and elsewhere. I realize that discussions like this go on more \noften than perhaps we understand. It--it does happen. Eh, I mean long term, I'm potentially open to the idea of--of \nallowing that dia--where tell us what--tell us what you're talking about. And then we can figure it out from there. So, \nyeah, and this kind of thing, we're going to have to work on in the future here. So, I--I--I'm willing for the moment to--\nwell, you know, it's kind of important that you're tracking this--sorry--to have that discussion and see about maybe \nan amendment we could agree to at--at the full committee mark that would do something along those lines. \n\nSo, if you guys could chat and see about working that out, because I--I think it--in talking with the people at the \nPentagon, there's a lot more of these discussions to realize. We just don't know what they are, when they are. This \nobviously would probably have to be a--you know, a classified report, but if we could get that report so we could \nunderstand what the level of dialogue is, but I think this is important.  I'm sorry we started, and Ms. Slotkin isn't here \nbecause she had a very compelling point on the Iran situation about whether or not there were back-channel \ncommunications going on with Iran that are not a formal discussion, but just so we understand each other so we \ndon't stumble into something, and her experience at DoD in terms of setting up those back channel \ncommunications. \n\n\n\nSo, if the gentleman is agreeable, I'm willing to entertain that--that conversation and move this to the full committee. \nAnd if we don't resolve it, you can offer this amendment to the full committee. \n\nTURNER: Fair. \n\nSMITH: Okay. That disp--I trust that hopefully also dispenses with the next one. \n\nTURNER: Yes, actually. The other one, which is just a brief bit of levity, and so it actually comes at a good point. \nSomebody isn't in the room. But, it--it really is just encouraging. Codell's (PH), Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Now, that's fine. And I--I would only have one-- \n\nTURNER: --I withdraw at 008. \n\nSMITH: Okay. And I would only have one point about that. I--I get the point. It is good to have that discussion.  But, \nyou understand there's a huge difference between the DoD guys and little old me in that they actually have the \nability to fire rather important weapons at each other. So, them talking is even more important. \n\nAll right. So, we've moved through those two, which gets us up to--what do we got next there, 174. And I \napologize. \n\nUNKNOWN: DesJarlais. \n\nSMITH: Yeah, who's not here. Is Dr. DesJarlais in the backroom, by any chance? \n\nUNKNOWN: I'll go look. \n\nSMITH: Okay. In his--in his defense, we moved more quickly than I think anyone was expecting. Mr. Wilson is here-\n- \n\nWILSON: Yes. \n\nSMITH: So, with permission, we'll go out of order and take I guess unanimous consent is the tactical thing and go to \nMr. Wilson's amendments until Mr. DesJarlais shows up. Without objection, so ordered. So, we'll do Log 426, and \nI'll recognize Mr. Wilson. For what purpose does Mr. Wilson seek recognition? \n\nWILSON: And--and thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. You are the (INAUDIBLE) amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading. And \nthe gentleman is recognized to discussed. \n\nWILSON: Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to achieve a bipartisan solution to a significant national security \nchallenge, plutonium pit production. The Senate NDAA has marked up the president's budget request, which \nsupports the requirement of 80 pits per year, but in 2030. The United States previously produced plutonium pits for \nour nuclear weapons at the Rocky Flatts plant in Oh--Colorado. That plant has now closed, and the last produced \nplutonium pit was in 19--1989, 30 years ago. \n\nNuclear weapons are like any other weapon system in the sense that they require maintenance and they require \ncomponents to be periodically replaced. That means we need spare parts. A plutonium pit is a component of every \nnuclear weapon that we have, which enhances explosive capabilities. And we simple do not have the needed \ncomponents to maintain these weapons. It is understood that properly maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile \nshould be amongst our highest priorities. \n\nTherefore, I am urging support of this amendment, which strikes Section 3114. Section 3114 repeals the \nrequirement contained in Title 50 U.S. Code to 53-8A that the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy will \ndemonstrate the capability to produce 80--80 plutonium pits by the year 2027. This is a substantiated requirement. \nThis is a requirement that has been validated by the Nuclear Weapons Council. Section 3114 also contends--\n\n\n\ncontains a sense of Congress that the National Nuclear Security Administration should prioritize producing 30 \nplutonium pits per year at Los Alamos National Laboratory and not divert resources to construct a second site for pit \nproduction. Th--this section of the bill should be struck for several reasons. \n\nFirst, Los Alamos is a research facility, not a production facility. The Department of Energy and NNSA have other \nlocations better suited for pit production. However, I'm not suggesting that Los Alamos relinquish their portion of the \nmission. Rather, I am suggesting we need a second production site to help achieve the 80 pit per year production \nrequirement. The two sites should work together toward revitalizing plutonium pits. \n\nSecond, Los Alamos has been attempting to produce a qualified plutonium pit since 2010. They have not yet \nproduced any plutonium pits that could be qualified for use in a weapon. They've been trying for nine years, sadly \nunsuccessfully. In 2021 is the deadline for producing qualified plutonium pits. And whether we will achieve that goal \nis in doubt. \n\nThis provision solely focuses on a single site that has yet to produce any usable pits. Third, the facility at Los \nAlamos where they are attempting to produce plutonium pits has been plagued with safety problems, safety \nproblems so significant that the facility was previously shut down for three years. I understand those safety issues \nhave been resolved, but there are other DOA installations with far better safety records. \n\nFourth, there is concern a second site represents a $14 billion life cycle cost increase. However, that estimate does \nnot include the offset by reducing the overall nuclear complex life cycle cost. According to the Institute for Defense \nAnalysis's report on pit production, the life cycle cost analysis omitted a significant number of personnel required for \nsupporter activities for all Los Alamos cost options, clo--closing much of the cost gap between the two site versus \none site solution, making the cost virtually comparable. \n\nFurther, focusing solely on cost would limit production to a single facility at a single site. This would jeopardize our \nnuclear deterrents in a new era defined by the National Security Strategy as a great power of competition. The best \nchoice for a second site is Savannah River site, which already has the facility certified to handle plutonium. There \nare engineering changes that need to be made. I don't want to suggest those are not without cost, but I'm \nconvinced it's less expensive than constructing and certifying a new site. We need a second plutonium pit facility, \nand this is by far the best option. \n\nIt's estimated that Los Alamos can achieve a maximum production rate of 30 plutonium pits per year, and I hope \nthey achieve it. However, that's not close to the 80 pits per year required, which is currently the law that has been \nvalidated by the Nuclear Weapons Council to maintain a resilient infrastructure. \n\nIn conclusion, I urge unanimous consent to submit for the record a letter from the StratCom commander, General \nJohn Heiten, dated 9--10-- \n\nSMITH: --Without objection--without objection, so ordered-- \n\nWILSON: --To--to the record concerning delay in pit production that supports a two-site plan. \n\nSMITH: And-- \n\nWILSON: I ask support for this amendment, and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Cooper? \n\nCOOPER: Thank the chair, and I would like to praise the gentleman from South Carolina. I know of no more \npatriotic American than him, or anyone who does a better job of representing his state and his district than Mr. \nWilson. I'm a little worried though that he does too good a job of representing his state and his history. \n\nAs members of this committee know, he and I have gone back and forth for years on the so-called MOX facility, \nwhich was finally subjected to a mercy killing. I called it for a long time the zombie earmark--the earmark that simply \n\n\n\nwouldn't die. But, now, finally, it's gone. And now at Savannah River, we have to find a new purpose, new job \ncreator there. And I'm not against jobs in South Carolina. \n\nI'm just worried, though, when he mentioned in his very fair presentation earlier that the estimate--the best estimate \nwe have of the combined life cycle cost of being $14 billion more, if we also have a site in South Carolina, that's a \nlot of money. A lot of folks here are scrambling for tens of millions of dollars, and this is $14 billion we would be \nhanding to South Carolina on top of all the other money we gave them in the MOX era. \n\nSo, having killed one earmark, I'm worried we're about to embark on another. Now, this debate is not about the 80-\npit requirement. That's a very valid debate as to whether we will need that many pits produced every year. This is a \ndebate about where we should do the first 30. And I think most people would acknowledge that most all of the \nplutonium scientists in America are located in or around Los Alamos, or at least in New Mexico. \n\nThere are very few, if any, in South Carolina. And to have this extra site at an extra cost of $14 billion seems to me \nto be an extravagance we simply cannot afford at this time. So, the debate is not whether we have 30 pits or 80. \nMany people want to get to 80. But, first we have to get to 30, and we have to get to 30 in a reliable way. The best \nestimate we have right now if we focus just on Los Alamos and we work really hard, we might get there by say \n2025. And that would be awesome. That would--that's a necessary achievement because we do need to \nrehabilitate our nuclear weapons. \n\nThis is vitally important, and I'm for putting it in where it is already, in New Mexico. Now, let's help those folks do \nthe best possible job in the quickest possible fashion so we have an adequate number of pits produced there. \nWhether that number is 30 or 80, Los Alamos is the place. New Mexico is the state. And let's do it there rather than \nship this plutonium all over America. I think New Mexico has a history of success in this area. We hope they can live \nup to their past achievements. \n\nThe lab director there, Thom Mason, is outstanding. He used to be Oak Ridge. So, let's do it right. Let's do it at Los \nAlamos. And then if we have extra money, we'll consider South Carolina. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. \nChair. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Turner? \n\nTURNER: Okay, so I want to go for some analogies, but first off, let me just deal with the earmark issue. Mr. Wilson \ndid not write this into our--our code or into our--our nuclear requirements. Yes, this does affect South Carolina. I'm--\nI'm not from South Carolina, and I'm--I'm for this, and I would do this. And this isn't because of--of Joe Wilson. This \nis because I believe that we need the nuclear weapons capability. \n\nNow this is the analogy. Now, we keep talking about plutonium pits, plutonium pits. But, let--let's just call it what it \nis. It's a part of the bomb. And we can say that. It's not classified. A nuclear pit is part of the bomb. Now here's your \nanalogy. I have a 1964 Cadillac. I love it. But, you know what? I can't get in it and drive it to work every day. It is not \nreliable. It is not good for me to use that for--for commuting. I would have no ability to a--to be assured that I can \nget where I need to with my 1964 Cadillac. We have weapons that are older. We have weapons that are that age. \nAnd they need replaced. \n\nYou can't be a w--nuclear weapons state and say, I bought one. I put it in the garage. It may be a 1964, but it's all \ngoing to be okay because I--I got one. You got to have something that works, that is reliable. The--the--a fou--the--\nthe requirement that is placed before us is 80 plutonium pits by 2027. The DoD in all studies, DoE, have come back \nand said, this is what we need and that we need two sites. This is what General Heiten said March 28th of 2019. \nAnd this is why your analogy is important. This is the general's quote, not mine, not someone on the committee just \nopining what's too expensive or not too expensive. General Heiten said, quote, \"I am concerned about building new \nweapons that will have 100-year-old plutonium pits. I think it is a risk the United States should not take.\" \n\nHere's your analogy. This is like me saying, okay, my 1964 Cadillac's too old. It's unreliable. So, I'm going to build a \nbrand-new car. But, I'm going to take the engine out. I'm going to put the '64 engine in my old car. And guess what? \nYou still have the same lack of reliability. We need to get to 80. We've been told DoD, DoE, all studies. We need \n\n\n\nthis. We need two sites, both for the reliability and to make certain that--that--that we're able to reach the production \nlevel that we need. The--the $14 billion of difference that is cited, it--it does not take into consideration all of the \nother factors that--that actually in looking at Los Alamos, looking at a second site, make it somewhat com--\ncomparable. You know, it shouldn't be my testimony. It shouldn't be Mr. Cooper's testimony. It shouldn't be like \nwhat's more affordable, what's not affordable. \n\nYou know, I say that--that it breaks even. He says it costs $14 billion. Th--this should just go to straight out \ntestimony of what we have, and what we have in front of us is DoD and DoE saying that we need this. Now, if we \ncombine all these things, if we say we're going to require--re--recall our nuclear weapons that are deployed and \nwe're going to hamper our ability to replace the nuclear weapons we have, we are starting down a path of not being \nable to meet the deterrents needs that we--that we must have in order to keep our country safe. \n\nSo, I support Mr. Wilson's amendment, and I think that--that this is a requirement we have long pursued. You know, \nanother aspect of this I just want to add that--that e--every time we get into this situation and people complain about \nthe costs, the costs of our nuclear weapons modernization continues to be affected by the fact that we run one way \nand then we wait a couple years. And then we go run another way. And then somebody else has a better idea what \nwe should be doing something else. \n\nM--maybe we should just trust the people at DoD and DoE who are saying that we--what we need and put it in \nplace and give them the dollars that they need to make certain we have a modernized nuclear weapons that are an \nactual deterrent to keep our country safe. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further debate, Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I want to support this amendment. We have a requirement to modernize our \nnuclear force. And our DoD, our--our StratCom, the nuclear weapons center, the National Military Secur--Nuclear \nSecurity Agency, they all say they need--and by 1927 (PH), 80 nuclear pits a year. And that's a minimum that they--\nthat they need. And we got to build a program to get to 80 by then. \n\nSo, according to the administrator Lisa Gordon Hagerty, the requirement of 80 per year is at the low end of the \nrequirement, given the pace and scope of the current modernization. And I know General Heiten personally. I--I live \nseven miles away from him. I see him a lot. I trust him. He's going to be our Vice Chairman. And he was emphatic \nthat we need to get to 80 a year. And there is no better voice on this than General Heiten, who's been running \nStratCom. \n\nAnd Mr. Turner only gave half that quote. Let--let me give you the full quote that General Heiten said, because I'm \nconcerned about building the new weapons who have 100-year-old plutonium pits. I think that's just a risk that the \nUnited States should not take. But, then it goes on to say, to continue where Mr. Turner stopped. He goes, the \nminimum requirement is by 2030 we need a plutonium pit production capacity up to 80 across the enterprise. \n\nWe have a plan with DoE that we support that to get that to 80 at both Los Alamos and Savannah River in South \nCarolina. This is General Heiten. He is speaking with authority on this. If we want to have assuredness with our \nnuclear weapons, I think we need to follow what he is saying. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Garamendi? \n\nGARAMENDI: You just spoke to--about Mr. Heiten. I do not recall him giving the Strategic Arms Committee a \ndetailed study of why 80 pits a year were needed, but I do recall over the last five year--I've seen this letter. But, the \nbackup information upon which that information is based, I don't believe has ever been given to the committee. But-\n- \n\nBACON: May I ask a question? \n\nGARAMENDI: Of course. \n\nSMITH: The correct thing to say is, will the gentleman yield? \n\n\n\nBACON: Will the gentleman yield? Thank you. I'm a sophomore, still learning. \n\nGARAMENDI: Of course, sir. \n\nBACON: Are you doubting, though, that General Heiten feels that way? \n\nGARAMENDI: I don't doubt that he wrote the letter, and I don't doubt that he'd rather have 150 a year rather than \n80 a year. His task is to reduce the risk. And--and we share that obligation. We also share the obligation to the \ntaxpayers that the money be spent wisely along the way. But, once again, I do not believe we've ever received a \nstudy about why 80 pits. I do recall over the last four years that the number has grown from 10 to 20 to 30 to 60 to \n80. \n\nAnd along the way, no analysis of why that growth has occurred. Now, it may very well be that there is out there a \ndetailed study. It seems to me it ought to be shared with us so that we can make a rational decision about not only \nthe total number that we're going to build every year, but also that we are able to determine where the best location \nthat may be built. If, for example, the appropriate number is 30, then presumably Los Alamos would be there. \n\nThe other thing that I'm concerned about is we have not seen a classified report on the degradation over time of Mr. \nTurner's engine. That is, the degradation of the pit itself. Now, we probably might assume that one pit is not the \nsame as the other. And since these things were used for a variety of weapons and stored and used in different \nlocations in different environments that maybe the degradation changes from one to another. \n\nThat is a critical factor in determining how many pits need to be built new to meet the requirement for the LEP, the \nLife Extension Program. So, I think we can go a little slow here. I don't think we need to make the final jump to 80 \nand the accompanied billions upon billions of dollars that would be required. And so, show me the studies. Show \nme the studies that the degradation in the plutonium is such that it is risky, that is it may not implode properly. Show \nme the studies that we need to therefore have to go to 80 before we commit to the full--what will be $15 billion \nadditional beyond what this amendment says our initial investment would be required. And with that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Bishop? \n\nBISHOP: Thank you. Look, I--I want to engage in this debate simply because I have been in Mr. Turner's Cadillac. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nBISHOP: And it truly is a pi--a POS. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nBISHOP: But, it is easier to get out of his Cadillac than out of his Mercedes. But, what I would like to-- \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nBISHOP: We sometimes--we sometimes-- \n\nSMITH: You're hurting him politically here, Mr. Bishop. \n\nTURNER: So-- \n\nBISHOP: Superficially. Let me yield 30 seconds to Mr. Turner simply so he can get the reference point, and then I \nwant to take my time back. \n\nTURNER: I do not have a Mercedes. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nSo-- \n\n\n\nBISHOP: --If that's what you say-- \n\nTURNER: --So, Mr. Garamendi, my dear friend, it is the Nuclear Weapons Council, and in fact, I--in hopes that I \nwould find something, I actually Googled the Nuclear Weapons Council, which they gave their report to us. Nuclear \nWeapons Council--I--I Googled Nuclear Weapons Council 80 pits, and I got the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration's report dated April 17th, 2019, which also has a link to the other report. And it discusses and \nvalidates the--the requirement for 80 pits, and I'll yield back. \n\nBISHOP: Let me yield back--re--reclaim my time because I too believe in what the military has told us of what this is \nessential. And we sometimes have a superficial way in which we look about these types of issues. And with that, I'd \nlike to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Wilson, because I missed his testimony when I came in--came in late. \n\nWILSON: And thank you, Congressman Bishop. I appreciate that. And, indeed, I want to thank Chairman Cooper \nfor his kind comments. But, indeed, this is not an earmark because what NS--NSA has done is that they have done \nstudies indicating that the MOX facility substantially completed is exactly where plutonium can be used safely and in \nthe interest of our country. Additionally, there's a trained workforce. We have technical colleges and universities and \ncolleges very close by the facility in Georgia and South Carolina to address the issue of the workforce. \n\nAnd it is also very warmly accepted by every level of government in--in the region. I would also like to point out that \nthere's been substantiation of the need for the 80 pits. We've--I've already introduced the letter by General Heiten. \nWe've had testimony here on March 28 by General Heiten. \n\nBut, additionally, on April the 9th, we had the Director of NNSA, Ms. Gordon--Ms. Lisa Gordon Hagerty, confirm that \nStratCom and the Nuclear Weapons Council requirement is to produce not less than 80 pits per year and for our \nfuture nuclear weapons needs. \n\nAdditionally, these numbers are based on production timelines, life extension milestones, and operational \nrequirements. Additionally, she testified during her subcommittee appearance that she reaffirmed that her highest \npriority is the plutonium pit manufacturing, and the Nuclear Weapons Council has endorsed the NNSA's two-site \napproach to pit production at Los Alamos and Savannah River. And indeed, the--there have been studies by the \nNuclear Weapons Council, which, as a joint activity of the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. And \nadditionally, last year, the NDAA required that there be a study. And it was done by the Institute of Defense \nAnalyses, a not-for-profit corporation that had--does extraordinary research in terms of scien--scientific, tech--\ntechnical, and analytic expertise. And they too have come back that there needs to be a--a capability of 80 pits. \n\nAnd so, the studies have been done. And I--I just urge people to look at this and understand it's just not--it's--it's so \nimportant for the nuclear defense of our country. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Ms. Torres Small? \n\nTORRES SMALL: I just want to reinforce the point that this question is not about the number of pits that are \nadvisable, but the question is about where they should be manufactured. And--and it's been said during debate that \npart of the reason why things can get expensive is because we're going back and forth on decisions. \n\nWe already have a facility that's dedicated. And so, we should stick with that and continue to do the work that we \nneed to do. \n\nSMITH: Let me just say I loved that argument right there, very concise, to the point, and I believe it took 20 \nseconds. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nJust because you--just because you have five minutes ticking down off the clock in front of you doesn't mean that \nyou have to fill all of that time by repeating what you've said. So, thank you for setting that fine example. And with \nthat, Mr. Mitchell, I will recognize you. \n\n\n\nMITCHELL: Mr. Chair, I--I believe I've--I've adhered to the theory of brevity and never gotten close to my five \nminutes. So, I--I won't do so here. If I believed Mr. Wilson was trying to get a secret earmark for $14 billion, I would \ntake him out behind the building, wrestle him for the $14 billion for (INAUDIBLE). I don't believe that's the case. I \nthink we're overlooking some things. First, there's a safety factor involved here. The Department of Defense has \ntalked about that without replacing these pits, we have--we run into safety issues. And we talked a lot about that in \nthis committee. \n\nWhy is it we're not as concerned about getting these 80 and making sure we have options to make--make it full \nflexibility to achieve the 80? The other is, Mr. Cooper, with all due respect, you talk about $14 billion being the \nadditional cost. IDA themselves has indicated they failed to consider the engineering--the engineering folks failed to \nconsider the personnel requirements at Los Alamos to get to the 80. \n\nAnd when they considered them, in fact, the cost to be significantly diminished. That's their quote, not mine. So, in \nfact, I don't have an exact number. I'll admit. But, it's not $14 billion. So, let's not kind of put up big numbers and \ncause issues here. If they indicate it's significantly diminished from their $14 billion number they originally quoted. \nAnd so, let's not--for the sake of having flexibility, engage the 80 pits. I think we should agree with the amendment. \nI--I support it. Thank you. And that was only a minute, 15. \n\nSMITH: Still not as good as Ms. Torres Small. Just saying. But--but, pretty good, pretty good. All right. I think that \nthe concern here is whether or not we're going to be wasting money on trying to develop pits at the MOX facility. As \nMr. Cooper has said, I have my quibbles about the 80--80-pit requirement. They got there awful fast after telling us \nthat there were 10, 20, or 30. And it just kept going do, do, do, do, do, up. \n\nAnd I would--I would love to see a--a better, clearer analysis as to why we got to those 80 pits. I know--I know that \nthey said that. But, that's not really the big point on the underlying mark. The big point is, are we going to wind up \nwasting an enormous amount of money at the facility in Savannah River, which, by the way, was largely created for \nan entirely different purpose. \n\nAnd let me also tell you, I wish we could roll the tape over the course of the last 10 years. The number of times we \nwere assured that the MOX facility was exactly what the NSA wanted, that it was going to work, that it was going to \nsuccessfully process the (INAUDIBLE), they were going to get there. And then, okay, next year, well, we didn't \nquite get there this time, but, you know, we're now--we're going to get there. And we never did. And I don't have, off \nthe top of my head, the exact amount of money that we wasted at that facility. And I say wasted because they never \nproduced what they said they were going to produce. \n\nBut, it is not a small number. So, when the NSA comes and says, hey, we got this, it's going to work at this plant, I--\nI--I don't sort of just fall over trusting them on that remark. So, our concern is that they more adequately explain to \nus how they're going to be able to do this in a cost-effective way. Los Alamos has been doing this for a--a--a long \ntime. We have that facility. There are also other options, other than the--the MOX facility down in South Carolina. \nAnd I have seen the history. \n\nHowever they arrive at their decisions and anyone in this committee who thinks there isn't a political aspect to \nPentagon decisions or NNSA decisions, you--you need to pay a little closer attention because there is a political \naspect to it. And pressure gets brought. And I understand. We--we want the South Carolina facility to work. That \nwould be great. I don't want to waste taxpayer money on it. That's what we're concerned about. We want to see the \njustification for the fact this facility that they're picking to build it at is actually going to work because they do not \nhave a particularly good history o--of doing this. \n\nAnd that's the concern, the reason that I'm going to propose this amendment. Anybody else? All right. All those in \nfavor of the amendment by Mr. Wilson will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no? \n\n\n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinions here. Yes, Mr. Wilson? \n\nWILSON: A--ask a recorded vote? \n\nSMITH: Recorded vote is asked for. We will spend on this one, and we're going to back up--well, okay. We're going \nto do both of Mr. Wilson's and then get to Dr. DesJarlais. So, next up is going to be Log 425. For what reason does \nthe gentleman from South Carolina seek recognition? \n\nWILSON: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of it. And the \nchairman has recogni--sorry. Mr. Wilson is recognized for five minutes. \n\nWILSON: Mr. Chairman, this amendment promotes an increase in funding for a national security challenge that has \nbeen previously discussed, and that is the plutonium pit production. The Senate NDAA has marked up to the \npresident's budget request, which supports the 80 pits per year at two site solutions. For the same reasons that I've \nmentioned in previous debate, I ask you to support this amendment, which adequately funds a two-site solution for \nplutonium pit production as recommended by the NNSA and the Nuclear Weapons Council. It is important for Los \nAlamos and Savannah River to join forces together in accomplishing this mission. \n\nTo re--reiterate some points from the previous debate, modernization of our nuclear weapons stockpile should be \namongst our highest priorities. Second, the 80 pits per year requirement by 2030 has been validated by the Nuclear \nWeapons Council and the Institute for Defense Analysis. And third, two sites will increase resiliency to unplanned \nproduction outages and can adapt to shifting requirements in countering future threats. \n\nThe Savannah River site is ready to work with Los Alamos to achieve full nuclear modernization in a safe, low-risk, \nand timely manner. And I ask support for this amendment, and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: You want to take a shot at this? Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: I'd like to speak in opposition to the amendment. I hate to be too graphic in my description, but I'm afraid \nthis is the first tranche of the earmark here. And where do they take the money from? Operations and maintenance. \nWe've had a readiness crisis with our military for years because everybody's favorite piggy bank is operations and \nmaintenance. \n\nNow, there are a lot of technical reasons for that. But--and this may seem like only $241 million, but that's about the \namount of money that MOX was getting in South Carolina virtually every year for the last five or 10 years. And as \nthe chairman noted, it never produced a thing. It was never completed, and they couldn't even agree on the degree \nof completion. That's why I called it years ago the zombie earmark. \n\nSo, here it is again in a different form, and the worst part of this amendment isn't so much trying to push the second \nsite. The worst part of this amendment is raiding the operations and maintenance account because it's everybody's \nfavorite piggy bank. Let's stop this raid right now. \n\nSMITH: Anybody else? Only thing I would add, as my helpful staff pointed out to me, we've actually spent $5 billion \non the MOX facility to produce nothing. So, it--it does happen that we make mistakes along those lines. And I had \nthe same argument against this amendment that I had against the previous one. Nobody else going to comment? \nAll right. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no? \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Opinion of the Chair, the no's have it. The amendment is not agreed to. And I keep doing that. When I get \ndone talking and start over again, I turn it off. And I'm still talking. Dr. DesJarlais, for what purpose do you seek \nrecognition? \n\nDESJARLAIS: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Ah. Now I've forgotten what I'm supposed to say. Clerk, distribute the amendment, and without objection, \nreading the amendment will be dispensed with, and the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. \n\nDESJARLAIS: My amendment would strike Section 1649 of the mark requesting an independent study on a no-first-\nuse nuclear weapons policy. We do not need a study on this issue. We know that this kind of policy would not only \nerode U.S. and NATO deterrent strategy. It would relay to our adversaries that our will in maintaining vigilance \nagainst attack on the U.S. and our allies is wavering. \n\nRussia hasn't had an NFU policy since 1993. China is strongly con--continuing to eliminate its policy as well. Both \ncountries continue modernization efforts of their respective nuclear forces and are making great strides in new \ncapabilities that this mark does not adequately prioritize, such as hypersonics and directed energy weapons. \n\nThis is not the time to be considering a no-first-use policy. It gives our adversaries permission to escalate. It puts \nour allies at risk. And it risks destabilizing the strategic environment. As recent as 2016, President Obama \nconsidered an NFU policy. And his own Secretary of Energy, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense argued \nforcefully against it, and the policy was never adopted. So, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and not \nentertain consideration of a policy that both NATO and the department have continuous--continuously said would \nmake the world less safe, not more. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. In response to this, this is something that we've worked on, talked about for a while. Again, the-\n-the purpose of nuclear weapons straightforward is to deter their use. Now, I do know a number of people in the \nanti-nuclear world who envision a world without nuclear weapons. I do not envision that world. You, in my opinion, \ncannot unring the bell. The ability to develop these weapons exists. So, it is very important that countries like the \nUnited States of America have nuclear weapons in order to deter anybody else from using them. I think that is very \nimportant. \n\nBut, we don't want to be the ones who are starting the nuclear exchange. And certainly, there are arguments where \nwe're backed into a corner. We may want to use a nuclear weapon, but I don't think those arguments carry the day \nversus the catastrophic effect of starting a nuclear exchange because we're not the only ones who have them. \n\nNow, I'm mindful of where-where the votes are at on this. We don't have a no first use policy in the bill. But I don't \nthink it would hurt to at least have a broader discussion about it and think about it, and that's what this does is it \nasks for that study and that discussion. I think that's reasonable given the risk associated with starting a nuclear \nwar. So, I--I will oppose the amendment. Further discussion. Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Dr. Desjarlais asked me to--to join with him on this and this is the only thing I want to say about a study \nthat I think is important about his amendment. Mr. Chairman, you said that the es--our nuclear weapons are \ndesigned to deter others so that they don't use nuclear weapons; so that nuclear weapons would--the use of \nnuclear weapons would be unthinkable. \n\nI--I don't know how you study the effect of a no-use policy on your adversary unless you can get in your adversary's \nhead. So, we're going to get the same thing that we got when we had a hearing on this, which is just academics \ntelling us what they believe that our adversaries--what Putin's going to do, what somebody else might do. \n\nWhat--who it might deter, who it might--the reality is is we'll never know. But we do know one thing. A no-use first--a \nnon-policy on no first use, indicating that we are in--in--in--we're unclear as to what we would do. Leaves certainly \nthe world as it, and that is, people have been deterred. They've been deterred for--for over fifty years. We--we'd--so, \nthis policy, I think, would be dangerous. And--and I think a study is not going to give us any information to make a \ndecision on this. I yield back. \n\n\n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion. Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: Maybe I can do this in 90 seconds. Is it good to be ignorant? Is it good to be ignorant? Is it good not \nto have someone study this and--academics and--you know--bunch of folks in ivory towers and others. Think tanks \ngo through this and say, \"What does a first-use policy mean?\" It means this, it means that, it--the kind of questions \nthat have been bouncing around here for the last couple of hours. \n\nIt seems to me we would have some information. The other thing that would be extremely important in this, and my \ngood friend Mr. Turner said that we can't get into the head of Putin or Chinese or whomever, but we could begin to \nunderstand what a first-use policy means. Whether we're the first ones to use it or they're the first ones to use it. \n\nThere's no harm in having this study. It might give us some very valuable information. It might even cause me to \nbelieve that Mr. Turner's correct on his previous arguments. Although that's a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. So, \nwhy not? Why not do a study? Why not have somebody inform us and we can carry on a good debate at a late hour \none year from now. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion. All those in favor of the amendment will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the nos have it. No's have it. The amendment is defeated. We are now up to block--\nhow do we get to 396R1, by the way. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nWhy not just 396? Log 396R--I'm sorry. I skipped one. Whoa, sorry. The board moved on me as I was looking at it. \nWe're at 414. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from Wyoming seek recognition? \n\nCHENEY: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: The--the clerk will distribute the amendment without objection. The amendment will be considered read and \nthe Gentlelady is recognized for five minutes. You would think after the five-hundredth time I did that that I would \nremember that. But it slips. Ms. Cheney. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was pleased to hear the chairman say he doesn't want to waste taxpayer \nmoney, and I'm confident he will therefore want to support my amendment. My amendment would basically \neliminate Section 65--1650 in the bill, which requires yet another study on the ground based strategic deterrent. \n\nThe majority must be aware of the multitude of studies that have already been completed on this subject, including \nthe Air Force's analysis of alternatives. Studies that look at sustaining the ICBM force beyond the end of the \nminuteman service life in 2030. Perhaps the majority hasn't read the conclusions in that exhaustive analysis, in \nwhich the Air Force weighed several alternatives, including options to accomplish a service life extension to \nminuteman three, a completely replacement to both minuteman three and silo infrastructure, and a hybrid which \nwould mix the existing infrastructure with a new missile. \n\nThe majority seems also to have overlooked the most recent 2018 national defense strategy, which highlights our \nincreasingly aggressive adversaries, all of whom are seeking or expanding long-range missile capabilities. They are \nalso apparently ignoring the last four nuclear posture reviews written under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. All of which assert the foundational requirement for the triad and our absolute need to modernize \nour aging nuclear system. \n\n\n\nBut the majority seems not to be familiar with these conclusions. And they've ignored the millions of dollars already \nspent analyzing alternatives, because they're seeking yet another report. I would like to ask that the majority \nconsider the stack of reports that we have here, all of which have been completed within the last four years; all of \nwhich have the same conclusion. Which is that we do--the most cost-effective approach is to procure the ground \nbased strategic deterrent. It in fact is far more expensive than trying to keep the aging minuteman three on alert. \n\nThis committee ought to debate these issues. We ought to debate whether or not we should move forward on a \nwhole range of topics. But to simply add another report requirement of an issue that has been studied ad nauseum \nis simply, I would say, an illegitimate way to address the issue and clearly a waste of taxpayer money. \n\nIt's absolutely clear we need a modern, safe, credible, effective nuclear triad. If you support that you should support \nmy amendment. I urge the committee to support this amendment, not impose yet another report requirement, waste \nyet more taxpayer dollars, but move to keep the GBSD program on schedule, on budget, and not adopt yet one \nmore superfluous report requirement of something that has already been studied. \n\nSo, I'd--I'd like to ask unanimous consent to enter all of these reports into the record and ask that the committee \nadopt my amendment and strike section 1650 from the markup. Thanks. I yield back the balance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: Well, let's see. The last one of these things that came up that we were seeking information, I did it in \n90 seconds. Maybe I'll just repeat what I said before. Wasting taxpayer money on rebuilding the entire strategic \ndefense system, that is the ground-based missiles, without understanding all of the implications involved, I--I will \nadmit that we certainly have a command and control issue. And that certainly needs to be upgraded. \n\nBut I'd also--if I read correctly about three weeks ago that there's about a two-year delay now in moving the--this \nsystem forward as a result of some questions that have been raised about some of the underlying issues. Which we \nprobably can't discuss at this point. But why--why do we have a problem with the study? Why do we have a \nproblem that probably cost us, I don't know, maybe a million dollars when we're looking at spending billions upon \nbillions. \n\nThere is a--one of the principal reasons that they want to replace these missiles is that we use a few of them every \nyear to test whether they're actually going to work. And guess what? Year after year after year they work. We don't \nneed to use three of them to test every year. Although we're now using them as decoys for the anti-ballistic missile \nsystem. So, maybe that's a perfect--perfect use of them. But we really need information here. \n\nThis is an--this is a very significant debate about what to do here, when to do it, what is necessary first, what is \nnecessary later, what kind of refurbishment is needed in the various silos. All of those things. So, why are we afraid \nof a study? I'm sorry, that took more than 90 seconds. Took two minutes. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Mitchell. \n\nUNKNOWN: Did you say me? Mr. Chair--oh, sorry. \n\nMITCHELL: I have utmost respect for Mr. Garamendi, but if you'd like I--I mean it's not far for you to walk down \nthere. I can give you the nuclear posture review from 2018. I can walk down--we--we have a really extensive \nnuclear review for the new age. And that's just--too--for public policy. Pretty bipartisan--pretty non-partisan group. \n2017. So, we want to spend more money to tell us the same thing we already know here. I--I'll give them to you. I \nknow you've seen them, I--you've been here a long time. \n\nGARAMENDI: If--would the gentleman yield? \n\nMITCHELL: Of course. \n\n\n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you, sir, very much. I've read those studies. I've read them cover to cover. I've read the \nanalysis. It's the backup. It's the dat--detail behind it. The nuclear posture review is written by the new \nAdministration coming in who was determined to increase the nuclear arsenal of the nation. \n\nThe underlying studies are--are either not mentioned in there, do not justify the conclusions that are based. One of \nthe conclusions in that nuclear posture review is that the United States is willing to use nuclear weapons in \nresponse to about five different categories of attack, including biological attacks, cyber attacks, nuclear attacks, and \nvarious kinds of war issues. I've raised questions about that-- \n\nMITCHELL: --Let me-- \n\nGARAMENDI: --Now, if I might just finish-- \n\nMITCHELL: --Let me claim my time back here in response-- \n\nGARAMENDI: --The underlying studies are not-- \n\nMITCHELL: --Let me claim-- \n\nGARAMENDI: --In that process that you just described. \n\nMITCHELL: As you well know, these studies can't contain the backup that you're seeking in a public forum. You \nreceive, in a classified manner, a great deal of that information. I can't tell you it's exactly what you want for your \nmind, but you--you--you receive that. And somehow, we're ignoring the classified briefs. And I yield the remainder \nof my time to Ms. Cheney. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you very much. I appreciate the importance of the issues that our colleague Mr. Garamendi has \nraised, but that particular study that we're talking about here is--is a study on the ground based strategic deterrent, \nand whether or not it's more cost effective to move forward with that or yet do one more life extension of the \nminuteman three. All of these studies, and they are government studies, they are non-governmental organizations--\nthe whole range non-partisan. \n\nThey all look at that same question. And they all come to the same conclusion. And the conclusion is that it is far \nmore cost effective as well as far more important in terms of meeting our national security requirements, to procure \nthe GBSD. And not do yet one more--attempt to do yet one more life extension to keep the aging minuteman three \non alert. \n\nSo, if--if we really are concerned about taxpayer dollars, and we really are concerned about a situation where we \ncannot delay the continued deployment and the procurement of this important system, we ought to at least \nrecognize this study's been done. Like, let's have the debate, let's have this argument over the issue if that's what \nwe're trying to do. \n\nBut the majority should not use studies to impose additional requirements at cost of additional taxpayer dollars to \navoid saying they don't want to move forward with modernizing the nuclear triad. That's not legitimate, it's not fair. \nWe ought to say the studies are here. We're going to enter them into the record and not force the department to go \nforward with yet-- \n\nSMITH: --Without objections so ordered, by the way-- \n\nCHENEY: --One more study and one more waste of time. And I yield--I yield back to Mr. Mitchell the balance of \ntime. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. And without objection, we'll enter the studies into the record. Mr. Bishop. \n\n\n\nBISHOP: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, you want short speeches. Cheney's right. The report requirement is redundant. \nWe have the information. Heiten was here in March in this very room saying life extension of minuteman three is not \ncost effective. We know the data already. I support her. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion. All right. All those in favor say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the aye's have it and the amendment is adopted. All right. It's now in order to settle En \nBloc package number two. And the chair recognizes Mr. Cooper for the purposes of offering the En Bloc package. \n\nCOOPER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up En Bloc package number two, consisting of \namendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. The clerk will distribute the amendments without objection. The amendments \nare considered as read. The gentleman is recognized to discuss them. \n\nCOOPER: The En Bloc package number two is comprised of the following: amendment number 64 by Ms. Davis \nconcerning DoD resource sharing to assist with natural disasters, amendment 68R1 by Ms. Gabbard regarding a \nreport on the Runit Dome in the Marshall Islands to identify environmental and health related concerns related to \nthe nuclear material located in the dome. \n\nAmendment number 76 by Mr. Cook concerning requirements for preparation to implement a plan for use of allied \nlaunch vehicles. Amendment number 28 by Mr. Conaway, concerning opportunities to leverage commercial, low-\nearth orbit satellite technology capable of delivering direct satellite to broadband cellular technology. Amendment \nnumber 170R1 by Mr. DesJarlais concerning an assessment of China's no first use of nuclear weapons policy. \n\nAmendment number 171R1 by Mr. DesJarlais regarding an amendment to section 1645, which would limit the \nprohibition for a mobile variant of a ground based strategic deterrent missile for--to 10 years. Amendment number \n336R1 by Mr. DesJarlais regarding an increase of $7 million for a lithium processing facility. Amendment number \n391R1 by Mr. Lamborn, which amends DRL concerning directed report language concerning commercial satellites \nfor remote sensing. \n\nAmendment number 417R1 by Ms. Cheney, which amends the directed report language concerning unobligated \nenriched uranium and domestic uranium requirements. Amendment number 428 by Mr. Wilson regarding an \nincrease in $6.5 million for the Savannah River community and regular--regulatory support under Savannah river \nsites. I--that's my reading of the En Bloc amendment. \n\nDAVIS: Okay, thank you. Is there any further discussion on the En Bloc package? Any comments? If no--if not, the \nquestion is on the adoption of the En Bloc package offered by Mr. Cooper. So, any that's in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nDAVIS: Opposed. The ayes have it and the amendment is not--is adopted. And we're not going--we're now going to \nturn--let's see, we're on Mr. Turner. Log 003. For what purpose does the gentleman (INAUDIBLE) issue? \n\nTURNER: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nDAVIS: Would the clerk please distribute the amendment (INAUDIBLE). \n\nUNKNOWN: Ma'am, we can't hear you. I'm sorry. \n\n\n\nDAVIS: Sorry. Dispense with--sorry. Dispense with the reading and we'll move to the Gentleman who--please \nexplain your amendment. Right? Are we good? \n\nTURNER: Thank you, Madam Chair. This is one that I think that we're going to get a fairly full agreement on. This \ncommittee required--well, the last national defense authorization act required a--a test of the SM3 against--a SM3 \nblock 2A against an ICBM class target. \n\nThis provision would cancel that test. This test--this provision has now been provided to the missile defense \nagency. And if you do this, it will cost $121 million of unrecoverable sunk cost and set back the entire testing system \nfor the SM block 3 two years. \n\nNow why would you want to do a test like this against an ICBM? Because you want options to take an ICBM down. \nYou want in mid-course options to--to be able to, besides our ground-based interceptors, to intercept an incoming \nthreat and to take it out. So, this test would verify that. It's already set up. It's already done. The only reason why \nyou'd do this is if you're against missile defense. \n\nThere's no reason to cancel a test that's on its way in and that's going to cost $121 million to--to cancel, and that's \ngoing to set back the entire testing system of this missile for--for two years. And that's what the missile defense \nagency has said. Staff can confirm this. We--we--we shouldn't--certainly shouldn't do harm in this bill. And this one \ndoes harm. \n\nThere's no benefit to the U.S. There's no benefit to us (INAUDIBLE), this is a test. I mean, we're not--we're not \ndeploying something. We're just testing it. We're understanding the knowledge of what it's capable of. So, I would \nask that my fellow members vote for this to save the $121 million, not lose two years in testing, and actually get the \nknowledge of how do we defend this country through missile defense. I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. I'm going to turn to Mr. Carbajal (INAUDIBLE) Gentleman. \n\nCARBAJAL: Thank you, matter--Madam Chairman. I would like to speak in opposition to the amendment and in \nsupport of the Chairman's mark. The provision in the mark would not prohibit a future test but remove the arbiary--\narbitrary date set by Congress to conduct such intercept and require a DLT&E assessment of operationally effective \nand suitable against the threats it was designed to intercept prior to conducting an ICBM test. \n\nSM3 block 2A experience two in-flight failures during developmental operational testing and has only successfully \nengaged one intermediate range ballistic missile, IRBM. Target for which the system was designed to be deployed, \non ships and ashore in Europe. EPAA phase three. This amendment supports the fly before you buy principles, to \nensure that the taxpayers' dollars are being spent on the system that works. \n\nGAO has highlighted the lack of testing against medium to intermediate range threats for which this system was \ndesigned. And the potential of this lack of testing leading to future design issues well into production of interceptors. \nNDA's initial planning would have completed five IRBM intercepts up to this point. Due to several flight test failures \nand test range availability issues, only one has been successfully completed. \n\nFurther DLT&E highlighted in their 2018 annual report that DLT&E considers the FTM29 SM3 block 2A failure to be \nan example of a shortfall in conducting ground testing in an operationally representative way. And an example of a \ndeficiency found in operational testing that should--development testing should have discovered. \n\nSM3 block 2A production is currently on hold by the department due to issues discovered in the redesign kill vehicle \nprogram, for which there is reuse of components between the two interceptors. Madam Chair, I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Okay, thank you. Is there any further debate? Ms. Stefanik. \n\nSTEFANIK: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to reiterate my support for Congressman Turner's amendment. First, I \nwant to touch on the funding issue. The missile defense agency has already expended over $121 million to execute \nthis test. Those funds would not be recovered and would be a sunk cost. So, for the taxpayers, this is $121 million. \n\n\n\nThat's significant. Additionally, regarding the testing gaps, the next opportunity to test an SRBM or IRBM class \ntarget against an SM block 2A is in fiscal year 2021. \n\nSo, this leave a testing gap of two years. And I want to point out that the majority seems to always emphasize the \nneed for operationally realistic test of missile defense assets. And this action artificially and purposefully introduces \na testing gap of two years into MDA's testing mater plan. Additionally, the missile defense review identifies SM \nblock 2A as a potential underlay for our Homeland Defense missile system. \n\nThis test would allow SM3 block 2A to add additional mid-course missile defense capability. So, at a time when our \nonly other mid-course system, GBI, is delayed because of a technical issue with the--with the reentry vehicle, we \nshould be looking for every opportunity we can to increase our mid-course homeland defense capabilities. Not \ndenying those opportunities for protection. \n\nAnd just to respond to my colleague Mr. Carba--Mr. Carbajal's comments. The missile defense agency has told us \nthat they will cancel the test if this language is included. So, I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Turner's \namendment. And I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Any other comments? Any other debate? You on this side, Mr. Bishop? \n\nBISHOP: Thank you, Madam Chair. May I yield to Mr. Turner? \n\nTURNER: I just want to give our new members a translation. Because you're got to think, why would you want to \nsched--to cancel a test that's already scheduled? Why would you want to set back testing for two years? Why would \nyou say that it's had a lack of testing and then cancel a test? \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nIt's because this is really an anti-missile defense provision. I mean, what we want--I think what the American public \nwant--is the ability to have capability that takes down an ICBM. If this test works, there are people who are \nsupporting this amendment that--that don't want that knowledge to ever be known. To ever understand that we \nmight have a capability of doing this. We should test this. This has been planned. And this, by the way, is another \none of those things that's never going to become law. The Senate's never going to allow this test to be cancelled. \n\nThere's no rational reason to schedule--to cancel a test that is scheduled. It's going to cost $121 million of sunk cost \nand a two-year delay. This--this has got only anti-missile defense undercurrents, and you should support this \namendment. Thank you. \n\nDAVIS: Okay. Further comments. See none. If not, the question is on the adoption of the amendment offered by Mr. \nTurner. So many as are in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nDAVIS: Those opposed. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nDAVIS: The no's have it. And amendment is not adopted. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nUNKNOWN: Record a vote, please. \n\nDAVIS: Okay. A roll call vote is ordered. We will call the roll call vote at the end of our consideration on this \nsubcommittee's mark. Okay. We'll now consider the next--log number 390R1. Mr. Lamborn. For what purpose does \nthe gentleman seek recognition? \n\nLAMBORN: I have an amendment at the desk, on the screen. \n\n\n\nDAVIS: Please distribute the amendment. And without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. \nAnd the chair recognizes the gentleman for the purposes of reading his amendment. \n\nLAMBORN: This is actually a very simple amendment; it restores something that the current mark is prohibiting. \nAnd I want us to really think about this. The thing that America has over any potential adversaries is our creativity, \nour technological prowess and ability, our--our asymmetrical advantage is our technological accomplishments as a \nnation. And I'm so disappointed that this amendment showed up--excuse me--this provision showed up--section \n1665--because it prohibits the Missile Defense Agency from even going down the path of exploring and researching \nand--and dev--developing the possibility of a space-based missile intercept layer. \n\nWe've had tremendous progress with directed energy, with neutron particle beams, with those kinds of \ntechnological advanced projects that to tell the Missile Defense Agency they can't even explore those to use \nagainst an adversary in the boost phase of that adversary lobbing a missile at us, I think is really ill advised. \n\nI don't see why we would tell them to not even explore this possibility, when if--if it's not going to work, it's not going \nto happen. If it would work, we want it to happen. We'd love to have a space-based defensive capability like this. \nSo, I would ask that we adopt this amendment and restore what we did two years ago. \n\nWe put this language in two years ago, and in a spirit of being helpful to my colleagues, two of my democratic \ncolleagues voted for this, two years ago, Mr. Garamendi and Mr. Norcross. So, I would hope that they would be \nconsistent and support it again this time. So, I would ask for the support of this amendment and that we restore \nwhat 1665 had prohibited MDA from doing. Yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: I'd like to speak in opposition to the amendment. For, especially new members of the committee, the \ntechnology we're really talking about here is called neutral particle beam. That was pretty thoroughly explored in the \n1990s and largely abandoned. Right now, it happens to have one or two advocates in the Pentagon. And--you \nknow--I hope like the gentleman from Colorado does that--you know--all technologies work, but some are more \nlikely to work than others. \n\nI apologize because the amendment is awkwardly worded, talking about development of space-based ballistic \nmissile to intercept layer--you know--only--it's really about neutral particle beam. And this request for $34 million \nwould essentially be a wild goose chase. Right now, it's a science and technology project at Los Alamos. It's not \neven a program of record. \n\nFolks I've talked to in the community--and I've asked virtually everybody about this in hearings we've had this year--\nthey kind of roll their eyes when they hear about neutral particle beam because it seems to be the pet project of one \nor two people in the Pentagon, not a real thing that the scientists think has a real opportunity to work. So, I'm not \nagainst pet--pet projects and one in a thousand might work, but it just seems like this is not as important a priority \nfor the Missile Defense Agency as many other things. \n\nI shouldn't have to remind this committee that the redesigned kill vehicle--it should be their number one priority. \nThey are making us suffer an unwarranted two-year delay because of an engineering series of mistakes that they \nmade in designing that absolutely essential vehicle. And to siphon off $34 million so that somebody can play with \ntoys in the Pentagon seems to me to be a little bit of a mistaken priority. So, I would urge opposition to the \namendment. \n\nDAVIS: Further debate? Mr.--Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: Okay. This is about knowledge. This is about research; this is about development. We all advocate for \nresearch and development and knowledge. Now, I just wrote down the words that Mr. Cooper was saying, \"Play \nwith toys\". \"Folks I talked to\". \"This is about particle beams\". Alright, I'm going to read you what this says. None of \nthe particle beam language is in there. \n\n\n\nIt says, \"None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2020 or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2020 for the Missile Defense Agency may be obligated or \nexpended to develop a space-based ballistic missile interceptor layer to the ballistic missile defense system with \ncapability that is only able to be deployed in space.\" \n\nNow, none of us expect we're deploying anything in 2020. Nobody is expecting that we have anything that we're \ngoing to be sending up. This is all research and development. There's no words on particle beam. He says this is \nabout--this is about a, the word a. It says a. That means any; you're doing none. And I can't imagine how anybody \non this committee would say that for research and development, I don't want the United States to have any of this \nknowledge. \n\nBy the way--you know--this is how we got in--you know, we're all looking at the hypersonic issue and how we're--\nwe're being passed by Russia and China. And, we were way ahead, and we paused. And it's the same thing. How \nis it that we could ever say, \"Yeah, I--I don't want anybody working on that. I don't want to know that.\" So, you \nshould vote this down because it is--it does not say what Mr. Cooper said it did. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Any further comments? You know, one of the--the issues I think that--that we run up against in \nthis is that when we looked at some these in, not exactly isolation because we obviously are looking at a host of \ndifferent issues, but part of the difficulty is--is really seeing, what else is going on and where else can we actually \nput our efforts, put our focus? \n\nAnd I think our concern is that this is not doing that. You know, this is not putting it in--in the context, that's so \ncritical here. And so, you know, I know that there's--they're still more concerned about it. Further debate? \n\nTHORNBERRY: Madam Chair. \n\nDAVIS: Mr. Thornberry. And we're not-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: I--I--I realize, since March 23rd, 1983, there has been a strain of thought in this country opposed to \nmissile defense. I realize that there has been a consistent refrain that it will never work. That we shouldn't try it \nbecause it will be provocative, that--that it's--it's a pet science project. I--I would hope that the success we've had, \nas well as the evolution of the threat--such as from North Korea--would have dispelled such lines of thought. \n\nAnd I'm--I'm--I'm sitting here listening to the last two amendments; one was we shouldn't even have a test of this \nmissile. This one is we should not even explore whether space-based missile defense layer make sense. I--I think \nthat the American people expect us to promote--certainly allow or promote the Defense Department to defend this \ncountry from missile threats. And to not test, to not explore, seems contrary to what they expect us to do in this very \nserious area where missiles are proliferating and the threats are growing. \n\nSo, I just, again, it does not make sense to me that we would want to dismiss out of hand a test or an exploration of \na--of a space-based missile defense layer, because I think the American people expect us to be able to defend from \nthe country. And doing so requires the sort of testing and research in these areas among others that can help us do \nthat. I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Any other comments over here? OK, Mr. Wittman? \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I wanted to yield my time to Mr. Lamborn. \n\nLAMBORN: I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'll just make this brief. Mr. Cooper, I have all the respect for your \nabilities as a chairman and you're a bright and intelligent guy. I would like you to consider with me that we as a \ncountry can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can pursue multiple lines of technological possibilities at the \nsame time. Now, if it--if it was true that cancelling this out and taking that money and putting it in another program \nautomatically translated into that other program being successful, then--then I would agree with you. \n\nBut cancelling this program doesn't mean that the other program you're concerned about, the re-entry--re-entry \nvehicle is going to be successful. You know--that--that's a separate issue. And we shouldn't conflate the two. I think \n\n\n\nwe as a country have the ability and we have the responsibility and the opportunity to--to pursue different kinds of \ntechnological possibilities. And to not even say we can ever even go attempt that is wrong as a country. I--I--I would \nhope you would agree with that. I yield--I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Would that gentleman yield? \n\nLAMBORN: Mr. Wittman's time. It's Mr. Wittman's time. \n\nWITTMAN: Madam Chairman, I yield my time back. \n\nDAVIS: Gentleman has time, he can yield. \n\nCOOPER: I have the highest regard for the gentleman from Colorado and I particularly want to congratulate him \nbecause even though he's not a member of the subcommittee, he has better attendance than many of the members \nof the sub-committee. You care passionately about these issues and I share your concern for science. In fact, I'd \nlike to invite you to a Washington event we've had for years here, the Golden Goose Awards. In which we \ncelebrate, nationally and internationally, the sometimes unexpected benefits of government-funded research. \n\nLAMBORN: I'm--I'm there. \n\nCOOPER: It's amazing. Well, we've actually had difficulty with some folks. You may want to talk to Randy \n(INAUDIBLE) and folks like that. We've had difficulty getting folks from your side of the aisle to help us with that \nbecause it is amazing what research can produce. And I am as pro-science as anybody in Congress, maybe as \nanybody in America. \n\nI hope and pray this works. But from the witnesses I've talked to on sub-committee, who give me these eye rolls, it \njust seems like of all the areas we could explore, this is not one of the more productive ones. And maybe they're all \nwrong, but we have to prioritize on this committee. And I just think the evidence so far at least is that this is more of \na science fair project than it is something that's likely to help us with missile defense. \n\nI am for missile defense. I want to fund it in a way that it will work, you know. And let's--let's work on that together. I \nthink we can do that. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. There's further debate on the question, Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank you. I'll be real brief. We know the Russians and Chinese are working overtime to develop anti-\nballistic missile capability. If a space layer defense is possible, I guarantee you, they're going to go down that path \nand try to field it. \n\nWe don't want this to become like hypersonic weapons where China gets a big advantage on us, and we have to \ncatch up. I think it's worthy of doing research to know what is the art of the possible. We do not want to be left \nbehind here. \n\nRussia and China put so much more energy on this than we do. We can't afford to be left behind. So, I think it's--\nit's--we owe more effort into this research area to see what's--what's possible. Thank you, I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Bacon. And--and I want to just take the prerogative and turn to the staff, I mean, is there \nany sense of cost factors that we're talking about in this regard? \n\nVASTOLA: Ma'am, the only thing in the budget for 20 right now is neutral particle beam that would fall under this \nprovision, and that was $34 million that they requested. The test bed, I think, is around $200 million just for that \ncomponent. There are no costs for the full up system at this point. \n\nDAVIS: So, $200 million-- \n\nVASTOLA: --Approximately for the test bed, correct. \n\n\n\nDAVIS: Okay. Not a small amount of change. \n\nVASTOLA: Correct. \n\nDAVIS: This is not for the study, but you're talking about the-- \n\nVASTOLA: --Correct, it would be for the test bed. Correct, Ma'am. \n\nDAVIS: Okay, thank you. Any more discussion? Okay. Then the question is on the adoption--Mr. Moulton? \n\nMOULTON: I just want to clarify, are we talking about the cost of studying this, or are we talking about the cost of \nimplementing it? \n\nVASTOLA: In 2020, there's $34 million to begin development of a test bed that will be deployed by 2023. So, it is \nnot a study at this point. It is development money for the actual test bed for our neutral particle beam. \n\nSMITH: Would the gentleman yield? \n\nTURNER: This provision though is so broad that it bans everything, right? This is not a line item that's removed. \nThis is everything. Anything that anybody considers, anything that anybody wants to do or redirect funds to or has \nin their budget, they are prohibited from doing anything in this category. \n\nVASTOLA: The only--the clarification I--. \n\nTURNER: --Just say correct, because you know it's correct. \n\nVASTOLA: The only--the provision states that it has to only be deployed--with possibilities to be deployed in space. \n\nTURNER: Right, but it--it said absolute prohibition. This is not a line item, it's not like you want into the budget and \nsaid, \"This line item is limited.\" It is an absolute prohibition that no one can go into their lab and consider anything \nwith respect to this. Prohibition. Thank you-- \n\nVASTOLA: --If it can only be deployed-- \n\nTURNER: --Thank you for yielding your time. I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Can I--can I follow up with your question, Mr. Turner then. I mean, is--is that language that is typically used \nin this situation--that it would be fully prohibited? \n\nVASTOLA: The way the language is written, it is a prohibition for any development of a technology that can only be \ndeployed in space. That does not apply to other technologies that could be deployed on things such as UAVs, \naircrafts, sea-based or land-based. \n\nTURNER: But it's--it's complete. It's not just a line item on a specific development project. It is complete. \n\nVASTOLA: Correct. \n\nDAVIS: Okay, because I want to be sure everybody is understanding that. Am I hearing that from everyone at the \ntable that that's the understanding, is that correct? Okay. \n\nUNKNOWN: Madam Chairwoman-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Yes, Ma'am, I concur with that. \n\nDAVIS: Okay. Thank you very much; appreciate it. And I'll--And I'll be perfectly honest, I'm not still exactly sure \nwhere that fits into what we already are working on in an aggressive way versus this program. \n\nGARAMENDI: Madam Chair. \n\n\n\nDAVIS: Yes, Mr. Chairman. \n\nGARAMENDI: As I understood this issue in its intention, it was what we often use around here, 'fly before you buy'. \nThat is that the system is developed, that it's--it's pretty clear that it will work, that its purpose will be achieved. My \nunderstanding of the way in which this was intended was that we would not move to the deployment until such time \nas we had assurances that there was a probability--or, a high probability that it would work. \n\nThe current discussion here seems to indicate something different. And it seems to me that Mr. Turner would agree, \nwe ought not spend a whole lot of money on building a system that we're not sure would work. But we ought to \nmove in stages. In other words, fly it before you buy it. \n\n(AUDIO GAP) \n\n--Have a high assurance that it's going to work before we deploy. \n\nTURNER: Ma'am, if I could have some of your time. This isn't about that. This is a complete prohibition against \nanybody doing any research and development, anything with respect to any portion of missile defense that will be \ndeployed in space. That's what we're debating. \n\nGARAMENDI: I understand what you're saying, I understand what you're saying--reclaiming my time--I understand \nwhat you're saying. I also understood the description that the staff has given us, which was different than my \nunderstanding of what was intended by this amendment. \n\nNow, I think what we might do here, and if Mr. Turner--or excuse me-- \n\nDAVIS: --Mr. Lamborn-- \n\nGARAMENDI: --Mr. Lamborn, the author of the amendment would consider this is that, to proceed with the \nengineering, the science, to the point that we have some reasonable assurance that the thing's going to work--and \nyou can go through the testing process--but don't move to the deployment until we have some assurance that this \nthing's going to work. \n\nSo, perhaps what we need to do here is to redesign-- \n\nTURNER: --Mr. Garamendi, just one thing-- \n\nGARAMENDI: --The foundation-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Reclaim-- \n\nTURNER: --Just a one-year period. You're for Mr. Lamborn's amendment because that's not--is it--that would have-\n-everything that you're concerned about is like another year, another request. This is just this request and--and--and \nthis--this ban. No one is deploying anything. And this only applies in--in this year, but it stops everything. So, you're-\n-you're actually speaking in favor of his amendment which I am too. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Turner. And to be quite honest, I've also--Mr. Moulton, reclaiming your time. \n\nMOULTON: I actually never yielded my time and this is actually why I-- \n\nDAVIS: --Reclaiming your time or giving up your time--. \n\nMOULTON: --Because I'm not sure we quite understand what's going on here. But I actually agree with both Mr. \nGaramendi and Mr. Turner, and would like to support the amendment because I don't think we should cancel all \nresearch and development on this technology. \n\nDAVIS: So, now that the chairman has-- \n\n\n\nMOULTON: --I do yield back-- \n\nDAVIS: --We're going to-- \n\nUNKNOWN: --Madam Chair-- \n\nDAVIS: --We're going to give it back to him. But it sounds to me like there is enough question that maybe we don't \nwant to move, perhaps, in the language that we have right here and come back to this in a little bit. \n\nTURNER: If--if I could, and sorry Mr. Chairman. You moved in here-- \n\nSMITH: --I'm sorry--before we keep going here, we've got like five people talking. Who--whose time is it at the \nmoment? \n\nGARAMENDI: Mad--Mr. Chairman, it's mine. \n\nSMITH: It's Mr. Garamendi's time. Mr. Garamendi, it is your time. Do you wish to speak or yield to somebody? \n\nGARAMENDI: Well, I've yielded to several people unknowingly, but I would like to do this. I think that there's a need \nto--to hold this for a while to, I think, follow what the--what was suggested and that is, let's see if we can work out \nsome language here that achieves the goal without flying before we buy or buying before we fly. That we continue \nthe research but not kill the project. \n\nSMITH: Okay, got it. Hold on just a second. This is--it's Mr. Lamborn's amendment. So-- \n\nTURNER: --I want to make that clarification, Mr. Chairman, if I might for just a second just to help clarify some \nthings. The language that we're all struggling with is the language that's in the bill, not the language that's in the \namendment. The amendment strikes the language in the bill. \n\nSMITH: Got it. \n\nTURNER: So, if--if we hold the amendment, it doesn't help us with the language, it's in the bill. We need to pursue \nwith Mr. Lamborn's amendment. \n\nSMITH: Well, if I-- \n\nTURNER: --At your discretion--. \n\nSMITH: --Yeah, understood. You know, the possibility here is that we are able to rework the underlying language in \na way that is agreeable to everybody as opposed to strike it. Now if that's not possible, that's cool. But I believe \nwhat Mr. Garamendi is saying is that, could we rework this in a way that makes the underlying theme acceptable \ninstead of striking it. But Mr. Lamborn it-- \n\n[*]SMITH: is the possibility here is that we are able to rework the underlying language in a way that is agreeable to \neverybody as opposed to strike it. Now if that's not possible, that's cool. But I believe what Mr. Garamendi is saying \nis that could we rework this in a way that makes the underlying thing acceptable instead of striking it. But Mr. \nLamborn, it is your amendment. So, if you want to do that, you may. If you don't, you don't have to. We can proceed \non your amendment. \n\nLAMBORN: If the gentleman would yield, I'd like to propose a possible solution and that is to go with my \namendment for now so that funding is in place. However, we discuss further before this hits the floor whether or not \nwe want to clarify that we're not talking about deployment of it. Nothing is going to be deployed. It's strictly research \nand development. In fact, nothing is ready for deployment. I mean that's not even really an issue. And that's what \nmy amendment is seeking to accomplish right now is we continue with the research and development. \n\nGARAMENDI: If I might, Mr. Chairman-- \n\n\n\nSMITH: Mr. Garamendi you still have a little time here mainly because they keep stopping the clock for this. I don't \nfully understand but. \n\nGARAMENDI: Well the clock stopped, and I thought it was -- anyway, let me just make this very, very quick. Let's \ndo something that creates clarity here. We're very close to an agreement here. The research, the development, \nthat's not a problem. The deployment would be. By striking all of the language we might wind up with deployment. \nLet's just write something that's very clear that says continue with the research and the development, hold the \ndeployment until such time as there's whatever would work. \n\nSMITH: Would that language be agreeable to you? \n\nLAMBORN: It would be agreeable to me. Would staff help me to do that before we finish out tonight? \n\nSMITH: Yeah and you do not have to withdraw your amendment. You can just put it in (INAUDIBLE) and if we can \nwork out this language then we can roll it into non clock-- \n\nLAMBORN: In the full committee portion-- \n\nSMITH: --in the full-- \n\nLAMBORN: --of our-- \n\nSMITH: Yes.  \n\nLAMBORN: Thank you. \n\nSMITH: Alright. We are now on -- we just got rid of it. It's now an order to consider log 396R1. For what purpose is \nthe gentlewoman from Wyoming seek recognition? \n\nCHENEY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. Hearing no objections, we'll dispense with the reading and the \ngentlelady is recognized for five minutes. \n\nCHENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks information from the department helping \nto make sure that the committee is able to ensure that any extension of the New Start Treaty would reflect the \nreality of the threats that we face in the world today. In the decade since President Obama's New Start Treaty was \nratified, the world has grown more dangerous. And my amendment doesn't say we should not extend New Start. It's \nreally an effort to make sure that this arms-controlled treaty, like all should, contribute to the security of the nation \nby addressing the real threats we face. So, the amendment seeks information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nasks for the chairman to report to the committee on two things. First, the Russia and China's expanding inventory of \nstrategic and non-strategic weapon systems and, secondly, the impacts on our national security if an extension or a \nsuccessor agreement to New Start weren't trilateral, including China, the United States and Russia and also the \nimpact on our security if such an extension did not include all strategic, non-strategic nuclear capable weapons \nsystems. Again, reflecting the reality of what we've seen the Russians do in terms of the expansion of their \ncapabilities during the period of the New Start Treaty and also what we've seen China do because they are not \nparty to New Start, not party to any limitations. So, my amendment simply would ask for information to help the \ncommittee ensure that we're able to make an educated informed assessment about whether or not any extension of \nthe New Start Treaty actually serve to contribute to the security of the nation. So, I would urge my colleagues to \naccept, to adopt the amendment and with that I yield back the balance of my time. \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Alright. I need to understand what this amendment does precisely. If I'm reading this correctly, and there's \npretty good chance that I'm not, that this basically would require us to go back in and renegotiate New Start, but we \nhave to include the Chinese and the Russians in that discussion. If I'm understanding this correctly. \n\n\n\nCHENEY: Mr. Chairman-- \n\nSMITH: And the key question for me on this is does this mean basically that the Start Treaty or the New Start \nTreaty that we have right now under this amendment would be allowed to simply go away and would have to be \nreplaced by this triparty agreement? Ms. Cheney, I'll give you a crack at explaining exactly what your amendment \ndoes here because I believe the underlying language in our bill is urging them to not dump the New Start Treaty, \nwhen is it, like 2020, something like that when it's ready to go out. Can you clarify for me what the status of the New \nStart Treaty is? \n\nUNKNOWN: Expires in 2021. \n\nSMITH: Expires in 2021. So, our underlying language in the bill says please renew it basically. Or it says something \ndifferent. Tell me what it says. \n\nUNKNOWN: We have an item of special interest on the-- \n\nSMITH: Microphone.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, we have an item of special interest that will be just commenting on New Start but there's no bill \nlanguage or-- \n\nSMITH: Okay.  So, our language basically says keep New Start. \n\nUNKNOWN: It's positive language about New Start. \n\nSMITH: Okay. \n\nUNKNOWN: It doesn't require-- \n\nSMITH: And your language says what? \n\nCHENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman for the crack at explaining the amendment. I appreciate that. My language \nsimply says report language. It simply says that the chairman and the Joint Chiefs should report to the committee \non whether or not -- first of all, give us an assessment of the overall -- the inventory of strategic and non-strategic \nnuclear weapon systems both Russia and China possess and, secondly, give us an assessment on whether or not \nan extension of New Start that does not include China has a positive or negative impact on America's security. Ms. \nChairman, I see from your face you're not pleased with this language. But it also says that there would be an \nexpanded arrangement that would simply include all strategic and non-strategic nuclear capable weapon systems. \nMr. Chairman, my amendment is simply and effort to make sure-- \n\nSMITH: Reclaiming my time. \n\nCHENEY: Actually, it's my time, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: No, actually you stopped and then I started and then I yielded to you. So, it's my time. \n\nCHENEY: It's my amendment. \n\nSMITH: Is this a substitute amendment? Does it strike the underlying language? \n\nCHENEY: No, Mr. Chairman, it does not. \n\nSMITH: It's an initial. Okay. That's helpful. Mr. Garamendi? \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I have the next amendment on the same subject. I had not had a chance \nto see Ms. Cheney's amendment. Her amendment in some way -- excuse me, Mr. Bacon. I'd like to communicate \nwith Mr. Cheney here for a moment. A major part of my amendment is a report requirement. It goes further than \n\n\n\nyours, Ms. Cheney. And it goes not as far. It goes further in some of the specifics that are asked for. For example, a \ncurrent status of the Russian nuclear forces and then an impact -- and analysis if New Start is not extended what is \nlikely -- what are the Russians likely to do? What are the potential? Similarly, it would assess our own \ncircumstances. What would we then do in response? In other words, the full description. It does not, however, my \namendment does not, however, deal with the Chinese. Which I think you're correctly bringing about is an important \npoint. The New Start does not in any way affect China at all as does the INF which has been discussed extensively \nby this committee. I also go further on the -- in my analysis. I believe I do not have a waiver on my amendment from \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. If that is the case, I was simply going to talk about it and withdraw. I would like to \nwork with you on expanding the language in your amendment to include the report language, the study language \nthat is in mind that is more fulsome with regard to Russia and the United States and bring into that report the work \nthat you have suggested with regard to China. \n\nSMITH: Would the gentleman yield? \n\nGARAMENDI: And yes, I would happy to yield. \n\nSMITH: What you're talking about I don't think we can do. You're talking about amending Ms. Cheney's amendment \nwith some of your language?  \n\nGARAMENDI: Well, that would be the ideal from my point of view, but I do understand that that would be difficult to \nachieve when I'm really looking at here is when we go to the floor and we've tried to work this out-- \n\nSMITH: Okay. Alright. Go to the floor. Alright. \n\nGARAMENDI: --so that the appropriate issues that Ms. Cheney is raising, and I believe the appropriate issues that \nI'm raising are all brought to bear. \n\nSMITH: If the gentleman would yield again, so we're going to have to offer and withdraw your amendment up next.  \nI mean if you're simply asking the chairman Joint Chief Staff to evaluate the value of New Start vis-a-vis China, \nwhatever he says we don't necessarily have to take his word for it. So, it informs us a little bit, but it doesn't mean \nthat we have to say wow there's no point in having New Start just because this guy thinks that it would be more \nimportant to have the Chinese involved in it. I don't see the harm in this personally. So, I'm willing to accept it unless \nthere are strenuous objections from anybody. \n\nGARAMENDI: If I might just ad one point? \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nGARAMENDI: Much of what Mr. Cooper and I have talked about in the last three amendments, four amendments \nhave spoken to General Hayden. And I would just want to put this on the record that two things.  First in the nuclear \nposture review it says that New Start's really important. Having heard the nuclear posture because you bring it up \nseveral times and in February of this year General Hayden said New Start is really important. That's a paraphrase \nof the lengthy statement he made in support of New Start. So, I just want to bring General Hayden and the nuclear \nposture review back to support my position this time. With that, I yield. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. By the way, General Hayden and the exact quote from him is that the New Start Treaty is \nunbelievably important to me. Is there further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Waltz? \n\nWALTZ: Mr. Chairman, in support of Ms. Cheney's amendment, the Chinese nuclear missile arsenal or the Chinese \nmissile arsenal is now the largest in the world. And they have built that arsenal while the United States and Russia \nhave limited themselves under Start and limited ourselves under INF. So, I certainly think it would be responsible \nand reasonable to have the Pentagon come back to us and have the chairman come back to us with how the \nChinese fit into a New Start type arrangement and certainly support Ms. Cheney's amendment. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Moulton? \n\n\n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I would just like to register my support for studying this as well. I think we could benefit \nfrom understanding what the implications are going forward. And I think it's a reasonable responsibility for us to \ngather that information. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. As they say, don't sell past the close. Or take yes for an answer. Pick your favorite analogy. All \nthose in favor of the amendment will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed?  Amendment is adopted. Mr. Garamendi, you are next. But you've already spoken on it. So, now \nyou just need to do the withdraw part. \n\nGARAMENDI: Three seconds.  Withdraw my amendment. \n\nSMITH: Alright. But then I got to go through the whole rigmarole of recognizing you for the amendment. So, we'll go \nahead and do that. Next up is log number 165. For what purpose is this, Mr. Garamendi, seek recognition? \n\nGARAMENDI: My amendment, sir.  \n\nSMITH: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nGARAMENDI: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Okay. The clerk will distribute the amendment. Hearing no objection, we'll dispense with the reading. Mr. \nGaramendi? \n\nGARAMENDI: My amendment deals with the issue just before, the New Start Treaty. It is a plea to continue the \nNew Start Treaty, providing various reasons for it. I want to work with Ms. Cheney on the study that her amendment \nwhich apparently is going to be in the final mark and I'm about to walk down with her, take down to her how she \nmight improve her study. With that I withdraw my amendment. \n\nSMITH: Alright. Okay. We are now moving onto the recorded votes that came in the start forces mark and it is -- it \nwould be helpful and we always -- I know they put the numbers up there but it would helpful if the staff would just \nquickly just read the official description of what the amendment does so members know what happens. So, first of \nall, how many amendments do we have coming up for votes? \n\nUNKNOWN: Four recorded votes. \n\nSMITH: Alright. And so, we've got first up Cheney 406 which does what exactly? This would be -- well tell me what \nit is so everyone knows. I'm not guessing. \n\nUNKNOWN: It strikes the prohibition on deploying low yield. \n\nSMITH: Low yield (INAUDIBLE). \n\nUNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) \n\nSMITH: Alright. And-- \n\nUNKNOWN: But I think there are more than that.  \n\nSMITH: More than four? \n\nUNKNOWN: Right because you've got the-- \n\nSMITH: What one do you think we-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Let me just check for just a second. We can just pause.  \n\n\n\nSMITH: Those are the four that were asked for I'm reasonably certain. Those were a couple that weren't asked for \nthat-- \n\nUNKNOWN: It's the other one that we refer the others to full committee. It's okay. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Alright.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Alright. \n\nSMITH: Alright. So, we're going to start with 406. Alright. We postponed proceedings on this. We're not going to \nproceed on it. So, we have a vote on 406. The clerk will call the role. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith? \n\nSMITH: No. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith votes no. Mr. Thornberry? \n\nTHORNBERRY: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Thornberry votes aye.

Mr. Chairman, on this vote the ayes are 29, the no's are 24. \n\nSMITH: The subcommittee mark is adopted.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman? Parliamentary inquiry? \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Larsen told me that if I had said hell no that would account as a double vote. Is that accurate? \n\nSMITH: It's about as accurate as most things Mr. Larsen will tell you. So, take that for what it's worth. So, alright. \nSecond to regroup here as we move onto the next section. The committee will now consider the chairman's mark \npursuant to committee Rule 17 in the consultation with the ranking member we will postpone recorded votes on \namendments until the conclusion of our debate. Alright. And now it's my job to make an opening statement. So, I \nmade the opening statement about 12 hours ago. Don't feel the need to repeat it at great length except to say this, I \nthink we've had very good debate this point and clearly you can see the couple of areas where we disagree. But \nagain, I would remind members this is a very long bill and at this point now we're deeply into debate and I can say \nwith some confidence that we're in agreement on about 98 percent of it. And there are enormously important parts \nto this mark including, I will emphasize, if we don't pass our bill the troops do not get their 3.1 percent pay raise. \nWe've discussed a little bit on the readiness part, the work that we have done to try to address the housing crisis \nand concerns. Sea Power Subcommittee funds important new ships and submarines. We've got the Tack Air mark \nsupports a large number of issues and the readiness mark helps keep us moving forward on readiness. And it is \nimportant to point out the amount of progress we've made from where we were three four years ago in terms of the \nnumber of our units in all of our services that are now ready compared to where they were before. We need to keep \nbuilding on that progress. And I know we're going to have a debate later on about 733 versus 750. But it's worth \nnoting that 733 by a reasonably comfortable margin is the largest defense budget we will have ever passed in \nCongress and is a significant improvement on where we were before we got the budget agreement, the caps deal \nfor 2018 and 2019 where we are now. So, we'll have that debate but overall, I will again emphasize how important it \nis that we pass this bill. There are hundreds of provisions in here that are crucially important to members of this \ncommittee and to the Department of Defense and to the men and women who serve to enable them to continue to \ndo their job. And we're going to have a little bit of debate here on full committee amendments. Once we get through \nthat, I would strongly urge all members to support the full committee mark and with that I will yield to Mr. Thornberry \nfor any opening statement he has. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I would just say I agree. It's very important that we pass this bill. It's even more \nimportant that we pass a good bill. And I think we have lots of significant issues ahead of us in the full committee \nportion and I hope that this bill gets better as the night goes on. And I'll save the rest of the debates until the \nappropriate time. \n\nSMITH: Alright. And we are rolling through a lot of amendments. And the first amendment up on the board is log \n45R1. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from Texas seek recognition, Ms. Escobar? \n\nESCOBAR: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: It's right at the top, I think. Isn't it?  Do you have the wrong list? Sorry. WE can pause for just a second. I \nthink we may have differing lists. Do you not have Ms. Escobar at the top of our...  We'll go ahead but can we get \nMr. Thornberry an updated version of the tracker here so we're on the same page? The clerk will distribute the \namendment. Without objection reading of the amendment is waived and the gentlelady is recognized for five \nminutes. \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have in my hand the Department of Defense's climate study which was \npublished in January. And that showed a majority of mission critical bases that they reviewed to be threatened by \n\n\n\nclimate change. Indeed, it is something that we discussed at length in our committee and subcommittee. That study \nlacked some required details which I am very grateful will be addressed elsewhere in this bill. Even in its current \nstate the study does confirm that the risk is real and prevalent and demands a systematic and urgent response. \nThis year several of our military installations struggle to recover from the damages caused by last year's hurricanes \nand floods. Normal work was disrupted, and service members were left trying to pick up the pieces. Much of this \ncould have been avoided with better planning and it is our oversight responsibility to make sure that happens \nbecause we know climate change impacts our readiness and we have seen that. My amendment would simply \nrequire the department to standardize how it measures climate related risks to military assets. The Department of \nDefense is free to develop a tool that makes sense for them. And it will allow installation managers and planners to \nbetter prioritize resources. It will protect taxpayer investments and it will ensure readiness. So that we can avoid \nthese devastating impacts to installations and disruptions to the work of our military in the future. The tools would \nprovide a common measure for how climate change impacts military networks, systems, installations, facilities and \nother assets. And it would push us to get serious about what the impacts to operational plans and capabilities are \nso that we can meet this threat head on. By getting clear about the relative needs and the specific impacts, we will \nbe able to effectively counter the threat posed by changing and extreme weather. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis very common-sense amendment and before I yield back, I want to wish a very happy birthday to my legislative \ndirector, Jacqueline whose in the audience and spending her birthday in NDAA markup fun. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: And we're not going to sing. Thought about it for a second there but I think that would be a bad precedent. \nSo, is there further discussion on the amendment? Hearing none, all-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry.  Yes. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Could we just hold on for just a second? \n\nSMITH: Sure. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Since we just rearranged all the amendments, we're kind of scrambling to see what's-- \n\nSMITH: I-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: Just hold on for a second. \n\nSMITH: I will.  I had asked to do that and that we would wait until you got there. So yeah happy to do that. Yes. \n\nTHORNBERRY: It's just a completely different order. \n\nSMITH: Okay.  Alright. I believe we are ready. Is there further discussion on Ms. Escobar's amendment? Hearing \nnone, all those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: The ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. And if we could get up on the screen there the order so that \nall members know what's coming here. We've got a lot of amendments in the full committee mark and it's going to \nbe good to give members a warning as to what's coming. It will adjust at some point. It is now in order to consider \nlog 500. For what purpose does the gentleman from Colorado seek recognition? \n\nLAMBORN: I have an amendment on the desk and on the screen, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Okay. The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection reading of the amendment will be \ndispensed with the gentleman as recognized to discuss his amendment. \n\n\n\nLAMBORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The amendment before you requires the secretary of defense to report on \nthe feasibility and cost for the Department of Defense to achieve net zero greenhouse emissions as would be \nrequired if the green new deal -- I'll call that H Res 109 were enacted into law. For those who say H Res 109 will \nnever become law because it is totally impractical and we shouldn't spend time on it, I will point out that we have \nmany candidates for president that are making it part of the national debate. 17 of them having endorsed the green \nnew deal. We have members of this committee that have endorsed H Res 109. So, I think it's worth getting a \nreport from the Department of Defense on how energy and climate policy in that resolution would interplay with \nnational security. What would it actually mean to achieve net zero emissions and make carbon -- America carbon \nneutral in 11 years? Could the Department of Defense even do this? What would be the impact to the military's \nability to implement the national defense strategy? And how much would this cost? We should have answers to \nthese questions. So, that's what this amendment would do. For context, renewable energy currently accounts for 17 \npercent of domestic energy production. Within this 17 percent wind accounts for less than 7 percent and solar for \nless than 2 percent. And besides that, 17 percent on renewables, nuclear power accounts for 19.3 percent and \nfossil fuels provide 63.5 percent. Don't get me wrong. I think we most of us support clean energy but not if it \nundermines our economy and makes our national defense vulnerable. From 2005 to 2017 the United States cut \nCO2 emissions by 14 percent. During that same period China increased theirs by 70 percent. So, I personally \nbelieve that we must push the military to continuously improve both institutional and operation energy efficiency. It's \ngood for the environment. It's good for our taxpayers and its' good for national security. For example, every fuel \nconvoy that we take off of a road in combat reduces risk to troops, reduces sustainment and reduces the demand \nfor strategic lift. So, I ask that members support this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I recognize myself. The main problem, I don't really have a problem with the net zero emissions \npart of this. The problem with you know examining what implementing the green new deal will have effect on \nmilitary readiness, is the green new deal is a sense of Congress. It's not a piece of legislation. It does not specify \nany particular action. It sets the goal of creating legislation that can get us to the place that Mr. Lamborn just \ndescribed. So, there's really nothing for the Department of Defense to analyze. It doesn't say you have to do this, or \nyou have to do that. The purpose of the green new deal is to set the stage for legislation to be introduced. And if \nthat legislation is introduced, it will be considered. So that's one problem and one reason I oppose the amendment. \nThe second thing is when it comes to fossil fuels, and we've had this debate in this committee many, many times, \nMr. Conaway and I usually go back and forth on this, if you simply look at it, what's the cheapest way to do it right \nnow? And if that's the only analysis well fossil fuels are going to win every single time. Because we've been \nsubsidizing the hell out of them for about 175 years. They have a massive infrastructure built to support them. And \nthat's where we're going to go. But the point is we need to make the investment so that we're not dependent upon \nfossil fuels. And we can study the impact of being dependent on fossil fuels and what that on readiness as well. If \nyou believe in climate change, if you believe that digging up things from below the ground and burning them, as we \ndo with fossil fuels, is leading towards the possible extension of extinction of the planet, not to mention all kinds of \ndifferent bad impacts on our national security. We've seen the extreme weather events. We've seen you know \nplaces that are now bases that are now more under water than they used to be. If you believe in all that, we've got \nto take steps to try to stop that from happening. And if it's a zero-sum game, well if it's cheaper, we're not going to \nmake the change then we are dooming ourselves to a bad future. Now if you don't believe in climate change, you \ndon't believe all that is going to happen, okay. That's a debate. But I do believe that climate change is a grave \nnational threat that we need to address and a threat to us, a threat to our national security in a whole series of \nways. So, a study like this would basically say don't' address it. Think short term, not long term. What gets us \nthrough the day as opposed to what enables us to maintain life on the planet. So, I don't think this is a good idea. \nAnd I oppose the amendment. Further discussion? Mr. Garamendi?  I'm sorry. If you want recognition you got to \njust say -- you look at me like yeah. If you want to call on me it's okay. \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, if I might? I'll try to do this quickly. This would fall within the work of the readiness \nsubcommittee. I want to really commend Mr. Lamborn for the work that he did in this subcommittee to deal with \nmuch of what he's asking to be done here. The HR109 has been referred to 11 committees in the House. I suppose \nif it were referred to this committee, we would be taking it up next year or as soon as he finished the work tonight. \nThat would be fine with me because there are many things that are here. The chairman pretty well laid out my \narguments on this. But I would just note for the committee's work and attention that the readiness mark has now \n\n\n\nbeen approved by the full committee really addresses almost everything here and we're glad to have Mr. Lamborn \nhave an opportunity to speak to HR109 and his concerns about it. However, we've done a lot of the work already, \nso let's move on and get on with the other amendments. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Hearing none, all those in favor -- I'm sorry?  Mr. Langevin? \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to reiterate the points that you made earlier. The green new \ndeal is not a bill. It's just a sense of Congress. It's an aspirational document, if you will, laying out a set of principles \nwhich I think are laudable and noteworthy and certainly do call attention to the challenges that we face as a nation \nto the effects of climate and change. I know that in the last two Congresses we have dealt with this as a committee \nand the 28 team NDAA I had offered an amendment which was accepted in a bipartisan basis acknowledging that \nclimate change is a threat to U.S. national security and we need to do an assessment of how it's affecting our \nbases, our military planning and such. So, the green new deal is certainly an important aspirational document \nlaying out important principles of the things that we need to look at in terms of how we get to zero net emissions but \nthere really is nothing at this point to study since it's not a bill in the sense of the word that we would deal as a \ncommittee. So, while I appreciate Mr. Lamborn's intent, it's a little premature. Let's wait for a bill and if that's the \ncase then it would be appropriate at that time to consider perhaps an amendment but not at this time. So, with that, \nI would have to oppose the amendment and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Ms. Houlahan? \n\nHOULAHAN: I really have no real opposition to a report, but I do have a bit of an opposition to this language of the \nlast two sentences. I guess the last sentence of the first paragraph which states of the devastating effect to military \nreadiness and that feels like there's a conclusion without the report actually even happening. And so, I just was \nwondering if that sort of language was fungible. If we could talk about that? \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? Mr. Moulton? \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I would just like to speak as someone who has signed on and supported the concept of \nthe green new deal because I do think that we must make addressing climate change a priority. But I do not agree \nwith all the provisions that have been preliminarily put forth by some of the Green New Deal proponents. I think that \nstudying the effects on the Department of Defense is a reasonable thing to do because we should understand the \nfacts here. But I share the chairman's concern that we simply don't have a concrete proposal that really exists as \nthe green new deal to study. I also share Ms. Houlahan's concerns about the preemptive conclusion of this \namendment. So, I do want to praise Mr. Lamborn for bringing this up for wanting to address the science here. We \nshould want to understand the science and how it impacts our national security. I'm just not sure this is the right \nway to go about it. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it.  \n\nLAMBORN: I ask for a recorded vote.  \n\nSMITH: Recorded vote is requested. We will suspend discussion of this until the end of the mark. Next up is log \n376. For what purpose does the gentlelady from Virginia seek recognition? \n\nLURIA: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment on the desk. \n\n\n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. If there's no objection, we'll waive reading and the gentlelady is \nrecognized for five minutes.  \n\nLURIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe in focusing our resources to those efforts which make our forces more \neffective, reliable and efficient. I introduce this amendment to assure we do that just. In the current version of this \nbill, $20 million is allocated to a program to develop low enriched uranium fuel for naval nuclear propulsion, \nsubmarines and aircraft carriers. Drawing on my 20-year Navy experience in the supervision and operation of these \nnaval nuclear propulsion systems, and the simple facts of size and weight in submarine design it makes little sense \nto divert resources from our successful high enriched uranium program that has been improved and refined over \nmore than six decades. I will read from correspondence by the secretary's in the Navy and the secretary of Energy \nand director of Naval Reactors with concurring opinions on this matter. In a letter dated 25 March 2018, the \noperational needs of United States Navy submarines and aircraft carriers place a high importance on the reactor, \ncore, energy density. The replacement of highly enriched uranium with low enriched uranium would result in a \nreactor design that is inherently less capable, more expensive and unlikely to support current life of ship submarine \nreactors. The low enriched uranium fueled system would affect operational availability of military assets due to \nnecessary refueling and will require significant new shipyard infrastructure. Funding development work of this \nmagnitude is not possible without increasing risk to other existing naval nuclear propulsion efforts. A program to \npreserve research and development of a low enriched uranium advance fuel system would compete for necessary \nresources against all other DOD priorities as part of a future budget request. One may argue that the use of high \nenriched uranium is a nuclear proliferation issue and a security threat. If that argument is used, I beg to see what \nadditional resources are proposed to solve this problem in today's budget. Others may argue that other countries \nuse low enriched uranium in their propulsion designs but I would respond that the world does not rely on those \nother countries to provide a reliable nuclear deterrent whose delivery is assured by our SSB and fleet and the \nreliability of these very nuclear propulsion systems from which this effort would divert critical resources. Lastly, \nsome may argue that $20 million is a small amount in the scope of a $730 million plus defense budget. However, \nthis is the initial investment in a program that is assured to, quote, negatively impact reactor endurance, reactor size \nand ship costs, end quote by Admiral Caldwell, Director of Naval Reactors. As a first expenditure in a $1 billion plus \nprogram spanning 15 years in which success is, quote, unquote, not assured. I can also say that for our operational \nforces $20 million is no small amount. When I served as the Executive Officer of a guided missile cruiser during \nsequestration, and sailors were scrounging for funds to buy their own toilet paper and basic supplies, $20 million \nwould have made a world of difference across our operational waterfront. For that reason, I consulted with Navy \nleadership about what program shows high risk to complete on budget and on time and carries significant \noperational impact and I very deliberately recommend this $20 million be placed in the ship maintenance and repair \nline item supporting the overhaul of USS Boise. I will conclude as I began. We need to commit our limited resources \nwhere they are most efficiently used to support our operational forces and our national defense. I yield back my \ntime. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Is there any debate on the issue? Mr. Wittman?  \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Madam chairman. I would like to speak in strong favor of this amendment. Like to urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. I think Ms. Luria brings up some very, very valid points. The bottom line is this. The \nadditional cost associated with low enriched uranium creates challenges for the Navy in the billions of dollars over \nthe lifetime of these ships. Also, it reduces operational availabilities. So, we're looking at increasing as the measure \ngoes (INAUDIBLE) operational availability and this reduces that. The ships will spend more time in port being \nrefueled. It will cost more. If you look at nuclear submarines, it will increase the times they have to be in port to be \nrefueled. That's a cost not only to the nation but it's a cost in terms of that ship being at sea. The same with the \nnuclear aircraft carrier. It will have to go back to port and be refueled one more time during its life. A complex \nrefueling and overhaul for a nuclear aircraft carrier is $4 billion. Add that times the carriers we have, take that for the \ntime it takes them in port, two years to be refueled and you see what happens with operational availability for our \nships. I understand the reasons behind wanting to look at low enriched uranium. Studies in 2014 has shown \nthrough naval reactors that it would impact reactor endurance, reactor size and ship costs. Reactors would have to \nbe bigger. The cost for our ships go up. The operation availability goes down. Also, in 2016 a report came to us that \nsaid it would result in reduced reactor life. Problems too with ship operations, especially on existing ships. The \n\n\n\nsecretary of energy and secretary of the Navy in a report March 25 of 2018 indicated the replacement of highly \nenriched uranium with low enriched uranium would result in reactor design that is inherently less capable, more \nexpensive and unlikely to support current life of ship submarine reactors which means we get less life out of those \nsubmarines which means we either have to spend more to extend their life, and remember, ships like submarines \nwhen they go to depth, experience compression on the steel which means it can only do that so many times before \nyou have a end of life of the submarine. If now you take that out because they're having to put another reactor in or \nnow have to create a larger reactor to put in that ship just to make sure that it can go to its expected life, we either \nhave one or two things. Extraordinarily increased costs or less ship life which means we have to build new ships \nsooner. All of those scenarios not good things for us to get to a 355 ship Navy. Not a good thing for us to look at \nhow do we get the most out of our ships. Not a good thing when we're looking at sailors wanting to be at sea on \ndeployment not at the dock waiting for ships to be rebuilt, to be refueled. Again, all of these things directly affect the \noperational capability of our Navy. And let me say this. There is probably nobody in this room that has more direct \nexperience in what it's like to be at sea and making sure that a ship is operational than Ms. Luria from the state of \nVirginia. I would urge all of my colleagues to listen closely to her assessment of what this means for our Navy and \nwhat it means for us to get to a 355 ship Navy. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion? \n\nLANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman?  \n\nSMITH: Mr. Langevin? \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I regretfully oppose the amendment. Due to the offset which decreases the \nresearch and development funding for vital nuclear nonproliferation program. So, this committee has supported this \neffort going back since 2013. The (INAUDIBLE) relates to a program that assesses the viability of using low \nenriched uranium in naval reactors. First of all, nothing requires this yet. It would have to meet Navy specifications \nand performance requirements, including those in aircraft carriers and submarines. So, as you may know, the \nUnited States has demonstrated strong leadership over the past decade to minimize and possible at all to eliminate \nthe use of highly enriched uranium for civilian purposes. Doing so reduces the risk of nuclear terrorism and makes \nclear that the accumulation of AGO is military in you're isolating nation state seeking nuclear weapons capability. \nSo, using low enriched uranium in a naval reactor if you could bring significant national security benefits with \nrespect to nuclear nonproliferation. It would also lower security costs and naval reactor research and development \nof the cutting edge of nuclear science pursuing the development of LEU offers the opportunity to achieve \ntransformational progress on fuel technology. Additionally, unless an alternative using low enriched uranium fuel is \ndevelopment in the coming decades, the United States will have to resume production of bomb grade uranium for \nthe first time since 1992, ultimately undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts. So, using LEU for naval reactors is not \na pipe dream. France's nuclear Navy already has converted from HU to LU and we must evaluate the feasibility of a \nsimilar transition to the U.S. Navy and take into account the potential benefits to U.S. and international security of \nsetting a norm for using LU instead of nuclear bomb grade material. As America confronts the threat of nuclear \nterrorism and as countries continue to enrich uranium for naval purposes, the imperative to reduce the use of HU \nwill become increasingly important over the next several decades. It's therefore critical that this committee fund this \ncritical research as we have done since 2013 again that is (INAUDIBLE) to our national security interests. The time \nis now and if we do not act soon to being transition, we're going to lock ourselves into using systems that rely on \nuranium found in nuclear weapons, not reactors. If we're forced to restart enrichment, nonproliferation goals could \nbe set back a century or more. So, again, it requires that if we were to do this, that we would meet Navy \nrequirements, nothing undermines Navy requirements and we checked with the Naval reactors and they do not \noppose funding on this as a nuclear nonproliferation amendment. The funds come out of NNSA, not out of naval \nreactors. So, these are already funds that were intended for nonproliferation purposes and again I think it's the right \nthing to do. The committee has supported this effort since 2013 and it would only be a step backwards if we were to \ncut the funding for this vital program. So, with that, I would oppose the amendment, urge my colleagues to oppose \nas well.  \n\nSMITH: Mr. Moulton? \n\n\n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I share Mr. Langevin's both his concerns about nuclear nonproliferation and his desire \nto ensure that America is always leading on this issue. I think that is essential. But I respectfully disagree with him in \nhis position on this amendment because I think the physics is pretty clear here and there's no evidence that having \nhighly enriched uranium here in the United States has been a source of proliferation concerns. There are a lot of \nnuclear proliferation concerns around the globe. It doesn't come from the highly enriched uranium that we use to \nfuel our submarines. It's also pretty obvious per the physics that if you use low enriched uranium you need a lot \nmore of it and that's a proliferation concern in and of itself. We also just went through quite a bit of debate about \nhow important it is to have an absolutely essential survivable leg of the nuclear triad in our SSBN's. And I don't think \nwe want to do anything to weaken that. There are a lot of people on my side of the aisle who supported that \nargument against some of the pronuclear arguments from the Republicans. While I wish that Mr. Luria had chosen \nan alternative for the funds for this, I know marines and soldiers who dream of the option of purchasing their own \ntoilet paper. I support her amendment and think it's a smart thing for our Navy and for our national defense. Thank \nyou. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Further discussion? Ms. Hill? I'm sorry. And then Ms. Hill. \n\nHILL: Thank you. I yield my time to my colleague from Virginia, Ms. Luria. \n\nLURIA: Well, thank you and thank you Mr. Wittman, my fellow colleague from Virginia as well as Mr. Moulton. I think \nwe can rely on the physics majors here in the room to know that the low enriched uranium at 20 percent enrichment \nversus the current 93 percent enrichment that we use for high enriched uranium the reactor would have to be just \nnuke math, five times as big or less one fifth as long. So, I think that the argument that we're using that we have a \nthreat of nuclear terrorism based off the high enriched uranium that we're using for our nuclear propulsion purposes \nis unrealistic and as I said in my earlier comments if that is a concern I think we should be looking at other ways to \ndedicate more security to securing that fuel against threats of nuclear terrorism. And again, I also reiterate the \nnonequivalence between the fact that some other countries including our allies have used low enriched uranium \nthemselves for their propulsion. Those allies although critical in completing our goals and working alongside NATO \ndo not have the same operational requirements or restrictions that we do, and the world relies on our continuous \npresence of our SSBN's for a nuclear deterrent. So, trying to find an alternate technology to power those that's less \nsufficient, more costly goes in direct conflict to my strong support for maintaining our nuclear deterrent which in fact \nis provided by delivery platform of the SSBN using exactly this technology. I yield the remainder of my time back to \nMs. Hill. \n\nHILL: Thank you. I yield back to the chair. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Courtney? \n\nCOURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, just want to say that I think this is sort of like a family discussion \nhere because there is no one who I think has shown over the years his support for our nuclear submarine force \nthan Mr. Langevin who has been a member of the Sea Power subcommittee for longer than almost anyone else I \nthink on the subcommittee and again has been a consistent supporter for recapitalizing our attack submarine fleet, \nour SSBN fleet and also in terms of you know getting the repair and availabilities moving faster for the Los Angeles \nclass submarines which again the Boise isn't one of those -- is one of those LA class submarines. I'm puzzled by \nthis amendment in terms of that -- actually that second part of it in terms of allocating the money towards Boise. \nThere is no question Boise has been stranded in the Nav Sea fiasco in terms of getting submarines turned around \nin a somewhat appropriate time period and there's no question that Boise, Hartford and Columbus actually are all \nLos Angeles class submarines that have taken far too long. With Mr. Wittman we have asked CBO and GAO to look \nat this problem in terms of the public shipyards not turning these boats around. And in fact, they found exactly what \nwe suspected which is that if they had moved some of this work to private yards, those subs would be deployed \ntoday rather than waiting in the queue for work at the submarine shipyard. There has been an underfunding \nrequirement for this. So that certainly is also the backdrop here. I would just note, however, if you look at the Navy's \nrequest in terms of unfunded requirements for ship depot maintenance, it was $815 million. That's' what came over \nfrom the Navy and $653 million of that was for submarines, for Columbus, Hartford and Boise. We are funding that \nin the readiness account fully. I mean every penny of that request that came over from the Navy is in the readiness \n\n\n\naccount. We actually did adjust the Virginia class account for the third sub because we couldn't spend all that \nmoney in 2020 and helped Mr. Garamendi address that issue. So, you know the decision to put $20,000 more into \nthat account just for that one sub when we got two others by the way, again I'm not sure how that decision was \ndone. It certainly wasn't done with the Navy's report in terms of what they need to get those ships turned around. \nAgain, Mr. Langevin has worked on this issue as he points out you know this is research dollars that have you know \ngo back to 2013 in a different account and again just because of just the -- how this money is being spent and the \nfact that there's a history here I'm not comfortable supporting this amendment. And again, I say it as someone who \nagrees that we got to get these Los Angeles class subs moving and in fact that's exactly what the mark and \nreadiness is going to do by fully funding that request. So, again, I will respectfully oppose this amendment and \nagain I'm sure this conversation is going to continue on lower enriched uranium. It's something that has been going \non for a number of years. I think everyone agree if you could really find it, so a solution that would use it and have \nthe same effectiveness as high enriched I think we would all be happy with that outcome. And with that I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Lamborn? \n\nLAMBORN: Mr. Chairman, I yield my time to the gentleman from Virginia. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Lamborn. I wanted to speak to this, and I want to first of all give a shout out to the \nchairman of the Sea Power projection forces subcommittee who has been relentless about making sure that ship \nmaintenance gets funded. And listen I agree with him concerning the element of how the money is directed towards \nUSS Boise. But if you look at it, money within that account is fungible. There is a $200 million deficit in ship \nreadiness. So, while you can make an argument that this is specific to the Boise in that the Boise was included in \nother language there, the money in the account is fungible. So, if this money goes towards Boise, it frees up other \nmoney in the account for us to be able to use for ship maintenance. I would argue the backlog that we've had on \nship maintenance, maintenance availabilities that money can be well utilized to make sure that we catch up in ship \nmaintenance and that we actually get ahead a little bit and actually through the years we have gone behind. And I \nknow that if you go to yards both in Mr. Courtney's district and my district and districts across the United States, \nyou'll find that they are today full with ships undergoing maintenance and some of that maintenance has been \ndelayed. So, I would argue these dollars actually have a lot of utility going into that account, especially since there is \na deficit there and this money can very easily get to the places where it needs to be to do ship maintenance that is \nindeed backlogged. So, I think that this is actually a great place for the dollars to be and again I would urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back to Mr. Lamborn. \n\nLAMBORN: And I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Okay. I just want you to know only one side is going to get the last word in this debate. No matter how it \ngoes. So, if we could, we've debated this rather robustly at this point so if there are further comments if we could \nmake them on the quick side, that would be much appreciated. There's a lot to get to and with that, Ms. Davis? \n\nDAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to Mr. Langevin. \n\nLANGEVIN: Thank you, gentlelady for yielding. I'll be brief. First of all, I will just underscore what Mr. Courtney said \nthat the funding for the USS Boise has been fully met and so there is not the need to put the $20 million towards \noperation maintenance for vessel because it had already been that funding level has already been met. I just want \nto say in closing on the R&D side that's what R&D is for. It may not be appropriate today in terms of being able to \nmeet Naval requirements, although again the French and the Chinese use LU instead of HU but that is the whole \npurpose of research and development. To make that determination. And we will learn significantly from the R&D \nwork that is done and there will be countless I'm sure a spinoff or untold benefits from the research. You think about \npeople over the years who have said well let's keep doing it the way we always do it because that's the way it's \ndone. Well, if we had done that, I'm sure there are people years ago that said you know a computer that filled a \nlarge room is fine. It's doing its work and why do research and development to try to shrink the size of the computer \nand go from tape to digital? So, I would say the R&D here is essential if we can reduce our dependence on HU and \ncan lead the world and by example showing that we can use LU as opposed to HU and it has benefits for not only in \nnational security but also in research and development other areas. I think this is something that we should support. \n\n\n\nThe committee, as I said, has supported it since 2013 and I would encourage my colleagues to oppose the \namendment and continue to support this type of R&D work. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Alright. Thank you. Question occurs on the amendment. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the no's have it. The amendment is defeated. \n\nLURIA: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Recorded vote has been requested. I suspect it's not going to go well. Anyway, alright. We will hold the \nvote until the end of the discussion. It is now an order to consider Log 1 -- well we're going to go to Log 160 and for \nwhat purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek recognition? \n\nSPEIER: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection we will consider it as read. The gentlelady is \nrecognized to discuss her amendment. This was one that was in the (INAUDIBLE) mark that was moved to full \ncommittee and we are -- it's back and we're discussing again. Ms. Speier? \n\nSPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, Ms. Hartzler and I met and regrettably we are just not on the same page. \nSo, the amendment as I presented it earlier today stands. We have a just a philosophical difference. Ms. Hartzler \nbelieves that emergency contraception is an abortifacient. It is not. It's wrong and it really goes against longstanding \nopinions by the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who define emergency contraception as a form of \ncontraception. They say that it is oftentimes confused with medication induced abortion. Medication induced \nabortion is used to terminate an existing pregnancy. All types of emergency contraception are effective only before \na pregnancy is established and therefore are not abortifacients. So, attempts to call emergency contraception as \nabortifacients is frankly an attempt to undermine science and I think any woman, any military service woman who \nhas been sexually assaulted and comes for services and is given the full panoply of emergency contraception \nshould be able to access it. Pure and simple.  \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a substitute amendment at the desk I'd like to offer. \n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? This one we had some advance notice on so should be on \nyour computer, should have it in front of you. We will dispense with reading of the amendment. Mr. Hartzler is \nrecognized to discuss.  \n\nHARTZLER: Great. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry.  One quick thing. We're going to have to vote on this as soon as this debate is done so if you're \nnot here and you are listening somewhere, you need to get here. Go ahead, Ms. Hartzler. \n\nHARTZLER: Great.  Thank you very much and I appreciate my friend and colleague for visiting with me about this. \nMy amendment does not strike any of the language by the chairwoman. It simply gives women more information. \nAnd I think this is reasonable and it's beneficial for the women in the military service. This subject is certainly a very \nsensitive subject. We're talking about women who have been sexually assaulted. It is unconscionable and it is \nupsetting to even think about. Very difficult subject. But what Representative Speier's amendment does it says that \nthe secretary of defense shall promptly furnish to sexual assault survivors at each military medical treatment facility \nthe following; and then she -- it says provides comprehensive medically factually accurate unbiased written and oral \ninformation about all methods of emergency contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. My \namendment would give them even more information. And the reason I would go on and to give that woman \n\n\n\ninformational so about pregnancy support services for women who might find emergency contraception \nobjectionable. And the definition of pregnancy support services includes government and non-government entities \nthat provide information, counseling and resources related to pregnancy. And the benefits, rights and services \npregnant service women are entitled to. The reason I think it's important that service women be provided with this \ninformation as well is because many service women do believe that life begins at conception. And we can have a \ndisagreement about the specifics of plan B and Ella but even the FDA says how does plan B work? Well it works \nlike other birth control pills to prevent pregnancy and that's what Representative Speier is saying. It's a pure \ncontraception. But the FDA also goes on and says that if fertilization does occur, plan B may prevent a fertilized egg \nfrom attaching to the womb, implantation. So, for many women of conscience they believe that once fertilization \noccurs it is life. It is a baby, a little baby that if implanted would have the opportunity to have a plan and purpose and \nlife. And so, as women have gone through this traumatic event and they are very vulnerable and they go to the \nmedical facility in the Department of Defense, doctors are sitting down with them I think they deserve to not only get \nthe information that Representative Speier's is saying that they need or that she's proposing that they get methods \nof emergency contraception so they learn about the option of plan B. Her amendment also says they are given a \nprescription if they want one. But also, why not share with them other options. First of all, their rights. If they should \nbecome pregnant what are their rights as a service woman? To be able to carry that baby to full term. What \nsupports are available there on base for her if that is something she wants to do after she's consulted and thought \nabout it and talked to those near her about what her future looks like and what she wants to do, what she should \ndo? Why should she be denied this important information at this very critical vulnerable time? And all my \namendment is saying it does nothing to take away from what Representative Speier wants to give them. The \ninformation. It just gives them more information, more information about their rights, more services that are \navailable to them and I think that's a good thing. And I would ask my colleagues that this is surely something we all \ncan agree on, come together, that our service women in this very difficult time are entitled to as much information \nas possible as they deal and grapple with what has happened to them and their options going forward. So, I would \nask everyone to support my substitute amendment and then let's move on. Thank you. I yield back. \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am speaking against the substitute and for the underlying amendment. Indeed, \nwomen who have been assaulted are vulnerable and they are going through something incredibly horrible. But \nwhen they are specifically and explicitly seeking and requesting emergency contraception the last thing, they would \nwant to hear is counseling that runs counter to what they are requesting. They've already been traumatized. This \nwould only retraumatize them. I cannot speak strongly enough against the substitute. I support Mrs. Speier's \namendment. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from California. \n\nHILL: Thank you. I think we just have to remember the timeframe that this is happening in. The only time that plan B \nis effective is within 72 hours of unplanned intercourse. And that means that you have just been sexually assaulted. \nYou're going in because you do not want to become pregnant from that. You don't want to talk about whether you're \ngoing to bear a child from that. You don't' have any idea. You won't have any idea for at least six weeks if you are \ngoing to become pregnant from that. So, the thought of finding out what your options are of becoming a mother in \nthe military or having to carry a baby to term that came from that sexual assault is horrifying to even have to go \nthrough your mind. All you know right then is that you were raped, and you do not want to get pregnant from it. So, \nthe idea of having to provide more information in this moment when women are absolutely horrified and are thinking \nabout nothing more than their own basic survival and the ability for them to move on with their lives and prevent you \nknow the absolute worst that could happen to them in that very moment from occurring is to me -- we have to \nsupport the underlying amendment and oppose the replacement. Thank you. I yield back to Ms. Escobar. \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you. I just I want to remind my colleagues that the vulnerable state that a victim is in and the fact \nthat we need to respect a victim's desire to seek contraception which again is intended to prevent pregnancy in a \ncase when she has been raped. And so, I would urge that we reject the substitute and support Ms. Speier's \namendment. I yield back to the chair. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Scott? \n\nSCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to briefly say this. The National Defense Authorization Act and if \nwe want to turn it into a partisan issue on social issues that certainly seems to be the way we're headed down and \n\n\n\nI'm sorry to see that.  I think Ms. Hartzler's amendment is very really doesn't ask for a whole lot other than to \nprovide additional information, it provides additional information, doesn't require any counseling or anything along \nthose lines and I would like to yield my time to my colleague Ms. Hartzler. \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you, gentleman.  I appreciate that. I just wanted to clarify something that was said. At the point \nthat my amendment these women are not requesting a prescription for emergency contraception and they are in the \ndoctor's office because they have been sexually assaulted. And that's at the point -- Representative Speier's \namendment is almost pushing them proactively having the doctor immediately say here's how to get emergency \ncontraception. Here's how to do it and here I'll give you a prescription if you want one. So, my concern is that \nwomen are very vulnerable and if this is the only option given to you, here's a prescription, here's what you can do, \nthey don't have time to think about all the ramifications and I'm just saying at that point the doctor, yes, the military \ndoctor can give them information about emergency contraception but they can also say but we want you to know as \nwell that there are services here that are available to you. There's counseling. There's this agency you can go to. \nThis person. In case you feel and the way you were raised that perhaps you want to consider other options besides \ntaking this prescription which potentially could mean an abortion. So, I just feel like it's important at that vulnerable \nstate to give them that information then they can decide if they want a prescription or not. And certainly, more \ninformation is not bad. It is helpful and good. I yield back to the gentleman. \n\nSCOTT: Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I just one quick comment, Ms. (INAUDIBLE). The healthcare that our men and women who \nserve in the military receive is very much within our jurisdiction. And there are a lot of decisions the DOD make that \nimpacts that healthcare, so this is not just raising some ancillary issue. It has an impact on our service members. \nSo-- \n\nSCOTT: Mr. Chairman, I agree with you but-- \n\nSMITH: I will-- \n\nSCOTT: --this is also-- \n\nSMITH: Mr. Scott, I have to -- just pro forma here. My time. I'm happy to yield to the gentleman.  \n\nSCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for speaking out of order.  \n\nSMITH: It's alright. \n\nSCOTT: But I agree with what you said but this is a -- this is the National Defense Authorization Act. This is a very \nbig issue that has the potential -- we've had this bill for years for 50 plus years we have brought this out in a \nbipartisan manner and passed it through the House of Representatives.  \n\nSMITH: Not always bipartisan but.  Just historically. Most of the time yes but not always. \n\nSCOTT: I would just say we have historically stayed away from putting things in the bill -- well I've only been here \nnine years.  \n\nSMITH: The Russell Amendment a few years back was pretty much on that point. \n\nSCOTT: Well, look, let me yield the time you yielded me back to you. I'm just -- Ms. Hartzler's amendment does not \nstop what another colleague who I very much respect is trying to do. It simply says in addition to that there's going \nto be additional information provided. \n\nSMITH: Understood. Reclaiming my time. We've got votes called. I've got Mr. Gallego and Ms. Stefanik.  I think it \nwould be awesome if the two of you were so brilliant that you wrapped up the debate and we were able to get it \ndone, take a quick vote and then go vote. So, no pressure but Mr. Gallego? \n\n\n\nGALLEGO: Thank you and with all due respect to all my colleagues I think it's absolutely crazy that we trust our \nwomen in the military to make snap decisions when it comes to other people's lives but when it comes to their own \nlives we actually are trying to set up extra requirements on them. Right? This is not -- it's just absurd to me that \nsomeone that has gone through such a traumatizing event that we somehow think that they don't have full capacity \nenough for them to figure out what other options they have when we're actually trying to just talk to them about \nmedical -- safe medical prescription that many people have identified not as an abortion. I understand where they \nmay be some of my friends, especially my friend to my left that we're talking about other types of issues particularly \nmaybe dealing with the Hyde Amendment, but this is not the Hyde Amendment. This is something that even \nwomen take before they even know they're pregnant just in case they are -- they had gotten raped to the point \nwhere they don't want to end up finding themselves later dealing with a medical procedure such as an abortion. \nAnd more importantly, again, these women join the military, they entrust their lives to us, we trust their lives to them. \nLet's let them make their medical decisions they need to so they can actually continue serving their country and \nactually keep their dignity in such a horrible state. And I yield back my time. \n\nSTEFANIK: I think it's really important to note that this amendment I support Ms. Hartzler's secondary amendment \nbecause it's about more information. Look, I have a strong record of supporting access to emergency contraception, \naccess to birth control for our service women but I think we should also include information about pregnancy \nsupport services. This is about more information. This does not limit access to emergency contraception and I fully \nsupport Mrs. Hartzler's secondary amendment.  \n\nSMITH: The question occurs on the substitute amendment. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it. The substitute and yes, we'll have a recorded vote.

They can get done by \nmidnight. It could happen.  \n\n(RECESS) \n\nSMITH: And we are back after that charming interlude. You know, you could've caught a movie during the course of \nthat time, which I think would've been a better way to spend a recess, but for future reference. Okay. Up first, \nhaving the substitute amendment was defeated, which means that the question is on the remaining underlying \namendment offered by Ms. Speier. So all those in favor will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed?  \n\nUNKNOWN: Opposed.   \n\nPending the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. Okay. Now, let's see--okay. Ms. \nSpeier is here. Okay. We will now consider log number 454R1 by Ms. Speier. And for what purpose does the \ngentlelady seek recognition? \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: The amendment will be passed out by the clerk. Without objection, reading of the amendment is, I can't \nthink of the right word here, not required; how's that? And with that, I yield Ms. Speier to discuss her amendment. \n\nSPEIER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. This is really quite simple, service members who are females can access all \nforms of contraception at military facilities. Those who cannot are their dependents through Tricare or persons who \nare not active duty. This particular amendment makes it available to everyone. The ACA now provides \ncontraception at no cost, no copay and it makes no sense that the dependents of service members or non-active \nduty service members would be treated differently. \n\nIt's also important to point out that besides being appropriate healthcare, birth control is also critical for healthcare \nconditions, like endometriosis and is a tool for menstrual suppression. Women make up more than 17 percent of \nour active duty and reserve members and are half of the beneficiaries at Tricare. According to DOD estimates, 95 \npercent of all women serving in the military are of reproductive age. So this is really quite critical. \n\n\n\nLet me also point out the data from the Department of Defense survey of health-related behaviors among active \ndut--duty military personnel shows insufficient access to comprehensive family planning education among service \nmembers. The lack of consistency in providing basic preventive health services is unacceptable.  \n\nNot surprisingly, research shows that active duty service members of reproductive age have a rate of unplanned \npregnancy that is 60 percent higher than that of comparable women in the general population. It's pa--in part due to \ndifferences in policy on birth control education. A research study found that female army soldiers have more \nchildren in their first two years of enlistment and missed more work than do women in other military branches. \n\nFor example, Navy's approach in promoting long-acting reversible contraception and other forms of birth control at \nbasic training for those who want it requiring--requiring recruits to meet individually with medical providers has all \nbeen beneficial.  \n\nSo our troops deserve the very best regardless of which branch of the military they serve and ensuring our service \nmembers and their dependents receive the same healthcare services as civilians is the least we can do. So with \nthat, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    \n\nSMITH: (INAUDIBLE) Ms. Hartzler. \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So as I look in here at this amendment, it seems to do exactly opposite of \nwhat my colleague here on my right side was objecting to in my former amendment, just giving him information \nabout pregnancy support services in that it not only just has what currently DOD provides family planning \ninformation to service members now, it sets up an entire curriculum--entire curriculum, entire education program on \nfamily planning. \n\nAnd at three different points in your military career, it mandates that you participate in this education program the \nfirst year of service and I'm not sure how long this curriculum takes, how many weeks, how many hours is required, \nhow--how much time away from the training field that this is going to entail that you come in and sit down perhaps \nto a PowerPoint presentation and I--I'm not sure, but the first year of service you're required to have--be subjected \nto this education. \n\nAnd then when a member is in training to assume command, once again, you have to go through this family \nplanning training and then a third time when an enlisted member becomes a senior enlisted member. So it just \nseems like we are being excessive here and I'm not sure it's needed in that as far as I know, every military \npersonnel is already--has available to them this education and that's what the Department of Defense and the \nmedical experts right now provide and is available to everyone.  \n\nSo I'm--I'm not sure that this is needed. And so I have concerns about that. I also have concerns with what is in the \ncurriculum and it may not be intended, but it says that this information should include the importance of providing \ncomprehensive family planning for members. Many times people feel like--that the word, when you say \ncomprehensive family planning, means you're giving counseling about abortion services. \n\nAnd so I'm not sure if that was what was intended or not, but I just feel like--that overall, this is, I think, excessive, I \ndon't think it's needed. I--I think this information should be available, but it already is available. I do not believe that \nwe should be forcing our military to go through, at three different times in a military career, a whole curriculum on \nthis particular topic. \n\nSo for those reasons, I would oppose this amendment and encourage us to vote it down and to continue on with \neducation programs that are currently available. And with that, I yield back. Thanks. \n\nSMITH: Further debate on the amendment? Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: I just kind of have a few questions on it. I get the first year of service, I understand what that means, but \nwhen a member is in training to assume command, is that every level of command from 03 to 05 to 06 to 09? Is that \nevery level of command? Which levels of command does that apply to? And then--and then what training?  \n\n\n\nBecause many times people are selected, but there's not necessarily a specific training for that command in some \ncases, in some services. And then I also would like to know when an enlisted member becomes a senior enlisted \nmember, what that means. Does that mean from E5 to E6? Does that mean from 0--E5 to E5 or is that command \nsergeant majors or the E9 equivalent as that of E8? \n\nAnd so just to--there's enough vagueness there and--and if the chair--chair--chairperson could answer those \nquestions, it would make it easier for me to understand exactly what we're voting on and who it applies to.  \n\nSPEIER: So first of all, it's important to point out that there's two parts to this legislation. One is to put everyone in \nparity so the dependents of those who are not active duty will not be paying a copay through Tricare. That's number \none. Number two is to make sure that family planning education programs are available across military branches to \nensure that service members receive medically accurate information to make informed decisions. \n\nI--I don't understand how you cannot recognize that we have a--a problem in the military where service members \nwho are females have a 60 percent higher unplanned pregnancy rate than in the civilian population. So part of that \nis not being able to access family planning services.  \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, if I could reclaim my time-- \n\nSMITH: Yes.  \n\nKELLY: --the specific question was--is what are the definitions? What are those things? I--I don't--I'm not--on the \nmerits, I don't have issues with--with the things that we're talking about. What I have issue with is the vagueness \nand who it applies to and at what level. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. If I may take--take a moment, I'm not sure if the description is accurate here, does--does this \nrequire everyone to go through an ed--education process or does it simply require to be made available?  \n\nSPEIER: My understanding is that there is a program whereby family planning services will be made available to all \nservice members and beyond that, I cannot answer as to whether or not it's going to be required at E2 or E3. \n\nSMITH: Okay. If I could ask the staff just point of clarification, does this amendment require certain people to get \nthis education or does it require it to be made available if they seek it? \n\nDIEHL: My understanding, it's a little bit of both. If they--if they seek it, then that will--they will, of course, be \nprovided the--the information. I--I do understand that at least the Navy does this now in terms of they have a--they \nhave a--a--a--they offer a system training. \n\nSMITH: Got that part. When you say it's a little bit of both, okay, you just mentioned the part that is not required but \nis available-- \n\nDIEHL: Right. \n\nSMITH: --what's the part that is required if it's a little bit of both? \n\nDIEHL: It's that it is in some curricula--some--it is in some curriculum right now already with-- \n\nSMITH: I'm talking about what this amendment does. \n\nDIEHL: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You're--you're correct. You're--you're correct in saying-- \n\nSMITH: I'm not correct about anything, because I didn't know what I was talking about.  \n\nDIEHL: No. You're correct in saying that I--I--there is no requirement. \n\nSMITH: Okay. So the only thing is it is available if they seek it? \n\n\n\nDIEHL: Right, but-- \n\nSMITH: They--they are not required to--it doesn't say you have to teach this curriculum to everybody?  \n\nDIEHL: That's correct. That's my understanding. That's correct, sir. \n\nSMITH: Okay. If someone--I see a lot of frowning faces out here. So I think there's disagreement. Mr. Sennott. \n\nSENNOTT: Sir, I believe the language says the secretary of defense shall establish a uniform standard curriculum \nto be used in education programs on family planning for all members of the armed forces, including both men and \nwomen members during the following periods and then it alludes to the periods that Mr. Kelly referenced. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. That's kind of ambiguous, actually, as to whether or not it's 100 percent required that they go through \nit, I mean, if they have to develop it. Is this possibly something we could try--try to work out on the floor? Because I \nmean, it's a pretty big distinction.  \n\nSPEIER: I agree, let's withdraw it. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Amendment is withdrawn. Next up is log 196, Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Carbajal, for what purpose do you \nseek recognition? \n\nCARBAJAL: Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: The clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection, we will waive the reading of the amendment and \nthe gentleman is recognized to discuss his amendment. \n\nCARBAJAL: Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry, first of all, I'd like to thank you both and also staff \nfor working with me to address this critical issue of energy security and its importance to the operations and \nreadiness of our military. As you all know, California is a leader in the area of renewable energy and we strive to \nmeet a 100 percent clean energy goal. \n\nOffshore wind has become a reliable source of energy nationwide and has positioned itself to help America reduce \nits reliance on foreign energy sources, which in turn enhances national security, especially in California. The Bureau \nof Ocean Energy Management industries and the state and DOD have been working together to increase presence \noff of--off--offshore wind off the coast of California. \n\nThere has been specifically--there has specifically been great interest to bring offshore wind to the Central Coast. \nThe Central Coast of California and industries have been working diligently with DOD representatives for almost \nthree years in order to bring this alternative source of energy to the area while ensuring they avoided and mitigated \nany potential conflict with DOD testing and training activities.  \n\nMultiple industries follow the DOD Siting Clearinghouse rules and additional direction for specific projects offshore. \nState and local governments were also working with DOD to coordinate efforts and ensure it would not conflict with \nDOD training and testing. Unfortunately, near the end of the process the DOD Siting Clearinghouse process came \nto a halt and it was taken over by the services. \n\nThis was a major disappointment for the Central Coast of California that I represent, but we are continuing to work \nwith the services and the department to enable offshore wind while mitigating potential impacts on military \noperations. The purpose of my amendment was to direct the department to pick up where the Clearinghouse left off \nin identifying space in the warning areas off the Pacific Ocean to accommodate viable wind energy projects that are \ncompatible with DOD testing and training activities. \n\nMilitary readiness continues to be the center of all discussions and it is critical to recognize and understand that \noffshore wind has become a real-world environment that the military should consider as they train the forces for the \nfuture. By the end of 2020, China will have 6.7 gigawatts of operational offshore wind and U.S. Forces will have to \nbe prepared to operate in such environments. \n\n\n\nIt is imperative that the military start training in something that mirrors our future areas of operations. I am confident \nthat we can work together to accomplish energy security and military readiness. There is room for both in the \nPacific, however, it is critical that the department and services be willing to work with us and be open to mitigation \nefforts. \n\nDue to referral issues, I will be withdrawing my amendment, but Mr. Chairman, I would greatly appreciate it if you \nand committee staff will commit to working with me as we work with the department and the clearinghouse to \nexpand opportunities in providing reliable renewable energy resource through offshore wind. Thank you, Mr. \nChairman. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Carbajal. And I--and we have worked on this and discussed this. I think it is a very worth--\nworthwhile goal and something that the, you know, Department of Defense should be doing. In an ideal world, they \ndo it without our direction and I know they've been dragging their feet on this for a long time. So we--we are going to \nlook at different ways to get them to stop dragging their feet and move forward. \n\nI know it's important to your district, I appreciate you offering and withdrawing the amendment, but it is an important \nissue and we will meet that pledge and continue to work on it. Thank you very much. We are now onto log 329R2. \nFor what purpose does the gentleman from Virginia seek recognition? \n\nWITTMAN: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. I keep asking that same question, I get the same--I should stop asking--I know why you're seeking \nrecognition. Why am I asking? The clerk will pass out the amendment and without objection, we'll waive the reading \nand the gentleman's recognized for five minutes. \n\nWITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment establishes the Strategic Seaport Readiness infrastructure \ndevelopment program and fund within the Department of Defense in coordination with the Maritime Administration. \nThis is specifically to make sure that our strategic ports of which there are 17 across the United States are kept safe \nand our readiness is maintained. \n\nRight now in many instances, they're lacking the necessary resources to support the 355 shipped Navy that we are \nmoving towards and making sure to--that our military sealift capabilities can be supported by our ports and these \nstrategic ports are in a variety of different states from Washington to Texas to California, from Virginia to Georgia to \nFlorida to Mississippi, all of them mission-centric to what DOD needs to be done. \n\nThis fund will also allow for the training of a workforce to be there to support the shipping and ship traffic and ship \nsupport within those areas all that are all critical elements of what we have to do to support and maintain military \nsealift command, ready reserve fleet and the ships that our Navy needs in addition to the port facilities to make sure \nthat we can safety transit those ships in and out of our ports here in the United States. \n\nMr. Chairman, though, due to a waiver referral, I'm going to withdraw this amendment, however, I want everyone on \nthis committee to make sure that we are totally committed to ensuring that our strategic ports have the funds \nnecessary to support our nation's ability to respond to threats overseas. Thank you. \n\nSMITH: The gentleman withdraws the amendment. We now move onto log 200. For what purpose does the \ngentleman from Michigan seek recognition? \n\nMITCHELL: Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection, reading is waived. Gentleman's recognized for five \nminutes. \n\nMITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The language at the desk, the amendment, is a result of a situation that \nemerged in my--with a constituent in my district. He was an Air National Guard--Guardsman deployed to \nAfghanistan who unfortunately had a stroke while on deployment. He was transported to Landstuhl, ultimately had a \nsecond stroke, was transported to a private hospital there.  \n\n\n\nThe hospital commander authorized emergency family member travel to bring his wife to Germany. Unfortunately, \nshe did not have a passport and this event happened on a Friday, to make it a really difficult set of circumstances. \nThe base commander called me and asked for help. I ended up calling the White House. The White House called \nthe State Department. \n\nWe got the passport office of Chicago open, but then it became--she became aware that there were emergency \npassport fees on top of everything else, all the other struggles she had. So while there's--and I appreciate this \nreport language here about why it is that--and they're providing inadequate training to base commanders on \nprocedures for assistance. \n\nWe're also trying to get those fees waives. Those fees for loved ones who are going over to member--service \nmembers who are injured and they don't have a passport, they're expensive. That's a barrier they shouldn't have to \nface. My amendment mirrors provisions in the--in a No Passport Fees for Heroes Act and we requested a referral \nfrom the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \n\nIn fact, there are senior members of the committee that are me--that are cosponsors of the bill. At this point, \nunfortunately, they have not provided that waiver, that letter for us. Let me stress the CBO indicates that the \nexpenses to this provision are, \"Insignificant effects on both revenue and spending.\" Our military families sacrifice \nmuch for us. I believe we can handle this problem and the Foreign Affairs Committee has agreed to do just that and \nwork with us to do that.   \n\nSo while I wanted to bring this issue up today, I withdraw the amen--the amendment and work with members on \nForeign Affairs to see if we can solve this problem for family members when they have service members that are \ninjured and they need a passport. So thank you for the time and I yield back, Mr. Chair. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Gentleman withdraws the amendment. We go--okay. Okay. We'll now consider en bloc \npackage number 1. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package consisting of amendments that have been \nworked and approved with mino--minority. Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc \namendment? \n\nWithout objection, the amendments are considered as read. And now I would like to try an idea here and I'll try not \nto discuss it too long, if we could have unanimous consent to dispense with the actual reading of the description of \nthe amendment, maybe I can just go--okay. There seems to be struggling--and--and--and I'm not just doing that \nbecause I'm now the one who has to read them.  \n\nIt--it's late and this will speed it up. I appreciate that. With unanimous consent, we will dispense with that and I will \nsimply quickly read off the numbers. En bloc package number 1 consists of logs 091, 125, 127, 146, 164R1, 227, \n231, 237R1, 252R1 and 275. Is there discussion on the--on the en bloc package? Hearing none, all those in favor \nwill say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed, no. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. And it is now an order to consider en \nbloc package number 2. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number 2 consisting of amendments \nthat have been worked and approved with the minority. Without objection, so ordered. The clerk will distribute the \nen bloc amendment. Without objection, the amendments are considered as read.  \n\nAnd I now recognize myself to, once again, read quickly through the numbers that are at play here. This is log 278, \n307R1, 331, 343R1, 352, 442R3, 443, 476 and 045. Is there discussion on the en bloc package? Hearing none, all \nthose in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed will say no. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. Now I need to regroup for a \nmoment here. All right. We are onto log 187. Mr. Cooper, I believe you have an amendment. Do you seek \nrecognition? Space Force. \n\n\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I first want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Mr. Rogers, because \nSpace Corps was really his idea from the beginning. \n\nSMITH: We skipped a procedural point here-- \n\nCOOPER: Okay.  \n\nSMITH: --where you say you have an amendment at the desk. \n\nCOOPER: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: And I say-- \n\nCOOPER: Sorry. \n\nSMITH: --say it with me. No. I'm sorry. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nThe clerk will pass out the amendment. With unanimous consent, we'll waive the reading and the gentleman is \nrecognized to discuss this amendment. \n\nCOOPER: Mm-hmm. I thank the gentleman. As I was saying, my friend and colleague, Mr. Rogers from Alabama \ndeserves tremendous credit for really spearheading this initiative. Three years ago in 2016, before there was even \na--a new president, the Space Corps was voted on by this committee by an overwhelming vote of something like 60 \nto 1, a completely bipartisan effort, a response to the threats that we are increasingly facing from China and Russia \nand other potential adversaries, because the feeling was the Air Force had not done a good enough job in \npreparing for the coming threats.  \n\nAnd this isn't just our feeling, way back in 2001, the Rumsfeld Commission had come up with a similar conclusion. \nIn 2008, the Allard Commission had come up with a similar conclusion, but the War on Terror distracted us from \nimproving our space capabilities. So the Space Corps is--is close as we could make it to the proposal that passed \nthis committee overwhelmingly three years ago. \n\nI will not elaborate on all the details of it, but it is not a separate service as the president had proposed, it is instead \na corps underneath the Air Force. It is not a $13 billion expenditure, a gold-plated plan like had been proposed to us \nby the secretary of the Air Force, it is instead a reorganization so that space professionals can be properly \nrecognized for their skill and ability and promoted. \n\nThis does not fold in NRO or NGA, the intelligence agencies. It does allow volunteers from the Navy and Army to \njoin the Space Corps if they would like. It--Space Corps would be run by a four-star com--commandant who has a \nfour-year term and would be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  \n\nIt offers streamlined acquisition capability for the Space Corps, which is a central feature, because many of our \nmilitary satellites had been slow in acquisition and it offers the Air Force flexibility in shaping the new corps, \nbecause it will be underneath the Air Force, but then offers a separate promotion path for space professionals. \nThat's a quick and dirty explanation. \n\nMr. Chairman, I would like to yield to my friend and colleague, Mr. Rogers, for any comments he would like to make \non the Space Corps.  \n\nSMITH: Actually-- \n\nROGERS: I thank my friend, Chairman Cooper. He has been a great partner in this endeavor over the last several \nyears and he's right, the Stra--Strategic Forces Subcommittee spent years reviewing the problems that we were \nhaving in national security space.  \n\n\n\nThis is something that took a lot of time and energy and have put--we had a lot of thought put into it and--and he's \nalso correct that what we present to you tonight is almost identical to what passed out of this committee nearly \nunanimously over two years ago and it is essential to be done.  \n\nOne of the things that many of you may have noticed in the testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee about a month ago was the secretary of defense, the chairman of Joint Chiefs, the--the Gen--General \nHyten with Strategic Command and Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force all gave full-throated support for \nthis endeavor and in fact, Joe Dunford went further and said that if we don't do this now, five years from now this \ncountry is going to regret the position we'll be in. \n\nSo I'm proud to see this bipartisan work coming to fruition tonight and I urge your favor of a--favor of a vote and I \nyield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Crow.  \n\nCROW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a--an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: All right. Just second here. You have a perfecting amendment at the desk, I believe you meant to say. \n\nCROW: Correct. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment and the chair now recognizes the gentleman for the purpose of explaining his or her perfecting \namendment. \n\nCROW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to begin by recognizing the great hard work by Chairman Cooper, Mr. \nRogers over the last few years doing wonderful work to build out the infrastructure for this and I'm wholly in support \nof their--their proposal here, but my amendment does something very simple. It addresses a concern that arose in \nthe--the last 24 hours that came out of the Senate version of the Space Force Bill and I'd--I'd like to read some of \nthat language. \n\nIt says, \"In addition to the elements of the Air Force Space Command as of the date of the enactment of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the United States Space Force shall include other military and civilian \npersonnel of the Air Force, including appropriate elements of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve and \nother infrastructure, assets and resources of the Air Force.\" \n\nThe--the issue with that and the reason that I am proposing this language in this amendment to address that is the \nimpact that this would have on National Guards. In particular, the Colorado National Guard. In fact, 80 percent of all \nArmy National Guard space assets and 40 percent of all Air National Guard space assets are actually located in \nColorado. \n\nThis is hundreds of jobs and has a huge impact on our economy. So while I'm supportive of the effort to create \nSpace Force and I've been on the record repeatedly about Space Command and the overall space infrastructure \nand the effort--efforts of the committee, I do not want to do this at the jeopardy of our National Guards, because we \nrely on, in Colorado and throughout the country, those guard men and women that actually support the state \nmission as well. \n\nAnd if we are to allow the Air Force to involuntarily transfer those personnel from the National Guard mission where \nthey enlisted and joined their state services and to have that resource pulled away to the active force, we could \njeopardize that state mission as well. So I would ask folks to consider my amendment to resolve that issue. \n\nCOOPER: Will the gentleman yield? \n\nCROW: Yes.  \n\n\n\nCOOPER: I've talked with Mr. Rogers and I think we would like to accept your amendment in the spirit in which is--\nis offered to augment and help the Space Corps. We have the highest regard for the reserve and for the guard. We \nare well aware of the crucial role that the Colorado Guard plays and we look forward to having a situation that works \nnot only well for the new Space Corps, but also with all the guard and reserve units in Colorado and other states.  \n\nSo I think this can be worked out. And the California Guard too. Let me not exclude that. All the Guards are \nwonderful, particularly, the Tennessee Guards. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nSMITH: He loves all of his children equally. Is there further discussion on the perfecting amendment? Hearing none, \nall those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? The ayes have it, the perfecting amendment is adopted. Is there further discussion on the \namendment itself? Mr. Turner \n\nTURNER: Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate you on the bipartisan effort for this provision, as Mr. Cooper and--\nand Mike Rogers have worked together on this, but in addition to bipartisan of the committee, this is bipartisan even \nwith the administration. As we know it, the Missile Defense Review rollout, President Donald Trump said we will \nrecognize that space is a new war-fighting domain with the Space Force leading the way. \n\nIn just twice this year, he's stated, our destiny beyond the earth is not only a matter of national identity but a matter \nof national security. He went onto say, space is a war-fighting domain just like the land, air and sea. Our service \nmembers will be vital to ensuring American continues to lead the way into the stars.  \n\nSo I appreciate the chairman's bipartisanship in working both with Mr. Cooper and M--and Mr. Rogers, but also in \nsupport of Donald Trump's vision of the administration's efforts to ensure that we have a presence in space that is \nboth defensive and protection of national security. I yield back.    \n\nSMITH: Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is a necessary development for our military. It's--it's clear that Russia \nand China are weaponizing space. We've got to be prepared and I think this will take our space personnel to--to the \nright level so we could build a--a better space culture. I do have one question for Mr. Cooper or Mr. Rogers.  \n\nIt's a little vague to me what will happen with the--the Navy and the Army and the Marine space folks in this. Will \nthey be dovetailed into the Space Corps or are they still separate? And if they're separate, does that not water \ndown the effect? So I just--it's--it's vague to me. So I appreciate the feedback. \n\nROGERS: We--we wanted to keep this initial version as identical to the last version as possible and the last time \nthe Defense Department was not fully embracing this concept. So we didn't want the political battles of adding the--\nthe Navy and the--the Army missions, which are very small, by the way. The Navy has only the--the MUO satellite \nsystems for satellite--weather satellites and the Army has SMDC and that's it and that basically was our thinking \nhere today. \n\nThis is the initial standing up of the service, we can come back next year and look at--at bringing those \nprofessionals in just like the Space Development Agency, we expect, in about three years, to be folded into the \nSpace Force. This is going to be an evolving product over the next four to five years and we're going to have time \nto--to--to deal with those, but we didn't want to change this initial bill from the one that passed before, because it \nwas completely uni--bipartisan and--and had a lot of support. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rogers. \n\n\n\nBACON: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rogers. I'll just--I'll just reecho, I think this has taken us in the right direction. It's \nwhere our future is going. So I--I support the development. So thank you. \n\nSMITH: Further discussion. If not, all those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Oppose? The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. It is now an order to consider log 332, an \namendment offered by Mr. Khanna. And Mr. Khanna, for what purpose do you seek recognition? \n\nKHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, the reading of the amendment will be \ndispensed with and the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. \n\nKHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment is in direct response to TransDigm fleecing the American \ntaxpayers in a bipartisan expose, which forced them to reimburse $16 million to the American taxpayers just a few \nweeks ago. There was a bipartisan committee hearing led by Mark Meadows among others that exposed \nTransDigm's fraud.  \n\nWhat TransDigm did was buy up smaller Defense contractors and they jacked up the prices way above what the \ncosts were. Kevin Fahey, the president's assistant secretary for acquisition, described TransDigm's policies as, \n\"gouging and immoral and unconscionable,\" in our oversight hearing last month. Just a few days ago the American \nConservative Magazine said that this is exactly what Congress should do, exposing unpatriotic companies like \nTransDigm that are ripping off the American taxpayers. \n\nThe assistant secretary said that the lack of historical cost data left contracting officers with not enough information \nin determining whether the Pentagon was being fairly charged and Mr. Norquist--Norquist, the defense comptroller \nsaid that we needed to have reforms. The two reforms that he recommended are the ones that this amendment \noffers.  \n\nFirst, it gives contracting officers the ability to get certified cost data. Right now they don't have that. They don't--\nthey're often flying blind even though most contracting officers, according to the IG report, knew that TransDigm \nwas ripping off our military. They were unable to do anything, because they couldn't get the cost data that they \nwanted. \n\nSecond, this closes the loophole of the commercial exception. In TransDigm's case, the CEO of TransDigm \ntestifying Kevin Stein admitted, during the oversight hearing, that the company's employees withheld cost data from \ncontracting officers for 15 parts manufactured by the company despite requests from contracting officers. \n\nIn the hearing, Stein claimed that TransDigm withheld this information by calling them commercial items even \nthough the Department of Defense found that none of these 15 parts actually were commercial items. This \nexception is being abused. This is how TransDigm systematically ripped off the American taxpayers.  \n\nThe IG found, when they reviewed it, that TransDigm jacks up these prices without the contracting officers knowing \nthe price and the amendment is focused on weaning out these back actors by closing the loophole on commercial \nexceptions and not allowing that if the contracting officers determine that that is not fair. Now, there are many good \nactors that supply information to the Department of Defense and parts to the--the Department of Defense. \n\nThis does nothing to go after them. It's unfortunate that we have bad actors who are taking advantage of the \nAmerican taxpayers while so many people are risking their lives to serve our country. I don't think this is a partisan \nissue, this is despicable for anyone to take advantage of the system and this amendment will make sure that no \nDefense contractor is able to abuse the system again. I yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. So debate on that? Mr. Thornberry? \n\n\n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the \namendment and the gentleman is recognized to speak on his amendment. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I don't know of anyone who disagrees with the characterization that Mr. \nKhanna just gave of TransDigm and their behavior. They abused the system. Now--now, technically, they may not \nhave violated the law as his--the hearing he talked about in oversight brought out, but they clearly abused the \nsystem.  \n\nWhat my substitute amendment does is take the exact recommendations from the inspector general who looked \ninto this matter about--and--and it requires the department to implement them and in essence, it says, the \nUndersecretary for Acquisition has to set guidelines across the whole department dealing with price \nreasonableness ways to get at cost when items seem to be at high risk for unreasonable pricing or contractors \nhave a history as TransDigm did.  \n\nThey were first audited in 2006 and yet they continued to do business with the Department of Defense and--and \nother aspects of--that the inspector general said the Department needed to put in place to prevent this from \nhappening before.  \n\nI mean--I mean, again, I do not believe that the under--that Mr. Khanna's amendment would have stopped \nTransDigm and in fact, I think the danger is while attempting to treat the symptoms, it makes the problem worse, \nbecause the underlying problem here is that TransDigm went out and bought the intellectual property, the patents \nor the licenses for parts that we had to have to keep airplanes flying. \n\nThe answer to that is number one, we need more tools to identify and go after companies that are abusing the \nsystem, like TransDigm did, and number two, we've got to have more competition. We need more than one \ncompany to provide these parts. And I would point to--members to a GAO study in 2017 that said this ha--requiring \ntraditional and nontraditional DOD contractors all to have certified cost data is one of the biggest discouragements \nthere can be for not--for doing business with the Department of Defense. \n\nIn other words, it decreases competition if you have this blanket short of approach. So I think the better answer is to \nfocus on the bad guys, make sure the department develops the tools to focus on the bad guys. That's what the IG \nsaid. And secondly, don't do anything to discourage competition, as a matter of fact, do things to increase \ncompetition so that we do not get into this position where one company has the patent or the license or--or the--the \nintellectual property for something that we have to have. \n\nI think that's the essential difference, not--not only treat the symptom, but go down and treat the disease. That's \nwhat this substitute tries to do. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Is there further discussion on this amendment? Mr. Khanna. \n\nKHANNA: Mm-hmm. I'll be brief noticing the time. I appreciate Mr. Thornberry's--Ranking Member Thornberry's \nsentiments and--and his work on the issue. I would just say three points. One, the amendment you're offering is \nlargely already being implemented by the Department of Defense and is in Representative Speier's unbound \namendment that will be we're voting on. \n\nSo I think having the Undersecretary do a report is a good thing, I don't think it's a bad thing, but I don't think it's \nefficient. What this amendment does is exactly what Mr. Norqui--Norquist, who's the comptroller of the Department \nof Defense, recommended in the hearing and that is it gives the contracting officer the authority to request \ninformation if they suspect foul play or if they suspect that there's a need for that.  \n\nIt's not a blanket requirement that they would do it in every case, it's only if they suspect that there is a bad actor \nlike TransDigm. So I'm all for more competition and we can look at ways that incentivize not just having a single \nsource, but this is not going to disincentivize any company other than the ones who are not being honest and \n\n\n\ngetting rid of the commercial exception, again, is not a blanket statement, it is only when contracting officers feel \nthat they are being lied to, that that's being used as--as an excuse. \n\nBasically, this is saying that we trust the judgment of contracting officers at the Department of Defense, that we trust \nthe judgment of Mr. Norquist, that we trust the judgment of the president's own appointees who were outraged with \nwhat happened with TransDigm. I yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: Is there further discussion on the substitute amendment? Hearing none, the question occurs on the \nsubstitute amendment. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no?  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: All right. Let's try that again. All those opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: All right. There we go. Pending the chair, the no's have it. Well, you did well the first time, you were kind of \nin there. But no's have it and the amendment is not agreed to.  \n\nJOHNSON: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Yes.  \n\nJOHNSON: We request for a recorded vote. \n\nSMITH: Recorded vote is requested. Under the rules, we will-- \n\nJOHNSON: Unless you want to do the voice again on both sides. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nSMITH: We can do that for a while.  \n\nJOHNSON: Yeah. That's kind of what I'm thinking. In fact, I think in the future we should do the wave. Instead of \njust doing the voice we'll have both sides stand up and see how enthusiastic you are or not. Okay. I believe we go \nstraight to the vote and the clerk will call the role. And this is, just to be clear, the vote on Mr. Thornberry's substitute \namendment.  \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith? \n\nSMITH: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Chairman votes no.

All \nthose in favor, say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Pending the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. And Ms. Davis is going to \ntake over for a minute on the next couple of amendments. So it's all yours. \n\nDAVIS: Okay. We will now consider log 124, Conway-- \n\nCONWAY: (INAUDIBLE) 7. \n\nDAVIS: --Mr. Conway.  \n\nCONWAY: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nDAVIS: Great. Clerk, please distribute and we waive that requirement. Without objection, we'll dispense with the \nreading and the chair recognizes the gentleman for the purpose of explaining his amendment. \n\nCONWAY: Thank you, madam chairwoman. This is a pretty straightforward amendment that had been made--or \nthis--had we gotten the sequential referral issue taken care of, it would've been pretty straightforward. It provides \nfor a--a modification of the Transparency Act--transparency rules relati--relative to accounting firms that are doing \naudit--audit remediation work. \n\nThe current law is too broad and captures too much information that's irrelevant to the work that's going on. The \ntrou--the troubling issue is we found out at 10:00 p.m. Monday night that we had these sequential referral issues \nand this amendment's been in the--in the works for a long time. And so hopefully, at some point in the future, \nmuscle memory will get to the point where we will have more than just a day to--to clear those. \n\nSo I want to withdraw our--I ask for unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and we will work to try to get \ndown on the floor when we go over there. So with that, I ask to withdraw. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. The gentleman withdraws the amendment. Thank you.  \n\nCONWAY: No choice. \n\nDAVIS: We'll now consider log number 439-- \n\nGALLAGHER: Madame chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nDAVIS: --by Mr. Gallagher. Thank you. Please distribute the amendment and we'll dispense with a reading. And the \nch--I recognize the gentleman for the purpose of explaining his amendment. \n\nGALLAGHER: Thank you. This is a very simple amendment which I offered with Mr. Gallego and several oth--\nseveral other colleagues. It was a simple one-word fix to a provision that we passed of this committee and in the \nwhole Congress in FY-19 NDA regarding prohibitions on federal purchases going to Chinese telecom companies, \nlike Huawei and ZTE.  \n\nIt was a one-word fix, it was not controversial, but it was--ended up being referred to not one, not two, not three, but \nseven different committees by my count. I had a similar amendment on Chinese telecoms, also cosponsored by Mr. \nGallego, that was referred to four different committees despite the fact that the standalone we introduced earlier this \nyear referred exclusively to foreign affairs. It was only committee. \n\n\n\nAnother amendment I was hoping to include a bipartisan Senate bill establishing sanctions on companies that \ncontribute to Chinese island construction and disputed seas received six referrals. So I understand that we want to \nrespect equities of different committees, I'm all for that. There does seem to have been a marked change in the \nthreshold.  \n\nI've only been--I've only been through this twice prior to this. And so I think we need some way to adjudicate these \nissues without it being referred to six, seven, eight, nine committees. So I'm going to have to withdraw my \namendment. I thank my colleague from Arizona and my fellow Marine, Mr. Gallego, for his leadership on all things \nrelated to Huawei and I look forward to revisiting this debate on the House floor and I request unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment and yield-- \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. The gentleman withdraws his amendment. We're now going to move to en bloc number three, \nwhich consists of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority, as the chair mentioned \nalready, there's unanimous consent for us to only read the numbers. So I will do that quickly. And anybody who's \nthinking about withdrawing their amendment might want to think about that a little bit too as we--as we go through \nthe en bloc. \n\nSo the en bloc number three package, amendment number 333, by Mr. Khanna, amendment number 108R1 by Mr. \nBrown, amendment 126R1 by Mr. Conaway, amendment 123 by Mr. Conaway, amendment 166R1 by Mr. \nGaramendi, amendment 299R1 by Mr. Moulton, amendment 265R1 by Mr. Bacon, amendment 438R3 by Mr. \nGallagher, amendment 254R3 by Mr. Byrne. Further discussion on the en bloc package? Yes, Mr. Bacon.    \n\nBACON: Thank you, ma'am. I just want to thank the committee and the chairman for putting in the en bloc, the \nsense of Congress on Taiwan. I think it's important for our friends of Taiwan not to only hear from the Foreign \nAffairs part of Congress here, but also from the Armed Services Committee. You know, they're a--a nation at--or a \ncount--a people that want to protect freedom, religion, freedom of the press. \n\nThey're 23 million, very isolated next to China. So I just--I think we're doing the right thing by expressing our support \nto these folks that we've had an--an agreement with since 1979. Thank you. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. If there's no further discussion, the question is on the adoption of en bloc package number \nthree. So many as are in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nDAVIS: Opposed? The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Okay. Now, we're considering number 138R1, \nMs. Gabbard. Ms. Gabbard-- \n\nGABBARD: Madame chair, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nDAVIS: Great. And we'll dispense with distributing and waive that. I recognize the gentlewoman for the purpose of \nexplaining her amendment. \n\nGABBARD: Thank you, madam chair, I'll keep this very brief. What my amendment does is simply strengthens the \nexisting provisions that require the DOD to provide a public annual report on civilian casualties. My amendment \npromotes greater accountability and collaboration between DOD and the intelligence community for best practices \nso that we can decrease the likelihood of civilian casualties. \n\nIt does this by reinstating the requirement of an annual public report on the number of strikes by DNI against \nterrorist targets outside of areas of active hostilities and to provide an assessment of combatant and non-combatant \ndeaths resulting from those strikes. This requirement is not unusual and this committee passed a similar \nrequirement in the FY-18 NDAA for the DOD. \n\nWe received a waiver to consider this amendment today from the Intelligence Committee here in the House, which \nfurther enables us to exercise our oversight in Congress. Please support my amendment, support transparency and \naccountability. I yield back. \n\n\n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Is there any debate on the amendment? Mr. Bacon? \n\nBACON: Thank you. And I appreciate Ms. Gabbard's input on this. We need to have transparency on what we're \ndoing with our remote piloted aircraft and I think this Bill's already done that. We have two provisions in the Bill, \nSection 1063 that modifies the duties and/or reporting requirements for DOD and then Section 1086 that directs an \nindependent assessment of duties reporting on policy on civil--civilian casualties. \n\nHere's my concern and why I--I don't think the--this amendment needs to be modified or not passed, this is forcing \nDOD to re--to do reporting on intelligence missions, not DOD missions and I think this is more germane for the \nIntelligence Committee and it's more germane for our intelligence communities to do the reporting on civilian \ncasualties, most missions that they're running. \n\nDOD is already going to do this for their missions and I think that that reporting should come from DOD when it's a \nDOD mission not doing a reporting on DNI-led missions. So I think this is a terr--a territory issue, frankly. I don't \nthink-- \n\nGABBARD: Will the gentleman yield-- \n\nBACON: --I don't think our military wants to do that reporting on DNI. Yes, please.    \n\nGABBARD: --just--just a point of clarification.  \n\nDAVIS: Does the gentleman yield? \n\nBACON: I do yield. Thank you. \n\nGABBARD: Thank you very much and I appreciate your raising this question and concern. The--the amendment \nspecifically states that this report will come directly from DNI. So the DO--this is something that will not have to be \nconveyed through the DOD. DNI will report directly to Congress. \n\nBACON: So--so why doesn't--I want--a question back to you, if I may, why--why would not the Intelligence \nCommittee be compelling DNI to do this versus the Armed Services Committee? \n\nGABBARD: Well, I think as you know, there are a number of activities where there may be overlap. \n\nBACON: Mm-hmm.  \n\nGABBARD: So this allows for our committee to exercise our oversight, obviously, without getting into--to too many \ndetails here. \n\nBACON: All right. I just wanted to express my concern I think this is more appropriate coming from the Intelligence \nCommittee from DNI, but I do appreciate the fact hearing that DNI's providing the numbers. I think that's a--a--a \nstep forward. I yield back. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Mr. Waltz. \n\nWALTZ: Thank you, madam chairwoman. Just to reiterate Representative Bacon's comments, DOD already \nextensively reports on civilian casualties. In fact, the 2019 NDAA expanded the scope of what DOD has to report \nand in fact, can make those reports public unless the secretary of defense decides that, for a variety of reasons, \none of which is that our enemies tend to use these reports as propaganda overseas, decides if they should be \nclassified. \n\nBut I could just tell you from personal experience, as someone who has called in drone strikes overseas, as \nsomeone who has called in airstrikes, as someone who has had to take down compounds and terrain because \nairstrikes were denied, I--I just want to impart on my colleagues the ripple effects of these types of reports and an \noveremphasis on these reports. \n\n\n\nWe've had situations, and I've personally experienced situations, where there is such an emphasis and so much \ndemand and so much--so many fingers and chests that come down the chain that we've actually had to send \nsoldiers into locations, on the one hand, lost soldiers because airstrikes were denied of an overconcern of civilian \ncasualties and then on the other hand, lost soldiers because we had to go verify sites that were incredibly \ndangerous to ensure there were no civilian casualties. \n\nThis is an incredibly important issue and as someone who has had to make those life and death decisions with a \nlawyer, with a JAG officer standing next to me trying to decide if that ISIS fighter that we let go or that commander \nthat we let go will end up killing more civilians down the road, if those civilians that are providing ammunition and \nsupport are indeed lawful combatants under the law of war, if the civilians that are with them are family members \nbut you have to make that unfort--unfortunate decision. \n\nI just think we need to pause for a moment and realize no one--no military member wants to either intentionally, \ncertainly not, or accidentally cause civilian casualties and there is an extensive reporting already. I think by layering \nadditional reports on we not only send that additional pressure, which, again, can apply both ways, but we send a \nmessage, I think, to our commanders downrange who receive extensive training on these issues that they're not to \nbe trusted. \n\nAnd when you have reports going through the chain coming to the Congress, it--it--it--it has some secondary tertiary \neffects that--that--that I just don't think we fully appreciate here. I yield my time. \n\nDAVIS: The gentleman yields back. Ms. Stefanik. \n\nSTEFANIK: Thank you, madam chairwoman. The protection of civilians is a fundamental part of all operations in \nDOD standards and policies reflected, as my colleague Mr. Waltz just eloquently outlined based upon his personal \nexperience. I want to make a few key points why I oppose this amendment. So first, as Representative Bacon and \nMr. Waltz outlined, there are already provisions in the Bill that increase the level of reporting of civilian casualties for \nDOD. \n\nSection 1063, that modifies the annual reporting requirements, Section 1086, that directs an independent \nassessment of DOD's reporting and policy on civilian casualties and in addition, this is on--this is on top of Section \n1057, which was in the FY-18 NDAA, which established a robust reporting mechanism for DOD, which is publicly \navailable, has been--which has been pointed out before. \n\nSecond, on this committee, we talk frequently about the ballooning of reports and the cost on DOD. This chairman's \nmark already imposes 240 new reporting requirements. That's a 34 percent increase on our FY-19 Bill and a 79 \npercent increase for the FY-18 Bill. Third, this is not the job of the DNI and our intelligence community should not be \ntasked in this matter. \n\nAs one of the few members who sits on both HASC and HPSCI, this raises significant jurisdictional issues. We have \nseen this amendment before and this is the first time HPSCI has ever waived jurisdiction.  \n\nWe're talking about the DNI, not the DOD here. So today, we started off in the subcommittee not being able to get a \nwaiver when we were talking about an Undersecretary for Defense, but yet now we can get a waiver from HPSCI \nwhen we're dealing with the DNI if we want to legislate on this, propose this amendment for the Intel Authorization \nAct, because it should not be included in this mark, which is one of the reasons--one of the key reasons why I \noppose it and lastly, for members who are serious about preventing civilian casualties, rather than this amendment, \nwe should agree to fully fund the DOD at $750 billion, which would restore readiness, it would modernize DOD and \nsupport surgical strikes and ISR training and operations that guarantee precise targeting with minimal civilian \ncasualties and collateral damage. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield back.   \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Right. Right. So just two points, first of all, I would be absolutely appalled if the Department of \nDefense would say that for $733 billion, they aren't as able to avoid targeting or hitting civilians. I--I would hope that \nwithin that range of money they--they would be able to do as good a job as they can do and the idea of an \nadditional $17 billion is going to make it less likely that we kill civilians, if that's true, that's a heck of an indictment \n\n\n\non what the Department of Defense is doing. I don't think it's true. I think the Department of Defense is working to \ntry to limit civilian casualties (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nSTEFANIK: Will the chairman yield since it's in direct response to my comments? \n\nSMITH: Sure. \n\nSTEFANIK: I appreciate that. As I said at the start of my comments, DOD has policies in place and as we heard \nfrom Mr. Waltz, takes very seriously civilian casualties to avoid them at all costs.  \n\nSMITH: And that's not the question I was arguing with. \n\nSTEFANIK: I--I highlighted the importance of an increased topline to rebuild readiness and to make sure we have \nthe capabilities for surgical strikes. \n\nSMITH: Right. And that's because--reclaiming my time. \n\nSTEFANIK: This is in addition to jurisdictional issues. Yield back. \n\nSMITH: Reclaiming my time. That--that's--that's what you said. The part that I'm quibbling with is the notion that \nsomehow an extra $17 billion is going to make it less likely that they inadvertently kill civilians. That's the part that \nI'm quibbling with. I--I don't think that--that is an accurate argument. I will--will also point out that you're right, there \nare a lot of reports in this Bill. \n\nRoughly half of those reports are Republican members' requests. A part of the reason we have so many reports is \nI've bent over backwards to try to meet members' requests to make sure that--that the committee was bipartisan \nand while I take the point that we ask--asking for reports does require something of DOD, our job is oversight.  \n\nThat's part of what we do. We have to try to balance that, but as I think in a bipartisan way, if you went back and \nsee who requested the reports, you would see, in a bipartisan way, we think exercising oversight is an important \npart of what we do and that's why--why--why we do it and certainly, part of oversight is trying to minimize civilian \ncasualties and keeping--keeping an eye on that issue. Mr. Mitchell, I believe you were next up. \n\nMITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Maybe it's getting late and I missed something, can you confirm for me that we \nactually have a waiver from the Intelligence Committee? Is that correct? \n\nSMITH: Oh, my goodness, we need a waiver? Yes, we have a waiver.  \n\nMITCHELL: Well, we jest about it, but we're talking a significant reporting requirement. \n\nSMITH: I jest about the impo--that the possibility that that hadn't occurred prior to you bringing it up-- \n\nMITCHELL: Oh, that's a (INAUDIBLE). I--I--it wasn't an indictment of your comment, sir. \n\nSMITH: --not about the importance--the importance of it. \n\nMITCHELL: (INAUDIBLE) comment. Cl--we--we talk about--we--we have a--we have a waiver from Intelligence on \nthis, which is signif--significant reporting requirements noted by many yet a one-word amendment to add the word \nsubsidy to last year's NDAA as it relates to Hu--Huawei--Huawei, excuse me, pronunciation, re--results in a referral \nto seven committees. Do we see some problem with how this is working? I--I--I-- \n\nSMITH: It didn't work--if the gentleman will yield. \n\nMITCHELL: Certainly, of course. \n\nSMITH: It--it didn't work any better when we were in the minority. \n\nMITCHELL: I'm sorry? \n\n\n\nSMITH: I said, it didn't work any better when we were in the minority. So I hear you, it's an imperfect process, as I \nsaid at the outline. I--I should also take this opportunity to point out that I was--the Intel Committee, actually, has \nbeen very cooperative. I was critical of them earlier, I apologize for them. I was wrong about what they were doing.  \n\nThey have actually been--been cooperative. So I appreciate the opportunity to publicly retract those comments. I \nyield back. \n\nMITCHELL: Well, re--re--reclaiming my time. I may suggest that I--if we go on the theory that every time we believe \nsomething's been overlooked when they were in the minority, this institution is not going to function very well long-\nterm. So while you didn't like how it functioned, you said it, we have to strive to find middle ground on some of this \nstuff. And I'll--I'll yield back, but I'm just astonished. I'll--I'll--I apparently mis-changed (INAUDIBLE). \n\nSMITH: If you can yield to me just one quick--quick point. \n\nMITCHELL: If you can, but Ms. Cheney's (INAUDIBLE) me. \n\nSMITH: Just ver--ver--very--very quickly, I didn't imply that it was better or worse in the minority or the majority, it's \nno different. I think it works the way it works and I think it works perfectly fine. We--we do work--work in a bipartisan \nway. \n\nMITCHELL: With all due respect, Mr. Chair, referral to seven committees for one word is pretty--I mean, maybe it's \nmy 35 years in private business, but I've got to say, oh, holy crap, you've got to be kidding. And I yield the \nremaining of my time to Ms. Cheney.  \n\nCHENEY: (INAUDIBLE) my time to Ms. Stefanik. \n\nMITCHELL: I'm sorry, Ms. who? \n\nCHENEY: I'd like to yield my time to Ms. Stefanik.  \n\nSTEFANIK: I just want to reiterate the point regarding the jurisdictional issues. Again, there are very few members \nthat sit on both HPSCI and HASC. I am one of them. This is an issue where at the beginning of this committee \nhearing, we were talking about an Undersecretary of Defense that we could not get HPSCI to waive for renaming, \nbut yet we are now asserting jurisdiction over the DNI.  \n\nThis is an overreach. This is not the oversight role of this committee. This should be in the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence and this should be debated as part of the Intel Authorization Act. I think this sets a bad \nprecedent and I think this further confuses and further complicates jurisdictional issues which are already tough \nenough between those two committees. Just wanted to reiterate that point. \n\nIt's important for members to know whether you're on HPSCI today or whether you have future members on HPSCI. \nI know many of these members are interested in serving on HPSCI. With that, I yield to Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Just real briefly, I am quite confident the military does not want to take responsibility for reporting for DNI \nmissions. That's--that's the concern here. This is a DNI mission, they should be doing the reporting and I--I know \nour military does not want to take responsibility for reporting on their operations. I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Is there further debate?  \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: I hesitate to get into quibbles, as you say, but as I have told you privately, I do think that while--\nwhile it is absolutely true both sides have used outside committee waivers to their advantage, I do think this year \nhas been different. It has been more restrictive, more difficult, more things have been referred to outside \ncommittees than before.  \n\n\n\nSo I do quibble that what's happened this year is the way that it's always happened. I think it has been different and \nit has been more restrictive on members and maybe it's been more restrictive on both Republicans and Democrats, \nbut it has been different.  \n\nSMITH: Further debate? All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed? \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSTEFANIK: I ask for a recorded vote. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Recorded vote has been requested. We'll suspend this vote until we are done with full \ncommittee mark. I should say, along those lines, I've been talking with the staff, it's possible that we might--\ndepending on how many stack up, we might want to do a series of votes before the very end, but that would only be \nin co--consultation with minority and there will be plenty of warning if we think it would help members that we don't \nget too far attenuated from where--where the debates were. \n\nSo keep that in mind. Like I said, I won't do that anytime soon. So if you need to take a break, you can take a break, \nbut we are considering that possibility. All right. Where are we at? We will now consider log number 334R1 by Mr. \nKhanna. And we'll recognize Mr. Khanna for the purposes of offering his amendment. \n\nKHANNA: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Well, the clerk--the clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, the reading of the amendment \nwill be dispensed with and the gentleman is recognized to discuss his amendment. \n\nKHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, noting the time I'll be brief. I was privileged to work with Representative \nMoulton and Representative Brown to offer a very simple amendment that reclaims Congress's constitutional role. \nThe amendment says that there can be no funds used to go to war with Iran unless the president first comes to the \nUnited States Congress to seek authorization to do so or if there is a threat of attack on the United States \nconsistent with the president's use of his powers under the War Powers Act. \n\nThis amendment should be noncontroversial. It's actually not even making a determination about a war on Iran. \nWhat's it's act--standing up for is the constitutional privilege of this body to decide on matters of war and peace. \nThat's Article 1 of the Constitution. Even this president has recognized that we have spent $7 trillion in endless \nwars, as he put it, in the Middle East and that has not advanced our own strategic interests, as articulated by this \nadministration, which worries that China is our greatest rival.  \n\nTo put it in some perspective, we're 24 percent of the world's GDP, China is about 15 percent, Iran is .55 percent. \nHistorians will wonder what we were doing in a region that is--accounts for 3.5 percent of global GDP if our focus is \nhow do we get ahead of China. There's a reason China hasn't been in a war since 1979 and has been devoting its \nresources to building its economy.  \n\nSo this amendment is to reassert our constitutional values, but it's also to prevent another strategic blunder that \ncould cost the United States the lead in the 21st Century. I yield back my time.  \n\nSMITH: Who seeks recognition? A whole lot of people. We'll go with seniority and go with Mr. Conaway.  \n\nCONAWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Did I miss the unanimous consent to go to three minutes?  \n\nSMITH: Yeah. It's five minutes, People, I believe. Yeah.  \n\nCONAWAY: Oh, thank you.  \n\n\n\nSMITH: But I'm confident you can do it in three. \n\nCONAWAY: The--the amendment would talk about a--an emergency that's created by the attack on the United \nStates as territories, possessions or Armed Forces is under attack by Iran, Iran's proxies, someone unrelated to \nIran altogether. What--what triggers the--the attack? If the--the gentleman would yield time to the gentleman to--to \nclarify as who--who is the attacker. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Khanna, you-- \n\nKHANNA: Which section is this referring to, the national emergency--(INAUDIBLE)--attack on--I mean, that would \nbe an attack by--by Iran or the pro--you know, or proxies of Iran. \n\nCONAWAY: So that's--that's how you interpret it, but that's not what it says.  \n\nKHANNA: I think that's-- \n\nCONAWAY: Anyway, the construction of it is I'm--I'm opposed to the amendment in general, but it seems to me that \nthe implication that Iran is the attacker is--should've been better clarified in the amendment itself to--to lay that out, \nbut I oppose the gentleman's amendment and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Brown. \n\nBROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I initially had concerns with this amendment and work closely with \nRepresentative Moulton and Representative Connor to make sure we did a few things and I'll use the previous \ngentleman's question as an example, we--we lift from the War Po--Powers Resolution the three conditions under \nwhich we could introduce our Armed Forces in hostilities and the same question could've been asked about the \nWar Powers Act.   \n\nWell, what attack; right? We can't introduce U.S. Forces in hostilities unless we are attacked. Well, attacked from \nwhom? Implicit in this, just like in the War Powers Act, is the attack from the entity to which we are responding. So \nin this case, it's Iran. We haven't altered the War Powers Act, we have not altered the inherent powers of the \npresident in the Con--from the Constitution nor the inherent powers that Congress has, our constitutional powers in \nterms of declaring war. \n\nWhat this is simply saying, and you see in the first par--paragraph in the findings, is there is no current authorization \nto introduce military forces in Iran today and maybe there will be some tomorrow, but there aren't today and if--and \nif--if there is, then this simply says you've got to come back to Congress just like you have to do under the War \nPowers Resolution that is current law.  \n\nSo it's really a clarification and a--and a statement by Congress that there is no authorization today to introduce \nArmed Forces in Iran. \n\nSMITH: Will the gentleman yield for questions? \n\nBROWN: Yeah. I'll--I'll yield, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: So in the War Powers Resolution, actually, it does not require Congress to approve before military action is \ntaken. The War Powers Resolution, I believe, starts a 60-day clock that the president, if he feels he has to act, he \ncan act, but he's got 60 days then to come to Congress if hostilities continue past 60 days. So this isn't even saying \nthat you can't do anything before you come to Congress. \n\nYou are--you are free--that's the whole purpose of the War Powers Resolution. I yield back to the gentleman. \n\nBROWN: Yeah. The--the--your--the War Powers Resolution has been interpreted as the--and certainly, you can \nnever def--deprive our Armed Forces of self-defense. It's been interpreted as allowing the president, for example, to \nintroduce forces to rescue and--and recover U.S. personnel that may be captured or--or harmed.  \n\n\n\nIt doesn't--it doesn't alter any of that. So again, it's just a statement from Congress that there is no authorization \ntoday to introduce our Armed Forces in Iran. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Gallagher. \n\nGALLAGHER: A question to clarify. First of all, I--I sort of like the spirit behind this, the attempt to insert Congress \ninto the question of war powers and I think my colleague has successfully done that on a related issue recently, but \nis there a precedent, and maybe this is a question for the sta--for the staff, for any sort of proactive anti-AUMF like \nthis that--that you could point to where we've said proactively that we are not authorized to go to war with this \ncountry?  \n\nSMITH: That's not really a staff question.  \n\nGALLAGHER: Well, then for the author of the amendment, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Okay. That--that's fine. It's--that's--that's--that's more of a policy call there as to whether or not there's a \nprecedent, because a precedent won't exactly-- \n\nMOULTON: Will the gentleman yield? \n\nKHANNA: I don't know, I--I wish there were. It would've saved us a lot of blunders in the last 15 years.  \n\nMOULTON: Will the gentleman yield? \n\nKHANNA: Yeah.  \n\nGALLAGHER: I'll yield.  \n\nMOULTON: No. There is no precedent, because I don't think there's been a time in American history when \nCongress is so abrogated its authority under the Constitution to make these decisions and where we've had \nrepeated conflicts under an authorization that is totally out of date, which is exactly the spirit of this amendment that \nyou refer to.  \n\nSo no, there is no--there is no precedent for this, but that's because I believe we're in an unprecedented situation. I \nyield back. \n\nGALLAGHER: So for--I thank you for that. So I--I guess my concern would be by making this a new standard, which \nactually inverts the war powers standard by--by doing a proactive anti-AUMF, you almost implicitly say, in every \ncountry around the world where we don't have such a proactive anti-AUMF, the administration or any administration \nhas latitude to do many different things. \n\nYou almost make it the new standard where Congress has to proactively act in this manner to prevent the \nExecutive Branch from acting and I don't want to see any sort of increase of Executive Branch war powers, which \nleads to my second question, are we currently in a national emergency situation with respect to Iran? \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry, are you yielding time to somebody or-- \n\nGALLAGHER: If--if either of the-- \n\nBROWN: I'll--I'll--I'll take that. I mean, look, the--the president has not declared a national emergency against Iran. \nNow, how we, in this body, want to characterize it is one thing, but Congress certainly hasn't declared war against \nIran. Congress has not passed a resolution specifically identifying Iran as having attacked the United States \nwarranting some sort of response. \n\nSure, there has been an escalation in the Middle East, but also of great concern has been language coming out of \nadministrative--administration officials that suggest that they have authorization to go in Iran and this is clarifying \nthat they do not.  \n\n\n\nGALLAGHER: So--so--so I would disagree, because indeed it has been the position of every single administration \nsince 1979, Republican and Democrat, since Carter onto the present day, that we are in a national emergency \nsituation with respect to Iran.  \n\nIt's been recertified and renewed in every single administration and therefore, I worry that actually, in Section 3, with \nthe criteria you've created, in attempting to restrain the Executive Branch, you've actually given them all the \njustification they need to make war with Iran, because indeed they are continuing tradition of saying, we are in a \nnational emergency situation with--national emergency situation with respect to Iran.   \n\nAnd two, we have multiple instances, in the past three decades, of Iran and its proxies attacking American forces. \nSo Iran has actually satisfied both criteria under Section 3 of your amendment. And so I just worry that this is \nactually doing the exact opposite of what it's trying to do and I yield the balance of my time. \n\nBROWN: Will the gentleman-- \n\nKHANNA: I mean, maybe-- \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry, the-- \n\nKHANNA: Sorry. \n\nSMITH: --the time ha--has been yielded and I believe both Mr. Khanna and Mr. Brown have already taken time on \nthis amendment. Mr. Gallego. \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield my time to Representative Moulton. \n\nMOULTON: Just to reiterate, there are no new authorities granted in this resolution. So it reiterates authorities \nunder the War Powers Act. Your idea that this gives the Executive Branch new authorities or more authorities is just \nnot true at all. The text of this admin--of this--of this amendment reiterates authorities that already exist. \n\nBut let just be real about the situation here, the reason why we're having this discussion is not only because this \nadministration and previous administrations have used the 2001 AUMF to justify wars that have nothing to do with \nthe September 11th attacks over the last two decades, but also because members of this administration, including \nsome of whom were the same people who pushed us into a war with Iraq have been war mongering to get us into \nIran and that's been patently clear from not only the press reports, but the briefings that we've had in Congress. \n\nI've fought Iranians on the ground in Najaf in 2004. I know that Iranian threat as well as anyone. If I wasn't \nconcerned about getting into a needless unnecessary war, we wouldn't have this discussion, we wouldn't have this \namendment and I'm sure that you would not have said that you like the spirit of this amendment because of the \nconstitutional situation we're in where Congress refuses to even have a debate about an authorization for the use of \nmilitary force. \n\nSo this amendment does not give any new authority to the Executive Branch, but it does send a very clear message \nthat perhaps for the first time since 2001, Congress might actually take the step to do our constitutional duty and \nhave a debate before another administration pushes us into an unnecessary war.  \n\nI have no problem whatsoever going to war with Iran if it's necessary, I'm just not confident in this administration \nthat they will make that decision on their own. And oh, by the way, they don't have the constitutional authority to do \nso. I yield my time to Mr. Brown.  \n\nGALLEGO: Well, I yield my time to--my remaining time to Representative Khanna. \n\nKHANNA: I just want to--I--I appreciate Representative Gallagher's thoughtful back and forth. I just want to make a \nclarification, there's a distinction between a national emergency classification, which is what we have with Iran and \na national emergency as defined by the War Powers Act, which requires a national emergency created by an attack \nupon the United States, its territory or its Armed Forces, which we haven't seen. \n\n\n\nSo those two things can't be conflated and I just echo Representative Moulton, this isn't giving any more authority, \nit's just reiterating what the War Powers is.  \n\nGALLEGO: I yield my remaining time to Mr. Brown. \n\nBROWN: Thank you. I just wanted to--I take the time to acknowledge that Representative Garamendi did also \ncollaborate on this and I yield my time back to Representative Moulton. \n\nSMITH: The microphone--the microphone is not on, but he (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nBROWN: I just want to acknowledge Representative Garamendi's work as well on this amendment and I yield my \ntime back to Mr.--Representative Gallego.  \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you. I yield my remaining time to Mr. Crow. \n\nCROW: Thank you, Mr. Gallego. And just to put a finer point on Mr. Khanna's earlier point about the conflation of \nthose issues, to be more specific, I--I--I think what my colleague from Wisconsin is conflating is as the War Powers \nResolution says an emergency that arises based on attack versus the Iranian sanctions, which are actually based \non the IEEPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is an economic emergency and that's the \nbasis that's been reauthorized over and over again for the Iranian sanctions and certainly not conflating those two, I \nthink, is important here. I yield back the remainder of the time.  \n\nSMITH: You want to take care of anybody else or--or are we good? \n\nGALLEGO: I--I think I may have put some words in my--so, you know, I am in 100 percent agreement with this \namendment. It--it was truly scary and deja vu to see what the mistakes and lies that led us up to the first Iraq War \nand like many of you, I also fought in that war and then to see this administration, you know, talk in the manner they \ndid to us in our briefings and their justification, without going into details, I think terrified us so much to the point that \nwe needed to act in whatever manner we can and this is, I think, one of the most quickest manners we can to \nrestrain the--any crazy attempts, again, to lead us to an unjust and irresponsible or like the last administration did. \nand I yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr. Waltz. \n\nWALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Moulton, you--you don't have a monopoly on fighting against the \nIranians on the ground in terms--in terms of credibility. There is precedent here, 1988-- \n\nMOULTON: Will the gentleman yield? I did not once say I have a monopoly, I said I understand it as well as \nanyone. \n\nWALTZ: Okay. I understand equally as well. So let's level the--the playing field on credibility. This is--I don't think is \nabout Article 1 versus Article 2 at all. I think it's very clear that this is aimed at this administration. The CENTCOM \ncommander requested forces to go to the Arabian Gulf based on credible intel that was multi-sourced that many of \nus were briefed on and the intelligence community, in those briefings, stated very clearly that a body of evidence \nshows the Iranians backed down with face with conventional force, they are aggressive when faced with weakness. \n\nWe have a body Iranian officers and leaders who learn from the lessons of the attacking Americans in Beirut. We \nchanged our policy and withdrew under the American--under the Reagan administration. We have a body of officers \nthat learned by killing Americans in Iraq we reacted against their proxies and not against Iran themselves.  \n\nMy concerns here are that this really has nothing to do with an AUMF against Iran. It is misguided. What--what's \nreally concerning is that it's unclear in terms of our ability to defend Israel. It's--there's no carve-out for allies. What \ndo we do if Israel comes under attack from Iran, Iran proxies, the Iranian threat network? What do we do in defense \nof a ship or a vessel in the Straits of Hormuz if an ally comes under attack? \n\n\n\nWhat do we do in terms of--Seventh Fleet right now is interdicting and conducting interdiction efforts in the Indo-\nPacific to--to thwart Iranian sanction evasion, Syrian, Yemen, Bahrain. I mean, we can go on and on in terms of \nproxies, threat networks and a number of--of incredibly complicated and difficult Iranian activities and essentially, \nwhat we're doing is we're taking options off the table when the maximum pressure campaign frankly is working.  \n\nWe did respond with strength. I commend the administration for not waiting until body bags were coming home \nbefore responding and we've seen an actually de-escalation in--in--in the theater. So I--I--I--I'm glad that we kind of \ngot past that whether this was really about Article 1, about Article 2. I think this is aimed at the administration. \n\nI think it takes options off the table right when--exactly when the policy is working and exactly when the United \nStates needs to look united abroad and not divided and I would encourage my colleagues to--to oppose this \namendment. Thank you.  \n\nMOULTON: Will the gentleman yield so we can respond? \n\nWALTZ: I do yield.  \n\nMOULTON: I think your question about limiting responses to an ally like Israel being attacked is very legitimate and \nthat should be a concern of everybody on this--on this committee, but there is nothing in this amendment that limits \nour ability to respond, because once again, it does nothing--it takes no power away from the War Power \nResolutions.  \n\nSo whether under existing law or under this provision being signed into law, the president could immediately \nrespond to such an attack by using the U.S. Military to defend Israel and then report to Congress with--within 48 \nhours under the War Powers Resolution and in that situation, it's hard to imagine we wouldn't do that. So there are \nnumerous provisions in existing law, including Section 201 of P.L. 110 409 that guarantees the U.S. will ensure that \nIs--Israel has a qualitative military edge to counter adversarial forces. \n\nNone of this does anything to diminish that, but it does, to your point, take options off the table. You're right about \nthat. It takes options off the table, but the only option it takes off the table are the unconstitutional ones. That's the \nwhole point of this amendment.  \n\nWALTZ: I've reclaimed my time. Yeah. So Mr. Moulton, I think--I--I think the difference here is we--we can argue the \nrest of the evening probably on the constitutionality and how this overlays with the War Powers Act, but my concern \nis the signal that's ascending both to our enemies and our allies at a--at a critical point in terms of the pressure \ncampaign. \n\nYou may disagree with the administration's policy, but I don't think it is appropriate or responsible to tie their hands \nwhen the adversary has a history of acting through proxies and has a history of acting against allies and interests \nnot directly against the United States.  \n\nMOULTON: We're only tying their hands to the United States Constitution.  \n\nSMITH: Seth, I'm sorry, you--you don't--you don't have the time. So gentleman's time has expired. If--if--I recognize-\n-recognize my--myself in this amendment. This--there's really no mystery here and this is something we've been \nafter for a while and were after during the Iran brief that we didn't get an answer to is we don't feel that the AUMF--\nthe 2001 AUMF or the 2002 AUMF should be used as an excuse to take action against Iran. \n\nThat is the purpose of this amendment, something--and the administration was given many opportunities to say \nthey wouldn't do that, they didn't say it. And yes, it's correct, we're--we're taking that option off the table, because \nwe feel that it is an unconstitutional abuse of that power and as Mr. Moulton has pointed out, this is not the only \nadministration. \n\nI mean, we've been through three administrations now that have taken that AUMF from 2001 and twisted it beyond \nall recognition to use it as a just--now, they have a lot of other justifications within the War Powers Resolution to \n\n\n\nrespond, as my colleagues have done a better job of explaining than I can, but the focus here is to say you \nshouldn't be able to use an inappropriate authority to engage that military activity, you should stay within the law. \n\nAnd the War Powers Resolution gives the president a fair amount of flexibility and a number of different options. Mr. \nTurner.  \n\nTURNER: This--there--there is just so many things that are wrong with this. I mean, let--let's start first with--with I--I \nthink Mr. Gallagher ought to just like get up and take a victory lap around the room on Mr. Moulton's statement that \nhe's fought Iran. I think that means that Iran fought him. I think he was a member of the Armed Forces and I think \nthat means--proves his argument that number three could be like checkmark satisfied even though that wasn't the \nintent. \n\nBut the--the worst part of this is just the legislative malpractice of the fact that this--this is just horrible language. I--I-\n-Mr. Moulton's statements of, well, of course, it gives them authority under the War Powers Act, no, it--it doesn't say \nthat. It actually says no funds and it doesn't say except for otherwise. It doesn't say NATO. It does--it doesn't say, \nyou know, under Article 5 of NATO, if Iran should attack one of our NATO allies that it's okay that it doesn't apply \nhere. \n\nIt says, no funds. I mean, it doesn't have any other exception clauses, except we've declared war, we specifically \nenact statutory actions or an attack is happening on the United States, not our allies. If they attacked at Iran, this is \nnot clear. I mean, this--it is not clear that it just--just of course, they could go--the United--the--the president would \nbe able to protect Iran--Israel if--if Iran was attacking them. \n\nThe--this--this is--is not even necessary contrary to like what has been--been said in the prior statements. There \nwas no statement by anybody from the administration that they have current authority to go into Iran and that's \nactually the words that were used in this hearing, into Iran--that they had authority to go into Iran. No one from the \nadministration has ever said that.  \n\nNow, if you don't want them to use the AUMF for the 2001, say that, don't say this. I mean, thi--this is like the--the \nworst language on something that could not be so incredibly--I mean, that is so incredibly important, I can't imagine \ndoing this, especially when you--when you consider our allies and this neighborhood and our interests in that \nneighborhood and what we try to do to help and support our allies in the area that you would just so blanketly try to \nrestrict-- \n\nYou know, again, there is so much in this Bill that is just--you know, I've--I never thought I would ever say thank \nGod for the Senate, but thank God for the Senate, because there is so much in this Bill that is just so horrifically \nwritten that it's never going to become law and--and--and thank God this is going to be one of them.  \n\nBut--but for goodness sakes, we could actually take the effort to draw legislation that is readable, understandable \nand that--that--that actually can be interpreted both within the protection of the United States or national security \ninterests on our allies and this certainly isn't it. I yield back.  \n\nGAETZ: Will the gentleman yield for a question? \n\nSMITH: He yielded back, but yes, we will pretend that didn't happen and he still has the time and if you wish to yield \nto Mr. Gaetz, you (INAUDIBLE). \n\nTURNER: Sure. I yield to Mr. Gaetz. \n\nGAETZ: So m--so my question is if there was language that simply said it's the sense of Congress that the 2001 \nAUMF--AUMF does not authorize force against Iran, would that satisfy the gentleman's drafting concerns?  \n\nTURNER: Say that again, I didn't hear you. \n\nGAETZ: So I was listening carefully to your argument and would it satisfy your concerns if, within the NDAA, we \nsaid it was the sense of Congress that the 2001 AUMF does not authorize hostility to Iran? \n\n\n\nTURNER: Well, I think it would satisfy what they said was their intent. At least you'd have something that was \nwritten in English comparable to what they're espousing as their intent.  \n\nGAETZ: So would you vote for that? \n\nTURNER: So I--I'm not voting for that, but again, there's no one from the administration that said they would do that. \nSo this is--this is outrageous steps to be taken for something that has--has never been said. It--it is--it is not \nsomething that--that is in front of us to even debate.  \n\nSMITH: He's got the time.  \n\nTURNER: Mr. Gaetz, I'll yield to you if you need additional time. \n\nGAETZ: Oh, thank you, Mr. Turner for yielding. I recall a briefing in the CVC where information was shared that is \nnot consistent with what you're saying to us regarding the connections between the 2001 AUMF and Iran. I--I know \nwe can't get too precisely into that and who said it, but these--the--the--the notion that the administration has never \nmaintained that there are elements of the 2001 AUMF that would authorize their hostilities toward Iran is not \nconsistent with my understanding of what they said to us. \n\nTURNER: Well, Mr. Gaetz, it's--it's--I can assure you that--that no one stood in front of you and said that the 2001 \nAUMF, on behalf of this administration, provided them sufficient authority to go into Iran. What they said was that \nthey would comply with all laws, both publicly and--and--and privately. It's the same statement.  \n\nSMITH: The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: I suspect that--I would suspect that if we would back down for just a few moments, all of us would \nwant to have a situation in which a resolution of Congress would proceed any war with Iran. We've seen that in past \nsituations, certainly, the Iraq 1 and 2 that occurred and it should occur if there is a situation in which we would \nengage a war with Iran.  \n\nThe language in this particular amendment is flawed and it has--and therefore has raised many, many questions \nthat I believe most of us would like to see resolved so that there is clarity that the House Armed Services \nCommittee would be in a position to carry out its constitutional obligation to declare war in what would be a very \nsignificant fight.  \n\nNow, the other purpose for this particular amendment is to make it clear that we believe that it is our obligation to \ndebate and to decide on behalf of the American people if we want to war with Iran. Now, as I said, the language \nbefore us was not what I had recommended. I think it--I would hope that what I had recommended would deal with \nsome of the concerns that have been expressed here, but I would like to see this go forward.  \n\nUndoubtedly, on the floor there will need to be clarity on this matter and I would urge all of us, Democrat, \nRepublican, Conservative, whatever to work together to make it clear that ambiguity that exists today could create a \nwar that we have not authorized and part of that is seen in the current language and Mr. Gallagher pointed it out \nvery clearly, the administration has been using the word emergency over and over again.  \n\nUnfortunately, the language here might actually lead to what Mr. Gallagher has correctly expressed a concern \nabout. We have to be very careful here that we write this thing carefully, but I would urge all of us that we shoulder \nthe responsibility that is given to us by the Constitution in which we agree to accept in our oath of office. Now, I'd \nlike us to go forward with this even though it is flawed, because it is a message to all of us that we need to address \nthis issue. \n\nIt may or may not pass, I don't know. I'm going to wind up voting for it even though I think there are flaws in it as \nwritten. I would like to see this on the floor. We have, for more than a decade, asked for a debate on the use of \nforce. Afghan 1 and Iraq 2 AUMFs have been discussed repeatedly, but have never been really debated on the \nfloor. We are on the cusp of another fight in the Middle East and we need to be involved. \n\n\n\nSo I want this to go forward. I see the flaws that have been brought forward by Mr. Turner and Mr. Gallagher and \nothers, but I think it's really, really important for us to say, okay, we've taken this up, you may know that it's not \nexactly right, but let it be known that this committee that has the fundamental responsibility of funding the military \nand making sure the military can win a war is going to be heard before that war commences. So with that, I yield \nback. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: I am very sympathetic with the constitutional concerns that have been expressed today and--and \nmany times previous, but I want to elaborate for just a second on Mr. Garamendi's point about flaws in this \nlanguage. The senior general officers responsible for operations on the Joint Staff and at CENTCOM were asked to \nlook at this language and say what difference it would make to them. \n\nTheir view is that if enacted, this language would limit the inherent right of self-defense at a time when we have \nspecific detailed incredible threats against the 65,000 military personnel in the CENTCOM AOR. It would \nimmediately stop purely defensive intel sharing, air defense and border security we are doing with partners in the \nregion. \n\nIt would stop active information-related capabil--information-related capabilities directly countering Iranian threat \nnetworks that members have more sensitive details about from CT and cyber-classified quarterly briefings. I just \nthink we need to be careful about what we do. That's what Mr. Garamendi said and that's some more specifics. I \nyield back.   \n\nSLOTKIN: Thanks. Can--can I actually just pose a question to Mr. Thornberry then? If the language was changed to \na simple one sentence along with what Representative Gaetz was suggesting, that nothing in the 2001 AUMF \nauthorizes war against Iran, a simple sentence in respect to the Constitution, would you support something like \nthat? \n\nTHRONBERRY: Uh, if the gentlelady will yield, I--I would certainly consider. The reason I hesitate is because--and--\nand we have not updated the 2001 AUMF. And therefore it has been used through the cour--expanded through the \ncourts to include ISIS and a--and a--and a variety of terrorist actors. I can't go into the detail, but Iran could be \ninvolved with some of those terrorist actors. But I'm talking about the terrorists, not the state of Iran. So you kind of \nsee the complication that--that's at least going through my mind. I do not believe, for what it's worth, the 2001 \nAUMF authorizes military force against the state of Iran. And I think--well, I'll--I'll just top there. \n\nSMITH: Will the--will the gentlelady yield? Could I-- \n\nSLOTKIN: Hold on one second. \n\nSMITH: Wait--ooh, sorry. Yes. Go ahead. \n\nSLOTKIN: So I mean, I would be in support of saying something as simple and as elegant as that. And I don't know \nhow to do it procedurally. But I think that is--it's a simple way to do it, it doesn't complicate things. I--I do think this is \na messy resolution, but still on net a positive thing to do. I would say to Mr. Turner, to be intellectually honest, and \nwithout going into classified details, the pres--in--in alignment with what Representative Gaetz said, we were \nabsolutely presented with a full formal presentation on how the 2001 AUMF might authorize war on Iran.  \n\nYes, I'm--sir--I'm sorry, sir, Secretary Pompeo said it with his own words. He did not say, I want to go to Iran and I'm \ngoing to use 2001. He referenced--I don't want to go into the details. He referenced a relationship between Iran and \nAl-Qaeda. And--and I--and I will tell you that it goes to the heart--yes, sir. Just let me finish. \n\nSMITH: Will the gentlelady yield-- \n\nSLOTKIN: I'd like to be the one woman recognized in this conversation. The--there is--to me, once he opened that \ndoor, he asked for an answer. And to me, the one sentence that I understand maybe still don't feel like, you know, \nit's a--if it's a messaging thing that people are concerned about, maybe they can vote for nothing. But that to me \n\n\n\nseems the minimalist way that we can still preserve the constitutional rights of this body to authorize military force. \nAnd I yield to Mr. Turner, since I ref--reference him specifically. \n\nTURNER: Thank you. I--I have a great deal of respect for you, as you know. And when the--the time that we spent \ntogether in Munich talking about national security issues and on the panel together. So I appreciate that you have--\nhave clarified your concern about your perception of what the secretary of state has said. Your--I understand your \nextrapolation from that statement to this concern. It was not a nexus that was expressly stated. But I understand \nyour extrapolation and--and your concern from there. So thank you for--that's incredibly honest and--and clear, and \nI understand that. \n\nThe--I didn't share the same concern because I believed the--the--the very public statement that he has made later, \nand--and clearly of--of--that they would be following the law. My issue and concern is--and because I--I've been \nhere and I--I--where--and I was incredibly opposed to our action in Libya. I think the unbelievable toll of civilians has \nbeen incredible. The war mongering that occurred there, there was no nexus to--to the AUMF of--of--of 2001. And \nyet we went in and did full on regime change. Loretta Sanchez and--and I went all the way to the command--up the \ncommand, to--to try to get clarify as to why Congress--where--to force Congress to be able to have a--a voice, \nwhich I think could have stopped it. \n\nMy concern is--is that--that we're--we're--because people are trying to be protective of what might happen, that \nwe're making mistakes, of what we could be doing wrong. And--and I--I--I just am very concerned about this \nneighborhood. I--I--I--I don't think that that one sentence concludes the debate. I think, I--I--I think this is premature. \nBut I--I share everyone's concern. I mean I certainly believe that--that the--that the president of the United States, \nthe administration should come to us if Iran is going to--to--if they're going to go to Iran. So I'm--I share your \nconcerns. \n\nBROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To me there is no ambiguity in this language. It prevents the United States of \nAmerica from defending our allies should there be an attack by Iran on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, \nKuwait, Israel, Jordan, whomever. And I hope everybody will just look at the language and decide for themselves \nwhat it says. Paragraph B, in general except as provided in subsection C, i.e., except in subsection C, none of the \nfunds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense, or to any other \nfederal department or agency, may be used for any use of military force in or against Iran. \n\nWell, let's go to C then. What are the exceptions? There are three. Quote, exceptions, the limitation in subsection B \nshall not apply if, one, Congress has declared war, and there's the delay to do that; two, Congress has enacted \nspecific statutory authorization for such use of military force that meets the requirement of the war powers \nresolution, and such authorization is enacted after the date of the enactment of this act, again a delay, in the \ndefense of our allies; or three, a national emergency is created by an attack upon the United States, its territories, \nor possessions, or its armed forces. \n\nSo if we get intelligence that Iran is about to attack one of its neighbors in the Middle East, an ally of ours, this \nlanguage prohibits the United States from preventing that kind of attack, from interceding and saving the lives that \notherwise would be lost. For that reason, I urge this committee to vote against it. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Two points. I agree too that the 2001 AUMF does not apply to Iran. If we--but if \nwe want to make that clear, we ought to just make that clear. This--the 2001 and 2004 AUMFs do not apply to Iran. \nI think we keep it that simple. And the second part is, and Mr. Brooks and Mr. Waltz have hit on it, there has--if \nwe're going to go with this wording, you have to have something about allies. Because we have units in Israel, \nSaudi Arabia, Jordan, and so forth. Missile defense forces--if--if our ally is under attack, can our missile defense \nforces be used to interdict ballistic missiles going to Israel. This would not permit it. Because this just talks about \ndefe--only if our forces are under attack, not our allies. \n\nSo there has to be some kind of addition for allies in this. And I would suggest a more simple line about the AUMF \ndoes not apply. Thank you. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Thank you.  \n\nBANKS: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: We've--we--we had a couple other people. This is a robust, important debate; if you have new points to \nmake, that--that's appreciated. But I think we've made very strong points. Appreciate that. But we do have two \npeople who have requested time, three people. So Mr. Banks. \n\nBANKS: Here--here we are, 17 hours after starting this hearing. I've been--I've been scratching my head and \nlooking for many ways to overlook many of the issues in this bill that I don't agree with, in hopes that we can move \nan NDAA forward to the Senate, and hopefully the Senate can fix many of the problems. But what we have in front \nof us right now is an amendment. The senior general officer is responsible for operations of the joint staff and \nCENTCOM say would actually make America less safe, and would prevent us from protecting our allies like Israel. \n\nAnd that's where I draw the line. That's where I say, enough is enough. If this amendment passes, there is no way I \ncould--I could vote for this NDAA. Whether you agree with it or not, we have to ask the question of what is it going \nto take to get this N--NDAA over the finish line, pass it through the full House of Representatives when it passes out \nof this committee, and pass it forward, so that we can support our troops, so that we can secure America's national \nsecurity, which is why each and every one of us, Republican or Democrat, sits on this committee to begin with.  \n\nWe've spent 17 hours debating ways to support our military, protect America, keep America safe and secure. And \nright now we have an amendment--amendment in front of us that senior military leadership, not--not political \nappointees, but senior military leadership tell us would make American less safe and secure. I--I hope that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, especially those of you who are new, will think very deeply about that, \nand--and oppose this amendment with the rest of--with the rest of us. With that, I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Mr.--Mr. Khanna, if I could ask you, because I--I think there are many members on this \ncommittee who are very adamant about making sure that the legislative branch upholds its side of the bargain here, \nand that we don't use the 2001 AUMF or existing authority to supersede the War Powers Resolution, to \nsuperseded--to act like Congress has given authority that it hasn't given. A lot of people want to do that. A lot of \npeople are very uncomfortable with the actual language here.  \n\nSo I would like you to explain clearly how within this language--and please don't tell me who's vetted it, and who's \nagreed to it, and who likes it--just in a plain honest conversation, how this language doesn't create the problems \nthat are being described about allies being attacked, and whether or not we can respond to that within Article 5 of \nNATO and elsewhere. Just plain language conversation--protect that. \n\nKHANNA: Well, first I--I appreciate the conversation, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate the constructive criticisms. I \nknow they come from a place of intellectual debate, which is what this committee should be for. The resolution \nallows the president the authority under the War Powers Act. Section 8 of the War Powers Act allows the president \nof the United States to take immediate action if there is a threat or an imminent threat to our troops or any treaty \nally. That means under the current law, if this--if we didn't do anything, under the War Powers Resolution, this \npresident, if Israel was attacked tomorrow, could take action, doesn't need the authorization of Congress, and \ndoesn't have to come to Congress till 60 days. \n\nNothing any of us can do changes that president's authority to do that either if our troops are attacked or if Israel is \nattacked under the current law, unless we repeal the War Powers Resolution that was passed in 1973. So by \nhaving which was Representative Brown's suggestion, actually the original draft that was drafted--and by the way, \nyou can disagree with who helped look through the resolution that was drafted by, you know, the national security \nnetwork, which are, you know, you can disagree with it, but these are serious-- \n\nSMITH: Reclaiming my time, if I could ask one quick question about that. \n\nKHANNA: Yeah. \n\n\n\nSMITH: And--and that makes sense that the War Powers Resolution still applies. But the War Powers le--legis--\nlegislation--sorry, it's a piece of legislation. So if we pass legislation, it alters said piece of legislation. Well, it \ndepends on how we pass it. And it says, except as provided in subsection C, none of the funds authorized to be \nappropriated or otherwise made available to Department of Defense. Basically you can't have any money to go to \nwar with Iran, period, except if Congress has declared war, Congress has enacted specific statutory authorizations \nfor such use of military force that meets the requirement of the War Powers Resolution, or a national emergency is \ncreated. It doesn't say in those exceptions, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution.   \n\nBROWN: Mr. Chairman, if you'll yield for just-- \n\nSMITH: Yes. I--I will yield to the gentleman to answer that> \n\nBROWN: Yeah. I mean the very last section says nothing in this act may be construed to abrogate the restrictions \nrelated to the use of force or to relieve the executive branch reporting requirements as set forth in the War Powers \nResolution. I mean, in anticipating that concern, are we altering--that's in the--that's in the--the end of the-- \n\nSMITH: Yeah. I'm looking at it. \n\nBROWN: In anticipating that concern that, hey, you're modifying the War Powers Act, that's why that was put in \nthere.  \n\nSMITH: All right. So leading--reading that last section it says, nothing in this act may be construed to abrogate the \nrestrictions related to the use of force or to relieve the Executive Brance--so basically it says it doesn't change the \nWar Powers Resolution, which empowers the president to--to basically deal with the situations that other people \nhave been raising here, to basically act if our allies are attacked. That--that makes sense to me. Mr. Bishop. \n\nBISHOP: Mr. Chairman, look, I--I appreciated what people have been saying here. And not that I'm a wonderful \nwordsmith, but everyone has been talking about something that I think we could if there were time easily come up \nwith language that would satisfy the concerns. When you tried to explain this bill, I thought it was very direct and to \nthe point. Unfortunately what you were saying is not necessarily the same as this bill. If indeed that last--that last \nportion of it does not change anything, then it is redundant. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, I would ask you, this is one of those things that if it were in the bill could change the actual \nvote on this. If it were given time to work out something that could be taken to the floor, I think you have enough \npeople talking here that you could talk about how to actually implement this, how it would impact our allies, \nspecifically NATO and Article 5. In addition to which, put some timelines in here. How far back in history does some \nevent have to take place in which-- \n\nSMITH: And would the gentleman yield-- \n\nBISHOP: And so I'm--I'm begging you to think that if we were to back off on this at this point, and give some time to \nwork on it, your assurances to everyone else that we will bring something to the floor, that would be a solution. \nBecause I don't think everyone is that far away from a potential solution. \n\nSMITH: Right. If the gentleman will--will yield. \n\nBISHOP: I'll--I'll just quit and you can have the time. \n\nSMITH: All right. What--whatever works. I--I tend to agree with that. And let me just say, I--I remember a dozen \nyears ago now when--when we tried to update the AUMF in 2001. And that is not an easy thing to do. When you \nstart getting into the language here, it is incredibly complicated and very difficult. And everybody is going to \ninterpret it in 1,000 different ways. And I will tell you, and I want to make clear in this NDAA, that you have to follow \nthe law and follow the Constitution before you go to war with Iran. I absolutely want to do that. And we absolutely \nwill do that.  \n\n\n\nIt was my initial preference to do that on the floor. This amendment was worked out by a bunch of people. I am \ntroubled by this amendment. Now I--because--and I--I can walk through it, and I can reach Mr. Khanna's \nconclusion, as we just did, I can walk through it and reach other conclusions. I would prefer if we took this up on the \nfloor so that we could get the language the way that we wanted it to. That however is up to Mr. Khanna. It's his \namendment. He's offered it. I believe there has been a good faith discussion in a bipartisan way. And I'm under no \nillusion here. I know that a fair number of Republicans, no matter how we word this, aren't going to vote for it. But \nwe do have a majority in the House, and would be able to pass this on the floor whether--whether they agreed to it \nor not. And I think there are many Republicans who would agree to it. \n\nI think it would be good for this committee if we could withdraw this amendment and work on this on the floor, given \nhow complicated and difficult the issue is for constitutional lawyers, let alone all of us who are--who are trying to \nunderstand it. Mr. Khanna. \n\nKHANNA: Well, Mr. Chairman, out of respect for you and your leadership and others, I'm happy to do that \nultimately. But I want to make a couple points before that. \n\nSMITH: Please. \n\nKHANNA: First of all, to Representative Gallagher's point, in 1982 the Boland Amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations Act, actually did prohibit the use of funds to overthrow the government of Nicaragua or promote a \nmilitary exchange before Nicaragua or Honduras, that was preempted. Second, I fundamentally believe that this \nlanguage as Representative Brown, and Representative Moulton, and I, and many constitutional lawyers have \ndrafted, addresses all the concerns that other people have raised. I just want to make that clear. There is nothing \nthat limits the president from engaging in actions to defend our troops, or imminent threats, or any of our allies, or \nIsrael.  \n\nYou will understand the skepticism of people who have been trying to stop bad wars, when people who have \nsupported a lot of those wars are suddenly picking at the language and saying, let's wait, let's do other things. Now \nI am taking in good faith the suggestions of Representative Bishop and Representative Gaetz. I mean \nRepresentative Gaetz and I don't agree on many things, but he's been very principled on a lot of non-intervention \nissues. And other members on the other side, and Representative Moulton and Representative Brown and I talked, \nand we would like to see a genuine--if we can get a bipartisan effort, we would prefer that \n\nSMITH: And my--and my commitment to you is, if we get a bipartisan effort, that's great. But my commitment is, \neven if we can't get a bipartisan effort, we will have a vote on the floor on this issue. And--and the language \nproblem--and this is what I went through with on the AUMF, I'd write it up, I'd show it to one group of people, they'd \nsay, okay, Well, this is clearly what it means. I'd show it to another group of people just as knowledgeable, and they \nwould say the exact opposite, looking at the exact same language.  \n\nSo there--there are a lot of complications to work through here. And the simpler is the better. I think we've covered \nthis. If the gentleman would withdraw, he has my absolute commitment that I want language in this bill that makes \nclear that there will not be an unconstitutional war in Iran. And we will be committed to doing that on the floor. This \nlanguage I don't think at the moment is going to get us there. So if you would withdraw, we will continue to have \nthat discussion and make sure that it's ready for the floor. You have my commitment on that. \n\nKHANNA: Out of respect for your leadership, I will withdraw the amendment.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I appreciate that. With that amendment withdrawn, where we at here? Next is log number 306 \nby Mr. Moulton. You are recognized on your amendment. No, sorry. Mr. Moulton, you are  recognized. I'm sorry, \nyou have to say you have-- \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the \namendment. And the gentleman's recognized to discuss. \n\n\n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase the authorized number of Afghan special immigrant \nvisas in the chairman's mark by 4,000 visas. I want to acknowledge and thank the chairman for his work to \nauthorize an additional 300 visas in the underlying bill. But there is still so much more work to be done. Congress \ncreated the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program to bring safety to the brave men and women who risked their \nlives to help the U.S. mission on the ground in Afghanistan, who risked their lives not just for their country, but for \nours.  \n\nThese brave people looked at America and believed in the ideas behind our nation so strongly, that they were \nwilling to risk their lives to bring those freedoms to their country. And their support for our mission exposed them to \ndirect threats, and jeopardized their safety and that of their loved--loved one. Those risks remain. But in recent \nyears the SIV backlog has continued to grow. Congress has struggled to provide enough visas to bring our allies to \nsafety here in America. Thousands of Afghans are still waiting on the safety that only comes from within our \nborders.  \n\nSo I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives Waltz and Crow, for cosponsoring this amendment and for their \nsupport for the program. They have their own very personal stories to share about the invaluable support they \nreceived from their partners in Afghanistan and Iraq. So I look forward to working with the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and Mr. Waltz and Crow, to ensure we live up to the promises we made to our friends and partners. But I \nwill be withdrawing the amendment so that we can find funding sources for it. With that I'd like to lead--excuse me, \nI'd like to yield my time to Representative Waltz.  \n\nWALTZ: Thank you, Representative Moulton. And thank you for your leadership on this. Not only do I share your \ncommitment to finding--funding for this important program to increase this cap, but I also share your commitment to \ngetting to the bottom of why this State Department is having such a hard time approving providing these important \nvisas. I'll just--you know, we all have our--our stories. I've sponsored Afghans coming over here. I've also lost \nAfghans who were executed along with members of their family while on the waiting list, which is now over 50,000.  \n\nI just can't overstate how dangerous it is for not only for these--for these men and women, but their entire families to \nwork with us. And I can't overstate what a strategic issue it is for our armed forces. Allowing these Afghans and \nIraqis to be killed who have worked with us, or deploying forces without effective interpreters and translation \nsupport, is like deploying them without radios. They are--they are ineffective in talking to--in talking to the populace. \nAnd right now they're getting the signal loud and clear that America won't live up to its word. So I thank you again \nfor your leadership and I share your commitment to--to improve this program. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. \n\nMOULTON: Thank you, Mr. Waltz. \n\nSMITH: Gentleman, yield back. \n\nMOULTON: I'd like to yield my remaining time to Mr. Crow, Mr. Chairman, if that's all right.  \n\nSMITH: Yes.  \n\nCROW: Thank you, Mr. Moulton, for your leadership on this issue, and Mr. Waltz as well. I would reiterate that there \nis a--a very important moral element to this that we have folks across the world, and obviously particularly in \nAfghanistan, who have risked their lives and put everything on the line for our country, and for what we represent, \nand what we have been fighting for. And we certainly have to honor that. But there's also another dimension to this \nas well. And that is a national security dimension. And our ability to operate in many places throughout the world \nrelies on our ability to actually recruit interpreters and local support.  \n\nAnd if folks do not think that our word is good, that we will honor them, that we will protect them and their families, \nwe will not be able to recruit that support, we will not be able to communicate with local populations, and we will not \nbe effective in many places in the world. So we have to maintain our moral credibility, as Well, as our logistical \ncredibility, and be able to honor our promises to folks. I yield back the remainder.  \n\n\n\nSMITH: Thank you. And just so--I'm sorry, if-- \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman, I yield. \n\nSMITH: Every year we try to get as many visas--the problem is it's a mandatory score. For whatever bizarre \nreason, we got to come up with mandatory money in order to fund these. We searched for as much mandatory \nmoney as we can. And we'll continue to do that once we get in conference. It is an important issue. With that, the \namendment is withdrawn. And next up is log 501 by Mr. Thornberry. For what purpose does this gentleman seek \nrecognition?  \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, reading of the amendment will be dispensed \nwith. Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHRONBERRY: Mr. Chairman, this may classify as tilting at windmills, but it has been a bipartisan admittedly issue \nthat we continue to require reports, written reports, when briefings and other information transmission would often \nsuffice. As was noted earlier in the underlying chairman's mark, there is a 34 percent increase in the number of \nreports this year over last year. It's a 79 percent increase over the year before. In the last two months, Pentagon \nhas sent 24 reports to us at an average cost of $60,000 for each report. So just the increase, and this doesn't \ninclude any of the amendments, anything we've done today, just the increase in the underlying mark is about $14 \nmillion.  \n\nIf you look at the 1,149 reports that were required in last year's NDAA, that's about $70 million. Some of it is \nabsolutely necessary. But too often we default to a requiring a report without considering the cost. I don't get rid of \nany of them. All this amendment does is says they all expire at the end 2021, so that if we need it, we can renew it. \nBut let's just not have these things go on forever. I yield. \n\nSMITH: I am willing to accept this. It's late. We could fight about this forever. We have other things to fight about. \nYou know, we'll have to discuss it going forward. Because there are some of these--some of these reports are more \nimportant than others. And look, part of the problem, as you know, and this is not peculiar to this administration, \nDepartment of Defense is not always terribly cooperative about providing information with Congress. So we get \npissed, and we put it into the law, and we force them to do it. If there was a better dialogue between us, we would \nbe better off.  \n\nBut if we could promise not to debate this further, I'll go ahead and accept it. And--and we'll figure out if there are \nperhaps some reports that we want to make sure we preserve, we'll look at it more closely, and maybe limit it to the \nnumber of reports that are sunsetted in 2021, to ones that are more, I don't know what the word would be, less \nimportant than the others. Let's put it that way. Is there further discussion? Hearing none, all those in favor of the \namendment will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nSMITH: Opposed? The amendment is adopted. Mr. Kelly is now up with log 224. For what purpose does this \ngentleman seek recognition? \n\n[*]KELLY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  \n\nSMITH: The clerk will pass out the amendment. And without objection, reading of the amendment is dispensed with. \nThe gentleman is recognized.  \n\nKELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm offering this amendment because the report language that I'm moving to \nstrike is presumptive and would bias the outcome of the report. Mr. Chairman, as we all know, we have a periodic \nreview board process which determines if detainees no longer pose a threat to national security and can be \ntransferred, spec--specifically talking about Guantanamo Bay. And I understand that many of my friends on the \n\n\n\nother side of the aisle think that this process, the periodic review board, is too slow, that it doesn't move fast \nenough.  \n\nBut this is an area that we can't afford to be at 80 percent, 85 percent correct, 96 percent correct. This is one where \nwe have to be 100 percent correct. It requires due diligence, more than almost anything else that we do. And when \nwe're talking about Guantanamo Bay, it's a very partisan issue at times. But I was fortunate enough when I first \ncame here four years ago to be able to go on a trip to Guantanamo Bay. Just like I visited the border. And because \nI was taking other people's words on these things. And I believed what other people told me. And so I had this \nperception in my mind of what we were talking about. And when I got there it was absolutely not true of what I had \nin my mind based on other people's thoughts.  \n\nAnd I would just tell you, in other places it references the closing of Gitmo, or we talk about bringing Gitmo \ndetainees to the United States for medical treatment, and there's a whole lot of different ways that we talk about. \nBut here's what I say, Mr. Chairman. When you visit there, these are not--the numbers will shock you of how many \nthere are really that are there. It's not--it's not a great number.  \n\nSo knowing how many people are there, first of all, we're not talking about this large population. We're talking about \na very finite amount of human beings who have been detained for crimes in war, war crimes, or war acts. These \ndetainees are not some good people. So you will hear stories of detainees, and what this person only did this small \nthing, and so they should be released, or they should do this. They are the worst of the worst.  \n\nAnd in Iraq in 2005, I don't mind rules of war, and I get rules of engagement, and I get things I don't like even as a \nsoldier. But I--I literally captured soldiers for trying to blow me up, sent them through the judicial process in Iraq, and \nbefore I left home they had been released, and that same person tried to blow me up again. We can't afford to \nmake a mistake and put these people back.  \n\nWe can't rush the decision. We can't be time driven. We have to be 100 percent correct that they do not go back on \nthe streets to try to kill more Americans or our allies. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I ask people to support my \namendment to strike the language. And I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The issue here, there are broader issues, and we will debate a number of different issues here, \nand you kind of threw a bunch of them into this one amendment. This--this one amendment is focused on-- and I \ndon't know what the number of individuals is, but it is a very small number of individuals who have been cleared for \na repatriation. In other words, they have been determined not to be a threat.  \n\nIt's also worth noting that a lot of people who were rounded up at Gitmo early on, it was a little chaotic when they \nwere doing it at the start. And they weren't all people who had blown people up. A lot of times, better safe than \nsorry. And we have repatriated a lot of them.  \n\nAnd we're not even saying in--in the part that you're striking, you have to send these people back. All we're asking \nis, okay, you cleared them some time ago, and this is the Trump administration that's going to be making this \ndecision, not the Obama administration. They've been cleared by the Trump administration. Trump administration \naccepted that.  \n\nAnd they have not been yet released from Guantanamo and sent back to a country. We would like to know where \nthat process is at and why. So all of your arguments tonight, we'll get to some other portions of this, where what \nyou say, we can--but on this portion, it doesn't really make sense that we wouldn't ask why aren't you repatriating \nthese people. And wouldn't be that hard for them to tell us. They just haven't.  \n\nAnd so that's all we're asking here. So I mean there may be some other parts of this where we have clear \ndisagreement on. But I wouldn't think we would have that big a disagreement on--on this piece of it. And with that, \nI'll yield to Ms. Sherrill for five minutes.  \n\nSHERRILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I just wanted to make clear that these were several individuals, not the--\nthe full group, who had been cleared for repatriation. Several of them have been successfully repatriated I believe in \n\n\n\nGuam, and Pilau, and South America. And reports have--have detailed who those people were. I think some of \nthem are Uighurs from--from China that were kind of swept up in a bit of a dragnet and should not have been. And \nthat is why they were cleared for repatriation.  \n\nIt--it is a very lengthy detailed process. It's--it's--it took years for them to get to that point and for the United States \ngovernment to convince itself that they in fact should not have been put in Guantanamo in the first place, and were \nnot terrorists, and should be repatriated elsewhere. So--so this is a small subset, not people that were picked up on \nthe battlefield, that had presumably committed some of the bad acts. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Hartzler. \n\nKELLY: Will--will the gentlelady yield, or has she yielded back, Mr. Chairman?  \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry. Ms. Hartzler has the time. If you wouldn't mind yielding a quick minute, Mr. Kelly, that would be \nhelpful. Ms. Hartzler?  \n\nHARTZLER: I--I will yield a minute, just after I make a point here.  \n\nSMITH: Sure. \n\nHARTZLER: So I support the gentleman's amendment. But I just wanted to share some facts, that I've been to \nGuantanamo three times, Gitmo. There were originally 779 detainees. And there are 40, 40 that remain. Ten faced \ncharges under military commissions, 30 are indefinite law of war detainees. And so we're only talking about 40 \nindividuals.  \n\nAnd the language in the underlying bill says that the lack of transfers is having a substantial negative impact on the \nfunctioning of the process and other proceedings, as Well, as the detainee population. The committee believes the \nrepatriation process should recommence immediately and urges the administration to facilitate the transfer process \nwithout delay.  \n\nI just, you know, disagree with that. I mean a lot of the people have already been transferred. We only have 40 left, \nand--and ten are under the military commissions. They're facing charges. And there's 30 that are really, really bad \npeople, that helped organize attacks on our country, so-- \n\nSMITH: Will the gentlelady yield for just one quick second? \n\nHARTZLER: Yes. \n\nSMITH: Does staff know how many people out of those 40 are currently have been deemed to be eligible for \nrepatriation, and how many we're talking about in this amendment? \n\nUNKNOWN: I believe that's five.  \n\nSMITH: Right. So again, it's--it's late. And there are a lot of other things to debate on Guantanamo. But if we can \nstay focused on--on the five here that have been declared eligible for repatriation, and argue why we shouldn't ask \nthe administration, why haven't they been repatriated when the decision has been made. And I'm with you. \n(INAUDIBLE) that we talk about that. We're not talking about--we're talking about five that have already been \ndeclared to be re--repatriatable, if that's a word. And the purpose of this is to say, yeah, why haven't you sent them \nback. Focus on those five. I yield back.  \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you. Reclaim my--reclaim my time. The wording in the underlying bill though says the \ncommittee believes a lack of transfers poses serious--makes it sound like there's a--a huge amount of people, and \nthey have need to be immediately--I'm not aware of the five, but I will yield to the gentleman from Mississippi.  \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, and--and I think that is my argument, that's the main problem that I have, is that I'm a \nwordsmith and--and I'm sorry, but words matter, and they have meaning in each and every one. And that may be \n\n\n\npart of going through war college where you had to write in too few words. You couldn't--but--but it almost sounds \nlike we direct them to come out with the outcome that we want, Mr. Chairman. And I don't know that that's your \nintent. But if--if our intent is, if you take this out and you say, we urge the administration to facilitate the transfer \nprocess without delay, I have no issue with those words.  \n\nWhat I do have issue with is the committee believes that the lack of transfer poses serious policy and human rights \nconcern, and that the lack of transfers is having substantial negative impact on the functioning of the PRB process \nand other proceedings, and on and on, as Well, as the detainee population and joint task force Guantanamo \npersonnel. The committee believes repatriation process could recommence immediately. I'm okay with the order, \nyou know, saying some of that. But I think almost we're directing the outcome that we want to get. And that is my \nissue with the words. Sometimes I think shorter is better and less is better when those words matter (INAUDIBLE). \n\nSMITH: If the gentleman will yield, actually-- \n\nKELLY: Absolutely-- \n\nSMITH: Ms. Hartzler will yield, it's her time.  \n\nHARZLER: Yes.  \n\nSMITH: Yeah. You--you can't almost direct someone legislatively. Either you direct them or you don't. Now I--I will \ngrant you that there--there is encouraging language there. But we--we are not directing them. But I don't mind \nsoftening that language a little bit. I'm just trying to figure out process-wise how we do that. I don't want to mess \naround with an amendment to the amendment at this hour in the morning. I'm willing to accept the gentleman's \namendment and we'll work on something a little more user-friendly for the floor. And we'll--we'll work with you on \nthat, unless someone has a strong objection to that approach.  \n\nKELLY: Thank you, chairman.  \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the amendment? \n\nHARTZLER: I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Oh, thank you, sorry. All those in favor, say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nSMITH: Opposed? Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. Mr. Kelly, we're back with you on log 225. For what \npurpose do you seek recognition?  \n\nKELLY: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will pass out. And without objection, the reading is dispensed with. Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: Once again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time. And before I get into this, I--I want to thank you for the \nhard work and--that--that you've put in on this entire--this entire NDAA. And I think I told you early on, I made a bet \nwith folks that I thought you would get this done, and get it done on time, and in a bipartisan way. And I still believe \nthat this deep into the process. So let's get there, Mr. Chairman.  \n\nThis amendment would strike Section 1034 of the chairman's mark, which is a sense of Congress stating that the \nSec Def should take into account standard of care at facilities administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. \nThese people do not need to be housed on United States soil, ever. Gitmo is the most appropriate and safest place \nto hold these detainees. The medical care and treatment facilities there, including the people we can--experts we \ncan fly in for specific needs or--or things that they need done at Guantanamo Bay, we can provide any level of care \nthere that they need and provide the experts there without bringing them to the United States.  \n\n\n\nAs a former district attorney, and looking at the immigration laws, and all the issues, and all the federal laws we \nhave with people claiming asylum, whichever side you're on, the problem is, is we don't know at what point they \ntouch American soil. If they claim asylum in the right court at the second they--then we have a two year court battle, \nwhere some of these people who are the worst of the worst are now on U.S. soil with the opportunity to stay here. \nAnd so I urge you to support this amendment. Let's look at ways to improve the medical facilities there or the \nmedical treatment there. But let's do not take an opportunity to bring people who should never come to the United \nStates, to give them the opportunity to harm more Americans. And with that I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Ms. Sherrill. \n\nSHERRILL: I would just like to bring to the attention of the committee that we now have about 40 detainees and it \ncosts about 4.5 million each year per detainee, which is 55 times the cost of holding an individual in a federal prison \nhere. The difficulties of providing medical care on the island are increasing as the population ages. So we expect \nthat cost to go up. And the United States already safely holds more than 400 terrorists in federal prisons across the \ncountry, including the 9/11 plotter, the Boston Marathon bomber, the shoe bomber, the underwear bomber. None \nhave ever escaped. Federal courts have regularly provided effective--proved effective in convicting terrorists. And \nwe've already put them through--several of them, convicted them in military tribunals.  \n\nSo I think this is something that the committee really does have to take a--a clear look at. Because it is becoming \nmore and more difficult to hold these detainees in Guantanamo. \n\nSMITH: Thank--thank you. I recognize myself. The--the exact language being struck--stricken--struck here--the \nmark expresses a sense of Congress that medical care at Gitmo should meet adequate standards, and the DOD \nshould take into account relevant standards at other facilities such as the Bureau of Prisons in des--designing \npolicies. We're not talking about transferring to the U.S. in this section. We're simply saying that we should look and \nmake sure that adequate medical care is being provided. Because we have received a fair number of reports that \nit's--it's a bit problematic.  \n\nIn fact, one of the problems that we've heard is that--have a hard time having someone sort of advocate for the \nhealth care of the detainees, and basically say, you know, they got a problem here, and that they are not getting \nthe help they need. And we just want to make sure there--there's adequate healthcare. So it seems like a \nreasonable provision. And I oppose that this amendment be (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nCONAWAY: Would the gentleman yield? Would the gentleman yield? \n\nSMITH: Yes. Mr. Conaway. \n\nCONAWAY: Mr. Chairman, is there some evidence that over the 17 years we've held folks down there that the \nhealth care was not adequate? \n\nSMITH: Yes. As a matter of fact, I had a couple of Judge Advocate Generals in my office talking about a gentleman \ndown there now  \n\nCONAWAY: So one person out of 700, I bet you could find a lot-- \n\nSMITH: Sorry, did you--did you yield the time?  \n\nCONAWAY: So anyway, I--I just don't know that--that--that that's the-- \n\nSMITH: Sorry, you asked a question, I was taking a stab at answering it there. And was told basically that, you \nknow, the guy has back problem, can't walk and everything. They didn't heed that. They like put him on a bus, took \nhim for a 10-hour hearing. We were sitting around waiting forever. Nothing ever happened. Put him on the bus. \nTook him all the way back. And he was not in medical condition to do that. And there was no one there to advocate \nhim. So yes, there is some evidence. So we would like to-- \n\n\n\nCONAWAY: Would you clarify that 10-hour thing? I don't know there's any--you ride a bus 10 hours in Guantanamo \nBay-- \n\nSMITH: Sorry. The 10-hour thing is how long he sat waiting for what was going to happen to happen that didn't \nhappen. Then he had to go back to where he was. This is what the Advocate Generals explained to me when they \ncame into the office. So yes, I have been presented with evidence that there has been inadequate health care. And \nall this portion of the mark does, it says let's take a look and see, let's take a look and answer your question, \nbasically, authoritatively, instead of just based on the evidence that was put before me. \n\nKELLY: Will the chairman?  \n\nSMITH: Yes. Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, one of the things that I have an issue with in the language is you--we--we direct or we--we \nask the secretary of defense to take into account standards of care at facilities administered by the Federal Bureau \nof Prison in determining that care. I don't think that's the proper standard. \n\nSMITH: Why not? \n\nKELLY: And I also think that we start attaching certain things to them, we change them from a detainee, and start \ngiving them the same status as Federal Bureau of Prisons-- \n\nSMITH: Reclaiming my time, Mr. Kelly, just-- \n\nKELLY: So just the Federal Bureau of Prisons-- \n\nSMITH: Re--reclaiming my time. Just out of curiosity, what--what should be the difference in the standard of health \ncare that we give to inmates that we have convicted of crimes and locked up in the United States, versus the \nstandard of care that we should be giving to people who are being locked up as law of war detainees?  \n\nKELLY: I think because some of the rights that attach when you come to the United States-- \n\nSMITH: We're not--they're not coming to the United States. They're in Gitmo.  \n\nKELLY: But when you start talking about standards of care, and if they get the right to go to a facility at the Federal \nBureau of Prisons, it's outside of the prison thing--  \n\nSMITH: If I may, just for clarification point, this--this section of the bill that you are striking does not give them the \nright to come into the U.S. It merely attempts to say, let's look at the standard of care that we currently have at \nfederal prisons, and see if it is matched by the standard of care that we have at Gitmo. We ain't transferring them \nanywhere under this section.  \n\nKELLY: And to be clear, in this--this--this--this language does not give them any rights that the prisoners under the \nFederal Bureau. It just compares them to, but is not--does not give them any rights. \n\nSMITH: That--that--that is--is my interpretation. And I'm pretty sure that's exactly what it says. \n\nKELLY: Yes, sir. Thank-- \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on the amendment? All those in favor will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\n\n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the no's have it. The amendment is not agreed to. It's now, in order to consider log 285. \nMr. Waltz, for what purpose do you seek recognition?  \n\nWALTZ: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.  \n\nSMITH: The clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection, the reading is dispensed with. The gentleman is \nrecognized.  \n\nWALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment seeks to strike Section 1033, which is a prohibition on the use \nof funds for transfer and detention of additional individuals to the United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, to \nGitmo. Section 1033 would, which is the language this amendment seeks to strike, Section 1033 would prohibit \ndetention or transfer of any additional individuals under the law of war or pursuant to a military commission \nproceeding except those at Gitmo as of May, 2018. So basically going forward, no additional individuals can come \ninto Guantanamo.  \n\nIt would also require the attorney general to provide a plan within 60 days identifying a disposition other than \ncontinued law of war detention at Gitmo for each individual currently detained at Gitmo. So here are my issues--\nhere are our issues with Section 1033. The concern is that essentially this is a backdoor Gitmo closure. And though \nalthough there are currently no known plans to transfer new detainees to Gitmo, the option should not be taken off \nthe table in order to be able to respond to emergent requirement. So currently I could tell you downrange, where we \nhave special operators in 60 to 70 countries tonight as we speak, they are presented with a series of bad options.  \n\nEither they are forced to detain individuals on the battlefield, which they cannot do as operational units, as we've \ndiscussed. They are forced to release them to the local national judicial system which is often nonexistent, which is \nessentially a catch and release program. We have some type of creative solutions such as putting them on ships, \nwhich is not sustainable. Or they can come to Guantanamo. This language would prohibit them coming to \nGuantanamo. So essentially our operational forces would have nowhere to reasonably and responsibly put these \ndetainees.  \n\nThe other issue, in retire--in requiring the Attorney General to submit a plan identifying a disposition other than law \nof war detention is essentially then preventing the government from holding these detainees. Because as we've \ndiscussed, 30 of the current 40 detainees are held under law of war detention. Now we all know the Obama \nadministration and President Obama on day one of his administration sought to close and order his administration \nto close Guantanamo Bay. And after eight years, as the president's number one and first priority, they were unable \nto transfer all law of war detainees. And they after exhausting every effort, and then held those remaining detainees \nunder the law of war detention. We really have no other choice.  \n\nAnd in fact, I'll close with this, just a few days ago on June 10, 2019, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the \nindefinite detention of law of war detainees, that we were now going to ask the Attorney General to find an \nalternative to, an alternative that the Obama administration was not able to do, an alternative that the Bush \nadministration was not able to do, and an alternative that the Supreme Court just recently rejected. So I--again this \namendment seeks to strike that language. We need the operational flexibility to accept more detainees to \nGuantanamo. It's the least bad option after many, many years of trying to find other options, and the option that the \nlanguages directing the Attorney General to provide is essentially nonexistent. I yield my time. \n\nSMITH: Before I respond to this one, I would ask unanimous consent at this point if people are okay with limiting the \ntime now to two minutes in terms of comments. Is--is there objection to limiting to two minutes comments?  \n\nTHORNBERRY: Reserving the right to object, Mr. Chairman-- \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nTHORNBERRY: That would mean proponents of an amendment only have two minutes to explain the amendment? \n\nSMITH: Yeah. And opponents would too. \n\n\n\nTHORNBERRY: I object. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Mr. Thornberry suggested we have one five minute speech on each side. But that's, I don't know, I \nthink probably more than one person might want to speak on some of the stuff that we got coming up. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Well, if--if the chairman would yield, my--my point was we've got several Gitmo amendments, \nseveral order amendments. \n\nSMITH: Right. \n\nTHORNBERRY: And I kind of figured everybody could--could plug in there, or yield to each other within the five-\nminute time. \n\nSMITH: Eh, okay. I'll take a stab at Mr. Thornberry's--yeah, the rule would be five minutes on one side, five minutes \non the other, you can divide it up however you want. Is there objection to that? Okay. They're pretty close to broken \nat this point, I think. They'll--they'll agree to anything. All right. Yielding my--myself the time on this--this last one. I \nmean there's a fundamental fallacy in the there are no options. And the big fallacy here is you can do law of war \ndetention in the United States of America. Okay. There is no reason you cannot--we've done it before. We--we did it \nin World War II.  \n\nYou do not have to have them in Guantanamo which is an extraordinarily, as Ms. Sherrill pointed out, unbelievably \nexpensive place to house them. And I want everyone to remember the history here. The reason we used \nGuantanamo was because we thought, incorrectly as it turned out, that if they were in Guantanamo, the \nConstitution wouldn't apply. Well, there were several Supreme Court decisions where it was made clear--and this \nby the way is why they don't get any new rights when they're transferred to the United States. The courts ruled you \nget habeas corpus; you get your constitutional rights even in Guantanamo. That's why we have the law of war \ndetention. It doesn't change anything. It's just a lot less expensive.  \n\nNow the primary argument that has been used, which I view is largely political, to say that, oh gosh, we can't \npossibly take them out of Guantanamo, as these people are just too dangerous. Well, as Ms. Sherrill has pointed \nout, if the United States of America is incapable of holding dangerous people so that they are not a threat to the \ncommunity, then we're all in a whole hell of a lot of trouble. Because in the United States of America we have \nmurderers, rapists, pedophiles, and yes, some of the worst terrorists you can imagine being held in the U.S. safely \nand protecting the community. There is no reason to keep Guantanamo open at this point other than for the political \npoint. Whatever we have here in--I personally think we should use the Article 3 courts to prosecute these people so \nthat we do it cleanly and we don't wind up with the situation like Guantanamo.  \n\nBut if you can't, if you want to go law of war detention, no reason. You can't do it in the United States of America. \nSo I disagree and urge opposition to this particular amendment. And forgive me for a moment, I've got to look at \nsomething here. Oh, yeah. And this particular portion of it is about putting new people into court. There's no need to \nput any more people into the most expensive detention facility we have in the world. We have plenty of domestic \noptions. So I urge opposition to this amendment. Further discussion? Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye.   \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the no's have it. The amendment is not agreed to. \n\nAll right. Next up is--where we at? We're moving up and down the line here. Okay. I'm sorry, oh yes. Recorded vote \nis requested. And we'll do that near the end. It is now in order to consider log 255. Mr. Byrne, for purpose do you \nseek recognition? \n\nBYRNE: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. \n\n\n\nSMITH: And the clerk will pass out the amendment. Without objection, the reading will be dispensed with. Mr. \nByrne. \n\nBYRNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief. Every year since fiscal year 2011, this committee has carried a \nprovision that prohibits the transfer or release of Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States. I was interested \nto see that this same language was not included in the chairman's mark. And that's why I'm offering that previous \nprovision as an amendment. While I'm pleased to see that the chairman included a prohibition on the transfer or \nrelease of Guantanamo Bay detainees to Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, we should include a prohibition on the \ntransfer of these dangerous terrorists to the United States.  \n\nLet's take a minute remember that the 40 detainees remaining in Guantanamo are 9/11 architects, Osama bin \nLaden bodyguards, and Al-Qaeda operatives. These are bad people who wish to do harm to people in the United \nStates and would do it again if given the opportunity. This has been a bipartisan issue in the past and I hope it \nremains bipartisan today with a yes vote on this amendment. And I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I--I will be--be brief as well. No one is talking about releasing them into the United States. The \ntransfer restrictions on Somalia have to do with people who have been again deemed eligible for release. This is \nthe argument I made just a minute ago, so I won't--won't repeat it at any length.  \n\nWe can hold these people in the United States of America far more cost-effectively and in a way that--the \ninternational community is not thrilled with Guantanamo for the reason that it was set up in the first place, that it was \nset up to try to get around the Constitution. It does--we've had many generals testify throughout the years that it \ndoes undermine cooperation with allies, the possibility that they may be sent to Guantanamo, which has a horrible \ninternational reputation. And there's no need for it.  \n\nWe can hold them here in the United States of America under the exact same set of laws that we hold them in \nGuantanamo. Nobody's talking about releasing them. So I urge opposition of the amendment for that reason. \n\nLAMBORN: Would the gentleman yield?  \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nLAMBORN: I want to dispute two things, Mr. Chairman. When the--the trials were proposed to be held in New York \nCity back in 2010, New York City estimated that their security--they didn't want to just throw them in jail, city jail. \nThey wanted special security given the threat that they would pose to radicalizing other inmates or people trying to \nspring them from jail, perhaps. They were--they wanted to cover all those contingencies. New York City estimated \nthat it would cost $200 million.  \n\nSMITH: Reclaiming my time for just a quick minute, you--you're aware that colleague--I forget the names, Ramzi \nYousef--Ramzi Yousef, the Blind Sheikh, a whole lot of very bad terrorists are currently held in the United States in \nprisons. \n\nLAMBORN: Yeah. And (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nSMITH: At a much less cost (INAUDIBLE)--  \n\nLAMBORN: And I'm going to get to that in a second. \n\nSMITH: Okay. \n\nLAMBORN: But the costs to New York City would--is a lot more than keeping Guantanamo open. And I--and I doubt \nif New York City is alone in that. So-- \n\nSMITH: If I could reclaim my time just one quick second. In New York City, they were talking about the cost of trying \nthem, and going through the court proceedings, in New York City. Taking them back and forth to court every day. \nThat's not what we're talking about here. These people are being held under law--law of war detention. We're \n\n\n\ntalking about the mere ability to transfer and hold them here. Trials is a more complicated discussion. I'll grant you \nthat, but-- \n\nLAMBORN: That's true. But I don't think you'd have city or states that would want to just use existing facilities. \nThey'd want to beef up those facilities. \n\nSMITH: Well, what-- \n\nLAMBORN: And I know that because I have supermax in my district. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. So do I. Well, actually, no, I don't. I have a federal prison that's not a (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nLAMBORN: I have the most secure federal prison in the country in my district. \n\nSMITH: So I guess the question is-- \n\nLAMBORN: And they don't--the people there, the guards, the families of the guards, they don't want these terrorists \nfrom Guantanamo Bay in their community. It's a security threat-- \n\nSMITH: Got it. Reclaiming my time for just a second. We already have Well, north of 300 terrorists behind held in \nthe United States of America right now in these communities. And there's some pretty bad people. And I'll grant \nyou, there are a lot of people down--of the 40 down at Guantanamo who are pretty bad as well. \n\nLAMBORN: They're the worst of the worst. \n\nSMITH: Yeah. Well, I don't know that you get much worse than Ramzi Yousef. You know, certainly in terms of the \nnumber of Americans he was trying to kill. We are able to hold these terrorists in the United States. We got 40 \nmore. It simply doesn't make sense that we can't safely hold 40 more in addition to the hundreds that we currently \nhold. It doesn't make sense.  \n\nLAMBORN: Mr.--Mr. Chairman-- \n\nSMITH: If--I'm--it is my time, but I'm happy to yield. \n\nLAMBORN: Okay. I'll--I'll ask for more time here. People in a community like Florence, Colorado, do not want these \npeople in their community. It would--they would pose a hazard to their family members who work inside the prison-- \n\nSMITH: Just out of curiosity, does the gentleman have evidence that the people--the terrorists that we are holding \nnow, I have not seen the stories about all of these problems about people in communities say you got to get this \nguy out of here, what's he doing in this prison, it's terrible for our community-- \n\nLAMBORN: The people at Guantanamo, Mr. Chairman, are in a special category. There's a lot of them. And they're \nbad actors. \n\nSMITH: There's 40 of them. And we hold--Well, we've gone back and forth often enough. I think everybody \nunderstands both of our points.  \n\nLAMBORN: And one other thing, Mr. Chairman, the threat of radicalizing other inmates is a--would be a growing \nthreat within our country. So it wouldn't just be a stable plateaued situation. It could be potentially much worse in the \nfuture. \n\nSMITH: All right. I'm done with my time. Anybody else? Hearing none, all those in favor--I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly. I \nlooked at you. \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time. There--there are so many issues with bringing these--and first of all \nthe people who are here in the Federal Bureau of Prisons are who are here--the terrorists that are here, were \nalready here and committed acts and crimes here. The majority of those committed crimes-- \n\n\n\nSMITH: If the gentleman will yield for just a second. \n\nKELLY: Yes. \n\nSMITH: It's not actually true. A--a fair number of these terrorists did in fact commit terrorist acts elsewhere and were \nconvicted of committing them and locked up here. Just saying. \n\nKELLY: And so those people are not. They--they--they are not. They have not been on this soil, or if they have, \nthat's not where they were captured at the time. The second is, as many of those, not some of them, are--are \ndifferent levels of threat. These men in Guantanamo have the ability to command, or get armies, or large numbers \nof people to do their bidding.  \n\nSo the facilities here I think have to have upgrades. But the point is, is while they are down there at Gitmo, they are \nunder the laws of war, the detention laws of war, not criminal acts. And we know there's trials. And when you start \nblurring those lines, and bringing people here, and we have a wonderful Constitution that guarantees rights to \nAmerican citizens and other people who are in America who are not citizens, and we fight over the constitutionality, \nand which applies to which, and all those things. \n\nWhat I do know is this, we don't have those arguments if they never set foot on U.S. soil. And I would--I don't want \nto take American lives and put them at risk at the bidding that a court somewhere will rule they get certain \nconstitutional, or criminal, or immigration rights (INAUDIBLE).  \n\nSMITH: Will the gentleman yield for just one quick second? \n\nKELLY: Yes, sir. \n\nSMITH: You're an attorney. You're--you're--you're familiar with the decisions around Guantanamo, that basically \nsaid that the inmates at Guantanamo have the rights afforded by the U.S. Constitution because Guantanamo is \neffectively U.S. territory because we hold it. They don't get any more rights if they come to the U.S.  \n\nKELLY: Unless they come out from under the law of war detention act. And then all of a sudden because we started \ntalking about Federal Bureau of Prisons, remember in the ones earlier. But when we talk about Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, when you start attaching things, then maybe all of a sudden they're no longer caught under the--the laws of \nwar, Mr. Chairman. But now we start looking at them under the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or as a criminal, as \nopposed to a war act. And so that's--that's--that's my precautions of why I don't think it is good to in any case bring \nthem to the United States of America. \n\nSMITH: Right. All those in favor say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nSMITH: Opposed, no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the no's have it.  \n\nMEMBER: Ask for roll call vote. \n\nSMITH: Roll call vote is requested. Moving on. Did we just do--yes. Okay. Log 151, Mr. Banks, for what purpose do \nyou-- \n\nBANKS: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute. Without objection, reading is dispensed with. Mr. Banks. \n\n\n\nBANKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Guantanamo Bay detention camp has proven itself to be an invaluable resource \nthroughout the global war on terrorism. Some of my colleagues would lead you to believe that the cost of \nGuantanamo Bay is prohibitively expensive and the intelligence gathered is not significant enough to continue \nfunding these facilities.  \n\nHowever, let me assure you that this could not be further from the truth. Gitmo criminals have proven to have \nvaluable intelligence for counterterrorism operations. High value detainees simply cost more than most incarcerated \nAmericans. That's a fact. It is illogical to compare these drastically different groups of criminals and the facilities it \nrequires to house them. We do not need to build a new facility to house these detainees when these secure \nstructures already exist at Guantanamo Bay.  \n\nMy Amendment prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the United States to house individuals \ncurrently detained at Guantanamo. Building a similar facility in the United States would be a wasteful use of \ntaxpayer dollars. These provisions should not be controversial as this language has been carried unamended in \neach annual NDAA since FY 2011. And many of you have voted for this language many times before.  \n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to support my amendment prohibiting funds to construct or modify similar facilities in the \nUnited States. With that I yield back the remainder of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I oppose this amendment as Well, for all of the reasons that I've stated at this point. So I will not \nrestate them. But I urge opposition for, you know, we've had the basic Guantanamo debate. You understand the \narguments. And it is true, this has been carried in the bill and I've objected to it every single year, unsuccessfully to \nthis point. I'm hoping it's a new day. Any further discussion? All those in favor will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the no's have it. Recorded vote is requested. We will have a recorded vote. We are \nnow on to log 250. Mr. Rogers. \n\nROGERS: (INAUDIBLE)--the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute. Without objection, reading will be dispensed with. Mr. Rogers, you are recognized. \n\nROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's common knowledge we have a crisis at our border, not just a \nhumanitarian crisis, but a--a crisis in the--the massive numbers that are coming across our--our border. It's the last \nthree months we've had in excess of 100,000 migrants per month that were detained. In March it was 101,000, April \nit was 109,000, in May it was 144,000 migrants. This--and this is going to continue to escalate. \n\nNow Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Venezuela, are all part of this illicit pathway to our southern \nborder. Civil unrest in Venezuela is driving displaced workers into these migrant paths. Honduras, Guatemala, and \nEl Salvador are all hotbeds of migrant smuggling. Folks cross our border. And we know terrorists have long wanted \nto exploit illegal immigration into the United States. So releasing hardened radicals into our country with smuggling \nroutes is asking for trouble.  \n\nSo all my amendment says is that if somebody is deemed at Guantanamo Bay to be appropriate for release, they \ncannot be released into any one of these countries in Central America or South America that have these illicit \npathways into our country. And with that I will urge a favorable vote and yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. Ms. Escobar? Oh, gosh. But if Ms. Escobar could yield for just one minute. I want to alert \nmembers, we possibly have to substitute amendment vote coming up. So we're going to have to get people back \nhere if possible so we can work on that. Ms. Escobar. \n\n\n\nESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish to offer a substitute amendment. \n\nSMITH: The gentlelady is recognized. The clerk will distribute the amendment. I believe we have it. Without \nobjection, reading of the amendment will be dispensed with. The gentlelady is recognized. \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My colleague's amendment alleges that Guantanamo detainees transferred \nto any of these countries will attempt to enter the United States illegally over land and that it poses a security risk to \nthe United States. There is zero proof that any terrorists have ever come in through the southern border, or that \nwhat my colleague is alleging has ever occurred. That's why I feel an attempt to blacklist these countries is at best \npremature and at worst unfounded.  \n\nAs the house membership Well, knows, negotiating these transfers is a delicate balance. We should not limit our \noptions by further blacklisting a whole slate of countries based on generalizations not rooted in evidence. We've \nheard countless times today that many issues weren't studied before legislation is appropriate, and this is one of \nthose issues. My amendment would do just that. This amendment would require a report to Congress on past \ntransfers of Gitmo detainees to these four countries, including the date and circumstances of each, and provide real \ndata so that we can accurately assess whether there is in fact a security risk, and if so what it is.  \n\nIt is part of our oversight responsibility to gather a clear assessment of what the security risk is, and from there \ndetermine the correct response. Banning an entire group of countries with no information is a bad idea and one I \nfear we've seen before. This report would help us focus in and assess what if any risk has resulted from transfers to \nthese countries. I encourage my colleagues to support this substitute amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I \nyield-- \n\nTHORNBERRY: Ms. Davis. \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Is there any debate on the substitute amendment? Yes.  \n\nROGERS: Thank you, Ms. Davis. Listen, this--this is knuckleheaded. We don't need a report to tell us you shouldn't \nrelease a known terrorist into a country that's got illicit pathways to our country. And by the way, I've been on the \nHomeland Security Committee since it was established. There have been numerous occasions where terrorists \nhave come through our southern border to get in this country.  \n\nWe have sleeper cells throughout this--don't shake your head no. I've been on the committee 16 years. I know what \nI'm talking about. This--these folks want to get to our country, they want to get to these sleeper cells, so that they \ncan wait to be activated. These are bad actors. We don't need to waste money on a study to tell us don't turn them \nloose in these coun--in these countries where there's pathways that are active with massive numbers of people, \nthey can get in cloaked by, and come into our country.  \n\nAnd just a second, an aside, and this is the Jim Cooper in me coming out. Every time we order a report, the \nPentagon doesn't write these. They hire some FFRDC to write them. And it winds up costing a million dollars. So \nlet's just don't loosely be ordering reports left and right like that doesn't cost us a lot of money. With that I yield \nback.  \n\nDAVIS: Thank you. Any further debate? Seeing none. Okay. If not, the question is on the adoption of the substitute \namendment offered by Mr. Escobar. So many as are in favor will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nDAVIS: Those opposed.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nDAVIS: The ayes have it. And the substitute amendment is adopted. And ask for a recorded vote. A roll call vote is \nordered and a roll call vote on the substitute amendment will be postponed, or cannot be postponed. I'm sorry. \nOkay. Please call the roll. We can't-- \n\n\n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith-- \n\nDAVIS: I was going to postpone it, but we can't. So okay. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith-- \n\nDAVIS: All right. Please call the roll. We'll-- \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith. \n\nDAVIS: --see everybody coming in. \n\nSMITH: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith votes aye. Mr. Thornberry? \n\nTHORNBERRY: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Thornberry votes no. Mrs. Davis? \n\nDAVIS: No. \n\nCLERK: Mrs. Davis votes aye. Mr. Wilson? \n\nWILSON: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Wilson votes no. Mr. Langevin? Mr. Langevin? Mr. Bishop? Mr. Bishop? \n\nBISHOP: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Bishop votes no. Mr. Larsen. \n\nLARSEN: Yes. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Larsen votes aye. Mr. Turner. \n\nTURNER: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Turner votes no. Mr. Cooper. \n\nCOOPER: Yes. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Cooper votes yes. Mr. Rogers.  \n\nROGERS: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Rogers votes no. Mr. Courtney? \n\nCOURTNEY: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Courtney votes yes. Mr. Conaway?  \n\nCONWAY: No. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Conaway votes no. Mr. Garamendi? \n\nGARAMENDI: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Garamendi votes yes.

(OFF-MIC) \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. No. \n\nSMITH: Mister--where we at here? We're now on log number 2-(INAUDIBLE)-- \n\n\n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. (OFF-MIC) \n\nSMITH: It's unfortunate under the circumstances. But it's also totally unfair. And it's up to the minority. By UC, Mr. \nLangevin can be allowed to vote. But I'm pretty sure it has to be--it has to be by UC. I realize we're not supposed to \nargue about these things. But it's 4:00 in the morning. Mr. Langevin (INAUDIBLE) doing his best. It just doesn't \nseem right to deny him the right to vote (INAUDIBLE). Be that as it may, it is by UC (INAUDIBLE)  \n\nUNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman, about the inquiry about reconsideration. I mean-- \n\nSMITH: What are the parliamentary rules on reconsidering? (OFF-MIC) \n\nUNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) parliamentary inquiry. My understanding though in a reconsideration, when someone \nhas voted and asks for it to be reconsidered, they have to vote the other way in the re-vote, which is the whole \npurpose, which you're going to get mathematically the same outcome. \n\nSMITH: Well, actually-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Because my understanding is that--that--and that's why the parliamentary inquiry-- \n\nSMITH: I got you. If I could take a stab at this. First of all, I don't believe that is true. I don't think the person who is \nmoving for the reconsideration-- \n\nUNKNOWN: I think that's their point of moving-- \n\nSMITH: --has to change their vote. They have a right-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Otherwise it would be in perp--perpetuity that everyone gets to do that. That's not the case. \n\nSMITH: Well, it wouldn't be in perpetuity. We got the argument is-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Right. Because anyone can. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry, that's--stop babbling. Let's get an answer. We got parliamentarians here. If you make the motion \nto reconsider, do you have to change your vote? By the way, if she changed her vote, it would make the reversal \neven more pronounced, not the other way around. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. She changed her vote to yes. \n\nSMITH: Right. \n\nUNKNOWN: Whatever, whatever. \n\nSMITH: Think about that one for a second.  And then we'll--but let's get the parliamentary answer. Apparently we--\nwe--we don't have a handy answer to that. So we're--we're going to get an answer to that. I would really rather not \nrecess. So if--if you could huddle with the parliamentarians instead of us having a public discussion about it, and \nshow them what you've got, and see how they react to it, I would not--not object to that.  \n\nMy request is that we continue on the amendment process and come back to resolve this issue once the \nparliamentarians on both sides have agreed. Is that okay? All right. So we're going to move forward. And we'll \nresolve this issue. And we'll come back to it when necessary. So we are now on log 223, Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: And we've already been through this. So Mr. Kelly, you are recognized.  \n\nKELLY: And I'm going to be very brief on this. I thank the chairman again for yielding. And I'm offering this \namendment to strike a portion of this report language because it is inappropriate for the GAO to recommend policy \nchanges or legislative action.  \n\n\n\nThe chairman's mark presumes that medical care at Gitmo is inadequate. I've been to Gitmo and that's just not the \ncase. We have the capability to provide whatever specialty care is needed for the detainees. I reemphasize these \npeople do not need to be housed or to be on U.S. soil. Gitmo is the most appropriate and safest place to treat the \ndetainees and protect the American public. I urge support for this amendment. And I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Hold on a second. I would also like to point out, we--we had a motion, there's a whole lot of things going on \nhere. So let me go through them in order. Number one, we did have a UC motion saying only five minutes on either \nside. We haven't really been paying attention to that.  \n\nSo since that is the current rules, now part of the way we're going to have to do that is if someone speaks as quickly \nas Mr. Kelly did, he's still got like four minutes left, we're going to have to keep track of the time even after they \nrelinquish it. There's five minutes on each side, if that's possible, so we know how those five minutes are. We'll get \nthrough them. And if this blows up at some point, we can revisit it. But that's what we're going to--going to try to do. \n\nSecond, we're going to try to resolve the other thing, but we're working on that at the moment. Lastly, again, I have \nhad evidence that medical care at Guantanamo is not what it should be. It strikes me that studying it is a reasonable \nthing to do, to try to make sure that the healthcare at Guantanamo is as wonderful as it has been described. So I \ndon't see a problem with this. And I oppose the gentleman's amendment to strike the provision. Any other \ndiscussion? \n\nCONAWAY: Mr. Chairman, just quickly. \n\nSMITH: Yes. \n\nCONAWAY: Earlier conversations you were saying that the medical care should comport with federal law or \nFederal Bureau of Prisons. How did you know that if you didn't have the study? Should you get them both? \n\nSMITH: Well, it's not a matter of knowing that. In--in that case we were trying to get to a standard. So we do know a \ngreat deal about the medical care standards in federal prisons. In fact it's kind of in statute what is required. So we \nwere asking (INAUDIBLE)-- \n\nCONAWAY: But if you require it--yeah, but if you require that, why do you need this study? \n\nSMITH: We didn't require it. We asked that they look at it and try to make it comparable. The study would help \ninform whether or not it is comparable. \n\nCONAWAY: That's--I trust our DOD to be able to make that assessment. If you tell them it's got to be done-- \n\nSMITH: I don't. \n\nCONAWAY: --and comport with the--with the federal prison rules, then our guys are way capable of deciding what's \nthere versus what's that. And--and I don't know that you need a study to make that happen. \n\nSMITH: Duly noted. You said your piece. I said mine. We could keep going back and forth forever, but I think we're \nthere. Any further discussion. All those in favor say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it.  \n\nCONAWAY: Mr. Chairman, I ask for a recorded vote. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Recorded vote is requested. All right. Okay. Let's do this, before we try to address the issue of what \nRobert's Rules of Order are. We're going to get through this amendment by Mr. Lamborn. And then we will see \nwhere we're at on the other issue and hopefully resolve that one way or the other. So log 389 is up next, \namendment by Mr. Lamborn. For what purposes does he seek recognition? \n\nLAMBORN: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk and on our screens. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, the reading is dispensed with. Mr. \nLamborn. \n\nLAMBORN: This amendment seeks to restore funding for a high value detainee building at Guantanamo. The--the \nDepartment of Defense has asked for this. And the majority has struck it out. Unfortunately I think it's a poor \ndecision and I'm going to explain why. Joint Task Force Gitmo has says that--has said that the existing facility is \nunsafe. It's unsafe for the soldiers, our army soldiers who serve as guards at Gitmo. Quote, the current complex \nhas failed foundations which has resulted in cracked flooring and uneven settling of walls and doorways. Increasing \nroutine facility failures include inoperable doorways, including cell doors that do not close, broken water supply and \ndrain lines.  \n\nAnd they also say, quote, facilities were not designed and constructed to provide long term detention, legal counsel, \nand medical treatment, and a consolidated and streamlined method. As a result the guard force is required to move \nhighly dangerous detainees back and forth between separate facilities. Each detainee movement places guard \nforce members at risk.  \n\nSo Joint Task Force Gitmo has said that the current facility is unsafe for our men and women in uniform who are \nguarding these dangerous detainees. And think about that for a minute. Think about if you were a prison guard at \nnight, and you were making your rounds, and there were cell doors that did not close. Would you be a little \nconcerned about your back if people--if their cell doors did not close? That's what Joint Task Force Gitmo has \nreported. That's the conditions that our men and women, our--our army soldiers who guard these detainees are \nliving under right now.  \n\nSo and a further irony in this situation is that two other facilities are being funded by the bill as it stands at this \nmoment. Those two buildings are a communications facility for $22 million, and a detention legal office and \ncommunication center for $11.8 million.  So right now in the bill that we're going to vote on, we're funding two other \nbuildings to be built at Guantanamo Bay, a communications facility for $22 million and a detention legal office and \ncommunication center for $11.8 million. In other words, we're going to build facilities for the reporters and the \nlawyers, but not for our men and women in uniform who are guarding these people. I think that's embarrassing.  \n\nHow can we live with that? We're building stuff for reporters and lawyers, but not for our guards, our soldiers who \nare guarding these people. I think that this is a horrible situation. We should fund that third building. I don't even \nknow why it was taken out of consideration. Let's adopt this amendment and put that funding back in for that high \ndetainee facility so our army soldiers have safe operating conditions. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Yeah. According to her a little five back and forth thing, you should reserve the balance of time-- \n\nLAMBORN: Okay. I'll reserve myself for others-- \n\nSMITH: It's about a minute and 20 seconds. Thank you. I yield to Mr. Khanna. \n\nKHANNA: Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Sorry. Just taking a drink of water there. The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, the \nreading of the amendment will be dispensed with. And Mr. Khanna is recognized. \n\nKHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, my substitute amendment would require a study on \nalternatives, near term facility requirements to house high value detainees. It requires that this report be completed \nwithin 120 days. The department has not yet done its due diligence in assessing alternatives to building an $88.5 \n\n\n\nmillion new permanent detention facility. The facility last time last year was projected to cost 69 million. And both \nRepublicans and Democrats opposed it on a bipartisan basis. We asked similar questions last time about \nalternatives and haven't yet received any answers. This time the amendment is seeking a project for 20 million \nmore when we haven't even gotten the answers.  \n\nViable alternatives include repair, renovation, and repurposing of existing facilities. DOD has not yet provided a \nfeasibility analysis of alternatives that could adequately meet the requirement to humanely house high value \ndetainees and ensure safety for military personnel who guard them.  \n\nBoth the MilCon subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhave cut this project out of similar concerns. The proposed complex is not primarily a medical facility. And the \nextent to which it may or may not enhance the provision of medical care is unclear. Medical care is currently \nprovided to the detainee--detainees in multiple facilities including a health clinic funded in the 2015 NDAA. I reserve \nmy time.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you. The chair recognizes Mr. Brown. I believe he has a perfecting amendment. \n\nBROWN: Mr. Chairman, I have a perfected amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Is your microphone on? \n\nBROWN: Oh, sorry. Mr. Chairman, I have a perfected amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Sorry. The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, reading of the amendment will be \ndispensed with. Mr. Brown. \n\nBROWN: Yes. Mr.--Mr. Chairman, my perfected amendment changes the time period in which the secretary of \ndefense--of Defense shall submit the report that is required in the substitute amendment, and it changes it from \n100--120 days to 90 days. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Okay. Is there-- \n\nLAMBORN: Mr. Chairman.  \n\nSMITH: Further discussion. Mr. Lamborn. \n\nLAMBORN: Yes. I'd like to start my five minutes over again. \n\nSMITH: Well, you can because it's a new thing. \n\nLAMBORN: Thank you. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure. This is really an amazing situation-- \n\nSMITH: You do need to start the clock. Sorry. \n\nLAMBORN: We're in an amazing situation. The Department of Defense through Joint Task Force Gitmo has filed a \nform called a form 1391. They did this in response to the appropriation request that they're making for these three \nbuildings, including the one that right now is being prohibited. This is--this form 1391 is dated March 1st of 2019. \nThis is a report.  \n\nThis right here in my hands is a report. And the report says, I'm going to quote it, alternative methods of meeting \nthis requirement have been explored during project development. This project is the only feasible option to meet \nthis requirement. Let me repeat that. Alternative methods of meeting this requirement have been explored during \nproject development. This project is the only feasible option to meet the requirement.  \n\nSo if my colleague Mr. Khanna wants a report, we've already got it. Why do we need to accept his amendment? \nWe've got the report. And by the way, the report says there's no other way to do this. And on Mr. Brown's \n\n\n\namendment, it's a tree, a Christmas tree, I don't know what they call it, it doesn't--it doesn't feel very festive here. \nBut it's to preclude any other amendments from our side-- \n\nSMITH: I think it's just a tree. It's not-- \n\nLAMBORN: But that's--changing 120 days to 90 days, once again that's moot, that's irrelevant because the report is \nin our hands. It's right here. We don't need a report. We've got the answer. The answer is this building is the only \nway to meet this need. So I would urge a no on both of these Christmas tree amendments or whatever we call \nthem, and a yes on the amendment to actually build the building that will protect our guards holding these high \nvalue dangerous detainees. Mr.--this is kind of embarrassing. We shouldn't be having this discussion. I yield back.  \n\nSMITH: Is there further discussion? If not, the question occurs first on Mr. Brown's perfecting amendment. And--and \nthe clerk will call the roll. I was presumptuous. I apologize. I was assuming a recorded vote. All those in favor of Mr. \nBrown's perfecting amendment will say aye. Aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the ayes have it. (OFF-MIC) \n\nMEMBER: I withdraw that-- \n\nSMITH: All right. The ayes have it. We're down to 90 days. Now we are on to Mr. Khanna's amendment, substitute \namendment. All those in favor of Mr. Khanna's substitute amendment will say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the ayes have it. (OFF-MIC) A recorded vote is called for. The clerk will call the roll. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith. \n\nSMITH: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith votes aye.

It is now in order to consider Mr. Lamborn's--Lamborn--amendment \nas amended. All those in favor will say aye. Aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair the eyes have it. The eyes have it. The amendment is adopted.  \n\nMEMBER: Call for a vote. \n\nSMITH: It's the same vote. They are on the record. They--they are very much on the record. I mean, if you want it, \nit's your privilege. But back me up here people, it's the same vote we just took.  \n\n(OFF-MIC) \n\nSMITH: Okay. Thank you. All right. It is now in order to consider en bloc package number four. I ask unanimous \nconsent to call up en bloc package number four consisting of in--inmates--amendments that have been worked and \napproved with minority, without objection so ordered. Clerk will distribute the en bloc amendments. Without \nobjection, the amendments are considered as read.  \n\nEn bloc package number four is comprised of the following. Log number 433R1, 481R1, 216, 277R2, 431R1, \n373R1, 357R1, 029R2, 242R1, 021R3, 341R1, 436R1, 056, 471, 140R2, 022R1, and 478. Is there discussion on \nthe en bloc amendments? Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye. All those opposed will say no. The en blocs \nare adopted.  \n\nIt is now in order to consider log 349R1 by Mr. Garamendi. What--for what purpose does Mr. Garamendi seek \nrecognition? \n\nGARAMENDI: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection, reading will be dispensed with.  \n\nGARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I'm going to do this very quickly. We have involved ourselves in Iraq and Syria for the \nlast three years, successfully defeating ISIS on the battlefield. Unfortunately ISIS is still around and the problem \npersists as to what to do with the remnants of ISIS, as Well, as the reconstruction and renewal of life in both Syria \nand Iraq.  \n\nThis amendment provides direction to the U.S. military about what it can do. It follows very closely on plans that \nhave already been made. It instructs the military to work with the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, to enact a plan. Essentially the activity the military would be to train and equip the \nsecurity forces, and to provide protection and security for the American organizations and government operations in \nboth Iraq and Syria for the reconstruction. \n\nThat's it. It's what we really ought to be doing. And we really ought to have had a waiver from the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. I don't need to go into all the trouble we've had before, but since we do not have a waiver, this will \ncome up on the floor. I yield back.  \n\n\n\nSMITH: (INAUDIBLE) Next is log 245 by Mr. Rogers. For what purpose does Mr. Rogers seek recognition? \n\nROGERS: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute. I think we need to update these things because that was always when you actually \nhad to actually distribute it. Without objection the clerk--we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And \nMr. Rogers is recognized. \n\nROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I'll be as brief as I can because I think everybody's got their lines drawn \nwhen it comes to these border bills. The underlying bill prohibits any money being spent by the DOD for the \nconstruction of border barriers. As I said, I've been on the Homeland Security Committee since it was established.  \n\nWe have never had a difference of opinion on party lines as to the effectiveness of barriers at the border. In fact, \nthe San Diego fence when it was built in 1992, we've seen a 92 percent drop over the last 23 years in migrants \ncoming across. El Paso built in '93, we've had 95 percent over 22 years. Tucson built in 2000, illegal traffic dropped \n90 percent. Yuma built in 2005, illegal traffic dropped 95 percent.  \n\nBarriers work. We need to have these barriers erected so we can stop this flow I described earlier, these massive \nnumber of people coming across our border. I think it's irresponsible for us to block this--this funding. And I urge a \nadoption of my amendment to allow the president move to forward in his building of the barrier.  \n\nSMITH: Did the gentleman yield? \n\nROGERS: Yeah. I will yield. \n\nLAMBORN: Just to add a couple points there. Congress has not acted to fund this, so the administration has had \nno choice but to send troops and to try to find funds to make some borders in effect. And I think that we have no \nchoice but to let that happen unless Congress actually takes action to address the problem at the crisis, at the \nborder.  \n\nEven the New York Times a few days ago on the 9th of June, editorialized in May for 144,278 migrants were taken \ninto custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000, and the highest one-\nmonth total in 13 years. Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrants' shelters are dangerously \novercrowded and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease, and even death are a growing reality.  \n\nAnd then they conclude by saying, while lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of \nmigrant children are suffering. Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering. Why can't we do \nsomething? Why can't we do something? This amendment at least lets the administration make stopgap measures \nuntil we can get our act together and have a long-range solution. So please support this amendment. I--I yield back \nthe balance of my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. And in--in keeping with--actually it's Mr. Rogers'-- \n\nLAMBORN: I reserve. I reserve to Mr. Rogers. \n\nSMITH: So there's about two minutes and 14 seconds left on their side. On our side, we start now. I'm going to say \nsomething quickly. There is a crisis at the border. I'm not going to say no one disputes that. Maybe some people \ndo. But I think it's pretty clear that there's a crisis at the border. What we dispute is that spending billions of dollars \nto build a wall is going to address that crisis. The migrants that Mr. Lamborn just referenced weren't trying to sneak \nin. They turned themselves in. The overwhelming majority of the population that is now the crisis at the border, \nchildren, women, migrants, who we cannot house or adequately take care of, are not trying to sneak across. \n\nIt is an unbelievable waste of resources to address this crisis to spend that money on a wall. The crisis is in dealing \nwith the people who are coming across the border. So that's our--our--our complaint and our disagreement. \nSecond, it's DHS, not DOD. This money should not come out of the Department of Defense, as by the way, a lot of \n\n\n\nmy Republican colleagues said when this first came up. So those are the two issues. Not disputing the crisis. And \nwith that, I yield to Ms. Escobar. \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, I represent El Paso, Texas, which has essentially been the \neye of the storm. There has been no other district that has seen more migrants coming across; in fact, there are two \nof us here at this dais who represent the sector that has been the most impacted by what is happening at the \nsouthern border. There are two of us who live in the El Paso sector for whom safety and security could not be more \nimportant because we live there. We live there and we represent constituents who live there. \n\nThe reality is in El Paso, where the numbers are the highest along the southern border, there is a wall. The crisis is \na humanitarian one. And the people being apprehended are being apprehended at the wall. Because the wall does \nnot exist on the dividing line between the United States and Mexico; it, in fact, exists yards away and in some cases \nmiles away.  \n\nSo by the time migrants have come across and reached the wall, they had long been on American soil. They are \nactually waving down border patrol agents, asking to be apprehended. There is no one who wants to solve this \nmore than the people who live and represent the border. A wall is not a solution. Happy to work with anyone on a \nsolution. DOD is not a solution. A wall is not a solution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Yield to Mr. Gallego. \n\nESCOBAR: I yield to Mr. Gallego. \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you, Ms. Escobar. I understand that my friends support President Trump's border well. Every \nmember here knows where I stand on that issue. However I don't speak in opposition to my friend's amendment as \nmuch I speak in support of the integrity of this committee, this Congress, and the clear separation of powers \noutlined in our Constitution.  \n\nLast Congress I offered amendments to the NDAA into several appropriation bills to ensure that a military funding \nwould not be mis--misused for border wall construction. I was assured by my Republican colleagues at that time \nthat my amendments were totally unnecessary, since Congress didn't appropriate one dollar for the wall. And as we \nall know, the president could not build his wall if Congress didn't fund it. That's Constitution 101.  \n\nWell, my Republican colleagues were right and wrong. The Republican Party had unified control for two years, but \nCongress unilaterally rejected President Trump's request to fund a wall, and they were right about that. But even \nthough Congress never appropriated one dollar for Trump's border wall, that didn't stop the president from flipping \nthe Constitution on its head and trying to steal $7 billion from our military for his wall.  \n\nThere are members of this committee who support construction of a border wall. I'm not here to argue that position. \nAlthough I do oppose it and believe that we could win on the merits of this issue. But I'm here to echo what my \ngreat friend Ranking Member Thornberry who said, I fully support doing more at the border, but we don't need to \nrob the military, as he said last year. \n\nI will remind my friend that this is--my friends that this is the House Armed Services Committee. Our job is to stand \nup for the people, for the armed forces, for our service members, and for their families, not use them as a pawn for \npartisan political fights. I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to oppose this amendment, which undermines \nour effort to ensure that every single penny authorized in this bill is spent for the benefit of our troops, for the \nnational defense, and for nothing else. I yield back my time.  \n\nSMITH: All right. That pretty much exhausts the time on this side of the issue. There's about--I forget what they got \nleft, about two minutes and 15 seconds on the other side. I think the way we're going to have to do this is sort of like \nwe do it on the floor. We'll have one person on each side control the time and yield it to people.  \n\nAnd on this amendment, Mr. Rogers--Mr. Rogers you're controlling the time. You have two minutes and 14 seconds \nleft. Okay. All right. All those in favor of the amendment by Mr. Rogers will say aye.  \n\n\n\nUNKNOWN: Aye.  \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no.  \n\nUNKNOWN: No.  \n\nSMITH: No. Opinion of the chair the no's have it. Recorded vote is requested. We will have a recorded vote. It is \nnow in order to consider log 247, also by Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers seeks recognition. \n\nROGERS: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Amendment will be distributed. And reading will be waived. Mr. Rogers. \n\nROGERS: Thank you. This--this has to do with restoring national emergency authority that's been limited by the \nunderlying bill. And--and what has happened is the--the majority has put language in that would basically allow \nenvironmental lawyers, activists, to be able to file litigation to prohibit--to stop the president from trying to wreck the \nwall, any kind of mil--using military construction money. Again this goes to the same issue. We need to start \nbuilding barriers at the wall. We don't need to start throwing impediments in front of the administration, particularly \nwhen it comes to just litigation. So I would urge the adoption of this amendment and reserve the balance of my \ntime.  \n\nSMITH: Thank you. And I--claiming the time in opposition, if we'll do it that way. I would just say, you know, quickly \non this, this is actually an issue that goes beyond the wall. And we--it's been bipartisan in the sense that when \nthere's a Democratic president, the Republicans do not like the power the executive exercises. And when there's a \nRepublican administration, Democrats don't like it.  \n\nBut there has been a massive expansion of the emergency powers that have been granted to the executive to over-\n-well, to basically push the legislative branch aside. The emergency powers were meant to be far narrower than \nthey've been interpreted by many administrations, but certainly by this one. It's not just this issue, but on tariffs and \na bunch of other things. So I think it's a really important issue to reign in the emergency powers. \n\nWe have a process. And if the president has a proposal, he comes to Congress, we work it out, we should not \noverride the congressional body in this manner. And therefore I oppose the amendment. And I will now yield to Mr. \nGallego. \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would say that all members on this committee are supporters of-- \n\nGALLEGO: (IN PROGRESS) given them the authority or the money to do it. This amendment strikes language that \nwas put into the mark because of the recent unconstitutional raid by this administration on our military. \n\nAs we all know, the administration declared a national emergency, stole money from military construction accounts \nand tries to use it to build a wall, over the objections of this committee and its power of the purse. Every member of \nthis committee should be concerned about. \n\nBecause of that huge breach of trust, we have to impose sensible limits. Sensible limits. And that's what this \namendment does. It limits expenditures for national emergencies to $500 million or $100 million if it's entirely within \nthe United States. \n\nCongress can always appropriate more emergency spending during a crisis if it so chooses and makes sure that \nyou can't cancel projects for the specific purpose of stealing the money for presidential vanity projects under any \nadministration and makes sure that other parts of the law must be respected rather than be tossed out by someone \nwho is more interest in creating a building--in creating a building and fulfilling a promise than a much needed airstrip \nin a warzone, ensuring a pumping station is functional or any type of an emergency military construction that was \nbuilt with this authority back when we could trust that the president and the secretary of defense to be responsible \nwith what we appropriate. \n\n\n\nStripping it out does nothing to solve our national debate over the border but it would handicap our constitutional \nrole, our readiness and the confidence that when we, the peoples representatives order something that it means \nsomething.  \n\nI encourage my friends on this committee to remember their oaths to the Constitution and to join me in voting down \nthis amendment and voting in favor of the safety and security of troops and the radical principal of using \nDepartment of Defense dollars for Department of Defense priorities. \n\nThank you Mr. Chairman and I yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you. I reserve the balance of my time. Anyone else seek recognition on this? If not, all those in favor \nwill say aye.  \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nThose opposed will say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSee we're picking up over here. The no's have it, opinion of the chair. \n\nUNKNOWN: I ask for a recorded vote. \n\nSMITH: A recorded vote is requested. A recorded vote will be ordered, and it is now, I'm sorry did we just do 247? \n\nUNKNOWN: Yes. \n\nSMITH: Okay it is now an order to consider law 244, also by Mr. Rogers. For purpose of Mr. Rogers-- \n\nROGERS: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute the amendment and reading of the amendment will be dispensed with. Mr. Rogers. \n\nROGERS: Thank you Mr. Chairman I have in my hand a letter that was sent to the Congress two days ago by the \nsecretary of Health and Human Services and the acting secretary of Homeland Security. I ask it be submitted to the \nrecord without objection. \n\nSMITH: Without objection, so ordered. \n\nROGERS: And the letter just basically explains how dire the crises is and the secretary of HHS is telling us that in \ntwo weeks, they're running out of money so they're not going to have any place to put unaccompanied children that \nthey have in massive numbers, so we need to give them some help. \n\nBut one of the other things that the administration's been doing here to fore while we are waiting on Congress to act \nand Congress has refused is we've been sending resources down there and they're mainly in the form of manpower \nto do administrative functions to relive Border Patrol Agents to try to deal with the folks and keep them safe and \nhealthy. \n\nThe underlying bill takes away the authority for the administration, to any administration to be able to send troops to \nthe border to be--to function in that support capacity. I want everybody to understand we have been sending DOD \nassets to the border since the Alamo. \n\nIt's been happening every decade. You just go back in recent memory, President Clinton sent troops down there \nrepeatedly, George W. Bush sent troops down repeatedly, Obama sent troops down there repeatedly and Trump \nhas. We have to do it in order to keep our borders secure and to deal with things like the humanitarian crisis. \n\n\n\nAll my amendment does is it restores the border assistance authority that exists in the current law into the bill and I \nwould urge adoption of my amendment. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Gallego.  \n\nGALLEGO: I rise in opposition to this amendment. Number one, just for historical context, when the Alamo \noccurred, there was no American forces. That was Texans fighting Mexicans just kind of want to correct that.  \n\nBut number two, we have a problem at the border that should be fixed through the appropriate process, which is \nthrough HHS funding, DHS funding. There are packages that are moving through the House right now. The reason \nwe are instituting a lot of these break--these breaks because there was a particular move by this administration to \nstrip money and more importantly strip our powers of oversight on this committee and this is why we are instituting \na lot of these efforts to make sure that in the future when there are true emergencies they have to come and consult \nwith us instead of just trying to steal the money for things that we have appropriated and authorized. \n\nI yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: Thank you and I'll just, I'm sorry you were seeking recognition Mr. Brown? \n\nBROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I oppose the amendment. Look, the chairman's mark maintains the ability for \nthe department, for the military to assist with aerial surveillance, intelligence analysis and logistic support. We seen \nthat a high-water mark seven thousand troops at the border. I think today there are five thousand between active \nand reserves.  \n\nWhat we're requiring in this section is that the DoD be reimbursed for these costs. Through the end of this fiscal \nyear it's projected or estimated to cost the DoD $1 billion. Think about it, later this evening we're going to have a \ndebate or discussion or an effort to increase the mark by $17 billion. Six percent of that $17 billion is being spent at \nthe border for a job that DHS ought to be doing. \n\nSo, the mark just says, reimburse the DoD for the support they are providing you. That's consistent with everyone's \nconcern that the DoD needs to be sufficiently funded. We do a few other things by requiring the DoD to certify \nreadiness. We do that because in response for example to the Marine Corp Commandants comment that the \nborder mission is an unacceptable risk to combat readiness and we're also asking the department to show us how \nthe skills of those deployed soldiers aligns with the missions that they're asked to do. And that's important because \nwe know that soldiers are on the border, sailors and marines painting the wall, shoveling manure and fixing cars. \nSo, we're asking for a report, we're asking for reimbursement. \n\nI yield back, Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: aye's there any further discussion on this amendment? \n\nROGERS: Yes Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as it may concern to my friend from Georgia. \n\nSCOTT: I want to read a little bit from the CIA's page on Mexico.  \n\nMajor drug producing and transit nation. Mexico is estimated to be the world's third largest producer of opium with \npoppy cultivation in 2015 estimated to be 28 hectares yielding potential production of 475 metric tons of raw opium.  \n\nGovernment conducts the largest independent illicit crop eradication program in the world, continues primary trans-\nshipment country for U.S. bound cocaine from South America with an estimated 95 percent of annual cocaine \nmovements toward the U.S., stopping in Mexico. \n\nMajor drug syndicates control the majority of drug trafficking through the country producing distributors of ecstasy. A \nsignificant money laundering center, major supplier of heroin and large (INAUDIBLE) supplier of marijuana and \nmethamphetamines to the U.S. markets. \n\n\n\nI would just remind you we lose more Americans to drug overdoses in a month than we have lost to terrorism in the \nlast decade and so as much as I wish we didn't need our military at the border, if we're honest, we need to stop the \nflow of illegal drugs into the country and this may be the only way to do it.  \n\nAnd with that I yield the remainder of my time back to Mr. Rogers.   \n\nROGERS: Nothing further. \n\nSMITH: (OFF MIC) \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it. \n\nUNKNOWN: We'll have a recorded vote on this one as well. \n\nSMITH: And we are now on to law 229R1, Miss Hartzler for the purposes of Miss Hartzler's (INAUDIBLE) \n\nHARTZLER: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment, reading is dispensed with, Miss Hartzler is recognized. \n\nHARTZLER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to take us all back to the year 1990. That's when we had--we were \nworking on the NDAA. I wasn't here but we had a Democratic controlled House and Senate and they passed a very \nimportant bill at that time that allows the Department of Defense to provide for the construction of roads and fences \nand installation of lighting for the purpose of to block drug smuggling quarters across international boundaries of the \nUnited States. \n\nThis is a large piece of legislation that this committee several years ago passed in order to go after the drug cartels \nand to the counter drug operations. My amendment today restores the DoD's ability to build fences for counter drug \nactivities. That has been the law of the land since 1990 and in the underlying bill they removed this provision of \nSection 284 and I think we can all agree that this is an area that needs to stay in our current law. \n\nThe Department of Defense needs to be able to help take on this real threat to our country because we not only \nhave wars abroad, afar, we also have a war on drugs. In 2017 alone we lost 70,000 Americans to drug overdoses. \nNow that is more than during the entire time during the Viet Nam war. It is devastating and 90 percent of the heroin \nthat is coming into the United States comes across the southern border from the drug cartels. \n\nThey aren't backing off. The drug cartels are ramping up. Over the last two years we've seen a 73 percent increase \nin Fentanyl, 38 percent increase in methamphetamine coming across the border. 22 percent increase in heroin \nseized and last year Customs and Border Patrol seized enough cocaine to fill more than 141 one-ton pickup trucks. \n\nWe received--they caught more Fentanyl, 1,847 pounds of Fentanyl. That's enough to kill 418 million people and \nthat's more than the entire population of the United States. But these numbers aren't just statistics. They are played \nout in the lives of individuals in our district. I've had individuals in Missouri and families I've gotten to know that \nhave lost children to the heroin, to the war on drugs.  \n\nBut there's other lives that have been lost to this horrific epidemic. There's Cameron Weiss 18 years old from \nAlbuquerque New Mexico who died of a heroin overdose. There's Madison McDonald a 15-year-old girl from \nMarlton, New Jersey who was found dead in her bedroom the day after Christmas in 2017 with a bag of heroin cut \nwith Fentanyl next to her. There's Caitlyn Sterling of Saxis, Virginia who died at the age of 20 from a heroin \naddiction.  \n\n\n\nEach of us in this room has been impacted by the drug epidemic in our nation and it's irresponsible to limit DoD's \nability to effectively conduct drug interdiction. The Constitution clearly states it is our duty to provide for the common \ndefense. \n\nFor our forefathers, initially that meant our immediate borders. We have a responsibility to defend our nation from \ndeadly drugs that's taking lives of our citizens. Our predecessors understood this and that's why they expanded the \nDepartment of Defense's role in previous NDAA's. \n\nThis epidemic requires a whole government approach which includes the military and so I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment to allow us to be able to keep this very, very important tool to keep our constituents safe. \nTo allow the Department of Defense to continue to target the drug cartels and to counter those and to be able to \nprovide and build fences and construction of roads if need be to block off the drug corridors that are taking the lives \nof ultimately of our citizens and so with that I reserve the balance of my time. \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you Mr. Chair and I too wasn't here in 1990 but even as an 11-year-old I can tell the difference of \nwhy then that bill was justified and why it's no longer justified now. \n\nThen it went through an appropriate Oversight Committee hearing, it came through HASP, it was appropriated, we \nfunctioned as a, the (INAUDIBLE) check on the Presidency. What we have seen now with this particular section is \nthat it is the Trojan horse that is being used essentially to funnel the DoD money that we have appropriated and \nauthorized to this border wall and other efforts. \n\nNow what we are consistently seeing here is that if there's a way to do this, we should go through the proper \nprocess but we're saying in this committee or at least on this side was that the president has abused a system that \nwas set up for true emergencies. \n\nNow, if you believe that this is an emergency to the extent that this president is saying, then he should actually go \nthrough the appropriations process. We are, what we have in this markup actually allows a certain level of funding \nto be used as we noted $100 million entirely within the United States, $500 million outside the borders and if \nthere's more needed, then he should do what our forefathers always thought so that he should be part of that \nprocess and we should have the power of the purse to determine how the taxpayers money is best used. \n\nUnfortunately, what we've seen so far is that this particular section 10 USC 284 has been particularly abused by \nthis administration and has been the funnel from where most of this money has been going through so that's why I \nask all committee members to please oppose this amendment. \n\nAnd I yield back to Representative--I yield my time to Representative Garamendi. \n\nGARAMENDI: Thank you Mr. Gallego. You very correctly pointed out the abuse that the administration is involved \nin circumventing the appropriation power of Congress. \n\nI do want to speak to the issue of the flow of drugs into the United States. Some members of this committee are \nalso on the Transportation, Infrastructure the Maritime Subcommittee, a hearing took place here in the T and I \nCommittee room. The information provided is that the drugs from Mexico go through the ports of entry. Some \nsmaller amount, a very small proportioned amount do go through areas outside of the ports of entry but the great \nmajority, Fentanyl basically by the postal service and other delivery services and cocaine and heroin and marijuana \ndirectly through the ports of entry. \n\nSo that's one of the places we ought to do it. Also pointed out very, very clearly was the role of the U.S. Coast \nGuard which is severely underfunded and is unable to provide more than 16 percent of the known drugs that are \nflowing from Columbia into Central America and then from there transported both by water and over land into the \nUnited States. So, it is incorrect to think that a wall is going to solve the problem. It is correct to spend the money \nappropriately. Authorized and appropriated by the Congress for the purposes in the homeland defense agency. Not \nto use a surreptitious route of money that was appropriated and authorized for the Department of Defense from \nother purposes and then claiming a emergency and then funneling that money into the drug interdiction program. \n\n\n\nSo, with that I yield back the remaining of my time.  \n\nSCOTT: Thank you Mr. Chairman.  \n\n95 percent of the cocaine in the U.S. comes through Mexico. Largest supplier of meth to the U.S., major supplier of \nheroin. My colleague is correct that more of it comes through ports of entry than comes across--no I don't agree \nwith the 80 to 90 percent, I will concede that more comes through ports of entry but if we're honest about the \nwestern hemisphere, what is destroying the governments in Central and South America is the flow of money and \nweapons to the cartels. We are doing the other countries in the western hemisphere a favor by having a secure \nborder in the United States and stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the United States and stopping the flow of \nmoney back to the cartels in the western hemisphere that are destroying those governments and killing those \npeople. \n\nWith that I yield the remainder of my time. \n\nSMITH: I believe Mr. Gallego has 40 seconds left. Do you wish to use it? \n\nGALLEGO: Thank you Mr. Smith. This is how absurd that this situation we're dealing with. That 284 actually was \nsupposed to use directly for contra drugs except it was never actually used contra. They actually raided even that \nfund to put it towards the wall. So if you were actually trying to actually deal with the problems of ports of entry \nwhere the majority of the drugs are coming in, then we'd actually use that money to actually put it in the ports of \nentry, hire more CBP or hire--or do whatever necessary improvements you have to do there. Instead it's been used \nfor a wall, so this is why again the best way to actually deal with an emergency of this nature is actually go through \nthe process. The operation process where we can actually have input and we can actually truly figure out a way to \nsolve this in a bi-partisan manner and not through a power grab by the president using powers that we had never, \never given him or never thought any president would ever use and this is why we have to restrict them because \nthey have not used their power in an appropriate manner. \n\nAnd I yield back my time. \n\nSMITH: All right. A question occurs in the amendment by Miss Hartzler. All those in favor say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Opinion of the chair, the no's have it. \n\nRecorded vote is requested and we'll add that. \n\nAll right. We're going to--if everyone will bear with me for a moment, I want to give you an update on where we're at \nand what we're doing. A lot of fast and furious activity we have here. \n\nWe have an amendment by Mr. Crow left and then we have I believe four on block packages. There are two issues \nthat we now have an agreement on that we're going to try to include in those on block packages. If we can't get \nthem in, in time they will be handled separately and that is the launch language which I think we'll be happy to know \nwe are not going to have to have a vote on launch language, we have an agreement. \n\nSecond and I'll get into this in a minute. The $2.3 billion for the emergency funding, we also have an agreement on \nwhich we're going to be willing to be able to accept and then we'll have a fast and furious ten-minute debate about \n750 or 733. Then we will have a series of amendment votes. Do we have a count on how many amendments now? \nWe've asked for a vote. A lot is not a precise answer. It is accurate but it's not-- \n\nUNKNOWN: Eleven. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Eleven, and we will likely have at least one more, so we'll probably have 12 votes to take at the conclusion \nof (INAUDIBLE) amendment.   \n\nSo, everyone just take a deep breath, the home stretch here. We will now move to log 360R1 from Mr. Crow. What \npurpose does Mr. Crow seek recognition? \n\nCROW: I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. Without objection the reading of the amendment will be dispensed \nwith and Mr. Crow is recognized on his amendment. \n\nCROW: Thank you Mr. Chair. My amendment would prohibit the use of Department of Defense funds to house \nchildren involuntarily separated from a parent.  \n\nThis is a very simple amendment. I find the policy of forcible child separation particularly abhorrent and certainly the \nfact that we did this very recently will be a moral stain on our country but more so or similarly is the--is the impact on \nthose that are forced to participate in those policies and the impact on them and their families. \n\nThe primary purpose of our Department of Defense and our military is to ensure our national security, to train and to \nfight and win our wars. They should not be pulled into politics. They should not be pulled into policies of this nature. \nSo, I believe that this amendment is important to ensure that our uniformed personnel, our men and women are not \npulled into politics. \n\nIf this administration should decide to reinstitute a child separation policy in the future, we will have that battle in the \nHouse of Representatives and I will certainly fight to prevent that happening but I want to do through this \namendment is ensure that our men and women in uniform and the Department of Defense are not a part of that \nbattle. That we are insulating them from those politics, and we will have that battle separate from our men and \nwomen in uniform, so I would ask for everyone's support to ensure that we can make that happen. \n\nSMITH: aye's there further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Rogers. \n\nROGERS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. You know since the Trump administration ended the family separation practice \nmonths ago, even though it had been carried out the entire eight years of the Obama administration, I really have a \nproblem with this amendment because it's a moot point but for the fact that at the very end of it there's a poison pill \nthat I just can't abide. \n\nIt would allow law enforcement decisions about child safety be overruled by an anonymous, unvetted, \nunaccountable child welfare worker with no law enforcement experience. You know when we take children away \nfrom an adult now it's because we suspect the adult is not their parent, it's for their safety. Under the way this is \nwritten, unless they can find a child welfare worker within forty eight hours, who can make a decision within forty \neight hours, we have to put the kid back with the adult who we expect is really is just somebody who's rented the \nkid to get into the country. \n\nI think this is a dangerous precedent. If that provision wasn't in there, I'm fine with it but it is in there and I think we \nneed to vote against this. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Moulton. \n\nMOULTON: Mr. Chairman I just wanted to acknowledge that I was reluctant to support this amendment initially \nbecause there's a bit of hypocrisy here in the sense that just two years ago Mr. Bridenstine on this committee \noffered an amendment to prohibit housing unaccompanied alien children on U.S. military installations located inside \nthe U.S. and every democrat on the committee except Mr. Bacon's predecessor voted against it. \n\nIronically the only Republican to vote no was Mr. Crows predecessor but Mr. Crow in his case here has included \nsignificant exceptions to the amendment that I think are--that I think are reasonable. \n\n\n\nDemocrats in the past voted against this prohibition because we said if a military base is the safest place for these \nchildren to be housed then they should be housed there. Better than leaving them on the street. I think that Mr. \nCrow has accounted for those concerns with his exceptions and that's why I support the amendment. \n\nI yield back. \n\nSMITH: Mr. Conaway. \n\nCONAWAY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm from Texas as you know and it would be our state courts and state laws \nthat would be involved in this issue and our state legislature just finished their every other year session and one of \nthe unresolved issues is the lack of foster care, the lack of care for children who's parental rights have been \nsevered. \n\nAnd I can't imagine that Texas would want to step into those shoes, sever those parents' rights and then take \npossession of those children if this is what this is intended to have happen. \n\nIt may be okay for someone from Colorado to propose this but somebody from Texas is not interested in these \nchildren being loaded onto the state. We already bear a disproportionate share of the wreck that is the lack of \ncontrol at our borders and to add this to that, I don't think that our state folks would be really willing to step into this \nrole to assume custody of these children. \n\nWith that I reserve. \n\nESCOBAR: Mr. Chairman? \n\nSMITH: Miss Escobar.   \n\nESCOBAR: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Crow I want to thank you for your amendment I want you to know that \nchildren are still being forcibly separated from their parents in my district. We have casework that identifies those \nfamilies. We are raising the issue with the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security because it is \nhappening, so I see this as a very valuable, important amendment and I want to thank you. \n\nI yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you Miss Escobar. \n\nCROW: Can I use the remaining amount of my time Mr. Chair? \n\nSMITH: Absolutely Mr. Crow. \n\nCROW: Just to address some of the points on the opposite side of the aisle here. This is a very narrowly tailored \namendment with the exceptions to account for some of the law enforcement activities you had discussed earlier to \naccount for the need in some circumstances to remove a child, if that child's safety and wellbeing requires that but \noverall the thrust of this amendment remains the same and that is to ensure that our men and women in uniform at \nour military installations are not being involved and put in the position of having to house forcibly separated--forcibly \nseparated, accompanied minors who are forcibly separated from the folks who brought them over, their parents or \nguardians. They are not to house those children and get involved in that policy. \n\nSMITH: Any further discussion? All right, no further discussion. The question occurs on the amendment by Mr. \nCrow. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed will say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\n\n\nSMITH: Please show the aye's have it. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. \n\nIt is now in order to consider unblocked package number five. I ask unanimous consent to call up unblocked \npackage number five consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority without \nobjection. So ordered.  \n\nI like the way I'm kind of talking to myself here, but will the clerk please distribute the unblocked amendment. \nWithout objection the amendments are considered as read. Unblocked package number five is comprised of the \nfollowing. And these are the log numbers that I'm reading. \n\n026R3 by Mr. Turner, 040 by Miss Speier, 050 by Miss Hill, 067R1 by Mr. Gaetz, 075R2 by Mr. Larsen, 084R3 by \nMiss Gabbard, 093R1 by Miss Torres Small, 02R4 by Mr. Brown, 113R1 by Mr. Brown, 114R3 by Mr. Brown, \n117R1 also by Mr. Brown, 118R1 by Mr. Brown, 132R1 by Mr. Wittman, 135R2 by Mr. Cisneros, 139 by Miss \nSlotkin, 144R1 by Miss Hartzler, 148R1 by Miss Horn, 163R1 by Mr. Kim, 179R1 by Miss Speier.  \n\naye's there discussion on the unblocked amendment?

I ask unanimous consent to call up unblocked \npackage number six consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with minority. Without \nobjections so ordered.

Unblock number six consists of the following amendments. \n\nAmendment number 214 by Mr. Langevin, amendment number 220R1 by Mr. Kelly, amendment number 226 by \nDoctor Abraham, number 256R1 by Mr. Byrne, number 286 by Mr. Graves, number 288R2 by Mr. Courtney, \nnumber 290 by Mr. Courtney, number 292R1 by Mr. Courtney, number 295 by Miss Trahan, number 296 by Miss \nTrahan, number 302R1 by Mr. Moulton, 311 by Mr. Gallego, 321R1 by Miss Houlahan, 327R1 by Miss Haaland, \nnumber 338R1 by Mr. DesJarlais, number 339 by Mr. Carbajal, number 347R1 by Miss Haaland, number 354R1 by \nDoctor Abraham, 356 by Miss Sherrill, number 3621R1 by Mr. Thornberry, number 365 by Mr. Thornberry, number \n368 by Mr. Thornberry. \n\naye's there discussion on the unblocked package? \n\nKELLY: Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: I'm sorry, who speaks? Oh, Mr. Kelly. \n\nKELLY: Knowing the time of day and how this is an issue one of these unblocked amendments that I want to speak \non is Space A is for families of fallen heroes, our gold star families who have sacrificed so much for this country. \nMany of them had dreams of using Space A after retiring for travel.  \n\nThe survivor's dreams shouldn't be upended because of death of their loved one in service to this country. This \namendment creates a new Space A travel category for loved ones left behind and it's just a small gesture of our \nappreciation from a grateful nation and a grateful member of Congress to these gold star families. \n\nAnd with that I yield back Mr. Chairman. \n\nSMITH: Thank you Mr. Kelly. Further discussion? \n\nHearing none, all those in favor of unblocked package number six will say aye. \n\n\n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Those opposed will say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Ayes have it.

Unblocked package number eight. I ask unanimous consent to call \nup unblocked package number eight consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved by the \nmajority--minority, sorry. Without objection so ordered. Clerk will distribute the amendment without objection it will \nbe considered as read. Unblocked package number eight is comprised of the following. \n\nNumber 037R1 by Miss Speier, number 445R1 by Mr. Banks, number 069 by Miss Gabbard, number 051R1 by \nMiss Hill, number 031R1 by Miss Speier, number 508 by Mr. Bacon, number 459R1 by Miss Carbajal, number \n308R2 by Mr. Gallego, number 2R9 by Mr. Langevin.  \n\nThis is going to go on for a while by the way. \n\nNumber 322R1 by Miss Houlahan, number 447R2 by Miss Escobar, number 035R3 by Miss Speier, number 185R1 \nby Mr. Cooper, number 350R2 by Mr. Garamendi, number 105 by Mr. Brown, number 380R2 by Mr. Kim, number \n328R1 by Miss Haaland, number 086 by Miss Gabbard, number 513 by Miss Haaland, number 253 by Mr. Rogers, \nnumber 005R1 by Mr. Turner, number 390R2 by Mr. Lamborn, number 006R1 by Mr. Turner.  \n\naye's there discussion on the unblocked package? Mr. Bacon. \n\nBACON: Mr. Chairman I just want to point out how grateful I am to the committee here for having the MilCon--the \nMercy MilCon put in. We've been working this for weeks. I thought we had it yesterday, it came back out, but we \njust been able to get that added. But you know there was a $4.8 billion in damage was the estimate and the \nemergency supplemental that we passed a few weeks back was $1.6 billion. That left a big delta and the \nappropriators appropriated most of that contingent on this committee authorizing it this what this does, and this will \nhave a huge impact for Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point, Tindall Air Force Base and Offutt Air Force Base.  \n\nMy base, 30 buildings were destroyed and so this was a great moment and I just want to thank the committee. I \nyield back. \n\n\n\nSMITH: If (INAUDIBLE) will yield, there are more amendments to unblocked package number eight. I did not read \nthem all and I'm pretty sure that I--the thing's stapled. We put this together at the last minute so if you will indulge \nme for just a minute, I want to make sure that I read all the ones that were supposed to be read. \n\nOkay so we're going to think of, sorry about that, we're going to think of Mr. Bacon's comments there as an \ninterlude and we are back on unblocked package number eight and we're going to have to agree to adopt it and I'm \npretty sure this is where I left off and continue with 037R2 by Miss Speier, number 445R1 by Mr. Banks, did we \nalready cover these? \n\nUNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) \n\nSMITH: Ah, 086 by Miss Gabbard, so there was only the last page that we didn't get to so-- \n\nUNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) \n\nSMITH: Okay I did 0--yeah, I did, okay. Two handwritten one's which were added at the last minute.  \n\nMan am I going to have trouble reading this, there we go. \n\nNumber 264R1 by Mr. Bacon and number 470R1 by Mr. Smith. All right is there further discussion on unblocked \namendments? Miss Torres Small. \n\nTORRES SMALL: Thank you I'd just like to speak quickly about the importance of small business protegee \nprograms that allows small businesses to enter in to contracting opportunities with military--with the military.  \n\nIt grows rural communities and it helps support the pipeline.  \n\nSMITH: Further discussion on unblocked? And ironically, I have to discuss one of the unblocked amendments. \n\nThis has to do with the launch language which we've negotiated and we can all be thankful we're spared a larger \ndebate but I want to make clear the intent of the language we came up with was basically to make sure we had a \nmaximum amount of competition while at the same time the intent of the language is to maintain the current request \nfor a proposal and acquisition schedule for what is referred to as Phase 2. \n\nWe do not wish to slow down that schedule at all or alter the RFP involved in the process of going through with \nPhase 2. We will try and do some different things that aren't worth getting in to, but we have no intention of \nupsetting the current acquisition schedule for Phase 2 launch determinations. \n\naye's there further discussion on the unblocked amendments? Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: Ayes have it unblocked number eight is adopted. \n\nSMITH: (OFF MIC) for what purpose does Mr. Thornberry seek recognition? \n\nTHORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk. \n\nSMITH: Clerk will distribute the amendment and we will dispense with the reading of said amendment, Mr. \nThornberry is recognized. \n\nNow I will--we're going to try to keep five minutes for him, five minutes for me. We'll distribute it out, that's what \nwe're going to try to do. We have talked about this subject earlier in the mark, so we have had our chance. Mr. \nThornberry. \n\n\n\nTHORNBERRY: Thank you Mr. Chairman and I will try to be concise. This amendment would raise the top line in \nthe bill to the same amount that the administration requested and the same amount that the Senate has already \nmarked to. \n\nIt represents right at a three percent real growth which testimony has consistently been in this committee, from two \nSecretaries of Defense, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, endorsed by the National Strategy Commission with six \nDemocratic appointees, six Republican appointees, that that's the right amount. \n\nBut I don't really want to focus on the amount. I want to focus on the substance because when we put this together, \nwe identified the specific things that this money would go for. Nearly every bit of it was either in the original \nadministration request or in the unfunded requirements from the services.  \n\nThere are no lightning rods in here. There's no wall funding or anything like that. Where we agreed in the underlying \nmark to reduce an administration request, I did not go back and put it back in, I stuck with our agreement. \nEverything in here is core responsibility of this committee. \n\nFor example, $400 million for next generation air dominance. $100 million for F15C repairs and parts. And by the \nway 28 of those aircraft are currently grounded, awaiting repairs and parts. All of this by the way goes back up to \nwhat the administration requested. We're not going above; this is what they asked for. To fix the F15's. \n\nWe add money for six F35's one E2D Hawkeye, we restore money for $18 million for the Super Hornets as part of a \nthree-year multiyear deal. Going to ground, we restore $4.8 million for amphibious combat vehicles, $5 million for \narmored multipurpose vehicles. In the sea area we restore $211 million for CVN refueling overhauls. We put back in \nthe administration request of $390 million to prevent a one-year slip on CVN 81. We put back in $49.5 million for \nJDAM's, $25 million for army tactical missiles. We restore $130 million for ground based strategic deterrent. \n\nI mentioned earlier we put back in money for hyper-sonic development, unmanned surface vehicles, depot \nmaintenance support for Army, National Guard and (INAUDIBLE) reserve. \n\nAll of those and more is specifically laid out in the amendment before you. So--so this vote is not on some \nhypothetical number. It is on those specific capabilities and that's what matters most. It is also I would suggest on \nhow this committee can be relevant when it comes to negotiations with the Senate and whether we can engage at a \nlevel that the administration and the Senate Armed Services Committee have already agreed to. \n\nI--it is possible, let me say one more thing. It is possible that there could be a cap deal in the future that would be \nsome other number. It may be 733, it may be 740. I don't know what it would be, and I absolutely acknowledge that \nif and when there's a cap deal and I hope it's tomorrow, that we should adjust our authorization to fit it. \n\nBut where we are today for this committee to authorize, I understand where you appropriators are, for us to \nauthorize an amount less than the administration requested, less than the consistent testimony we have received, \nless than the Senate Armed Services Committee puts us at a disadvantage. \n\nSo, this is a vote mainly on the substance of the things I've listed and otherwise. It's also a vote for us to have the \nmost influence possible in the debates to come. \n\nI yield back. \n\nSMITH: Thank you.  \n\nJust to walk back through the history, it's worth noting that $733 billion by about $17 billion is the largest defense \nbudget ever. It is a 2.4 percent increase over last year's budget which was also the largest defense budget ever. \n\nWe have increased the defense budget (INAUDIBLE) significant amount in each of the last two years and in this \nyear. $733 billion is not a small amount of money and to walk through the history, when we got the caps deal for \nFY '18 and FY '19 it was agreed to or it was projected in the (INAUDIBLE) in the DoD that they would ask for $733 \nbillion in FY '20 and as Chairman Dunford testified, that was what they've done for the last year is to build their \n\n\n\nbudget around that $733 billion number and as recently as March you had administration officials parading up the \nCentCom Commander testified that $733 was what they needed to meet their national security objectives. \n\nThen the president said that he felt that the defense budget should be $700 billion. That caused a fair amount of \nconsternation amongst his Republican colleagues--not colleagues, the Republicans on the hill, which prompted a \ndiscussion. You can't go down to $700 which is why I reference earlier that on March 26th about 70 Republicans, I \nthink it was all House members sent an urgent letter to the president saying you have to stick to $733, our national \nsecurity is dependent upon that. \n\nThey went over and had a discussion about this and somehow the president's not a particular negotiator in my \nmind, he started at $733, he asked for $700 and after he negotiated, he came out at $750. That's not normally the \nway you're supposed to go in a negotiation.  \n\nSo, the $733 number was a very informed number over a long period of time to arrive at that number. And it is a \nnumber that Republicans as recently as three months ago was insisting upon and I will also submit very strongly as \nwe've seen with the battle over the wall, it didn't take the Pentagon more than the blink of an eye to find $7 billion \nfor this wall. It wasn't hard at all to take a billion dollars out of (INAUDIBLE) take it from other places. \n\nThe Pentagon has a history of asking for money in many instances for programs that are not ready to spend that \nmoney yet and if we give it to them it discourages them from being efficient. And I honestly believe that, and I think \nMr. Thornberry made a very valid point, back when we, without warning because of the Budget Control Act, cut the \nPentagon by 20 percent. Yeah, you're not going to get much efficient when you're cut overnight by 20 percent but \nwe're increasing you by 2.4 percent and after we've done that we throw another $17 billion at you, there is not \nincentive whatsoever to develop efficiency because you know there's more money coming around the corner. \n\nThe Pentagon still can't perform an audit. They can't tell you where they spent last year's money. Can't do it. They \ncan't tell you what's in their inventory. They can't tell you the amount of buildings that they have. There is \ninefficiency built into the Pentagon. If you just give them more money without asking for some rigor, and we had \nrigor in that $733 number, that's what they did over the course of the last year. They didn't do that for the $17 billion.  \n\nNow, the ranking member read off a very impressive list. Let me tell you something, if we funded at $750 it wouldn't \ntake anyone in this room more than about a half a day to come up with another list for another $17 or another $20 \nor another $30. There is always more money than you can spend at the Pentagon.  \n\nBut I think part of this committee's responsibility is to exercise oversight to ensure that that money is sufficiently \nspent. I've often joked defense is the one area where Republicans and Conservatives seem to think throwing \nmoney at the problem is perfectly okay. It's not. We have to insist upon efficiencies and going artificially up to $750, \nwhich is by the way what the appropriators marked to in the House, I think it's irresponsible. I think it takes away \nfrom our oversight responsibilities and from our demanding that our tax dollars be spent wisely and well. \n\nI do appreciate the debate. I just want to close by thanking all members for the debates we have; we're going to \nhave about 12 or 13 amendments coming up here.  \n\nI do urge a no vote on this amendment to enforce efficiency and let the tax payers know we're going to make sure \nthey're getting their money's worth out of every dollar that we spend at the Pentagon we're going to try and rein in \nsome of that waste that we heard discussed today and that we've all witnessed during our time on this committee. \n\nWith that I yield back, and a question occurs on Mr. Thornberry's amendment. All those in favor will say aye. \n\nUNKNOWN: Aye. \n\nSMITH: Opposed will say no. \n\nUNKNOWN: No. \n\nSMITH: I'll skip the analysis, ask for a recorded vote. So, we now have how many lined up here? \n\n\n\nI'm sorry, why are you whispering? \n\nCLERK: It's 12 or 13. I think we're talking 13 but a decision has to be made on Miss Escobar's-- \n\nSMITH: --oh sorry I made that decision I just didn't tell you. We're not going to revisit back. \n\nCLERK: Okay so 12. \n\nSMITH: 13 votes so if we could get them up in order there. Give us a minute to see them, put them up on the board \nbefore we start calling them. We'll then try to go through and explain what they are since it's been a while since we \nhad the debates. \n\nUNKNOWN: (OFF MIC) \n\nSMITH: I don't think so. The suggestion was to unblock all the Guantanamo votes but I'm thinking that's not going to \nhappen so. The suggestion was to unblock all of the Guantanamo votes in one big Guantanamo vote, yeah, I don't \nthink so. \n\nYeah, I was asked, figured I'd throw it out there. They're not quite all the same. We're getting these things \norganized here. It will take just a moment. \n\n(OFF MIC) \n\nAs we go one by one here if before, we do the roll call vote, you can say, first one is Lamborn 500, briefly what is it. \n\nUNKNOWN: Lamborn 500 requires report by SECNAV on how implementing net zero emissions-- \n\nSMITH: It's the Green New Deal. \n\nUNKNOWN: Green New Deal will-- \n\nSMITH: We know what it is. Roll call. \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith. \n\nSMITH: (OFF MIC) \n\nCLERK: Chairman Smith votes no. Mr. Thornberry. \n\nTHORNBERRY: Aye. \n\nCLERK: Mr. Thornberry votes aye.
