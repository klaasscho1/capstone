{"title": "Court to hear Olga Franco's appeal today", "body": "\nThe case of Olga Franco, the illegal immigrant convicted of killing four children in a 2008 school bus crash near \nCottonwood, Minn., goes in front of a Minnesota Appeals Court panel today.\n\nFranco, 26, was convicted in August 2008 of four counts of criminal vehicular homicide and 17 counts of criminal \nvehicular injury in the Feb. 19, 2008, crash, which killed 9-year-old Hunter and 13-year-old Jesse Javens, Emilee \nOlson, 9, and Reed Stevens, 12, near the southwestern Minnesota community. She was sentenced to more than 12 \nyears in prison.\n\nFranco's attorney Manuel Guerrero will tell a three-judge panel today that there was insufficient evidence to \nconvict his client of gross negligence and to prove that she was the driver of the minivan that crashed into the \nschool bus.\n\nHe will also argue that Lyon County District Judge David W. Peterson should not have admitted into trial Franco's \nhospital-room statement that she was driving, because she was medicated and in distress.\n\nThe appeals court panel will have 90 days to issue a ruling.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Franco, a native of Guatemala, will likely be deported after her incarceration because of \nher immigration status, according to a spokesman with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n-- John Brewer\n"}
