{"title": "CITIZEN HOPEFULS CAN BEAT FEE HIKE", "body": "\nThe Santa Clara County Citizenship Program will conduct a \"citizenship blitz\" of educational meetings over the next \ntwo weeks to help immigrants file documents before the citizenship application fee increases.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service will raise the rate from $95 to $225 on Jan. 15.\nApplicants pay an additional $25 for fingerprints.\n\nCritics say the increase puts citizenship out of the reach of poor, legal immigrants. The INS says it needs to raise \nfees so that taxpayers are not subsidizing the naturalization process.\n\nThe blitz at the Center for Employment Training at 701 Vine St. in San Jose will be from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday \nthrough next Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Jan. 10-11. Those interested can drop in during these hours.\n\nParticipants will receive free advice on how to apply and whether they qualify, as well as free photos, free referrals \nto English and citizenship classes, and a free copy of test questions.\n\nTo be eligible for citizenship, a person must be a lawful permanent resident for at least four years and nine months \nor, if married to a U.S. citizen, two years and nine months.\n\nThose attending the blitz are asked to try to bring their residency card, Social Security card, dates of absences from \nthe United States, home andemployer addresses for the past five years, marital history, spouse's and children's \ndates of birth, court records for any crimes committed and a $95 check payable to the INS (if they intend to apply).\n\nNotes\n\nIF YOU'RE INTERESTED\n\nFor more information call (408) 286-1698 (Spanish and English) or (408) 286-1448 (Vietnamese).\n"}
