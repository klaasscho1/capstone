{"title": "PARTY OPPOSES BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nNevada's Independent American Party will spearhead a statewide initiative petition to prevent illegal immigrants \nfrom getting state benefits, its leaders said.\n\nThe party has formed Nevadans First, a committee to prepare language for the initiative that would be similar to \nCalifornia's Proposition 187 and could go before Nevada voters in 2006.\n\n\"We welcome legal immigrants who comply with the legal requirements to become citizens,\" said Chris Hansen, \nchair of Nevadans First. \"This initiative is to discourage illegal aliens from coming to Nevada in search of \ngovernment benefits paid for by Nevada taxpayers.\"\n\nRichard Siegel, a political-science professor at the University of Nevada-Reno, said the proposal seems similar to \nCalifornia's Proposition 187.\n\nThe 1994 initiative, pushed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, sought to bar most state services to illegal immigrants.\n\nNotes\n\nState News in Brief\n"}
