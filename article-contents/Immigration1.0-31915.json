{"title": "Board member overstates authority", "body": "\nCritics of conservative activist Phil Kent have accused him of being a \"nativist.\" Now that Gov. Nathan Deal has \nappointed Kent to a new board to crack down on illegal immigration, critics say he's distorting the truth.\n\nThey point to a speech Kent made before the North Fulton and Friends Tea Party on Oct. 4 where he explained the \nauthority of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board. The state General Assembly created it when lawmakers \npassed House Bill 87, legislation that aims to get tough on illegal immigration.\n\nKent's appointment to the board created controversy. The Anti-Defamation League asked Deal to reconsider Kent's \nappointment, saying he has a history of making \"deeply disturbing\" comments about immigrants. Kent said his \ncritics are left-wing extremists pushing their own agenda.\n\nKent told the tea party group that the review board take complaints about possible violations of state laws on \nimmigration. The board can subpoena witnesses, hold hearings and review or investigate possible violators.\n\n\"And yes we can actually prosecute, and get them into jail, if we bring in the attorney general,\" Kent said. \"That's \nwhat the open borders, anti-enforcement people don't like.\"\n\nImmigrant rights activist Erik Voss, who videotaped the speech, cried foul. The review board has no authority to \nbring in the attorney general, much less prosecute or jail violators, he told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nWe thought Kent's statement was worth a closer look. Can the immigration board call in the attorney general's \noffice and prosecute? We looked into the law. The Immigration Enforcement Review Board was created by Section \n20 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011, also known as House Bill 87.\n\nThe review board fields complaints that state governments or agencies have violated any of three state laws. One \nbans them from establishing policies that give illegal immigrants safe harbor. A second requires them to check the \nlegal status of applicants for public benefits such as food stamps. The third mandates that their contractors and \nsubcontractors file affidavits saying they use a federal database that checks whether employees are in the U.S. \nlegally.\n\nSome of the violations the board has the authority to investigate can be considered criminal offenses. Agency \nworkers who purposefully violate the law requiring them to check the legal status of those seeking public benefits \n\n\ncommit a misdemeanor, and the attorney general has the authority to investigate. Those who knowingly file false \naffidavits about their use of the federal database violate felony fraud laws.\n\nLocal governments that give safe harbor to illegal immigrants risk losing state funding. The board can issue \nsanctions such as fines as high as $5,000 if a local government doesn't fix its problems by deadline.\n\nThe section of HB 87 that established the immigration board makes no mention of bringing in the attorney general's \noffice, except to say that the law does not prohibit the state's top lawyer from \"seeking any other remedy available \nby law.\"\n\nWe asked the state attorney general's office for its understanding of the law. A spokeswoman said that the \nimmigration board has civil enforcement authority, while the attorney general has the power to prosecute violators \ncriminally. The immigration board can make recommendations to the attorney general's office, which will decide \nwhether criminal prosecution is appropriate.\n\nThe Association County Commissioners of Georgia and the Georgia Municipal Association, interest groups that \nrepresent local and county governments, have the same understanding of the immigration board's powers.\n\nKent told us that's how he understands the law, too. If activists think he's saying that the board has the power to \ncriminally prosecute violators on its own, they're twisting his words, said Kent, who is national spokesman for \nAmericans for Immigration Control.\n\n\"The panel could most certainly, if it felt warranted, 'bring in the attorney general' and recommend his office open an \ninvestigation with an eye toward prosecution,\" Kent said in an email.\n\nAnyone has the power to tell the attorney general of a possible violation of the law, he told us in a telephone \ninterview. \"The board can't do it alone, obviously,\" Kent said.\n\nWe agree, but that's not what Kent originally said.\n\nKent said that the board \"can actually prosecute\" violators, and \"get them into jail,\" if it enlists the help of the \nattorney general's office. Actually, the board cannot prosecute anyone or get them into jail.\n\nThe board can bring a potential violation to the attorney general's attention. So can any citizen. That doesn't mean \nhis office will investigate.\n\nKent may have meant to convey that the Immigration Enforcement Review Board can only recommend that the \nattorney general open an investigation, but he gave the impression it has far more power than that. He therefore \nearns a False.\n\nComment on a ruling\n\nWant to comment on a Truth-O-Meter ruling? You can.
