{"title": "U.S. TO RESUME HAITIAN DEPORTATIONS", "body": "\nAfter a year's moratorium, U.S. immigration authorities have quietly decided to resume deporting Haitians who \nentered the country illegally, saying the restoration of democracy to Haiti now makes it safe for them to go home.\n\nIn Florida, 1,358 Haitians face deportation.\n\nThe decision could have far broader impact if it signals a belief by U.S. officials that political violence in Haiti has \ndecreased to the point where the country is generally safe.\n\nThat view could make it harder for 14,800 Haitians who have applied for asylum in Florida to demonstrate a \"well-\nfounded fear of persecution,\" the legal standard for obtaining refuge in the United States.\n\nSome immigration judges and INS trial attorneys already are taking a tougher stance when reviewing asylum \nclaims, asserted Cheryl Little, an attorney for Florida Rural Legal Services in Miami. She cited several recent cases \nin which judges turned down asylum claims by noting the return of democratically elected Haitian President Jean-\nBertrand Aristide.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service suspended the deportation of Haitian aliens in October of last year, \nciting turmoil in their homeland. During the past year, the moratorium was extended when the international embargo \nhalted all flights to Haiti.\n\nINS officials decided to lift the moratorium after the U.S. military occupation that restored President Aristide and the \nsubsequent resumption of flights, said agency spokesman Lemar Wooley.\n\nThe agency made no public announcement of the change. Word got out after a Haitian immigrant was detained at \nthe Krome Detention Center near Miami this week for deportation after he visited INS offices in Miami for a routine \ninquiry.\n\nThe INS said the decision affects those who have final deportation orders from an immigration judge -- which \nmeans they have exhausted all legal appeals to stay.\n"}
