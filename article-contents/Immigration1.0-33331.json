{"title": "Arizona immigration ruling key points", "body": "\nIn a 5-3 ruling issued Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down much of Arizona's tough immigration law, \nSB 1070, but upheld a key provision allowing officers to question people about their immigration status.\n\nHere's what the court concluded:\n\nArizona police cannot make warrantless arrests and jail immigrants just because officers believe they are \ndeportable\n\nArizona cannot make it a state crime for illegal immigrants to seek work or to be in the state without carrying \nfederal documentation\n\nArizona police can briefly detain and question someone they've stopped and contact federal agents if they have \nreasonable suspicion they are in the country illegally\n\nVoted in the majority: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Anthony \nKennedy and Sonia Sotomayor\n\nDissented: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas would have upheld all of Arizona's law; Samuel Alito wanted \nto sustain two of the three provisions the majority rejected.\n\nNot participating: Justice Elena Kagan recused herself.\n\nReactions:\n\n\"I remain concerned that the sole remaining provision -- the requirement that police check the immigration status \nof a person they've otherwise stopped or arrested -- raises serious constitutional concerns that will result in civil \nrights violations against citizens and immigrants alike.\" -- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-San Francisco\n\n\"I am disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. ... Today's ruling essentially puts an end to immigration \nenforcement since the states no longer can step in and fill the void created by the Obama administration.\" -- U.S. \nHouse Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas\n"}
