{"title": "Gwinnett firm pleads guilty to harboring illegal immigrants", "body": "\nA Lawrenceville company that brings foreign nationals here to work on Y2K computer problems pleaded guilty \nTuesday to harboring illegal immigrants. Investigators said the company schemed to bring at least 43 \nprogrammers from India to Atlanta.CONSTITUTION\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service said Deep Sai Consulting Inc. got visas for the 43 and promised to find \nthem jobs paying $ 40,000 to $ 60, 000 a year. It said most of the 43 ended up in apartments in Duluth and \nNorcross, waiting for work that never came.\n\nLarry Hines, INS investigations section chief, said he thinks \"there are a lot of companies that know they can do \nthis. It's nothing but white-collar alien smuggling.\"\n\nINS Agent Chad Holth said Deep Sai's president, Syamala Kamineni, applied for visas for more than 200 Indian \nnationals. The government approved about 60 applications before it started to investigate. It made no decision on \nthe other applications pending a yearlong investigation by the INS and U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nJay Strongwater, attorney for Deep Sai and Kamineni, said he expects a judge to fine the company about $ 20,000. \nThe company pleaded guilty to a felony in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Last week, Kamineni pleaded guilty to a \nmisdemeanor alleging she recruited immigrants not eligible to work here. A judge put her on probation for a year.\n\nKamineni said she lined up jobs for the people from India but that the market soured and job prospects dissolved by \nthe time they arrived. The government said about a dozen of the 43 Indians eventually got programming jobs. \nAnother 30 got tired of waiting and left to seek jobs on their own. Investigators do not know what became of them.\n"}
