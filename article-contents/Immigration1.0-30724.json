{"title": "Taking away immigrant students' chance to 'Dream'", "body": "\nI read with outrage the statements of Maryland House Minority Leader Anthony J. O'Donnell (R-Calvert) on the \nMaryland \"DREAM\" act [\"Md. to weigh own 'DREAM' tuition act,\" Metro, Dec. 30]. He argued against giving in-state \ncollege tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants who have attended Maryland high schools.\n\nAs a recent graduate of a Prince George's County high school, I know from personal experience what the state is \nmissing by not encouraging talented immigrant students to attend college here.  \n\nI am a U.S. citizen and lifelong Maryland resident, now attending the University of Maryland. A close friend of mine \ncame to the United States from China when he was 8 years old. In his time here, he learned to speak English and \nadopted American values. We took AP American Government together. When he returned to China for a visit, he \nwas repulsed by the corruption, censorship and the absence of democracy he saw there.\n\nYet, because of his parents' inability to navigate the immigration system in the United States, he was unable to get \nU.S. citizenship. After our senior year of high school, he left for Canada, where he became a citizen and is now \nattending the University of Toronto. He's in the school's prestigious engineering science program.\n\n Our state and, indeed, our country, have lost an intelligent student who believed in the American system as much \nas any citizen and who could have contributed much to this country.\n\nI've met other immigrant students, and I believe that students who have grown up in the United States and \nattended our schools become part of our culture. Their hearts and minds belong to America, as much as those of \nnative-born Americans do. Why should we treat them any differently?\n\nMaia Werbos,  College Park\n"}
