{"title": "Apprenticeship Programs; Equal Employment Opportunity", "body": "\n Washington, DC:  This Rule document was issued by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA)\n\n  \n\n  \n \n  Action\n \n  Final rule.\n \n  Summary\n \n\n  The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL or Department) is issuing this rule to modernize the equal employment \nopportunity regulations that implement the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937. The existing regulations prohibit \ndiscrimination in registered apprenticeship on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, and \nrequire that sponsors of registered apprenticeship programs take affirmative action to provide equal opportunity in \nsuch programs. \n\nThis rule updates equal opportunity standards in part 30 to include age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual \norientation, and disability among the list of protected bases upon which a sponsor must not discriminate; improves \nand clarifies the affirmative action provisions for sponsors by detailing with specificity the actions a sponsor must \ntake to satisfy its affirmative action obligations, including affirmative action for individuals with disabilities; revises \nregulations to reflect changes made in October 2008 to Labor Standards for Registration of Apprenticeship \nPrograms, the companion regulations governing the conduct of registered apprenticeship programs; and improves \nthe overall readability of part 30 through restructuring and clarification of the text. Wherever possible, this final rule \nhas attempted to streamline and simplify sponsors' obligations, while maintaining broad and effective equal \nemployment opportunity protections for apprentices and those seeking entry into apprenticeship programs. The \npolicies and procedures of this rule promote equality of opportunity in apprenticeship programs registered with the \nDepartment and in apprenticeship programs registered with federally recognized state apprenticeship agencies.\n\n \n\n  Dates\n\n\n \n\n  Effective date: These regulations are effective January 18, 2017.\n\n \n\n  Compliance date: Several sections in the final regulation pertaining to equal employment and affirmative action \nviolations specify extended periods beyond the effective date for sponsors to come into compliance with the rule. \nThey are listed below, and described in more detail in the Section-by-Section Analysis and regulatory text. Unless \notherwise indicated, sponsors must comply with the provisions of this regulation on the effective date:\n\n \n\n  180 days after effective date: Obligations under \u00a7&thinsp;30.3\n\n \n\n  2 years after effective date (or 2 years after registration, for sponsors registered after the effective date): \nObligations under \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e), 30.5(b), 30.7(d)(2), 30.9, and 30.11\n\n \n\n  At first compliance review after effective date: \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c), 30.6\n\n \n\n  For Further Information Contact\n\n \n\n  John Ladd, Administrator, Office of Apprenticeship, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of \nLabor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-5641, Washington, DC 20210, oa.administrator@dol.gov, (202) 693-\n2796 (this is not a toll-free number). Individuals with hearing or speech impairments may access this telephone \nnumber via TTY by calling the toll-free Federal Information Relay Service at 1-800-877-8339.\n\n  \n\n  Supplementary Information\n\n \n\n  Statement of Legal Authority and Background Information\n\n \n\n  The National Apprenticeship Act of 1937 authorizes the Department to formulate and promote the furtherance of \nlabor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices.  (1)  The responsibility for formulating and \npromoting these labor standards within the Department lies with the Employment and Training Administration's \n(ETA) Office of Apprenticeship (OA). As part of its duties, OA registers apprenticeship programs that meet certain \nminimum labor standards. These standards, set forth at 29 CFR parts 29 and 30, are intended to provide for more \nuniform training of apprentices and to promote equal opportunity in apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  The regulations at 29 CFR part 29 implement the National Apprenticeship Act by setting forth labor standards that \nsafeguard the welfare of apprentices, including: Prescribing policies and procedures concerning the registration, \ncancellation, and deregistration of apprenticeship programs; the recognition of State Apprenticeship Agencies \n(SAA) as Registration Agencies; and matters relating thereto. On October 29, 2008, the Department published an \namended part 29 to provide a framework that supports an enhanced, modernized apprenticeship system.  (2) \n\n \n\n  Part 30 implements the National Apprenticeship Act by requiring registered apprenticeship program sponsors to \nprovide equal opportunity for participation in their registered apprenticeship programs, and by protecting \napprentices and applicants for apprenticeship from discrimination on certain protected bases. In addition, part 30 \n\nmailto:oa.administrator@dol.gov\n\n\nalso requires that sponsors of registered apprenticeship programs take affirmative action to provide equal \nemployment opportunity in such programs.\n\n \n\n  The Department first published part 30 on December 18, 1963, by order of the President that the Secretary of \nLabor, in implementing the National Apprenticeship Act and Executive Order 10925, require that the admission of \nyoung workers to apprenticeship programs be on a completely nondiscriminatory basis.  (3)  At that time, the \nregulations prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin. Nondiscrimination on the \nbasis of sex was added in 1971, as was the requirement for sponsors with five or more apprentices to develop and \nimplement a written affirmative action plan (written AAP) for minorities.  (4)  In 1978, the Department amended \nthese regulations to require inclusion of female apprentices in written AAPs.  (5)  This rule represents the first \nchanges to these regulations since 1978.\n\n \n\n  Apprenticeship is an earn-and-learn strategy combining on-the-job training with related technical (classroom) \ninstruction, blending the practical and theoretical aspects of training for highly-skilled occupations. Apprenticeship \nprograms are sponsored voluntarily by a wide range of organizations, including individual employers, employer \nassociations, joint labor-management organizations, and other workforce intermediaries. As of the close of Fiscal \nYear 2015, there were about 21,000 program sponsors representing about 200,000 employers that offer registered \napprenticeship training to more than 455,000 apprentices.  (6) \n\n \n\n  Registered apprenticeship is a voluntary national system under which the vast majority of program sponsors enter \ninto agreements with their Registration Agencies without direct funding. Potential apprenticeship sponsors \ndeciding whether or not to register their programs weigh the net benefits derived for meeting state and national \nstandards for registration.\n\n \n\n  There are numerous benefits to registering an apprenticeship program with the Department or an SAA. For the \nbusiness sponsor, registration provides a structure and framework for developing skilled workers critical to a \ncompany's success, and connection to industry, education, and government resources for on-going management of \nthe program and adaptation of new technologies and practices. For example, registered apprenticeships are \nautomatically eligible to be listed as Eligible Training Providers within the workforce development system, the only \nsuch training model to have such treatment. Also, Federal government grants for apprenticeships are available to \nregistered programs only. There are also economic incentives for apprenticeship employers in terms of the wage \nrates that apply to apprentices for work on projects covered by the Davis-Bacon Act and related Acts. For \napprentices, registered apprenticeship comes with education and training without the high costs of a 4-year college \neducation, and a nationally-recognized credential upon completion. American communities benefit from enhanced \nsystems to develop skilled workers in high paying occupations through collaborative partnerships of education, \nindustry, and government, working together and supporting quality training programs.\n\n \n\n  OA oversees the National Apprenticeship System. OA serves as the Registration Agency, and its staff members \nare directly responsible for, registered apprenticeship activities in 25 States. It also provides technical assistance \nand oversight to 25 SAAs in the other 25 States, in the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. In these \n\u201cSAA States,\u201d the SAA has requested and received recognition from the Secretary of Labor to serve as the entity \nauthorized to register and oversee State and local apprenticeship programs for Federal purposes. Therefore, in \nSAA States, the SAA, in accordance with Federal regulations, serves as the Registration Agency and has \nresponsibility for registering apprenticeship activities for Federal purposes.\n\n \n\n  Apprenticeship programs appear in traditional industries, such as construction (which has historically trained the \nmajority of apprentices) and manufacturing, as well as in new and emerging industries, such as health care, \n\n\n\ninformation and communications technology, transportation and logistics, and energy, which are projected to add \nsubstantial numbers of new jobs to the economy.\n\n \n\n  Apprenticeship has become increasingly attractive to workforce policy-makers in the U.S., and more in focus after \nwitnessing the expansive growth in apprenticeship in some of our closest allies, such as the United Kingdom, \nCanada, and Australia. U.S. policy-makers have studied these countries as well as several other European \ncountries, such as Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, where apprenticeships have been ingrained in the culture for \ncenturies and train large percentages of their workforce. The United States Departments of Labor, Commerce, and \nEducation have signed Joint Declarations of Intent to cooperate on workforce training with both Germany&thinsp; \n(7)  and Switzerland;&thinsp; (8)  apprenticeship systems and strategies are featured in both of these Joint \nDeclarations.\n\n \n\n  In light of favorable policy research and the increased business demand for high-quality workforce skills and \ncompetencies, the Department substantially increased its investments in Registered Apprenticeship in recent years.  \n(9)  The Department's new initiative, ApprenticeshipUSA, seeks to advance apprenticeship and build a strong \npipeline of skilled workers, critical for companies to grow their business and compete in the global economy. The \nApprenticeshipUSA initiative is stepping up efforts to expand apprenticeship into high-growth industries and to \nsupport a uniquely American apprenticeship system. The Department is lifting the image and quality of Registered \nApprenticeship throughout the nation, and broadening its scope of training and development activities into an array \nof diverse industries and occupations.\n\n \n\n  Through ApprenticeshipUSA, the Department has taken steps to focus on sector-based and industry engagement \nin expansion efforts, such as promoting business engagement in the Leaders of Excellence in Apprenticeship \nDevelopment, Education, and Research (LEADERs) and the Sectors of Excellence in Apprenticeship (SEAs) \ninitiatives, designed to expand the number of employers training apprentices, to increase program quality, and to \nbuild pipelines of diverse populations into apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  As apprenticeship expands in the U.S., the Department remains committed to long-standing principles of equal \nemployment opportunity to ensure that this expansion draws from and benefits the entire American workforce, \nproviding more Americans a path to good jobs and careers with living wages that apprenticeships offer, in line with \nthe Administration's commitment to double and diversify apprenticeship. The Department is also committed to using \nthese new initiatives and available resources, in conjunction with business, industry, and community partners, to \ncollaborate and build new pipelines into apprenticeship programs, with diversity as a cornerstone of growth in our \nexpansion efforts.\n\n \n\n  Increasing diversity in apprenticeship will further the goals and demonstrate support of the President's \nAdministration's My Brother's Keeper&thinsp; (10)  (MBK) Task Force, a coordinated Federal effort to address \npersistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their \nfull potential. This rule also builds upon programs such as the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional \nOccupations (WANTO)&thinsp; (11)  initiative, which provides technical assistance to improve outreach, \nrecruitment, hiring, training, employment, and retention of women, including women of color and women with \ndisabilities. The Department has additionally provided support for diversity in apprenticeship through the 2015 \nAmerican Apprenticeship Initiative grant that supported programs with a focus upon including underrepresented \npopulations, including women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities.\n\n \n\n  Building a sustained effort to ensure that the benefits apprenticeship programs provide are broadly available to all \nis a key goal of these revised regulations. The history, demographic patterns, and documented experiences in \napprenticeships of members of certain underrepresented groups demonstrate the continuing obstacles to the full \nparticipation of these groups in registered apprenticeship programs.\n\n\n\n \n\n  In evaluating the need for this rule, OA analyzed participant demographics in apprenticeship programs in \nconstruction and non-construction industries and the demographics of the national labor force. OA reviewed \napprenticeship data from OA's Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System (RAPIDS)&thinsp; (12)  \nand analyzed national labor force data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Using the data from these \nsources to compare the demographic characteristics of the national workforce to the demographics of individuals \nenrolled in apprenticeships makes clear that notable disparities exist in apprenticeship participation and completion.\n\n \n\n  As described in more detail below, these data and other available analyses indicate that certain groups continue to \nface substantial barriers to entry into and, for some groups, completion of registered apprenticeships. These \nbarriers result in the following:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Lower than expected enrollment rates in registered apprenticeships among women and specific minority groups;\n\n  \n\n   To the extent that women and minorities participate in registered apprenticeships, concentration of these groups \nin apprenticeships for lower-paying occupations; and\n\n  \n\n   Significantly lower apprenticeship completion rates among specific minority groups and lower construction \napprenticeship completion rates among minority groups and women.\n\n \n\n \n\n  It should also be noted that OA lacks data on the apprenticeship experiences of individuals with disabilities, which \ncomplicates efforts both to measure the challenges faced by this group and to address the disparities in access and \nparticipation that are likely to exist given the disparities faced by these individuals in the labor force more broadly.\n\n \n\n  Women in Registered Apprenticeships\n\n \n\n  In general, women's enrollment in registered apprenticeship programs is significantly lower than would be \nexpected based on labor market data. This disparity exists in comparison to the number of men in registered \napprenticeships and also in comparison to the number of women in the wider civilian labor force. As shown in Table \n1, in FY2015 the national labor force was 53.2 percent male and 46.8 percent female, and even when looking only \nat the labor force lacking a college degree\u2014those workers most likely to participate in apprenticeship programs\u2014\nthe labor force was still 43.0 percent female.

Additionally, while the share of \nnewly enrolled apprentices that are women has fluctuated up and down by small margins over this period, overall \nno noticeable progress has been made, and the share of newly enrolled apprentices in FY2015 that were women is \nidentical to the share in FY2006 that were women.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 2\u2014New Enrollments in Registered Apprenticeship by Sex and Fiscal Year, All Industries\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Fiscal year\n\n     \n\n      Female(%)\n\n     \n\n      Male(%)\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2006\n\n     \n\n      7.1\n\n     \n\n      92.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2007\n\n     \n\n      6.1\n\n     \n\n      93.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2008\n\n     \n\n      6.7\n\n     \n\n      93.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2009\n\n     \n\n      7.8\n\n     \n\n      92.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2010\n\n     \n\n      8.3\n\n     \n\n      91.7\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2011\n\n     \n\n      6.7\n\n     \n\n      93.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2012\n\n     \n\n      7.5\n\n     \n\n      92.5\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2013\n\n     \n\n      6.7\n\n     \n\n      93.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2014\n\n     \n\n      6.7\n\n     \n\n      93.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      2015\n\n     \n\n      7.1\n\n     \n\n      92.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n      10 Year Average\n\n     \n\n      7.1\n\n     \n\n      92.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      CPS Share of Labor Force (FY2015)\n\n     \n\n      46.8\n\n     \n\n      53.2\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Additionally, when looking at the 50 occupations with the largest number of apprenticeships, it becomes clear that \nwomen who are participating in the largest apprenticeship programs are disproportionately ending up in lower-\npaying occupations.  (14)  As shown in Table 3 below, while women account for 9.6 percent of the enrollments in \napprenticeship programs in the lowest paying apprenticeable occupations, they make up only 2.2 percent of \nenrollments in apprenticeship programs in the highest paying apprenticeable occupations. Also illustrative of this \nfact is that while the 16 occupations comprising the lowest-paid tier of these 50 occupations account for only just \nover one-fifth of total apprenticeship enrollments, they account for nearly half of female enrollments.

As seen in Table 4 below, of the 20 major industries in which apprenticeship programs exist, women's \nshare of apprenticeship enrollments is only greater than or equal to their share of the national labor force in three \nindustries and greater than their share of the national labor force without a college degree in four industries \n(Healthcare and Social Assistance, Retail Trade, Finance and Insurance, and Warehousing). Among the top five \nindustries by total apprenticeship enrollments (the first five industries shown in the Table 4), women's share of \nenrollments is no more than 11.6 percent. While there are many reasons that these apprenticeship enrollment rates \ndo not equal the share of the labor force that is women or the share of the labor force without a college degree that \n\n\n\nis women, the magnitudes of the disparities present clearly indicate the presence of significant inequities in access \nand participation.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 4\u2014New Enrollments in Registered Apprenticeship by Sex and Industry in FY2015\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Industry\n\n     \n\n      Total enrollments\n\n     \n\n      Female share (%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Construction&thinsp;16\n\n     \n\n      165,291\n\n     \n\n      2.8\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Public Administration\n\n     \n\n      19,579\n\n     \n\n      11.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Manufacturing\n\n     \n\n      17,154\n\n     \n\n      8.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Utilities\n\n     \n\n      8,389\n\n     \n\n      1.7\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Transportation\n\n     \n\n      4,951\n\n     \n\n      5.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Health Care and Social Assistance\n\n     \n\n      2,274\n\n     \n\n      71.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Retail Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,782\n\n     \n\n      72.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Education\n\n     \n\n      1,755\n\n     \n\n      17.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Other Services, except Public Administration\n\n\n\n     \n\n      1,658\n\n     \n\n      15.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Wholesale Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,529\n\n     \n\n      9.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services\n\n     \n\n      959\n\n     \n\n      18.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Accommodation and Food Services\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      36.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      8.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Information\n\n     \n\n      673\n\n\n\n     \n\n      12.5\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\n\n     \n\n      270\n\n     \n\n      20.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction\n\n     \n\n      225\n\n     \n\n      3.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Finance and Insurance\n\n     \n\n      146\n\n     \n\n      46.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      37.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Real Estate and Rental and Leasing\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      7.0\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Warehousing\n\n     \n\n      41\n\n     \n\n      58.5\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Disparities between male and female enrollment rates are particularly dramatic in the construction industry, where \nover 70 percent of apprentices were enrolled in FY2015.  (17)  That year, only 2.8 percent of enrollments were \nwomen, the second lowest female enrollment rate among all industries, trailing only the Utilities industry (1.7 \npercent). While historical and ongoing discrimination are not the sole explanations for this, the magnitude of the \ndisparities seen in the data, along with several studies of the construction industry and the anecdotal experience of \nthe women working in the industry who submitted comments to the proposed rule, suggest that discrimination \nremains a significant factor.  (18) \n\n \n\n  In the proposed rule, the Department stated that the construction trades have traditionally used informal networks \nand referrals and word of mouth to recruit for open apprenticeships. While we recognize, in response to comments \nsubmitted, that significant progress has been made in wider recruitment for apprenticeships and in opening these \nnetworks, historical barriers linger. Personal introductions and recommendations (as well as nepotism in the past) \ncontinue to be significant factors in selection for construction apprenticeships and work, and many potential female \napprentices are not even be aware of the apprenticeship and job opportunities available.  (19)  The problem of \nunderrepresentation then perpetuates itself; because women have historically been underrepresented in \nconstruction apprenticeships and jobs, many of them may not have access to the interpersonal relationships and \ninformal networks necessary to receive information concerning these opportunities and be selected for them.  (20)  \nBarriers remain even after women gain entry into these programs. Several women submitted comments recounting \ndiscrimination they faced during registered apprenticeship programs, such as being assigned more arduous tasks \nthan male counterparts or otherwise being required to work harder than male counterparts to receive equivalent \nrecognition, being given less skilled and meaningful tasks than male counterparts, being given fewer hours than \nmale counterparts, and seeing men with less skill promoted ahead of them. Several female commenters described \nincidents of sexual harassment and retaliation that they experienced during their apprenticeships or while working in \nthe trades.\n\n \n\n  In addition to low enrollment rates, women complete apprenticeships in the construction industry at lower rates \nthan men. As shown in Table 5 below, while across all industries women complete apprenticeships at a higher rate \n(50.9 percent) than do men (42.0 percent), within the construction industry women completed apprenticeships at a \nrate of only 36.5 percent compared to 40.6 percent for men.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 5\u2014Apprenticeship Completion Rates in FY2015 by Sex\n\n\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      FY2015 completion rates&thinsp;21\n\n     \n\n      &emsp;\n\n     \n\n      Completions(all industries)\n\n     \n\n      Completion rate(all industries)\n\n     \n\n      Completions(construction)\n\n     \n\n      Completion rate(construction)(%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Male\n\n     \n\n      23,763\n\n     \n\n      42.0\n\n     \n\n      11,685\n\n     \n\n      40.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Female\n\n     \n\n      2,248\n\n     \n\n      50.9\n\n     \n\n      271\n\n     \n\n      36.5\n\n    \n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  These disparities can be addressed, however, and evidence illustrates that women do participate and succeed in \napprenticeship programs at higher levels when provided equal opportunity and support. The state of Oregon, for \nexample, has been proactively working to increase diversity in its highway construction workforce since 2009 by \nproviding potential highway construction workers with a variety of supports to help them complete relevant \napprenticeships. The state's Highway Construction Workforce Development Program (WDP) provides pre-\napprenticeship programs, support services including childcare and transportation subsidies, and mentoring and \nretention services to help apprentices gain the training and credentials they need, with a particular emphasis on \nserving female and minority candidates.  (22)  A 2014 poll of apprentices by WDP found that 80 percent of female \nactive apprentices reported that WDP supports allowed them to take a job they would not otherwise have been able \nto take, and completion rates for female apprentices who received financial services from the WDP were \nsignificantly higher than those who did not receive any services (60.9 percent versus 31.5 percent).  (23)  Between \n2005 and 2013, the share of all heavy highway construction apprentices in Oregon that were female apprentices or \napprentices of color increased from 16.5 percent to 26.9 percent, with the program likely playing a significant role in \nmore recent years.  (24) \n\n \n\n  Examples such as that seen in Oregon demonstrate that progress can be made in improving women's \nparticipation and success in apprenticeship programs when doing so is made a priority. Making sure that women \nare aware of the apprenticeship opportunities available to them, that they receive equal opportunities to participate \nin those apprenticeship programs, and that they receive the same quality of training and mentorship in those \nprograms are all critical to closing the significant utilization gaps we see today.\n\n \n\n  Minorities in Apprenticeship\n\n \n\n  The participation of racial and/or ethnic minorities in apprenticeships has been uneven and varies by group. In \nFY2015, the \u201cBlack or African American\u201d demographic group&thinsp; (25)  comprised 12.3 percent of the national \nlabor force and 14.1 percent of the labor force without a college degree (see Table 6), but made up 10.0 percent of \nall apprenticeship enrollments. While those gaps are clearly substantially smaller than those seen among women, \nfocusing only on this broad measure can mask significant underrepresentation of Black or African Americans in \nparticular industries.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 6\u2014Racial and Ethnic Composition of Labor Force in FY2015\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      &emsp;\n\n     \n\n      Share oflabor force(%)\n\n     \n\n      Share oflabor forcewith nocollegedegree(9%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      White\n\n     \n\n      78.8\n\n     \n\n      78.5\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Black or African American\n\n     \n\n      12.3\n\n     \n\n      14.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Other Race\n\n     \n\n      9.0\n\n     \n\n      7.4\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Hispanic or Latino&thinsp;26\n\n     \n\n      16.6\n\n     \n\n      22.7\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  For example, as can be seen in Table 7, while Black or African Americans were well-represented in \napprenticeships in industries such as Public Administration, Health Care and Social Assistance, and Other Services \nin FY2015, they comprised only 8.8 percent of apprentice enrollments in Construction, the industry with by far the \nlargest number of apprentices. Black or African Americans also comprised under 10 percent of enrollments in seven \nother industries, including Utilities; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting; and Professional, Scientific, and \nTechnical Services among others. These disparities illustrate the uneven manner in which Black and African \n\n\n\nAmericans participate in apprenticeships across industries and also speak to the importance of disaggregating such \nenrollment data so as to gain a more accurate picture of where and to what extent different groups are being \nunderrepresented.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 7\u2014New Enrollments in Registered Apprenticeship by Race and Industry in FY2015\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Industry\n\n     \n\n      Totalenrollments\n\n     \n\n      Whiteshare(%)\n\n     \n\n      Black orAfricanAmericanshare(%)\n\n     \n\n      Other raceshare(%)\n\n     \n\n      Unreportedrace share(%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Construction&thinsp;27\n\n     \n\n      165,291\n\n     \n\n      62.4\n\n     \n\n      8.8\n\n     \n\n      7.2\n\n     \n\n      21.5\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Public Administration\n\n     \n\n\n\n      19,579\n\n     \n\n      62.0\n\n     \n\n      24.4\n\n     \n\n      3.5\n\n     \n\n      10.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Manufacturing\n\n     \n\n      17,154\n\n     \n\n      68.6\n\n     \n\n      10.4\n\n     \n\n      6.0\n\n     \n\n      15.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Utilities\n\n     \n\n      8,389\n\n     \n\n      74.5\n\n     \n\n      6.8\n\n     \n\n      4.0\n\n     \n\n      14.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Transportation\n\n     \n\n\n\n      4,951\n\n     \n\n      49.5\n\n     \n\n      11.1\n\n     \n\n      5.2\n\n     \n\n      34.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Health Care and Social Assistance\n\n     \n\n      2,274\n\n     \n\n      53.2\n\n     \n\n      31.9\n\n     \n\n      3.2\n\n     \n\n      11.7\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Retail Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,782\n\n     \n\n      26.3\n\n     \n\n      14.3\n\n     \n\n      3.3\n\n     \n\n      56.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Education\n\n     \n\n\n\n      1,755\n\n     \n\n      49.3\n\n     \n\n      13.2\n\n     \n\n      9.8\n\n     \n\n      27.7\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Other Services, except Public Administration\n\n     \n\n      1,658\n\n     \n\n      55.6\n\n     \n\n      29.5\n\n     \n\n      2.8\n\n     \n\n      12.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Wholesale Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,529\n\n     \n\n      66.8\n\n     \n\n      13.3\n\n     \n\n      2.0\n\n     \n\n      17.8\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services\n\n     \n\n\n\n      959\n\n     \n\n      31.0\n\n     \n\n      22.3\n\n     \n\n      8.2\n\n     \n\n      38.5\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Accommodation and Food Services\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      68.2\n\n     \n\n      13.0\n\n     \n\n      8.3\n\n     \n\n      10.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      67.8\n\n     \n\n      3.0\n\n     \n\n      5.8\n\n     \n\n      23.4\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Information\n\n     \n\n\n\n      673\n\n     \n\n      56.8\n\n     \n\n      16.2\n\n     \n\n      18.1\n\n     \n\n      8.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\n\n     \n\n      270\n\n     \n\n      55.6\n\n     \n\n      5.9\n\n     \n\n      21.1\n\n     \n\n      17.4\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction\n\n     \n\n      225\n\n     \n\n      37.8\n\n     \n\n      8.4\n\n     \n\n      32.0\n\n     \n\n      21.8\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Finance and Insurance\n\n     \n\n\n\n      146\n\n     \n\n      67.1\n\n     \n\n      24.7\n\n     \n\n      4.1\n\n     \n\n      4.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      48.8\n\n     \n\n      9.3\n\n     \n\n      14.0\n\n     \n\n      27.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Real Estate and Rental and Leasing\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      86.0\n\n     \n\n      2.3\n\n     \n\n      2.3\n\n     \n\n      9.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Warehousing\n\n     \n\n\n\n      41\n\n     \n\n      4.9\n\n     \n\n      4.9\n\n     \n\n      0.0\n\n     \n\n      90.2\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Studies examining apprenticeship data at the occupation level have also presented compelling evidence that \nBlacks or African Americans are underrepresented in certain apprenticeable occupations. In an analysis of 2005-\n2007 ACS data broken down to the occupational level in the construction, extraction, and maintenance sector, \nresearchers found that Black or African-American men experienced underrepresentation in 81 percent of the 67 \nprecisely-defined occupations that comprise this sector.  (28) \n\n \n\n  Examining the distribution of Hispanic apprentices illustrates a similar pattern of uneven participation of workers \nacross industries and points to the existence of significant underrepresentation of Hispanics in a number of \nindustries. In FY2015, Hispanics comprised 20.2 percent of apprenticeship enrollments, which was higher than their \nshare of the national labor force (16.6 percent) but below their share of the labor force without a college degree \n(22.7 percent). Looking specifically at industry employment, it can be seen in Table 8 that while Hispanics were \nrelatively well represented in industries such as Education and Wholesale Trade, of the top seven industries by \napprenticeship enrollment, Hispanics accounted for less than 10 percent of enrollees in all but one (Construction). \nIn total, Hispanics accounted for a share of enrollments that was below their share of the national labor force in 13 \nindustries, and accounted for a share of enrollments that was below their share of the labor force without a college \ndegree in 15 industries.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 8\u2014New Enrollments in Registered Apprenticeship by Ethnicity and Industry in FY2015\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Industry\n\n     \n\n      Totalenrollments\n\n     \n\n      Hispanicshare(%)\n\n     \n\n      Non-Hispanicshare(%)\n\n\n\n     \n\n      Unreportedethnicityshare(%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Construction&thinsp;29\n\n     \n\n      165,291\n\n     \n\n      21.2\n\n     \n\n      55.7\n\n     \n\n      23.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Public Administration\n\n     \n\n      19,579\n\n     \n\n      7.2\n\n     \n\n      46.8\n\n     \n\n      46.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Manufacturing\n\n     \n\n      17,154\n\n     \n\n      5.6\n\n     \n\n      62.1\n\n     \n\n      32.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Utilities\n\n     \n\n      8,389\n\n     \n\n      7.2\n\n     \n\n      61.7\n\n     \n\n      31.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Transportation\n\n     \n\n      4,951\n\n     \n\n      6.4\n\n     \n\n      37.2\n\n     \n\n      56.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Health Care and Social Assistance\n\n     \n\n      2,274\n\n     \n\n      9.9\n\n     \n\n      58.9\n\n     \n\n      31.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Retail Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,782\n\n     \n\n      4.7\n\n\n\n     \n\n      14.9\n\n     \n\n      80.4\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Education\n\n     \n\n      1,755\n\n     \n\n      30.9\n\n     \n\n      47.0\n\n     \n\n      22.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Other Services, except Public Administration\n\n     \n\n      1,658\n\n     \n\n      10.5\n\n     \n\n      38.9\n\n     \n\n      50.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Wholesale Trade\n\n     \n\n      1,529\n\n     \n\n      24.0\n\n     \n\n      61.7\n\n     \n\n      14.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services\n\n     \n\n      959\n\n     \n\n      8.4\n\n     \n\n      36.6\n\n     \n\n      55.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Accommodation and Food Services\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      8.1\n\n     \n\n      47.9\n\n     \n\n      43.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting\n\n     \n\n      701\n\n     \n\n      23.7\n\n     \n\n      33.7\n\n     \n\n      42.7\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Information\n\n     \n\n      673\n\n     \n\n      22.1\n\n\n\n     \n\n      44.7\n\n     \n\n      33.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\n\n     \n\n      270\n\n     \n\n      7.4\n\n     \n\n      55.6\n\n     \n\n      37.0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction\n\n     \n\n      225\n\n     \n\n      24.0\n\n     \n\n      50.2\n\n     \n\n      25.8\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Finance and Insurance\n\n     \n\n      146\n\n     \n\n      2.1\n\n     \n\n      87.7\n\n     \n\n      10.3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      23.3\n\n     \n\n      58.1\n\n     \n\n      18.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Real Estate and Rental and Leasing\n\n     \n\n      43\n\n     \n\n      0.0\n\n     \n\n      55.8\n\n     \n\n      44.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Warehousing\n\n     \n\n      41\n\n     \n\n      7.3\n\n     \n\n      2.4\n\n     \n\n      90.2\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Further, minority groups tend to be more concentrated in apprenticeships for lower-paying occupations than are \napprentices as a whole. RAPIDS data for the 50 occupations with the largest numbers of apprentices show that \nboth Black or African-American enrollees and Hispanic enrollees in apprenticeship programs make up higher \n\n\n\nshares of apprentices in low-wage occupations than of apprentices in high-wage occupations. As seen below in \nTable 9, while Black or African Americans comprise 17.3 percent of enrollees in the lowest-paid occupation tier, \nthey account for only 7.8 percent of enrollees in the highest-paid tier, and while Hispanics comprise 22.4 percent of \nenrollees in the lowest-paid occupation tier, they account for only 15.6 percent of enrollees in the highest-paid tier. \nFurther illustrating this point is that while enrollments in the bottom wage tier account for 21.2 percent of total \napprenticeship enrollments among these 50 occupations, they account for 35.8 percent of Black or African \nAmerican enrollments and 25.3 percent of Hispanic enrollments.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 9\u2014Representation by Race in 50 Most Populous Apprenticeable Occupations FY2015\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Category\n\n     \n\n      Example job titles in the tier\n\n     \n\n      Mean hourlywage\n\n     \n\n      Black orAfricanAmericanshare ofenrollments(%)\n\n     \n\n      Hispanicshare ofenrollments(%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Highest Paid Occupations Tier (17 Occupations)\n\n     \n\n      Electrician, Pipe Fitter, Plumber, Telecommunications Technician\n\n     \n\n      $28.04\n\n     \n\n      7.8\n\n     \n\n      15.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Intermediate Paid Occupations Tier (17 Occupations)\n\n     \n\n      Firefighter, Carpenter, Sheet Metal Worker, Glazier, Floor Layer\n\n\n\n     \n\n      22.70\n\n     \n\n      9.5\n\n     \n\n      22.1\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Lowest Paid Occupations Tier (16 Occupations)\n\n     \n\n      Truck Driver, Roofer, Painter, Housekeeper, Cook, Child Care Development Specialist\n\n     \n\n      17.16\n\n     \n\n      17.3\n\n     \n\n      22.4\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Finally, RAPIDS data also reveal that there are challenges for minority groups in completion rates as well. For \nexample, the FY2015 completion rate for Black or African American apprentices in all industries was only 39.3 \npercent, and in the construction industry it was only 30.6 percent (see Table 10). White apprentices, by comparison, \nhad an all-industry completion rate of 47.3 percent, and a construction-industry completion rate of 44.6 percent. \nSimilar patterns are seen among Hispanic apprentices, who had an all-industry completion rate of 31.7 percent and \na construction-industry completion rate of 34.0 percent in FY2015, compared to a 46.5 percent all-industry \ncompletion rate and a 43.2 construction-industry percent completion rate among Non-Hispanics.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Table 10\u2014Apprenticeship Completion Rates in FY2015 by Race and Ethnicity\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      FY2015 completion rates&thinsp;30\n\n     \n\n      &emsp;\n\n     \n\n      Completions(all industries)\n\n     \n\n\n\n      Completion rate(all industries)(%)\n\n     \n\n      Completions(construction)\n\n     \n\n      Completion rate(construction)(%)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      White\n\n     \n\n      17,853\n\n     \n\n      47.3\n\n     \n\n      9,168\n\n     \n\n      44.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Black or African American\n\n     \n\n      3,000\n\n     \n\n      39.3\n\n     \n\n      816\n\n     \n\n      30.6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Non-Hispanic\n\n     \n\n      15,690\n\n     \n\n      46.5\n\n     \n\n      7,951\n\n     \n\n\n\n      43.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Hispanic\n\n     \n\n      3,709\n\n     \n\n      31.7\n\n     \n\n      1,568\n\n     \n\n      34.0\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  That such disparities and patterns of uneven participation exist is not surprising given the challenges often faced \nby many minorities and ethnic groups as they look to find work in the industries and occupations where \napprenticeships are most common. These workers can be confronted by workplace cultures that are overtly or \nsubtly hostile to workers of their race or ethnic background, and they often lack access to the types of interpersonal \nrelationships and professional networks that would help them find jobs and receive the mentorship and training they \nneed to complete their apprenticeships. One study of apprentices in the highway trades in Oregon published in \n2015 documents all of these challenges.  (31)  In surveying apprentices in the highway trades, it found that 21 \npercent of men of color and 30 percent of women of color reported feeling disadvantaged on the job due to their \nrace or ethnicity. Speaking to the issues surrounding minorities' access to critically important informal networks, the \nsurvey also found that while only 13 percent of white men stated that problems with journeyworkers were a \nchallenge during their apprenticeship, 21 percent of men of color and 35 percent of women of color reported such \nproblems. Indeed, while 79 percent of white men reported receiving mentoring on the job, only 60 percent of men of \ncolor and 38 percent of women of color reported the same.\n\n \n\n  All of these challenges and disparities can make it very difficult for minority workers to break in to trades in which \nthey have not been traditionally well represented, but they can be successfully addressed by robust affirmative \naction efforts if these efforts are tailored to address the specific circumstances of the disparity.\n\n \n\n  Individuals With Disabilities in Apprenticeship\n\n \n\n  While the Department does not currently have data on the representation of persons with disabilities in \napprenticeship programs, the underemployment of individuals with disabilities in the labor force more broadly is well \ndocumented. According to data from BLS, 30.5 percent of working-age individuals with disabilities were in the labor \nforce in 2015, compared with 76.1 percent of working-age individuals with no disability.  (32)  The unemployment \nrate for working-age individuals with disabilities was 11.7 percent in 2015, compared with a 5.2 percent \nunemployment rate for working-age individuals without a disability. Furthermore, wages for individuals with \ndisabilities on average lag behind the rest of the workforce. The mean weekly earnings of employed full-time wage \nand salary workers with a disability in 2015 were $962 (with a median of $737) compared to $1,157 (median $811) \n\n\n\nfor those without a disability.  (33)  While 28.5 percent of individuals, ages 18 to 64, with a disability were in poverty \nin 2014, the data show that 12.3 percent of individuals without a disability were in poverty.  (34) \n\n \n\n  Affirmative efforts to seek out individuals with disabilities and ensure they have fair access to apprenticeship \nprograms and the \u201cticket to the middle class\u201d that apprenticeship programs provide has the potential to powerfully \nimpact these profound inequalities.\n\n \n\n  Overview of the Apprenticeship Equal Employment Opportunity Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Public \nComments\n\n \n\n  Leading up to the publication of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), OA received valuable input from a \nbroad array of interested individuals, including SAAs; the National Association of State and Territorial \nApprenticeship Directors (NASTAD); advocacy organizations; registered apprenticeship program sponsors such as \nemployers, employer associations, and labor-management organizations; journeyworkers; former apprentices; and \nregistered apprentices. This input addressed features of the existing rules that work well, those that could be \nimproved, and additional requirements that might help to effectuate the overall goal of ensuring equal opportunity \nfor all individuals who are participating in or seeking to participate in the National Registered Apprenticeship \nSystem. Recurring themes in these town halls, webinars, and listening sessions included the need for increased \noutreach efforts to attract women and minorities; focus on equal training and retention of apprentices; stricter \nenforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) obligations; recognition of the voluntary nature of \napprenticeship programs; clarification of complaint procedures; and progressive actions by Registration Agencies \nto achieve sponsor compliance with the regulations.\n\n \n\n  In developing the proposed rule, the Department also consulted with its Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship \n(ACA). Chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the ACA provides advice and recommendations to \nthe Secretary of Labor on a wide range of matters related to apprenticeship. The ACA is comprised of \napproximately 30 members drawn equally from employers, labor organizations, and the public.\n\n \n\n  OA's NPRM was published in the Federal Register on November 6, 2015.  (35)  The NPRM sought public \ncomment on a number of proposals designed to improve the regulations implementing EEO in apprenticeship. The \nNPRM was published for a 60-day public comment period. After receiving several requests to extend the public \ncomment period, OA extended the public comment period an additional 15 days to January 20, 2016.  (36) \n\n \n\n  The NPRM contained four general categories of proposed revisions to the part 30 regulations: (1) Changes \nrequired to make part 30 consistent with the Labor Standards for Registration of Apprenticeship Programs set forth \nin part 29; (2) adding additional protected bases to those already delineated in part 30, and further clarifying the \nscope of some of the existing bases; (3) changes to enhance and clarify the affirmative steps sponsors must take to \nensure equal employment opportunity, including the contents of affirmative action programs (AAPs), and how these \nobligations would be reviewed and enforced by Registration Agencies; and (4) changes to improve the overall \nreadability of part 30. Wherever possible, this Final Rule has attempted to streamline and simplify sponsors' \nobligations, while maintaining broad and effective EEO protections for apprentices and those seeking entry into \napprenticeship programs.\n\n \n\n  The first set of changes proposed to align the EEO regulations at part 30 with its companion regulations at part 29, \nand are necessary to ensure a cohesive, comprehensive regulatory framework for the National Registered \nApprenticeship System. To that end, the Department proposed to revise or add several definitions and incorporate \nthe procedures set forth in part 29 for deregistration of apprenticeship programs, derecognition of SAAs, and \n\n\n\nhearings. The use of a more uniform set of procedures streamlines management of the National Apprenticeship \nSystem. Also proposed were a few minor, conforming changes in 29 CFR part 29, the companion rule to part 30.\n\n \n\n  The second category of changes proposed to expand the protected bases upon which discrimination is unlawful \nand align the existing protected bases with current jurisprudence given the developments in EEO law since the \nregulations were last revised in 1978. Categories added to update the rule included age, disability, sexual \norientation, genetic information; the proposal also took the position that sex discrimination included \ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy and gender identity.\n\n \n\n  The third category of changes in the proposal was designed to improve the effectiveness of program sponsors' \nrequired affirmative action efforts and of Registration Agencies' efforts to enforce and support compliance with this \nrule. Among these proposed changes were the following:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Listing specific steps all sponsors must undertake to ensure equal employment opportunity, including: \nDissemination of EEO policy; outreach and recruitment obligations in an effort to increase diversity in applications \nfor apprenticeship; taking steps to keep the workplace free from harassment, intimidation, and retaliation; and \nassigning an individual at the sponsor to oversee EEO efforts (proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3);\n\n  \n\n   Specifying in clearer detail the components of a written AAP for those sponsors required to maintain one, allowing \nnew sponsors more time to establish initial AAPs, and requiring an internal, annual review of all written AAP \ncontents (with the possibility to extend the review to every two years if their review demonstrated compliance with \nall AAP elements) (proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4);\n\n  \n\n   As part of an AAP, simplifying the process by which sponsors analyze whether the apprenticeship program is \nunderutilizing women or minorities, and accordingly whether they need to set utilization goals (proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5-30.6);\n\n  \n\n   Expanding the AAP to include affirmative action obligations on the basis of disability, including a 7% utilization \ngoal for individuals with disabilities in apprenticeship programs and a self-identification mechanism allowing \nsponsors to quantitatively measure their progress against that goal (proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.7, 30.11);\n\n  \n\n   Clarifying the existing outreach and recruitment AAP obligation, which required engaging in a \u201csignificant number\u201d \nof ten possible activities, by specifying four required, common-sense activities (proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8);\n\n  \n\n   Requiring an annual review of personnel practices to ensure the program is operating free from discrimination \n(proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9);\n\n  \n\n   Providing sponsors greater flexibility in how they may select apprentices for their programs, provided that such \nselection mechanisms are free from discrimination and comport with the Uniform Guidelines for Employee \nSelection Procedures that already governed selection in the existing regulations (proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.10); and\n\n  \n\n   Clarifying procedures for apprentices to file complaints of discrimination and the types of enforcement actions \nRegistration Agencies may take in the event of violations (proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.12-30.15).\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  While progress has been made in some segments of the workforce since the promulgation of the existing part 30, \nthese enhancements and improvements were proposed to address the ongoing widespread underutilization of \nhistorically disadvantaged worker groups in apprenticeship. The Department has a compelling interest in ensuring \nthat its approval of a sponsor's apprenticeship program does not serve to support, endorse, or further promote \ndiscrimination.\n\n \n\n  The fourth category of changes was proposed to improve the overall readability of part 30 through a reorganization \nof the part 30 requirements, basic editing, providing clarifying language where needed, and adhering to plain \nlanguage guidelines. This includes replacing the word \u201cshall\u201d with \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d as appropriate to the context. The \nproposed rule added a new section setting forth the effective date for this rule and for programs currently registered \nto come into compliance with the revised regulations.\n\n \n\n  OA received 245 comments on the NPRM. Commenters represented diverse perspectives including: 107 \nindividuals; 45 advocacy and public interest groups; 27 Joint Apprenticeship Training Committees (state/local); 13 \nstate government agencies; 11 industry association/business interests; 10 national unions; 9 state and local unions; \nand 5 private employers.\n\n \n\n  The commenters raised a broad range of issues. Most commenters supported the broader intent of increasing \ndiversity and equal opportunity to bolster inclusion efforts, and many commenters strongly supported the expanded \nprotections proposed in the NPRM. Other commenters raised various concerns with the cost and burden associated \nwith the proposed rule, and questioned whether various proposals were feasible for sponsors to undertake and/or \ncomply with. Among the primary issues raised by these commenters were:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Whether the obligations under the new rule conflicted with the obligations of certain sponsors under Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to act as a fiduciary for the training plans;\n\n  \n\n   The application of certain non-discrimination, affirmative action, and recordkeeping obligations to certain group \nsponsors, whom commenters believed would not have the ability to control personnel actions made and records \nkept by participating employers (proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.3-30.12);\n\n  \n\n   The definition of sex discrimination, which many commenters believed should specifically include \ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation;\n\n  \n\n   The exemption from AAP obligations for those sponsors with fewer than 5 apprentices (proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4), \nwhich was carried over from the existing rule. These comments were split between those who wanted the \nexemption eliminated altogether versus those who wanted the exemption expanded to include sponsors with larger \napprenticeship programs;\n\n  \n\n   Questions of burden related to the frequency and extent of various elements of the AAP (proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.4-30.9);\n\n  \n\n\n\n   The burden of requiring sponsors to complete utilization analyses for race and sex (proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5-\n30.6), given that, while required under the existing rule, many sponsors do not have experience undertaking this \nanalysis and have in practice relied upon Registration Agencies to do so on their behalf. Related, a number of \ncommenters cited a lack of clarity on various facets associated with utilization goals (\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5-30.6), such as \ndefining a relevant recruitment area;\n\n  \n\n   The feasibility of the new 7% disability goal and attendant self-identification requirements (proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.7 and 30.11), with some commenters arguing for a lower goal and some a higher goal, as well as \nwhether pre-offer self-identification inquiries comport with State and Federal laws; and\n\n  \n\n   The new enforcement measure that would allow Registration Agencies to suspend sponsors (proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.15), which some commenters believed lacked due process considerations and could be used punitively \nfor political reasons by certain SAAs.\n\n \n\n \n\n  The active engagement from stakeholders to provide their ideas about and comments on the proposed rule \nresulted in a Final Rule that streamlines and simplifies the obligations of sponsors to the extent possible while \nmaintaining broad equal employment opportunity protections for apprentices.\n\n \n\n  Overview of the Final Rule\n\n \n\n  This Final Rule responds to and incorporates the public input received during the open comment period and ACA \nconsultation, as well as OA's analysis regarding barriers to entry, underutilization, and discrimination in \napprenticeship and nontraditional occupations for underrepresented groups and best practices to address these \nchallenges. The Final Rule includes the same basic structure and many of the same proposals that were \nannounced in the NPRM. However, to focus the Final Rule more closely on key issues, incorporate public \ncomment, and to reduce the burden to the extent possible while maintaining the efficacy of nondiscrimination and \naffirmative action efforts, the Final Rule also revises or eliminates some of the NPRM's proposals. A summary of \nthe significant changes from the NPRM are as follows:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Generally providing more time for sponsors\u2014both those currently registered and those who may register \nprograms in the future\u2014to comply with the new non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations;\n\n  \n\n   Adjusting the workforce analysis so that it is conducted at the occupation level, and the utilization analysis at the \nmajor occupation category level, using a common source of data easily accessible to sponsors;\n\n  \n\n   Clarifying that Registration Agencies will significantly assist sponsors in conducting utilization analyses;\n\n  \n\n   Clarifying that failure to meet utilization goals will not, in and of itself, result in the assessment of any enforcement \nactions or sanctions. In so doing, the Final Rule clarifies the goals are not quotas, which in fact are legally \nimpermissible, and that goals do not displace in any way merit selection principles; indeed, the rule specifically \nprohibits selections made on the basis of a protected category;\n\n  \n\n\n\n   Revising the proposed program suspension alternative in the enforcement action to address due process \nconcerns raised by commenters; and\n\n  \n\n   Allowing SAAs more time to submit their State EEO plan to come into compliance with these regulations.\n\n \n\n \n\n  These and other changes to the Final Rule, as well as a full response to the significant comments received and \nclarifying guidance on how the rule should be interpreted, are set forth in the Section-by-Section Analysis below.\n\n \n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n \n\n  Description of Part 30\n\n \n\n  The description of part 30 in the existing regulations reads \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity in Apprenticeship and \nTraining.\u201d The NPRM proposed to delete the words \u201cand Training\u201d to clarify that the rule applies only to \napprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act, and not to other training programs. The \nproposed change was also consistent with the recent change of the name of the Department's apprenticeship \nagency to the Office of Apprenticeship, from the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. We received no comments \non this proposed change. Accordingly, the Department adopts the proposed language describing part 30 in the \nFinal Rule.\n\n \n\n  Purpose, Applicability, and Relationship to Other Laws (\u00a7&thinsp;30.1)\n\n \n\n  The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.1 set forth the scope and purpose in one paragraph and laid out the range of activities to \nwhich the policies apply. The NPRM proposed to revise the title by replacing \u201cScope and purpose\u201d with \u201cPurpose, \napplicability, and relationship to other laws,\u201d organized the text to fall under these three categories, and provided \nclarifying details to enhance readability of the section.\n\n \n\n  The Department received only one comment, from a national JATC, suggesting that the current text be retained \nbecause it contains the same information in a more concise manner. We respectfully disagree, and believe that the \nexpanded nature of proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1 makes it helpful to the reader to divide the section's provisions among \nthree separate paragraphs: Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(a) set forth the purpose of the rule; proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(b) \naddressed to whom the rule applies; and proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(c) discussed how this regulation relates to other \nlaws that may apply to the entities covered by this regulation. We therefore adopt the structure of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1 as \nproposed.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.1(a): Purpose\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(a) added age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability to the list \nof bases set forth in the rule upon which a sponsor of a registered apprenticeship program must not discriminate. \nThe Department received numerous comments addressing these proposed changes, which were generally \nsupportive, although one commenter cautioned the Department not to discount the fact that prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation may raise implementation questions for sponsors and require \ntechnical assistance. The Department is prepared to undertake such assistance. Among the several commenters \nthat were supportive of the expanded protections, many suggested additional clarifications.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Starting with those protected bases in the existing rule, the NPRM explained that the Department interprets \ndiscrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d to include both pregnancy and gender identity discrimination, and clarified \nthis interpretation in the proposed regulatory text at \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(c), which provided the contents of sponsors' \nequal opportunity pledge, by explicitly including pregnancy and gender identity in a parenthetical following \u201csex\u201d to \nmake this clear. The Department received numerous comments advocating that pregnancy and gender identity be \nexplicitly listed as separate grounds of discrimination, rather than considered under the umbrella of sex \ndiscrimination. Per the language of relevant authorities and case law, both pregnancy and gender identity have \nbeen analyzed as forms of sex discrimination.  (37)  The final rule retains, in the E.O. pledge set forth in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(c), the proposed rule's parenthetical explaining that sex discrimination includes discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity and pregnancy. We include the parenthetical explanation in this one portion of the \nregulation because it is the language that will be incorporated into registered apprenticeship standards and \napprenticeship opportunity announcements and thus more visible to those the rule protects, but this interpretation \napplies wherever sex is discussed in the regulation. As set forth in the discussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(2) herein, the \nDepartment will look to the legal standards and defenses that apply under Title VII and Executive Order 11246, as \napplicable, in determining whether a sponsor has engaged in discrimination made unlawful by \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1), including sex discrimination.\n\n \n\n  The NPRM also proposed to include four new grounds to the list of protected bases upon which a sponsor must \nnot discriminate: Age (40 or older); genetic information; sexual orientation; and disability. The Department responds \nto the comments received on each in turn.\n\n \n\n  Age (40 or Older)\n\n \n\n  Of the few commenters who weighed in on the addition of age discrimination, including a national JATC, an \nadvocacy organization, and one individual, all supported its inclusion as a prohibited ground of discrimination. \nAmong these, a national JATC said its industry's programs have been following the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (EEOC) interpretations and/or State law and including age as a protected category, and that there are \nmany examples of older workers entering the electrical industry through apprenticeship as second careers. An \nindividual commenter relayed personal experience of being excluded from apprenticeship programs due to age, and \nthus could benefit from this added protection. Accordingly, the Final Rule adopts the addition of age as a protected \nbasis, as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Genetic Information\n\n \n\n  With regard to genetic information, those few commenters weighing in all supported its addition to the list of \nprohibited grounds of discrimination. The national JATC said joint labor-management committees already are \nprohibited from discriminating against employees or applicants because of genetic information, so this will not be a \nchange for these apprenticeship programs. Accordingly, the Final Rule adopts the addition of genetic information as \na protected basis, as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Sexual Orientation\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters, including advocacy organizations, individual commenters, a professional association, and \na State Workforce Agency (SWA), supported the rule's explicit inclusion of sexual orientation on the list of protected \nbases. Several advocacy organizations said individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual face high levels of \ndiscrimination and harassment at work based on their sexual orientation and this revision is in line with current law \nand within the Department's rulemaking authority.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Several of the above commenters plus additional advocacy organizations urged the Department to make clear that \nsexual orientation discrimination and sex stereotyping discrimination are also prohibited forms of sex \ndiscrimination. One of these commenters, an advocacy organization, stated that, while the legal landscape \ncontinues to evolve, it is now clear that a division between sexual orientation and sex discrimination is \nunsustainable and providing this additional clarification in the final regulation would provide the fullest protection for \nprogram participants. A national JATC urged some caution, noting that the interpretation announced by the EEOC \nin its 2015 Baldwin decision&thinsp; (38)  that sexual orientation discrimination is per se sex discrimination \nunder Title VII was not yet settled law.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule adopts the NPRM's proposed inclusion of sexual orientation as a stand-alone protected category. \nAs discussed in the NPRM, adding sexual orientation as a protected characteristic is consistent with both the \nstatutory authority requiring the formulation of \u201clabor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of \napprentices,\u201d&thinsp; (39)  and the Department's purpose and approach since part 30 was first established: to \npromote equality of opportunity in registered apprenticeship programs and prevent discrimination in the \nrecruitment, selection, employment, and training of apprentices by requiring, among other things, that apprentices \nand applicants for registered apprenticeship are selected according to objective and specific qualifications relating \nto job performance. We note further that the addition of sexual orientation as a protected basis aligns with \ndevelopments in legal protections over the last two decades. At the time of publication, 22 States and the District of \nColumbia, in addition to numerous additional counties and municipalities across the country, have laws explicitly \nprohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the public and private sectors.  (40)  \nAccordingly, the Final Rule retains sexual orientation as its own protected basis. We do note, as discussed more \nfully in later sections, that the Final Rule does not require sponsors to collect employee or applicant data on sexual \norientation, conduct specific outreach, or otherwise include sexual orientation in the utilization analyses required \nunder AAPs pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.4. This is consistent with the Department's Office of Federal Contract \nCompliance Programs' (OFCCP) approach to sexual orientation in its programs.\n\n \n\n  With regard to commenters' requests that the rule state that sexual orientation discrimination is also a per se \nform of sex discrimination, the Department supports this view as a matter of policy. Federal agencies have taken \nan increasing number of actions to ensure that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals are protected from \ndiscrimination,  (41)  and court decisions have increasingly made clear that individuals and couples deserve equal \nrights regardless of their sexual orientation.  (42)  The Department further notes that this area of title VII law is still \ndeveloping. In Baldwin, the EEOC\u2014the lead Federal agency responsible for administering and enforcing title VII\u2014\noffered a legal analysis and review of the title VII case law and its evolution, concluding that sexual orientation is \ninherently a \u201csex-based consideration\u201d and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is therefore \nprohibited by title VII as one form of sex discrimination.  (43)  As the EEOC noted in that case, in Oncale v. \nSundowner Offshore Services, a unanimous Supreme Court stated that \u201cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the \nprincipal evil [they were passed to combat] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions \nof our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201d&thinsp; (44)  More than \nfifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the contours of the law governing sex discrimination in \nthe workplace have changed significantly. Over the past two decades, an increasing number of Federal court \ncases, building on the Price Waterhouse rationale, have found protection under title VII for those asserting \ndiscrimination claims related to their sexual orientation.  (45)  In light of this legal framework, and for consistency \nwith the position taken by the Department's OFCCP in its recently issued Sex Discrimination regulations and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in its rule implementing Section 1557 of the ACA, the Department will \ninterpret sex discrimination under this Final Rule to cover treatment of employees or applicants adversely based \non their sexual orientation where the evidence establishes that the discrimination is based on gender stereotypes. \nThe Department will continue to monitor the developing law on sexual orientation discrimination as sex \ndiscrimination, and will consider issuing further guidance on this subject as appropriate.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Disability\n\n \n\n  Multiple commenters supported the Department's proposal to add disability to the list of protected categories \nagainst which apprenticeship programs may not discriminate. An individual commenter asserted the need for more \napprenticeship programs that are open to individuals with disabilities, as individuals with disabilities continue to \nstruggle to find and keep employment. A number of comments raised specific questions about how the proposed \ndisability non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations would be implemented. Many of these comments \nare addressed in the discussions of \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.7 and 30.11, but we respond to two of these concerns here \nbecause they implicate the purpose of the proposed rule and, to some extent, questions of applicability that are \ngermane to \u00a7&thinsp;30.1. Specifically, one commenter cited other federal regulations to which they must adhere \nthat prohibit the employment of workers who perform work that present dangers to themselves, co-workers, and the \ngeneral public. Other commenters implied generally that employment of individuals with disabilities was problematic \nin their particular industry due to physical requirements of the position.\n\n \n\n  As to the first, nothing in this Final Rule requires sponsors to employ individuals who present dangers to \nthemselves or others. The rule incorporates the \u201cdirect threat\u201d defense that is well-established in disability law \njurisprudence, which specifically allows an employer to require that an individual be able to perform the essential \nfunctions of the position held or desired without posing a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or \nothers in the workplace. As to the second, to the extent that commenters are seeking exemptions from the disability \nprotection in the Final Rule due to their particular industry, the Department declines to grant such exemptions. \nRequests to exempt sponsors from disability-related obligations in this Final Rule for safety-sensitive positions or for \nphysically demanding jobs are based on the fundamentally flawed notion that individuals with disabilities as a group \nare incapable of working in these jobs. The Department does not support this belief and will not construct an \navenue to permit sponsors to avoid recruiting and selecting individuals with disabilities for certain apprenticeships. \nWe acknowledge that some individuals with certain disabilities\u2014as well as some individuals without disabilities\u2014\nmay not be able to perform some jobs; this does not countenance broader exclusions from the obligations set forth \nin this rule.  (46)  Not all disabilities have physical limitations, and not all physical limitations will be relevant to the \njob at hand.\n\n \n\n  Proposed Additional Grounds\n\n \n\n  Several commenters suggested other possible bases for protection against discrimination in apprenticeship \nprograms, including caregiving status (e.g., parental responsibilities), military service, and criminal background. \nThese protected categories are beyond the scope of what was proposed in the NPRM, therefore we did not add \nthem to the Final Rule. However, we note that discrimination based on some of these proposed additional \ncategories may be actionable under already existing categories or under other, already applicable, laws.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.1(b): Applicability\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(b) simplifies the earlier description of the scope of the provision by stating clearly that the \nrule applies \u201cto all sponsors of apprenticeship programs registered with either the U.S. Department of Labor or a \nrecognized SAA.\u201d A number of comments raised questions regarding how the obligations of this rule would apply \ndifferently, if at all, to the different models of sponsors. Some sponsors employ the apprentices and thus their \ncontrol over the terms and conditions of employment is more clear, while \u201cgroup\u201d sponsors work with groups of \nemployers where apprentices may be hired or placed and the various types of employment actions prohibited by \nthis rule may be undertaken by these employers, rather than the sponsor.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Throughout the Section-by-Section analysis below, the Department has provided clarification with respect to \nimplementing particular requirements depending on the model of sponsorship. In general, per the text of \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.1(b), the Department recognizes the sponsor as the entity assuming the equal employment opportunity \nand affirmative action obligations of this part. To the extent that the sponsor has the ability to control, or otherwise \nhas input into, any of the various employment actions held unlawful by these regulations, its obligations under these \nregulations are clear. In those situations where discriminatory actions or other actions in violation of this part are \ntaken by participating employers, when the sponsor has knowledge of such actions it has an obligation to undertake \nsteps to address the violation. Historically, this has been accomplished by written agreements entered into between \nthe sponsor and employer setting forth \u201creasonable procedures . . . to ensure that employment opportunity is being \ngranted,\u201d&thinsp; (47)  as well as through the recordkeeping requirements obligating the sponsor to keep adequate \nemployment records of its apprentices. Were certain categories of sponsors exempted from these general \nobligations, it could render meaningless many portions of these regulations and the role of the apprenticeship \nsponsor to help ensure equal employment opportunity that has existed for several decades.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.1(c): Relationship to Other Laws\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(c) clarified that part 30 would not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures \nunder any Federal law, or the law of any State or political subdivision, that provides greater or equal protection for \nindividuals under the protected bases. One advocacy organization recommended that the Department work with the \nEEOC to ensure that part 30 is consistent with other agency directives, including the 2012 EEOC guidance on \nemployer consideration of criminal records. To that end, we note, as we did in the NPRM, that these regulations \ngenerally follow Title VII legal principles in their interpretation of the non-discrimination protections in this Final \nRule.\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization and a State agency commented on the possible linkages between this proposed rule \nand the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). We agree that the two authorities interrelate in \nimportant ways to provide broad nondiscrimination protection to apprentices. WIOA encourages the use of \nregistered apprenticeship and the public workforce system provides an opportunity to connect a broad talent pool \nwith the opportunities of apprenticeship, as well as to provide resources and supportive services to assist in \nconnecting individuals to apprenticeship and supporting them through successful completion and career attainment. \nSection 188 of WIOA also provides comprehensive nondiscrimination protections. The Department will work to \nensure that these statutory regimes work in tandem to provide broad and consistent worker protection.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(c) also recognized as a defense to a charge of violation of part 30 that a challenged \naction is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that another Federal law or regulation \nprohibits an action that would otherwise be required by part 30. A national JATC noted that the proposed regulatory \ntext states that \u201cIt may be a defense . . .,\u201d and instead recommends that the Department change the word \u201cmay\u201d to \n\u201cshall\u201d in the last sentence of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1(c). The Department respectfully declines to make this change, as \nwhether a defense will succeed is necessarily a fact-specific inquiry which amending the language to \u201cshall\u201d would \nforeclose. Further, this provision is identical to OFCCP's regulations implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 (section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (VEVRAA) \nprograms,  (48)  and the consistency among these DOL programs is desirable, especially for those entities that may \nneed to comply with both.\n\n \n\n  One specific potential conflict of laws clarification sought by multiple commenters was the interaction of certain \nobligations under this rule and obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). \nMany apprenticeship programs are employee benefit plans governed by ERISA. Among other things, ERISA \nprovides that, subject to certain exceptions, the assets of an employee benefit plan shall never inure to the benefit \nof any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying \nreasonable administrative expenses. In discharging their duties under ERISA, plan fiduciaries must act prudently \n\n\n\nand solely in the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries, and in accordance with the documents and \ninstruments governing the plan insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of ERISA.  (49)  Although \napprenticeship plans may differ in structure and operations from other ERISA plans, the plan fiduciaries must still \nabide by the general fiduciary standards in part 4 of title I of ERISA. The Department's Employee Benefits Security \nAdministration (EBSA) is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the provisions of part 4 of title I of ERISA.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters asserted that using assets of apprenticeship plans to pay for many of the tasks required in the \nproposed regulations to gain or maintain registered status under the National Apprenticeship Act would not be \nconsistent with obligations imposed on plan fiduciaries under ERISA. These commenters cited guidance EBSA \nissued in 2012 concerning the use of apprenticeship plan assets for graduation ceremonies and to engage in \noutreach activities and advertise the program to potential apprentices.  (50)  The commenters asserted that a plan \nshould have a defense against a violation of the proposed regulations if the apprenticeship plan's governing board \nor committee determines that it would violate ERISA to expend plan assets to take compliance actions required to \ngain or maintain registered status.\n\n \n\n  EBSA has taken the position that there is a class of activities referred to as \u201csettlor\u201d functions that relate to the \nformation, design, and termination of plan, rather than the management of the plan, that generally are not activities \nsubject to title I of ERISA. EBSA has concluded that although expenses attendant to settlor activities do not \nconstitute reasonable plan expenses, expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of settlor decisions \nmay constitute reasonable expenses of the plan.  (51)  A plan sponsor's decision to register an apprenticeship plan \nunder the National Apprenticeship Act is such a settlor decision of plan design. In the Department's view, \nestablished ERISA guidance on settlor activities supports the conclusion that reasonable expenses incurred in \nimplementing a decision to be a registered apprenticeship plan would generally be payable by the plan to the extent \npermitted under the terms of the plan's governing documents.\n\n \n\n  The commenters also expressed concern about the application of ERISA's fiduciary standards because registered \nstatus may result in benefits for the apprentice plan's sponsors in addition to the benefits provided to the plan's \nparticipants. In Advisory Opinion 2001-01, dealing with the benefits an employer may secure from sponsoring a tax \nqualified pension plan, EBSA expressed the view that in the case of such a plan design decision that confers \nbenefits on both the plan sponsor and the plan, a plan fiduciary is not required to take into account the benefits \nconferred on an employer in determining whether expenses for implementing the plan design decision constitute \nreasonable expenses of the plan.\n\n \n\n  A commenter asserted that ERISA may require plan fiduciaries to withdraw from the Department's registration \nprogram if the increased cost to the plan of compliance with the proposed regulations would be greater than the \neconomic benefits to the plan from registered status. The commenter cited guidance issued by EBSA concerning \ninvestments selected because of the collateral economic or social benefits they may further in addition to their \ninvestment returns to the plan.  (52)  Registered status is clearly connected to the purpose of an apprenticeship \nplan and provides a range of direct benefits to the plan and the apprentices participating in the plan. Accordingly, \nEBSA does not believe its guidance in Interpretive Bulletin 2015-02 applies to the decision of whether to maintain a \nplan as a registered apprenticeship plan.\n\n \n\n  ERISA requires that plan fiduciaries act prudently and solely in the interest of the plan's participants in choosing \nhow to comply with the federal regulatory requirements for registered status. Where an apprenticeship program is \nintended to be registered with the Department, the fiduciaries may treat the reasonable costs of compliance with \nregistration regulations as appropriate means of carrying out the plan's mission of training workers.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Some commenters requested clarification of ERISA's impact on the proposal's requirement that a registered \napprenticeship plan establish linkage agreements enlisting the assistance and support of pre-apprenticeship \nprograms, community-based organizations, and advocacy organizations in recruiting qualified individuals for \napprenticeship, and in developing pre-apprenticeship programs. These commenters noted that participants in pre-\napprenticeship programs are not participants in the apprenticeship plan and pointed out that ERISA plan fiduciaries \nmust discharge their duties for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the plan participants and defraying \nreasonable plan administrative expenses. In the Department's view, where plan fiduciaries prudently determine that \nsupporting quality pre-apprenticeship programs and other workforce pipeline resources are necessary to maintain \nthe plan's registration, or are otherwise appropriate and helpful to carrying out the purposes for which the plan is \nestablished or maintained, assets of the plan may be used to defray the reasonable expenses of such support. \nSuch advantages could include, among other things, more efficient outreach and recruitment, and broadening the \nbase of qualified and diverse applicants. For more information on what qualifies as a quality pre-apprenticeship \nprogram, see OA's Training and Employment Notice 13-12 (TEN 13-12), dated November 30, 2012.\n\n \n\n  Finally, one commenter said it is unclear why these defenses are limited to actions required by another Federal \nlaw or regulation, and recommended that these defenses be expanded to include actions required or prohibited by \nany applicable State law or regulation. This commenter did not specifically identify a provision of State law that \nwould be in conflict with these regulations, and we would decline to introduce any such broad defense contrary to \ngeneral principles of preemption.\n\n \n\n  Definitions (\u00a7&thinsp;30.2)\n\n \n\n  With regard to definitions included in the NPRM, we did not receive comments on the definitions for \n\u201cadministrator,\u201d \u201capprentice,\u201d \u201capprenticeship program,\u201d \u201cDepartment,\u201d \u201cEEO,\u201d \u201celectronic media,\u201d \u201cemployer,\u201d \n\u201cgenetic information,\u201d \u201cjourneyworker,\u201d \u201cmajor life activities,\u201d \u201cOffice of Apprenticeship,\u201d \u201cphysical or mental \nimpairments,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d \u201creasonable accommodation,\u201d and \u201cRegistration Agency.\u201d We made no changes to the \nproposed definitions for these terms. The others for which comments were received are discussed below.\n\n \n\n  \u201cApprenticeship Committee\u201d\n\n \n\n  This proposed definition comes from part 29, where this term is also used. An SWA suggested that the definition \nof \u201capprenticeship committee\u201d should be revised to encompass group sponsor structures as well as individual \nsponsor structures, and commented that the language throughout the rule is geared towards an individual sponsor \nstructure and not inclusive of group sponsor structures. The Department notes that this definition is identical to the \ndefinition contained in part 29. As worded, it is intended to apply to group sponsors as well as individual sponsors. \nAccordingly, the Final Rule retains the definition as proposed.\n\n \n\n  \u201cDirect Threat\u201d\n\n \n\n  This term was added because the proposed rule included disability among the list of protected bases covered by \npart 30, and the \u201cdirect threat\u201d defense is well-established under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as \namended, and other disability laws. A national JATC expressed concern that the proposed definition would require \napprenticeship programs to hire medical professionals to provide \u201creasonable medical judgement\u201d because this \nproposed definition states that the process for determining whether an individual poses a direct threat is based on \n\u201creasonable medical judgment.\u201d The commenter warned that this would pose a significant financial burden for \nsponsors, and said that the definition should either be changed or removed. As discussed above, the proposed \ndefinition for this term is taken directly from title I of the ADA, as amended, and from the EEOC implementing \nregulations. The Department intends that this proposed term will have the same meaning as that set forth in the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) and implemented by the EEOC in 29 CFR part \n\n\n\n1630. Sponsors and participating employers subject to the ADA, as amended, therefore are already required to \ncomply with this provision under that authority. Any departure would create an unwanted discrepancy between \nfederal disability laws. Further, we note that hiring medical professionals to provide \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d \nis not required by this rule (nor the ADA, as amended). EEOC guidance provides that determining whether a \u201cdirect \nthreat\u201d exists is an individual assessment \u201cconsidering the most current medical knowledge and/or the best \navailable objective evidence.\u201d&thinsp; (53)  (Emphasis added.) The Department interprets this rule consistently with \nthat guidance. Even if medical knowledge were used, it often can be obtained from the individual's own physician, \nrather than an in-house physician hired for such purposes. Accordingly, the Final Rule retains the definition as \nproposed in the NPRM.\n\n \n\n  \u201cDisability\u201d\n\n \n\n  This term was added because the proposed rule included disability among the list of protected bases covered by \npart 30. One commenter explicitly supported this definition as consistent with other Federal laws, most notably the \nADA and ADAAA. One commenter requested clarification of the term \u201cdisabled individual,\u201d and suggested that the \ndefinition and goals should differentiate between individuals with learning disabilities and other types of disabilities. \nAnother commenter, in asking for clarification about the definition of disability, expressed concern that the \nconstruction industry is physically demanding on both body and mind, and that its program asks applicants if they \ncan perform the work required in the industry and if they are physically able regardless of any disabilities. Disability \nlaw does not distinguish between \u201ctypes\u201d of disabilities, but rather whether an individual has, or is regarded as \nhaving, an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or has a record of such impairment. \nWe therefore decline to separate out particular \u201ctypes\u201d of disabilities for different treatment. With regard to \nselections in particular industries, again, disability law does not differentiate. It is a well-established tenet of \ndisability law that an individual must be qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, in order to be protected. The proposed definition (as well as the selection provisions in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.10 herein) reflects that, and we adopt it as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the phrase \u201ca record of such an impairment\u201d in the proposed definition of disability, one commenter \nasked for clarification as to what type of record would be acceptable verification of an individual having a \ndocumented disability. Again, this language was intended to mirror identical language in the ADA, etc., and should \nbe interpreted in the same manner as it is in the ADA. Generally, the phrase \u201crecord of\u201d does not require a written \nrecord, but rather prohibits discrimination against someone because they are known to have had a disability, for \ninstance, a person who has recovered from cancer or mental illness.\n\n \n\n  As discussed above, the proposed definition for this term is taken directly from title I of the ADA, as amended, and \nfrom the EEOC implementing regulations. The Department intends that this proposed term will have the same \nmeaning as what was set forth in the ADAAA and implemented by the EEOC in 29 CFR part 1630.\n\n \n\n  \u201cEmployer\u201d\n\n \n\n  The NPRM proposed slight modifications to the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in part 30 to conform to the definition of the \nterm in part 29, where this term is also used. We did not intend this alteration to change how the term is interpreted.\n\n \n\n  Two national unions expressed concern that, by adopting the definitions of \u201csponsor\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d in 29 CFR \npart 29, the proposed rule would allow for a sponsor to conduct its workforce analyses of the relevant incumbent \nworkforce (required in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)) without accounting for \u201call occupational titles in its registered \napprenticeship program,\u201d should that sponsor include subcontractors or other entities owned or controlled by the \n\n\n\nsponsor in its apprenticeship program. In this way, they assert that a sponsor could otherwise delegate to an \nemployer its obligations under the rule, thus avoiding enforcement and broad equal employment opportunity for \napprentices. It proposed that the Department amend both the definition of \u201csponsor\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d to include \nsubcontractors and other entities owned and controlled by the sponsor or employer. This latter concern was \naddressed in the discussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1, which clarified that the rule's obligations apply broadly to all \nsponsors, and will require partnership and information-sharing with employers to effectuate their non-\ndiscrimination and affirmative action obligations. The obligations under \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) will be discussed in that \npart of the Section-by-Section analysis. As the revised definition was offered solely to conform with the existing \ndefinition of \u201cemployer\u201d in part 29, we retain it in the Final Rule as proposed.\n\n \n\n  \u201cEthnicity\u201d\n\n \n\n  An SWA said that the term \u201cLatino\u201d should be used instead of \u201cHispanic\u201d because the term \u201cLatino\u201d is broader and \nincludes \u201cHispanic\u201d groups, but the term \u201cHispanic\u201d does not include all \u201cLatino\u201d groups. Additionally, the commenter \nsaid that \u201cLatino\u201d status should not be limited to \u201cSpanish culture or origin\u201d because some groups do not claim a \nEuropean cultural or ancestral background, and not all groups speak Spanish as a first language (e.g., Brazilians). \nIn response to this comment, the Department notes that the proposed definition is the same as that used under the \nOffice of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity,  (54)  as \nwell as the definition in the EEOC's EEO-1 reporting requirements. For consistency with other Federal data \ncollection requirements, we retain the definition as proposed.\n\n \n\n  \u201cPre-Apprenticeship Program\u201d\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule included a definition of \u201cpre-apprenticeship program\u201d because the existing rule refers to such \nprograms, but does not define this term. The proposed definition, drawn from a Training and Employment Notice \nregarding pre-apprenticeship,  (55)  was intended to provide clarity on what constituted and/or qualified as a pre-\napprenticeship program. It is worth noting that this Final Rule does not specifically require sponsors to develop their \nown pre-apprenticeship programs, but rather includes requirements that sponsors partner with appropriate entities, \nsuch as pre-apprenticeship programs, as part of an outreach and recruitment strategy to address underutilization \nand impediments to equal employment opportunity. The Department received numerous comments addressing this \nproposed definition, which were generally supportive, but which suggested improvements.\n\n \n\n  One commenter expressed concern that the proposed definition of \u201cpre-apprenticeship program\u201d does not capture \nthe full scope and reach of high-quality pre-apprenticeship programs, and suggested that the definition of a pre-\napprenticeship program should not be limited to programs that assist individuals in meeting the minimum \nqualifications for selection into an apprenticeship program, but should be expanded to include programs that \nprovide training and education to individuals who meet the minimum requirements for selection into an \napprenticeship program but seek additional training in order to remain competitive with other applicants. While this \ncommenter identifies laudable objectives that many programs may accomplish, the Department's primary focus for \npre-apprenticeship programs is to enable participants to obtain minimum requirements for selection into \napprenticeship programs to grow opportunities for those individuals. Nothing in the rule prevents sponsors and \nother entities from designing or linking with additional pre-apprenticeship programs that serve the ends noted by the \ncommenter. The Department is, however, revising the definition to align with TEN 13-12, which addresses pre-\napprenticeship programs. Among other things, TEN 13-12 provides that pre-apprenticeship programs maintain a \ndocumented partnership with at least one Registered Apprenticeship program, to help ensure that the pre-\napprenticeship programs have the relationships in place to support the future success of its participants.\n\n \n\n  Two national unions commented that the Department should also clarify whether Job Corps programs satisfy the \ndefinition of pre-apprenticeship. As indicated in the NPRM, many Job Corps programs have been used and can \nserve as pre-apprenticeship programs. While not all Job Corps programs are pre-apprenticeship programs, those \n\n\n\nJob Corps programs consistent with the requirements of TEN 13-12\u2014specifically, those focusing on preparing \nindividuals for entrance into and success in a registered apprenticeship program, and which maintain a partnership \nwith a Registered Apprenticeship program\u2014would qualify as a pre-apprenticeship program.\n\n \n\n  A national JATC asked for clarification about the intent of the requirement of collaboration in the definition of \u201cpre-\napprenticeship program.\u201d The JATC commented that if the intent is for a minimum of two different types of entities \nto collaborate on a program, then two employers or a single-employer group or a local union could not operate a \npre-apprenticeship program on its own. The JATC suggested that the Department should expressly recognize that \na joint-labor management committee is an example of employer and union collaboration, and thus could operate a \npre-apprenticeship program. The Department notes that the intent is to link the pre-apprenticeship program with an \napprenticeship program. This definition is not intended to require a minimum of two entities given the different ways \nin which such a link could occur.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters suggested broadly that the proposed definition of \u201cpre-apprenticeship program\u201d should be in \nalignment with the definition as written in the Department's TEN 13-12. Commenters encouraged the Department to \nadopt a definition of \u201cpre-apprenticeship program\u201d that includes elements that are essential for successful linkage of \na pre-apprenticeship program to an apprenticeship program, and/or are otherwise described in TEN 13-12. The \ndefinition for \u201cpre-apprenticeship\u201d in the proposed rule was specifically drafted to be consistent with the TEN 13-12, \nincluding with its description of the elements described therein, and the Department does not view any change to \nthe definition to be necessary. Sponsors should follow TEN 13-12 and other relevant guidance in their interpretation \nof the definition provided in the rule.\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters recommended that the Department's definition in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.2 should \notherwise be more expansive in specifically addressing: Barriers unique to women, people of color, and individuals \nwith disabilities; standards for EEO/affirmative action in technical instruction and selection procedures; and the \nlength of tenure or manner of payment expected in pre-apprenticeship programs. Again, while one aim of pre-\napprenticeship programs is to reach groups that are traditionally underrepresented in apprenticeships, and the Final \nRule includes multiple ways in which that may happen (such as in the discussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.8), we believe that \nsort of elaboration is best accomplished in those sections and in guidance such as TEN 13-12, rather than in the \ndefinitions section of the regulation.\n\n \n\n  The last sentence of the proposed definition included the optional provision of supportive services, such as \ntransportation, child care, and income support, to assist participants in the successful completion of the pre-\napprenticeship program. Several comments underscored the need for resources, including from the Federal \ngovernment, in order to provide support services. We recognize the resources required to provide such supportive \nservices, which is a primary reason why the provision of such services was not mandated in the definition. The \nDepartment has generally expanded the role of apprenticeship and provided opportunities for supportive resources \nunder its WIOA program. Additionally, many other Federal agencies offer some level of support for Registered \nApprenticeships.  (56)  However, because these services are not a mandated part of pre-apprenticeship programs, \nand because they are not limited to pre-apprenticeship programs but could apply to apprenticeship programs \ngenerally, the Final Rule deletes the sentence on supportive services to avoid confusion.\n\n \n\n  A national JATC recommended that the Department provide guidance that would reduce certain legal risks in \noperating pre-apprenticeship programs to increase diversity and mitigate claims of reverse discrimination. The \nJATC suggested that the Department could significantly advance its efforts by providing final regulations that: (1) \nPermit apprenticeship programs to include in their standards, subject to Department approval, direct interview or \ndirect entry from pre-apprenticeship programs specifically designed for one or more underrepresented groups and \nnot others; (2) ensure that such options, once adopted, would not violate part 30 rights for any other group; and (3) \nprovide that it is the Department's interpretation that such approved methods do not violate title VII or other Federal \ncivil rights laws and have the same level of protection against claims as if required under Federal law.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Providing guidance on the legality of direct entry programs necessarily requires fact-specific questions as to how, \nand in what context, that system is administered. Accordingly, we cannot provide broad guidance on the second \nand third points above. As to the first, generally speaking, an apprenticeship program may include in its standards, \nwith Departmental approval, a direct entry program targeted toward a specific underrepresented group that is \ndesigned to address underutilization. Indeed, such measures are specifically countenanced by \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, \nreferenced below. Beyond that, any such guidance necessarily must proceed on a case-by-case basis. For \ninstance, if a single-employer sponsor draws its apprenticeship pool entirely from a direct entry program that is \nspecifically designed to target one racial minority group, resulting in an apprenticeship pool that consists entirely of \nmembers from that group, such a process could result in underutilization of another minority group. Such a \nprogram, used in concert with other selection mechanisms resulting in a less homogenous apprenticeship pool, \nmay not. The Department is available to provide guidance, in consultation with its Office of the Solicitor, to sponsors \nwith questions about specific scenarios involving direct entry.\n\n \n\n  Finally, one comment raised the question of further guidance and suggested updating TEN 13-12. One commenter \nsuggested that the Department issue an update to TEN 13-12 that incorporates references to WIOA instead of the \nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), and others suggested that the guidance be updated to link quality pre-\napprenticeship programs with industry or sector partnerships as well as apprenticeship-related provisions in WIOA's \nimplementing regulations. The Department updates its guidance periodically with a particular view towards ensuring \nthat references to other complementary legislative schemes are correct, and will do so in this circumstance as well.\n\n \n\n  In conclusion, the definition is retained in the Final Rule as proposed.\n\n \n\n  \u201cQualified Applicant or Apprentice\u201d\n\n \n\n  The NPRM proposed to add this definition because of the addition of disability to the list of protected bases \ncovered by part 30. The only comments received related to this proposed definition posed questions about how \n\u201cqualified applicants\u201d related to the requirement in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c)(2) that utilization analyses take into \naccount the availability of those who have the \u201cpresent or potential capacity for apprenticeship.\u201d Neither of these \ncommenters raised issues with the wording of this definition, which is taken directly from title I of the ADA, as \namended and from the EEOC implementing regulations. The concerns raised by these commenters are addressed \nin the analysis of the comments received relating to \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c). The definition is incorporated into the Final \nRule as proposed.\n\n \n\n  \u201cSelection Procedure\u201d\n\n \n\n  The NPRM proposed a definition of \u201cselection procedure\u201d that was consistent with the definition found in the \nUniform Guidelines of Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) at 41 CFR part 60-3,  (57)  because program \nsponsors are already required to comply with those regulations under the current part 30 and should be familiar with \nthat definition. Commenters sought a few minor changes to the definition, but the Department declines to accept \nthese changes in order to maintain consistency with the term as used in UGESP, which has applied to sponsors \nunder these regulations for decades. Subsequent sections of this analysis, particularly the discussion of \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.10, address some of the finer questions commenters raised about selection procedures. If further \nquestions persist after publication of the rule, the Department will certainly consider further guidance on acceptable \nselection procedures.\n\n \n\n  \u201cUndue Hardship\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n  This proposed definition was added because of the proposed addition of disability to the list of protected bases \ncovered by part 30. The concept of \u201cundue hardship\u201d is a well-established one under the ADA, which provides that \nemployers need not provide certain accommodations if they will cause an undue hardship to the employer. A \nnational JATC suggested that the requirements for documentation of undue hardship should be reduced because \nthey add the possibility of a significant administrative burden on a registered apprenticeship program. As discussed \nabove, the proposed definition for this term is taken directly from title I of the ADA, as amended, and from the \nEEOC implementing regulations. The Department intends that this proposed term will have the same meaning as \nwhat was set forth in the ADAAA and implemented by the EEOC in 29 CFR part 1630. For the sake of consistency, \nthe Department has determined that the requirements should remain the same.\n\n \n\n  An SWA requested clarification on the specific formula and threshold a sponsor would need to reach to meet the \neligibility requirements for undue hardship. The EEOC has published guidance discussing in detail the various \nfactors that should be considered in making an \u201cundue hardship\u201d determination,  (58)  but these factors focus \nbroadly on the cost of the accommodation weighed against the financial resources of the employer, and thus are \nnecessarily fact-specific. If sponsors have questions about undue hardship in particular circumstances, the \nDepartment can provide technical assistance.\n\n \n\n  Beyond these definitions proposed in the regulations, several commenters proposed additional definitions that \nshould be included in the regulations. These are discussed in turn below.\n\n \n\n  \u201cIndustry\u201d and \u201cRelevant Labor Pools\u201d\n\n \n\n  A JATC expressed concern that the proposed rule did not provide a definition of the term \u201cindustry,\u201d and urged the \nDepartment to define the term (as used in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)) more narrowly to avoid comparisons of \noccupations that require different levels of skill, education, and technical expertise. The commenter also asked the \nDepartment to define the term \u201crelevant labor pools\u201d (in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(2)) to clarify the relationship \nbetween the relevant recruitment area and the relevant labor pools. These terms are further discussed in the \nrelevant sections specified above, and so we decline to define the term here. We note that the use of \u201cindustry\u201d as \nthe grouping for analyses under the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 was not carried over into the Final Rule, and thus there \nis no need to define it.\n\n \n\n  \u201cSelf-Identification as an Individual With a Disability\u201d\n\n \n\n  Another national JATC recommended that the Department add language to \u00a7&thinsp;30.2 that defines the phrase \n\u201cself-identification as an individual with a disability,\u201d which is used in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11. The Department \ndeclines to define this compound phrase, the meaning of which can be understood in the context of proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.11.\n\n \n\n  \u201cSex\u201d\n\n \n\n  Many advocacy groups, a professional association, and a national union, urged the Department to include a \ndefinition of \u201csex\u201d in \u00a7&thinsp;30.2 clarifying that discrimination on the basis of childbirth and medical conditions \nrelated to pregnancy or childbirth are prohibited forms of sex discrimination. This Department declines to address \nthis concern by adding a definition, but notes that the issue is addressed in the discussion of \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.1 and \n30.3(c) herein.\n\n \n\n  Equal Opportunity Standards Applicable to All Sponsors (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3)\n\n\n\n \n\n  The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 was divided into six paragraphs and set forth the equal opportunity standards for \nregistered apprenticeship programs: a sponsor's obligation not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \nnational origin, and sex and to engage in affirmative action (existing paragraph (a)); and a sponsor's obligation to \nincorporate an equal opportunity pledge into its apprenticeship program standards (existing paragraph (b)). The \nremaining four paragraphs of existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 set the effective date of the part 30 regulations for programs \npresently registered (existing paragraph (c)), the registration requirements for sponsors seeking registration of \nnew programs (existing paragraph (d)); and the bases for exemption from the requirement to develop an AAP \n(existing paragraphs (e) and (f)).\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 reorganized this section by focusing upon the equal opportunity standards in paragraphs \n(a) and (b) and removed paragraphs (c) through (f), the substance of which was incorporated into other parts of the \nrule for the sake of clarity. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a) and (b) built upon the equal employment opportunity \nstandards that are contained in current \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a).\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(a)(1): Discrimination Prohibited\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1) set forth the general prohibition against discrimination on the bases of race, color, \nreligion, national origin, and sex\u2014those listed in the current part 30\u2014and added prohibitions against \ndiscrimination on the bases of age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability. Proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1) still specified the same general range of aspects of apprenticeship programs that are covered, \nbut reorganized the text, and reworded it to follow the framework used in other equal opportunity laws. This \nproposed paragraph received several comments.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters urged the Department to clarify throughout the text of part 30 that the regulations prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy and gender identity as separate categories. As discussed in the analysis \nof \u00a7&thinsp;30.1, the proposed rule modified the EEO pledge that a sponsor must include in its Standards of \nApprenticeship, codified at \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(c) herein, to contain a parenthetical after the listing of \u201csex\u201d as a protected \nbasis explicitly including discrimination on the basis of gender identity and pregnancy as forms of sex \ndiscrimination. This language is retained in the final rule.\n\n \n\n  Proposed paragraph (a)(1) also listed all the various employment actions that, if undertaken on the basis of a \nprotected category, would be unlawful. One broader comment raised by an SWA, addressed in part in the \ndiscussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1 above, was that some of the employment actions listed in paragraph (a)(1) were those \nundertaken by the employer, not the sponsor, in certain group sponsor structures. For instance, the commenter \nstated that group sponsors do not \u201chire\u201d apprentices; rather, they place them with an employer. The commenter \nrecommended that this provision include language for all sponsor types. We decline to change the regulatory text \naccordingly, as we believe it can apply broadly with the following guidance. In the apprenticeship model where the \nsponsor and the employer are the same entity or otherwise under the control of a common management structure, \nthe prohibited employment actions listed herein are ones that can apply specifically to the sponsor. In the model \nwhere the sponsor and employer are different entities, such as the group sponsor structure identified by the \ncommenter, we appreciate that the sponsor may not have direct control over certain of the employment decisions \nlisted. For instance, a participating employer may discipline an apprentice or make a job assignment independent of \nthe participating sponsor. However, as discussed in the analysis of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1, sponsors and employers in such \napprenticeship models have historically entered into written agreements setting forth \u201creasonable procedures . . . to \nensure that employment opportunity is being granted.\u201d&thinsp; (59)  To the extent that a participating employer \nenters into such an agreement and engages in discrimination unlawful under this part, or even absent such an \n\n\n\nagreement the sponsor otherwise learns of such discrimination (either through complaints or its recordkeeping \nobligations under part 30), the Department would expect that the sponsor take action to address the discrimination \nand, if unremedied, take steps to terminate its relationship with the discriminating employer. While this certainly \nrequires a degree of oversight on the part of the sponsor, it is consistent with past practice in group sponsorships \nand is necessary so as to prevent expansive loopholes that could allow EEO elements of apprenticeship programs \nto go entirely unregulated, frustrating the purpose of this part.\n\n \n\n  Other comments were raised as to the specific employment actions delineated in paragraph (a)(1). One \ncommenter noted that the term \u201cplacement\u201d is more germane to a sponsor than the term \u201chiring\u201d may be. \nAccordingly, we have revised the Final Rule to include \u201cplacement\u201d in addition to \u201chiring,\u201d to the extent that either is \nmore applicable to a given sponsor. The same commenter also asked the Department to clarify the definition of \n\u201caward of tenure\u201d as used in this section. Upon review, this term does not appear to correspond to aspects of \napprenticeship programs. Accordingly, this term is not included in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters expressed the need for sponsors to ensure an equitable schedule of rotation, assignments, \ntraining, and mentoring to assure that all apprentices achieve core skill competencies. The Department notes that \n\u201crotation among work processes,\u201d \u201chours of training,\u201d and \u201cjob assignments\u201d are already included in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1)(iii), (vii) and (viii), while a lack of \u201cmentoring\u201d on the basis of a protected category could fall \nunder the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1)(x), which covers \u201cany other benefit, term, condition, or privilege associated \nwith apprenticeship,\u201d depending on the specific facts. Similarly, other advocacy organizations recommended that \nthe Department add \u201cwork assignments and training opportunities\u201d to the list of activities for which a sponsor cannot \ndiscriminate to ensure that these opportunities are afforded to all apprentices equally. The Department agrees that \nboth of these terms describe possible adverse employment actions, but believes that the proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1)(x) covers these terms. Finally, one commenter suggested adding a paragraph (a)(1)(xi) that \nwould include supervision by a trained and skilled journeyworker, where \u201ctrained\u201d means familiar with EEO \nconcepts and with a passing knowledge of adult learning theory. This suggestion is out of place in this section, \nwhich lists types of adverse employment actions that could be unlawful if made on the basis of a protected \ncategory.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(a)(2): Discrimination Standards and Defenses\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(2) laid out the discrimination standards and defenses in a framework similar to that \nused in other equal opportunity laws. Proposed subparagraph (a)(2)(i) discussed standards and defenses for race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, sex, or sexual orientation; subparagraph (a)(2)(ii) discussed disability; subparagraph \n(a)(2)(iii) discussed age; and subparagraph (a)(2)(iv) discussed genetic information (numbered incorrectly in the \nNPRM as (a)(2)(iii)).\n\n \n\n  Numerous advocacy organizations urged the Department to clarify in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(2) that, with respect to \npregnancy, the Registration Agency will apply the same legal standards and defenses as those applied under the \nPregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and the ADAAA, as well as EEOC implementing regulations and \nenforcement guidance when employers make or are obligated to make accommodations for a substantial \npercentage of others similar in their ability to work. This was the intent of the proposal and is the intent of the Final \nRule, and the regulatory language should be interpreted consistent with this intent. Further, these commenters \nrequested that the Department address the need to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnancy and related \nconditions, not only to the extent required to avoid discrimination on the basis of pregnancy under the Supreme \nCourt's recent decision in Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,  (60)  but also as an affirmative measure aimed at \nbreaking down barriers to women's acceptance and advancement in apprenticeship programs. The NPRM explicitly \ndescribed its intent to follow all relevant PDA and ADA/ADAAA case law, including Young, in interpreting \nnondiscrimination obligations. With respect to the request to require any additional affirmative action to address and \n\n\n\nprovide reasonable accommodations on the basis of pregnancy, we decline to specifically include such a \nrequirement as beyond the scope of what was proposed, but encourage sponsors to take steps to break down the \nbarriers raised by this comment.  (61) \n\n \n\n  An SWA requested clarification regarding the term \u201capply the same standards and defense\u201d and asked how it \nwould apply those standards to an individual sponsor. This subparagraph is intended to help stakeholders identify \nthe corresponding source of legal standard for each prohibited ground of discrimination. The information included \nafter each explanation is intended to be helpful as an initial reference but was not intended to be an exhaustive \nexplanation. The Department is available to provide technical assistance, in conjunction with its Office of the \nSolicitor, to answer questions that arise as to what standards or defenses might apply to specific situations.\n\n \n\n  A commenter expressed concern that the proposed language \u201cdetermining whether a sponsor has engaged in an \nunlawful employment practice\u201d is not inclusive of a group sponsor structure because group sponsors are not \nemployers and do not employ apprentices. As set forth in the analysis of \u00a7&thinsp;30.1 and earlier in this section, \nwe believe the non-discrimination provisions can apply to the range of sponsor models, allowing that in a group \nsponsorship model, certain specific employment actions may be undertaken by the employer, not the sponsor, and \nthus actionable against the employer under various other civil rights laws. However, the group sponsor, upon \nknowledge of such violation, retains an obligation to address the violating activity with the employer and, if \ncontinuing or otherwise unremedied, take steps to remove the employer from participating in the apprenticeship \nprogram it sponsors. For greater clarity beyond the language \u201cunlawful employment practice,\u201d however, the Final \nRule revises the text at the end of this section to read \u201cunlawful practice under \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1),\u201d the section \nwhich enumerates the types of actions that, if taken due to a protected basis, would constitute unlawful \ndiscrimination.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule contains one additional clarifying edit to \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(2)(i), including Executive Order 11246 as \na source for the standards and defenses that will apply to the protected bases listed under that paragraph. This \naddition was made because Executive Order 11246, like this Final Rule but unlike title VII, contains explicit \nprotections from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and thus the Department will \nlook to interpretations of the Executive Order when evaluating claims under those bases.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b): General Duty To Engage in Affirmative Action\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b) strengthened and further detailed the affirmative action obligation contained in the \nexisting \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(3), requiring that all sponsors, regardless of size, take a discrete series of affirmative \nsteps to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Before turning to each of the specific requirements proposed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b), we address some general \ncomments on this paragraph. An SWA expressed concern that the NPRM confounded the roles of sponsor and \nemployer, asserting that some of the proposed requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b) do not make sense when \nconsidered from the perspective of a sponsor that does not have a relevant workforce but merely coordinates \nmultiple employers in a group program (e.g., proposed requirements relating to training and dissemination of EEO \npolicy). This commenter suggested that the rule should clarify that the sponsor, where different from the employer, \nmust share the relevant affirmative action responsibilities and requested concrete guidance on how the sponsor \nshould ensure employer compliance. The Department recognizes that there is a difference between the roles of \nsponsor and employer; it also recognizes that under the existing rules, many of these obligations are among the \nlisted outreach and recruitment efforts of which sponsors must undertake \u201ca significant number.\u201d&thinsp; (62)  To be \nsure, complying with many of these obligations would be facilitated by involvement of participating employers to \n\n\n\ndevelop procedures to ensure equal opportunity is being granted; this is precisely the arrangement that has \nhistorically been created by sponsor-employer apprenticeship agreements that we expect to continue.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b)(1): Assignment of Responsibility\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(1) requires sponsors to designate an individual to be responsible and accountable for \noverseeing the sponsor's commitment to equal opportunity in apprenticeship. A national JATC recommended that \nthe Department clarify that it is the sponsor, whether employer or JATC, that bears responsibility for all aspects of \nmeeting the requirements of this standard, rather than one individual. Several commenters expressed that \nidentification of an individual to fulfill this role would be burdensome.\n\n \n\n  In reviewing the comments, the Department wishes to clarify that it is the sponsor that bears the responsibility for \nmeeting the requirements of this standard. The proposed requirement is intended to facilitate the administration and \naccountability of the program. As stated in the NPRM, the Department anticipates that this requirement would be \nfulfilled by the individuals who are already providing oversight for the program, such as a named apprenticeship \ncoordinator. This proposal would not create new duties for the sponsor that the sponsor would not already have; \nrather, it would require the sponsor to identify a point person for overseeing its commitments to equal employment \nopportunity, whether that person actually performs all the necessary tasks or instead coordinates or monitors the \nperformance of those tasks. While proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(1) requires each sponsor to identify \u201can individual,\u201d in \nlight of the comments indicating that some sponsors might find placing this responsibility on a single person \nburdensome, the language has been amended to require each sponsor to identify \u201can individual or individuals\u201d to \nprovide greater flexibility.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b)(2): Internal Dissemination of Equal Opportunity Policy\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) required the sponsor to develop internal procedures to communicate its equal \nopportunity and affirmative action obligations to apprentices, applicants for apprenticeship, and personnel involved \nin the recruitment, screening, selection, promotion, training, and disciplinary actions of apprentices. This proposed \nrequirement is similar to that in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c)(4) of the existing part 30, which addresses internal communication \nof the sponsor's equal opportunity policy. However, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) would be required of all sponsors, \nregardless of size, and would make this communication mandatory.\n\n \n\n  An individual commenter suggested that the Department strengthen the language in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) that \u201cthe \nsponsor must require that individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program \ntake the necessary action to aid the sponsor in meeting its nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations\u201d by \nspecifying that this includes interceding when observing suspected acts of harassment or discrimination on the job \nor at school. We respectfully decline to include this specific language in the regulation. It is a well-established \nprinciple of discrimination law that, if the employer learns of harassing conduct and fails to take reasonable care to \nprevent and promptly correct the harassment, the employer can be held liable.  (63)  This principle applies to \nsponsors in the apprenticeship context as well. Beyond this, we believe the anti-harassment measures and right to \nfile complaints otherwise set forth in this part will address the issue raised by the commenter. We do include one \nchange to the regulatory text in (b)(2), specifying that the target of the dissemination of the equal opportunity policy \ninclude \u201cindividuals connected with the administration or operation of the registered apprenticeship program.\u201d This \nis made partly to make this paragraph consistent with others in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 that use this exact phrasing. It is also \nto clarify the intent that the dissemination of the equal opportunity policy should be broad, reaching, for instance, \nsupervisors, foremen, journeyworkers, and other non-supervisory employees working alongside apprentices in the \nsponsor's program.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(i) and (ii) required a sponsor to publish its equal opportunity pledge in \napprenticeship standards and in appropriate publications and post the pledge on bulletin boards, including through \nelectronic media, accessible to apprentices and applicants for apprenticeship. Multiple commenters believed the \nproposed requirements requiring the equal opportunity pledge to be posted in apprenticeship standards and in \nappropriate publications, posted on bulletin boards, and through electronic media would not be burdensome, but a \nnational JATC asserted the proposed requirement was at least partially redundant of part 29, which already \nrequires insertion of the equal opportunity pledge. The Department notes that the proposed publishing requirement \npurposely goes beyond what is required in the part 29 equal opportunity pledge to include other appropriate \npublications. In response to a question about what constitutes these \u201cappropriate publications,\u201d we note that the \nproposed regulation specified several types; providing more specificity than this isn't feasible given that what is \nappropriate will likely vary from sponsor to sponsor. The Department can provide technical assistance on this issue \non a more individualized basis. The Final Rule does make a minor correction to (b)(2)(i), deleting \u201cand other \nappropriate publications,\u201d which was duplicative language, and replacing it with \u201cor other documents disseminated \nby the sponsor or that otherwise describe the nature of the sponsorship,\u201d and another non-substantive minor edit for \nbetter readability.\n\n \n\n  While commending the intent of the proposed language requiring wide dissemination of EEO policies, an \nadvocacy organization commented that the use of the term \u201caccessible\u201d in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) carries an additional \nmeaning for individuals with disabilities and urged that dissemination of a sponsor's EEO policies should be \n\u201caccessible\u201d in the broadest possible terms. Similarly, another advocacy organization recommended that the \nDepartment amend \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) to require that any electronic media platform used must be accessible to \nblind applicants (i.e., compatible with screen-reading technology). The Department notes that here \u201caccessible\u201d was \nintended to be interpreted broadly, and each sponsors should make its EEO policies available in alternative formats \n(such as large print, Braille and other means to enable individuals with visual impairments to read for themselves) \nupon request. This is consistent with existing obligations under disability law that require accommodations of \nindividuals unless to do so would impose an undue hardship on the sponsor's operations.\n\n \n\n  An individual commenter recommended that the Department require sponsors to use an inclusion statement to \nmake the workplace environment friendlier to current women in the trades, as well as more welcoming to women \nconsidering joining the trade. The requirements to publish and post the equal opportunity pledge are intended to \ncommunicate that the apprenticeship programs are welcoming to all apprentices regardless of race, color, religion, \nnational origin, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information, age, or disability. A required inclusion statement was \nnot proposed in the NPRM, and accordingly, the Department declines to so amend this provision. Nonetheless, the \nDepartment encourages such statements to the extent that they serve to further signal to all prospective \napprentices that they are welcome, which in turn may help sponsors obtain greater participation from members of \ncertain underrepresented populations.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(iii) required orientation and periodic information sessions for apprentices, \njourneyworkers who directly supervise apprentices, and other individuals connected with the administration or \noperation of the sponsor's program. Many comments received with respect to this requirement were generally \npositive. One advocacy organization suggested that the Department go beyond the proposal to require sponsors to, \nat a minimum, hold orientation and information sessions for apprentices, supervisors, and other individuals \nassociated with an apprenticeship program on an annual, rather than periodic, basis to ensure that individuals are \naware of the sponsor's EEO policy with regard to apprenticeship. We decline to incorporate this specificity in order \nto maintain sponsors' flexibility to conduct these sessions at intervals that make sense given the schedule at which \nsponsors onboard new apprentices. Another commenter recommended that the Department reiterate the \nimportance of broadening the awareness of the EEO policy among those on work sites who control the \ncircumstances of training by, for example, making clear that \u201cother individuals connected with the administration or \noperation\u201d include the foreman and supervisors who establish the accepted practice on the job site. While not \nincluded in the regulatory text, we have provided this guidance in this preamble in the discussion of \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b). We have also clarified in the regulatory text of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) that sponsors include the anti-\n\n\n\nharassment training required by paragraph (b)(4) of the final rule in these orientation and information sessions in \norder to make clear at the outset that harassing conduct will not be tolerated.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters raised concerns regarding the costs of such orientation and information sessions. In crafting \nthis Final Rule, the Department has attempted to balance the burden on sponsors with establishing a meaningful \nand effective equal opportunity policy dissemination process. For instance, the Department notes that sponsors, as \na matter of effective program management, must communicate some information jointly to apprentices and at least \nsome other individuals connected with the administration and operation of its apprenticeship program during the \ncourse of its sponsorship. Accordingly, the sessions established in these regulations need not necessarily require \nnew training sessions or timetables, but can incorporate the communication of the EEO policy information and anti-\nharassment training into existing sponsor-participant communications and training sessions. We additionally repeat \nthat the schedule for these sessions remains \u201cperiodic\u201d to provide sponsors with some timing flexibility.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters raised issues regarding the implementation of this requirement in various scenarios in which \nthe sponsor is not the employer. These commenters noted generally that the requirement would place a particular \nburden on multi-employer sponsors, that the employers would generally be better placed to provide EEO training of \nthis sort, and the constantly changing nature of the participating employers and employees further expanded the \nburden. Accordingly, one commenter recommended that the Department eliminate the proposed requirement that \nprogram sponsors conduct training and orientation for journeyworkers who supervise apprentices. The Department \nrecognizes that sponsors operate apprenticeship programs in numerous industries and occupations, involving a \nwide range of working conditions and environments, and that sponsors are not always the employer of the \napprentice. However, the proposal was largely based on existing actions already undertaken by sponsors, such as \nthat set forth in the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c)(10), to \u201cdevelop[&thinsp;] reasonable procedures between the sponsor \nand employers of apprentices to ensure that employment opportunity is being granted . . . .\u201d As discussed above, \nthe Department has not prescribed in the proposed rule the exact nature and frequency of these sessions, to allow \nsponsors some flexibility depending on their circumstances, but expects sponsors to carry out these activities in \ngood faith, which may in many cases involve coordinating with participating employers. Accordingly, we decline to \ndiverge from the existing regulations and create different obligations for different models of sponsorship.\n\n \n\n  Cost concerns were also raised with respect to the maintenance of records required by proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(iv). To clarify, the Department notes that this obligation is consistent with recordkeeping already \nrequired in the existing regulations, which obligate maintenance of \u201cinformation relative to the operation of the \napprenticeship program.\u201d&thinsp; (64)  For paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii), the obligation could be met simply by \nretaining a copy of the documents where the EO pledge is included. For paragraph (iii), retaining a copy of any \nwritten materials used to effectuate the sessions, as well as some memorialization of when the session occurred \nand who attended, would suffice for compliance purposes.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b)(3): Universal Outreach and Recruitment\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3) required all sponsors to ensure that their outreach and recruitment efforts for \napprentices extended to all persons available and qualified for apprenticeship within the sponsor's recruitment area \nregardless of race, sex, ethnicity, or disability status. Many commenters, including advocacy organizations and an \nSWA, expressed support for the proposed universal outreach and recruitment requirements. Some advocacy \norganizations reasoned that, given historical outreach and hiring practices focused primarily on men, broader \noutreach efforts are necessary to increase women's awareness of these opportunities.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters expressed concerns regarding the scope and cost of this outreach requirement. One \ncommenter recommended that the Department remove the proposed requirement in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)(i) that \nsponsors maintain lists of recruitment sources that will generate referrals from all demographic groups and the \nproposed requirement in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)(iii) to notify recruitment sources in advance of apprenticeship \n\n\n\nopportunities, noting that existing advertising mechanisms were sufficient. The Department notes that the proposed \nrevision mirrors outreach and recruitment efforts set forth in the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c)(1), so the requirement to \ndo so now should not be new for many sponsors. Further, the data in the introduction to this preamble showing \nwidespread underutilization of certain groups indicate that existing advertising mechanisms may not be sufficient to \ndraw interest from as broad and diverse a base as possible.\n\n \n\n  An SWA expressed concern regarding the costs of outreach activities for small sponsors, such as those with fewer \nthan five apprentices, that were not previously required to conduct mandatory recruitment and outreach activities, \nand that it might serve as a deterrent to creating new registered apprenticeship programs. To this, in addition to the \nresponse above, we note the Department intends to provide guidance to sponsors who need assistance finding \nsources for recruitment. While outreach and recruitment activities take some degree of time, when done \npurposefully they can provide immense benefits to the apprenticeship program, bringing a wide range of previously \nuntapped talent into the workforce.\n\n \n\n  Finally, another commenter recommended that to limit costs the Department retain the proposed minimum \nactivities but add to \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3) that a sponsor must engage in recruitment that would \u201creasonably be \nexpected\u201d to encourage persons with a potential capacity for apprenticeship to submit an application, suggesting \nthe following revised language:\n\n \n\n  (3) Universal outreach and recruitment. The sponsor will implement measures to ensure that its outreach and \nrecruitment efforts for apprentices extend to all persons available for apprenticeship within the sponsor's relevant \nrecruitment area without regard to race, sex, ethnicity, or disability and are reasonably expected to encourage \npersons with a potential capacity for apprenticeship to submit an application regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, or \ndisability.\n\n \n\n  The language proposed by the commenter appears to add another requirement, thus possibly adding to any \nburden that might be created. Insofar as the commenter is seeking to soften the requirement that a sponsor \n\u201cimplement measures to ensure that its outreach and recruitment efforts extend to all persons available,\u201d to clarify, \nthe implementation of this provision will be reviewed by evaluating the range of recruitment sources, not by \nchecking that every available person was reached. As noted above, during compliance reviews the Department will \nconsider a sponsor's good faith efforts in this regard. The Department accordingly declines to amend the provision \nas requested.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the question of whether the required outreach activities would result in a benefit to justify the costs, a \nnational JATC commented that the studies cited in the NPRM did not include any empirical evidence that additional \noutreach by construction industry training funds would result in greater participation of women and minorities in the \napprenticeship programs. The commenter said that the studies cited in the NPRM showed that the barriers to \nfemale participation are societal and there are no consensus best practices to address them.\n\n \n\n  As an initial response to this comment, the Department does not agree that there is no evidence that additional \noutreach would result in greater participation by traditionally underrepresented groups. As stated in the introduction \nof the rule, the experience of highway construction apprentices in Oregon, where extensive efforts to increase \ndiversity have occurred, demonstrates that the participation rate of women and minorities can increase markedly \nwhen it is prioritized. In response to the comment that underutilization is strictly \u201csocietal,\u201d which we interpret to \nmean out of the control of apprenticeship sponsors to address, while we do not suggest that discrimination is the \nentire reason for utilization disparities, there is ample evidence that it is a contributing factor. As described earlier, \ncomments received from several women working in the construction trades, including those who have participated \nin apprenticeship programs, detail repeated examples of differential treatment in job assignments, training, and \npromotions, as well as sexually harassing work environments. Another commenter cited academic research \n\n\n\ndemonstrating that, despite the ability and interest of women to work in these jobs, external barriers in recruitment, \nhiring, training, and retention of women persists. Indeed, a 2012 study funded by the U.S. Department of Labor \nidentified \u201charassment and exclusion at male-dominated worksites\u201d as one of three primary barriers underlying \nwomen's low rate of participation in construction trades apprenticeships,  (65)  and a 2013 report from the National \nWomen's Law Center describes the ways in which both overt and subtle forms of discrimination discourage \nwomen from entering and remaining in the construction field.  (66) \n\n \n\n  A number of comments made suggestions for additional specificity. Several advocacy organizations \nrecommended that the Department include all of the protected bases in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3) to ensure inclusive \noutreach and recruitment and avoid prohibited discrimination. Asserting that apprenticeship programs have a \nhistory of imposing maximum age requirements and other age-discriminatory practices, one advocacy organization \nurged the Department to add \u201cage\u201d to the bases on which registered apprenticeship programs have a general duty \nto engage in affirmative action in outreach and recruitment. As discussed above, the affirmative action provisions of \nthis part follow generally other such affirmative action programs which do not require specific outreach and \nrecruitment obligations on the basis of age. Nothing in the rule, however, would prevent a sponsor from engaging in \nsuch activities.\n\n \n\n  Some advocacy organizations urged the Department to add to the list of examples of relevant recruitment sources \nin \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)(i) organizations that represent and serve women, people of color, and other \nunderrepresented populations including individuals with disabilities. Further, these commenters suggested that the \nDepartment provide links to such resources on its Web site. As discussed above, the Department expects to \nprovide technical assistance to sponsors to help them identify relevant recruitment sources, either through \npublication on its Web site or through more targeted communication.\n\n \n\n  To underscore that outreach alone is not sufficient to recruit women in particular, some advocacy organizations \nsuggested that the Department include language in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3) to require that outreach is paired with \ncareer education that includes formal and informal apprenticeship information and orientation sessions describing \nwhat is entailed in the apprenticeship, the requirements and processes for applying, and explanations of the \nselection process. Related to this, these commenters recommended OA post on its Web site a list of resources for \ntechnical assistance and examples of career education materials, including links to WANTO-developed resources. \nThese comments call for new provisions that, while laudable, go beyond the scope of the outreach efforts proposed \nin the NPRM, and we decline to require them in the Final Rule. As stated above, the Department intends to provide \nguidance to sponsors relating to relevant recruitment sources.\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization urged the Department to strengthen the universal outreach requirements by requiring \nthat apprenticeship programs report on the results of their outreach efforts (e.g., how many candidates were \nreceived from each source, whether those candidates were accepted into the program, and why or why not) and \nmodify outreach efforts over time in accordance with the reported results. The Final Rule requires such reporting in \nwritten AAPs for sponsors who are underutilized and required to engage in targeted recruitment, as data would be \nparticularly important to sponsors in that standing, but we decline to extend it to the more general outreach \nrequirement. Similarly, another advocacy organization recommended that the Department propose accountability \ntargets for outreach, recruitment, and retention. This is largely the purpose of the utilization goals set forth in the \nsections dealing with the written AAP obligations.\n\n \n\n  A national union and a national JATC said that the Department should clarify the scope of the \u201crelevant \nrecruitment area,\u201d as that term is used throughout \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3). Explaining that JATCs are often located in \nremote areas, such that the training centers are not in the same labor market as the work opportunities provided by \nthe signatory contractors, these commenters recommended that the Department add clarifying language to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3). The Department addresses the proper interpretation of \u201crelevant recruitment area\u201d in the \n\n\n\ndiscussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, and submits that sponsors should use that interpretation to understand the meaning of \nthe term in this section as well.\n\n \n\n  Commenters also recommended that the Department develop, update, and disseminate annually lists of \nrecruitment resources, including contact information, by occupation and industry that sponsors can use. The \ncommenters suggested that this would ease compliance determinations made by Registration Agencies, in \naddition to easing the cost burden on sponsors so that they could expend recruitment resources on direct contact \nand ongoing coordination with the staff of recruitment resources and meeting with groups of potential candidates. \nThe Department and SAAs maintain relationships with some recruitment sources, and we provide such information \nto sponsors, as available and appropriate. The Department intends to increase technical assistance available to \nsponsors and provide additional recruitment sources to the extent that our resources allow.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter expressed concern that requiring sponsors to \u201cdevelop and update annually a list of current \nrecruitment sources that will generate referrals from all demographic groups within the relevant recruitment area,\u201d \ncould result in Registration Agencies holding sponsors accountable if recruitment and referral sources do not refer \nqualified applicants, despite good faith efforts on the part of the sponsor. For this reason, the commenter \nrecommended revising the language from \u201csources that will generate referrals\u201d to \u201csources likely to generate \nreferrals . . . .\u201d We decline to make this change. In the circumstance that the commenter raises, we would expect \nthat the sponsor, upon realizing that the sources it is using are not fulfilling the intent of this provision, would seek \nalternative or additional sources that are more effective at referring qualified applicants. The obligation is intended \nto be a dynamic one in which sponsors actively engage, rather than a rote, \u201ccheck the box\u201d requirement.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)(iii) requirement that sponsors provide recruitment sources advance \nnotice, preferably 30 days, of apprenticeship openings, we received comments on all sides of the issue. Several \ncommenters urged the Department to require no less than 30 days advance notice, which these commenters said \nwould allow sufficient time for the notice of an opening to be processed, acted upon, and disseminated by the \nrecruitment source and reach prospective applicants. These advocacy organizations stated that, historically, short \npublic notice of opening periods disadvantaged nontraditional pools of applicants who did not have the benefit of \nfamilial or collegial connections to become aware of apprenticeship opportunities and the application processes, \nselection methods, and/or criteria for competitive candidates.\n\n \n\n  By contrast, another commenter recommended that the Department eliminate the requirement to provide 30 days \nadvance notice of apprenticeship openings. This commenter reasoned that when an apprenticeship opening \noccurs, it may not always be feasible to provide referral sources with 30 days advance notice, particularly when new \nopenings occur as a result of a new project or when someone suddenly discontinues participation in the \napprenticeship program. Another proposed that the Department revise the provision to read \u201cprovide recruitment \nsources notice of such openings within 30 days of the opening being published,\u201d that is, 30 days after the opening. \nFinally, one commenter said the time set forth in the regulation should not be \u201cpreferred,\u201d but rather a concrete \namount of time.\n\n \n\n  We note in the first instance that the proposed language mirrored a provision at \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c)(1) of the existing \nregulations that established 30 days in advance as a firm deadline, rather than a preferred one. Thus, the intent \nwas to carry over an obligation that was familiar to sponsors, but provided more flexibility to account for differing \nlogistical possibilities. Taking into consideration the comments we received on both sides, we believe this approach \nremains the best one for those reasons, and thus we retain the proposed text in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b)(4): Maintaining Apprenticeship Programs Free From Harassment, Intimidation, and Retaliation\n\n \n\n\n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4) required a sponsor to develop and implement procedures to ensure that its \napprentices are not harassed because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 \nor older), genetic information, or disability, and to ensure that its workplace is free from harassment, intimidation, \nand retaliation. The proposal included four specific requirements set forth in separate subparagraphs: (i) \nCommunicating to all personnel that harassing conduct will not be tolerated; (ii) providing anti-harassment training \nfor all personnel; (iii) ensuring that facilities and apprenticeship activities are available to apprentices without \nregard to protected bases; and (iv) establishing procedures for handling and resolving complaints about \nharassment.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters generally supported the proposal. Numerous advocacy organizations, a professional \nassociation, and individual commenters expressed support for anti-harassment protections as being critical to \nprevent and confront the discrimination that is often pervasive at work sites, including sexual harassment and \nstereotypes, and to increase retention over time. One individual commenter stated that when women apprentices \nare isolated on jobs with only men they are subject to harassment and unsafe working conditions. Several women \nsubmitted comments describing their personal experiences being subject to sexual harassment as an apprentice on \na work site. An advocacy organization commented that age-based harassment is a growing problem, citing EEOC \nEnforcement & Litigation statistics.\n\n \n\n  Several advocacy organizations urged the Department to strengthen further the proposed anti-harassment \nprovisions in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4). One of these organizations cited a study that it asserted shows that 3 in 10 \nwomen respondents in an interview study reported frequent sexual harassment, harassment on the basis of their \nsexual orientation, or on the basis of their race or ethnicity. In particular, these organizations asserted that strong \nanti-harassment measures will help ensure that more women complete their apprenticeship programs and \nrecommended that the Department add to the anti-harassment measures at \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(i)-(iv) a \nrequirement that sponsors must make all work assignments and training opportunities available without regard to \nthe protected bases under the proposed rule. This principle is already protected by \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(1).\n\n \n\n  An industry association recommended that the Department clarify what \u201cworkplace\u201d means in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4) \nbecause, in many cases, apprenticeship sponsors are not the employers of the apprentices and only have control \nover what takes place within their own facilities. To address this concern, the Department has replaced the term \n\u201cworkplace\u201d with \u201capprenticeship program,\u201d to clearly indicate the sponsor's role in preventing harassment, \nintimidation, and retaliation. This can apply to both individual and group sponsors, in the manner discussed \npreviously.\n\n \n\n  One commenter suggested strengthening the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(i), which requires sponsors to \ncommunicate to all personnel that harassing conduct will not be tolerated, to include opportunities for apprentices to \nshare information about harassment or intimidation on the job or at school to identify common problems, which \ncould create a valuable feedback mechanism for sponsors interested in confronting harassment. The Department \nalso received significant comments regarding proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(ii) requiring that sponsors \u201cprovide anti-\nharassment training to all personnel.\u201d A number of commenters expressed concerns about the costs they asserted \nsponsors would incur as a result of the proposed requirement that sponsors must provide anti-harassment training \nto all personnel. For example, a national JATC urged the elimination of this provision in the Final Rule because \nmany union-sponsored apprenticeship programs are statewide or regional and the costs of bringing in every \njourneyworker for anti-harassment training would impose a large burden on the program. Further, this commenter \nreasoned that the provision is unnecessary because contractors are required by law to maintain a nondiscriminatory \nworkplace and union representatives can assist in helping them do so. In contrast to the comments raising the issue \nof burden, some commenters urged the Department to require additional training or add more specific language to \nthe proposed requirement that sponsors must \u201cprovide anti-harassment training to all personnel.\u201d These \nsuggestions included requiring regular and ongoing professional development on cultural competency, anti-\n\n\n\ndiscrimination, and affirmative action requirements for apprenticeship training staff, instructors, administrators, and \nsupport staff, both in classroom-related instruction and on work sites, as well as best practice guidelines.\n\n \n\n  To address these competing concerns, the Department has maintained the proposal's requirements that sponsors \ncommunicate that harassment will not be tolerated and provide anti-harassment training, but we clarify the proposal \nin three ways. First, in response to concerns that the proposal's requirement to provide training and \ncommunications to \u201call personnel\u201d was too broad, we revise the Final Rule to state that sponsors must ensure these \nobligations reach \u201cindividuals connected with the administration and operation of the apprenticeship program, \nincluding all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with apprentices.\u201d This is narrower than the \u201call \npersonnel\u201d language proposed, but, as stated in the discussion of paragraph (b)(2) where this language is also \nused, should be broadly interpreted to include apprentices, supervisors, foremen, journeyworkers, and other non-\nsupervisory employees working regularly alongside apprentices in the sponsor's program. It would not require, for \ninstance, communication to employees of participating employers who do not work in proximity to, or otherwise \ninteract with, apprentices in these programs, although we maintain that the broadest possible communication of \nanti-harassment principles and obligations is a best practice.\n\n \n\n  Second, paragraph (b)(4)(i) of the Final Rule requires that sponsors are required to provide training for this same \nnarrower category of personnel, and clarifies that this must not be a mere passive transmittal of information, but \nmust include participation by trainees in a training program, such as attending a training in person or completing an \ninteractive training program online.\n\n \n\n  Third, the Final Rule clarifies that the training content must include, at a minimum, the communication of the \nfollowing information: A statement that harassing conduct will not be tolerated; a definition of harassment and \nexamples of the types of conduct that would constitute unlawful harassment; and the right to file a harassment \ncomplaint. We believe communicating these elements as part of anti-harassment training is fundamental to creating \nan environment where it is broadly understood what constitutes harassment and that such harassment has no place \nin an apprenticeship program.\n\n \n\n  We expect that some sponsors, in the course of their normal business practices, already provide anti-harassment \ntraining that covers some or all of what this Final Rule requires. To the extent that sponsors can simply modify \nexisting training modules (including the orientation and information sessions set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) above) \nto include this training obligation, doing so will limit the associated time and expense for compliance. Further, to \nhelp sponsors comply with this training obligation, the Department will provide technical assistance, including links \nto materials relevant to the required contents of the anti-harassment training, that sponsors and/or participating \nemployers can use.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(iii) required that \u201cif the sponsor provides restrooms or changing facilities, the \nsponsor must provide separate or single-user restrooms and changing facilities to assure privacy between the \nsexes.\u201d An individual commenter urged the Department to require job sites to have separate male and female \nrestrooms. Some advocacy organizations urged the Department to require sponsors to have external locks on all \nsingle-user and sex-segregated restrooms and changing facilities and to ensure that all restrooms and changing \nfacilities are enclosed, including a roof, to ensure privacy between the sexes and support safety and health \nmeasures in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety \nand Health in its report \u201cWomen in the Construction Workplace: Providing Equitable Safety and Health Protection.\u201d \nCommenting that unsafe sanitary facilities are a large challenge for women in nontraditional trades, two individual \ncommenters also recommended that the regulations ensure that women have access to secure, safe, locked \nsanitary facilities. The Department notes that rules regarding the sanitation of restrooms and changing facilities \napply more broadly to workplaces than to those that are part of an apprenticeship program and this type of \nspecificity was not proposed in the NPRM. Nonetheless, the language \u201cto assure privacy\u201d implies that such \n\n\n\nrestrooms and changing facilities must be secure. For this reason, the Department does not change the proposal on \nthis account.\n\n \n\n  One advocacy organization suggested that the Department should include specific language regarding access to \nappropriate sex-segregated facilities for all workers in apprenticeship programs. Numerous other advocacy \norganizations urged the Department to clarify that program sponsors must permit transgender persons to access \nrestrooms and changing facilities based on their gender identity. As discussed earlier, \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)(2) of the \nregulation provides that the Department will look to relevant legal authorities to interpret whether sponsors are \nengaging in unlawful sex discrimination.  (67)  The Department will continue to monitor the developing law related \nto the issues raised by the commenters, and will consider issuing further guidance on this subject as appropriate. \nAccordingly, the proposed paragraph (b)(4)(iii) is retained in the Final Rule as paragraph (b)(4)(ii).\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(iv) required that sponsors implement procedures for handling and resolving \ncomplaints about harassment and intimidation. An individual commenter requested that the Department require \nsponsors to post such internal procedures in common areas of schools, work sites, and meeting spaces. The \nrequirement to \u201cestablish and implement\u201d implies providing notice that such procedures exist and posting such \nprocedures where apprentices would see them. The Final Rule retains proposed paragraph (b)(4)(iv) in the Final \nRule as paragraph (b)(4)(iii), with the addition of a line stating that the establishment and implementation of \nprocedures for handling and resolving complaints applies to complaints about retaliation, as well as harassment and \nintimidation. This is in keeping with the broader focus of paragraph (b)(4).\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(b)(5): Compliance With Federal and State Equal Employment Opportunity Laws\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(5) required all sponsors to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and \nregulations requiring EEO without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or \nolder), genetic information, or disability. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) largely duplicates the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.10.\n\n \n\n  An SWA commented that the \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(5) assignment of EEO obligations to the sponsor \u201cor [in the case of \na] joint apprenticeship training committee, parties represented on such committee\u201d seems to transfer responsibility \nfrom a sponsor to the applicable managers and union officials, which would protect the sponsor from ever being \nsanctioned (i.e., deregistered). The commenter asked why this privilege applies only to joint committees and \nwhether non-joint committees are materially different in this regard. The Department clarifies that, as stated earlier, \nthe obligations of this part apply to all sponsors. It recognizes that the language in parentheses \u201cor where the \nsponsor is a joint apprenticeship committee, the parties represented on such committee\u201d could be understood as an \nexception. Therefore this language has been stricken.\n\n \n\n  Moreover, this commenter asserted that the reference to other laws in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(5) would require \nregistered apprenticeship stakeholders to enforce policies of programs and systems that are outside of their familiar \nvenue (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, gender equity, or disability rights). The commenter asked whether officials in \nthose other policy areas will have reciprocal duties to enforce registered apprenticeship standards. In response, the \nDepartment notes that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(5) carried forward the provisions from existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.10. \nWith this in mind, we clarify that this proposed provision is not intended to incorporate by reference the \nrequirements of all Federal and State non-discrimination laws and regulations. Rather, it recognizes that many \nsponsors may already be subject to such laws, etc., and to the extent they are, they must comply with them. Failure \nto do so may be grounds for enforcement action under proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15. Such action would only be taken if \nthe violations of other Federal and State non-discrimination laws are applicable to the sponsor and relate to the \nemployment opportunity of apprentices. To make this clear, language from existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.10, \u201cif such \n\n\n\nnoncompliance is related to the equal employment opportunity of apprentices and/or graduates of such an \napprenticeship programs under this part,\u201d has been inserted in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(c): Equal Opportunity Pledge\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(c) carried forward the requirement set forth in the current \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b) for an equal \nopportunity pledge and include age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability on the list of \nbases upon which a sponsor must not discriminate, and included a parenthetical stating that sex discrimination \nincluded discrimination on the basis of gender identity and pregnancy. Apart from the comments addressed earlier \nrecommending that the ground of sex discrimination expressly recognize sexual orientation discrimination and \nsex stereotyping as additional forms of sex discrimination, which has already been discussed, no other comments \nwere received. Accordingly, the text is adopted as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(d): Compliance\n\n \n\n  In order to clarify the time a sponsor has to comply with obligations in this rule, rather than a catch-all \u201ceffective \ndate\u201d provision as was set forth in the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.20, the Final Rule sets forth in the specific sections, as \nneeded, when a sponsor must come into compliance with the obligations set forth in that section. If no such date is \nprovided, it is intended that the sponsor must comply with a particular section as of the effective date of the Final \nRule.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.20 required that currently registered apprenticeship programs have 180 days to come into \ncompliance with the provisions of \u00a7&thinsp;30.3, but did not specify a similar compliance deadline for sponsorships \nnewly registered after the effective date. This new \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(d) carries over the 180-day compliance date for \ncurrently registered programs from the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.20, and clarifies that sponsors registered after the \neffective date will need to comply with \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 upon registration or 180 days after the effective date of this \nrule, whichever is later. This is consistent with the proposal and will ensure that sponsors registered shortly after the \nrule's effective date in no circumstance will have to come into compliance more quickly than currently registered \nsponsors.\n\n \n\n  Affirmative Action Programs (\u00a7&thinsp;30.4)\n\n \n\n  The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4 set forth the regulatory requirements with respect to AAPs, addressing: The adoption of \nan AAP in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a); the definition of affirmative action in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(b); the requirements for broad \noutreach and recruitment in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c); the mandate that a sponsor include goals and timetables where \nunderutilization occurs in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d); the factors for determining whether goals and timetables are needed in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e); the establishment and attainment of goals and timetables in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(f); and that the \nSecretary of Labor will make available to program sponsors data and information on minority and female labor force \ncharacteristics in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(g). Exemptions from the requirement to adopt an AAP were found in the existing \npart 30 at \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(e) and (f).\n\n \n\n  The NPRM proposed to restructure this section in order to streamline, clarify, update, and improve the AAP \nrequirements by making clear the purpose of AAPs, stating who must adopt an AAP, listing the required elements \nof AAPs, explaining the exemptions for maintaining an AAP, and laying out the proposed new timing for internal \nreview of AAPs.\n\n \n\n\n\n  A number of commenters expressed concern with the burden associated with maintaining AAPs generally. For \nexample, a national JATC remarked that the proposed AAP requirements would put a time and resource burden on \nsponsors and an individual commenter warned that the proposed rule could divert already-limited resources away \nfrom training programs and opposed any rules that would increase costs for purposes of tracking and reporting. A \nnational JATC expressed concern that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4 would make affirmative action requirements more \ndifficult to understand and comply with in general.\n\n \n\n  The Department understands the voluntary nature of apprenticeship and that many program sponsors are under \nresource constraints, but notes that the requirement to maintain an AAP is not a new requirement and that all non-\nexempt sponsors (i.e., sponsors with 5 or more apprentices) are currently required to develop and maintain such \nplans with respect to women and minorities. As explained in the NPRM, maintaining an AAP need not be an unduly \nburdensome undertaking. Thousands of registered apprenticeships with AAPs have been established under the \nexisting regulations, and many have maintained and grown the number of apprenticeships and the skill of their \nindividual workers notwithstanding the AAP obligations, and because of these obligations have taken strides to \ndiversify their program to more closely reflect the available workforce. While these regulations add some new \nobligations to the AAP, the intent was to streamline and clarify the AAP as a whole, making it simpler to understand \nwhat compliance means and easier to measure and achieve meaningful success\u2014both for existing apprenticeship \nprograms and for the many companies looking to create apprenticeship programs now and in the future. The \nDepartment has thoroughly considered the concerns raised by the commenters with regard to burden and, as \ndescribed in the discussions of sections 30.4-30.8 herein, the Final Rule contains several changes from the \nproposal designed to reduce further the burden of AAP compliance for sponsors while maintaining an effective \noverall program.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.4(a): Definition and Purpose\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a) included a revised definition of \u201caffirmative action program\u201d and explained that, in \naddition to identifying and correcting underutilization, AAPs also are intended to institutionalize the sponsor's \ncommitment to inclusion and diversity by establishing procedures to monitor and examine the sponsor's \nemployment practices and decisions with respect to apprenticeship, so that the practices and decisions are free \nfrom discrimination, and barriers to equal opportunity are identified and addressed.\n\n \n\n  Multiple commenters, including a national JATC and SWAs, disagreed with the premise laid out in paragraph \n(a)(2) that \u201cabsent discrimination, over time a sponsor's apprenticeship program, generally, will reflect the sex, \nrace, ethnicity, and disability profile of the labor pools from which the sponsor recruits and selects.\u201d These \ncommenters argued that the goals set forth in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a) do not take into account the societal and cultural \nfactors that influence an individual's decision to pursue apprenticeship and that lack of diversity is not necessarily a \ndirect result of discrimination, and suggested that the Department remove paragraph (a)(2). Specifically, one \ncommenter said that it is impossible for the sponsor to address underlying societal problems that influence lack of \nparticipation by underrepresented groups, such as lack of access to childcare or transportation. Some commenters \nremarked that compliance with affirmative action requirements should be determined by whether the sponsor has \nmade significant efforts to meet its goals and timetables.\n\n \n\n  We respectfully disagree with many of the comments on this proposed language, which mirrors language in the \nOFCCP affirmative action regulations and describes well-established rationales for affirmative action. The idea \nbehind maintaining an AAP is to combat any existing societal factors that may have been influenced by previous \ndiscriminatory norms and practices and that may continue to deter underrepresented groups from seeking jobs in \ncertain sectors. The data cited at the beginning of this preamble demonstrates that stark underutilization of the \nprotected groups persists to the present. While some amount of this disparity may not be directly attributable to \ndiscrimination, the comments we received from individuals in the trades and advocacy organizations describing \n\n\n\nwidespread harassment and other behavior that has a chilling effect on these groups entering apprenticeships \ncannot be ignored. While a sponsor's goals are aspirational, it should take underutilization as a signal that it should \nlook closely at its employment and outreach practices to ensure that its practices are not preventing \nunderrepresented groups from applying to, participating, and advancing in apprenticeship. The targeted outreach, \nrecruitment, and retention practices outlined in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 are designed to help sponsors experiencing \nunderutilization overcome societal barriers to apprenticeship that may exist in that field. As discussed more fully in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.6, this is not a purely arithmetic exercise. Each sponsor's compliance with its affirmative action \nobligations will be determined in significant part by reviewing the nature and extent of the sponsor's good faith \naffirmative action activities and the appropriateness of those activities to identify equal employment opportunity \nproblems. A sponsor's compliance is measured by whether it has made good faith efforts to meet its goals; failure \nto meet goals is not itself a violation of these regulations.\n\n \n\n  An SWA requested a definition of the term \u201cbarriers\u201d as it applies to \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(1) and (a)(2), and requested \nclarification about how to detect and remove barriers. A national JATC and a national union suggested that the \nDepartment provide guidance on \u201cspecific, practical steps\u201d to address barriers to equal opportunity to comply with \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(2).\n\n \n\n  \u201cBarriers\u201d are any practices that prevent individuals from realizing an equal opportunity to apply for and participate \nin apprenticeship programs. These could include lack of effective outreach so that certain populations are unaware \nof apprenticeship opportunities, selection mechanisms that are not job related that disfavor certain protected \ngroups, attitudes toward or treatment of certain individuals that are hostile or otherwise unwelcoming, or the failure \nto provide equal opportunity in training, pay, work assignments, discipline, or other employment actions. AAPs are \ntools designed to assist a sponsor in detecting and diagnosing where barriers may exist in its program and how \nthey may be impacting certain groups. By documenting and collecting information at various stages of its program, \nincluding recruitment, selection, training, and assignment, a sponsor can analyze whether any element of its \nprogram is adversely impacting individuals within certain racial, sex, or ethnic groups. If a sponsor discovers that its \nprogram is underutilized for women or one or multiple underrepresented groups, this may be a sign that barriers \ncurrently exist for those groups. The Department has identified specific steps that a sponsor must take with regards \nto its outreach, recruitment, and retention activities if it discovers that it is underutilized, as set forth in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.8, infra. Each sponsor is also encouraged to take any additional steps it concludes could help eliminate \nbarriers. The Department can also provide more individualized guidance and technical assistance to sponsors in \norder to help identify and overcome any barriers to equal opportunity in apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Commenters, including a national JATC and a national union, suggested that the Department should clarify \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(3), which refers to internal auditing as a tool to measure the sponsor's progress in achieving an \napprenticeship program that would be expected absent discrimination, by specifying where the discrimination is \npresumed to take place (e.g., on the construction site or in the classroom or other training centers). One commenter \nsuggested that this internal auditing should be used to find specific areas of the sponsor's program where practices \nmight be causing a disparate impact on certain groups throughout different phases of the program.\n\n \n\n  AAPs are designed to assist sponsors in identifying possible discrimination that could be occurring at any point in \nthe apprenticeship program, whether that discrimination is occurring in the application process, in job \nassignments, through harassment at a work site, or any other element of the program. There is no single step in the \napprenticeship program where discrimination is presumed to occur and the internal audit and review that \naccompanies a sponsor's AAP should be thorough and detailed enough to allow the sponsor to learn of any \npotential discrimination throughout its program. The Department encourages each sponsor, when reviewing its \ncompliance with AAP obligations, to identify any specific areas or practices that may be adversely affecting certain \ngroups. An AAP is designed to be a tool to assist sponsors in identifying any specific practices that may be \ndeterring or excluding women and/or minorities from participating fully in the program.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Commenters also sought guidance on how the EEO responsibilities of JATCs might differ from those of non-joint \ncommittees that directly employ apprentices. Similarly, an industry association asserted that it would be difficult to \nmeet the requirements detailed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(4) related to monitoring, examining, evaluating, and revising \nemployment decisions and policies because apprentices may be involved in a JATC program that involves work for \nmultiple employers, arguing that these programs would be unable to monitor the employment policies of each \nemployer. An SWA commented that the proposed rule language confuses the roles of sponsors and employers, \nand suggested that the language could be clarified to define specific new responsibilities for sponsors.\n\n \n\n  These comments raise issues addressed previously in the discussion of \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.1 and 30.3. Generally \nspeaking, it is\u2014and has been historically under these regulations\u2014the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure that \nall aspects of its program are being administered in a non-discriminatory manner and to implement an AAP. This \nclearly applies to the sponsor's own employment practices, policies, and decisions. In programs where participating \nemployers, rather than the sponsor, control certain aspects of the apprenticeship experience, ensuring the \nprogram's broad compliance with affirmative action obligations has been accomplished through written agreements \nbetween sponsor and employer setting forth procedures to ensure that employment opportunity is being granted. \nThis would include sponsors communicating with participating employers about policies that could be resulting in \ndiscrimination and addressing complaints of discrimination. As stated previously, while this requires a degree of \npurposeful oversight on the part of the sponsor, it is consistent with past practice in group sponsorships and is \nnecessary so as to prevent expansive loopholes that could frustrate the purpose of this part.\n\n \n\n  An industry association suggested that the Department should use the term \u201cequal opportunity program,\u201d as \nopposed to \u201caffirmative action program.\u201d The Department declines to accept this suggestion. As is made clear by \nthe definition of \u201caffirmative action program\u201d that was contained in the NPRM, and that is adopted in this Final Rule, \nan AAP is \u201cmore than mere passive nondiscrimination\u201d and requires sponsors to \u201ctake affirmative steps to \nencourage and promote equal opportunity, to create an environment free from discrimination, and to address any \nbarriers to equal opportunity in apprenticeship.\u201d They share many similarities with \u201caffirmative action programs\u201d \nadministered by OFCCP. Referring to these programs as \u201caffirmative action programs,\u201d a broadly used and well \nunderstood concept, reinforces the idea that sponsors must not only refrain from discriminating against apprentices \nand applicants for apprenticeship, but must also take positive steps to correct any barriers to equal employment. \nAdditionally, many sponsors already maintain AAPs under the current regulations, and changing the name of the \nprogram would create unnecessary confusion and inconsistency.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.4(b): Adoption of Affirmative Action Programs\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(b) detailed who must adopt an AAP, and further stated that, unless otherwise exempted \nby proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d), each sponsor must develop and maintain a written AAP, which must be made \navailable to the Registration Agency any time thereafter upon request.\n\n \n\n  A comment from an SWA stated that affirmative action activities proposed would be difficult for smaller \napprenticeship program sponsors with limited staffing and financial resources and may discourage potential new \nsponsors from registering their programs. An exemption for smaller apprenticeship programs is discussed in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d), below. With regard to the more general burden concerns dissuading entities from entering into or \ncontinuing registered apprenticeship programs, the Final Rule allows sponsors, both existing and new, more time to \ncomply with AAP requirements than was proposed in the NPRM. Sponsors will have two years, either from the \neffective date (for sponsors registered with a Registration Agency at the time this Final Rule becomes effective) or \nfrom the date of registration (for new sponsors) in which to complete a written AAP. Details regarding the \ncompliance date of each of these components can be found in the respective sections of this Final Rule, but in \n\n\n\ngeneral, the Final Rule provides more time than the NPRM to complete these steps, allows more time between \nsubsequent reviews of these obligations, and increases the assistance provided by Registration Agencies to \nsponsors in order to complete these obligations. As one example, during a new apprenticeship program's \nprovisional review conducted within one year of registration, the Registration Agency will provide further guidance \nto assist in the completion of the initial written AAP.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.4(c): Contents of Affirmative Action Programs\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c) provided an outline of the five required elements of an AAP: (1) Utilization analyses for \nrace, sex, and ethnicity; (2) establishment of utilization goals for race, sex, and ethnicity, if necessary; (3) \nestablishment of utilization analyses and goal setting for individuals with disabilities; (4) targeted outreach, \nrecruitment, and retention, if necessary; and (5) a review of personnel processes.\n\n \n\n  The Department's responses to specific comments addressing the five required elements of AAPs are explained in \nthose respective sections of the preamble (\u00a7&thinsp;30.5-\u00a7&thinsp;30.9). In addition to the five elements outlined \nabove, a few advocacy organizations urged the Department to include sexual orientation in AAPs and suggested \nthat individuals should be given the opportunity to self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). \nThe Final Rule adds sexual orientation as a protected basis upon which a sponsor may not discriminate, but, \nconsistent with OFCCP's AAPs, it does not include sexual orientation as a basis upon which a sponsor must collect \ninformation or engage in action-oriented programs.\n\n \n\n  A national JATC encouraged the Department to retain the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c), which provides, in part, that \n\u201cthe Department may provide such financial or other assistance as it seems necessary to implement the \nrequirements of this paragraph.\u201d This commenter said that deleting this section sends the wrong message to the \nregulated community and the public because it appears the Department is leaving the JATCs to use their own \nresources to comply with requirements.\n\n \n\n  While the Department will provide extensive technical assistance to sponsors in complying with the AAP \nobligations of this Final Rule, as discussed in greater detail in later sections, it has always been and will continue to \nbe the responsibility of each sponsor to allocate sufficient resources to ensure that its program is being operated in \na non-discriminatory manner. Nonetheless, the Department does not need a regulatory requirement in order to \nprovide such assistance and the Department may continue to offer such assistance in the future. Accordingly, the \nDepartment declines to retain the prior language of \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c), and adopts the language in proposed \nparagraph (c) without change.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.4(d): Exemptions\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d) set forth the two exemptions to the requirement that a sponsor develop an AAP: \nPrograms with fewer than five apprentices; and programs already subject to an approved equal employment \nopportunity program providing for affirmative action in apprenticeship that includes the use of goals for each \nunderrepresented group. These exemptions are the same as those that were contained in the existing regulations. \nWith regards to the exemption for programs subject to an approved equal employment opportunity program, \nhowever, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d) required that a sponsor with an approved equal employment opportunity \nprogram agree to extend that program to include individuals with disabilities to ensure that all protected bases set \nforth in the proposal would be addressed and that the sponsor was taking the appropriate actions to ensure that \nprotected individuals are employed as apprentices and advanced in employment.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Paragraph (d)(1) of this section exempted sponsors with fewer than five apprentices from the AAP obligations. \nTwo industry associations, an SAA, and an individual commenter expressed support for the exemption for programs \nwith fewer than five apprentices. One industry association commented that the exemption should be expanded to \nexempt even larger programs from the AAP requirement. In contrast, many commenters suggested that all \nsponsors should be required to create AAPs, regardless of the size of the apprenticeship program, arguing that the \nexemption would exclude a significant portion of apprenticeship programs from the equal opportunity requirements \nthat the regulations aim to provide. Two national unions commented that the proposed exemption is contrary to the \nrecommendation of the Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship. These commenters suggested that the Department \nshould require all programs to maintain AAPs but support those programs with limited resources through technical \nassistance.\n\n \n\n  Commenters also expressed concern that exempting small programs would exclude programs in the early years of \ngrowth, when the AAP has the greatest potential for positive, long-term impact. A national union and a national \nJATC warned that there would be faster growth in small programs rather than large programs, and that these new \nprograms would not have to maintain AAPs under the exemption. An SAA concluded that, at a minimum, small \nsponsors should be required to provide a strategy for outreach and recruitment of a diverse workforce.\n\n \n\n  A national union and an industry association stated that the staff and resource capacity that would be needed to \ncomply with the affirmative action requirements would also be needed to comply with the universal outreach \nrequirements in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3, and therefore there is no additional reason to exempt small programs from the AAP \nrequirements. Similarly, two national unions argued that, by the Department's own analysis, the burden to develop \nand maintain an AAP would be minimal, and the benefits of ensuring EEO for all apprentices would outweigh \nwhatever burden was associated with maintaining the AAP. Some commenters also argued that exempting small \nprograms was inconsistent with other Departmental programs, including those applying to federal contractors.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters further argued that the exemption should not be based on number of apprentices, but on the \nresources available to the sponsor. For example, some commenters suggested that the exemption should be tied to \nthe sponsor's total number of employees, rather than the number of apprentices, or to the contributions received by \nthe sponsor. Several unions and an industry association commented that most large apprenticeship programs are \ntrusts created by collective bargaining agreements and are funded by contributions, which often have limited \nflexibility in terms of resource allocation and subjects programs funded by collective bargaining to the same cost-\nsensitivity as small programs. On the other hand, a State agency commented that entities with fewer than five \napprentices are often large employers with sufficient resources to comply with an AAP. A national union \ncommented that the exemption should only apply to sponsors that truly do not have the resources to maintain an \nAAP, and should not just apply to small programs across the board.\n\n \n\n  An SWA also asked whether the exemption would apply to sponsors that operate multiple programs, each with \nfewer than five apprentices, but with more than five apprentices across all programs.\n\n \n\n  Acknowledging the range of opinions on this topic, the Final Rule retains the current exemption without change. \nAlthough some commenters argue that the AAP requirement is so burdensome that even fewer programs should be \nrequired to maintain these plans, the majority of commenters and the Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship \nsupported eliminating the exemption altogether, claiming that the benefits of EEO far outweighed any burden \nimposed by maintaining an AAP. The Department agrees that the exemption should not be expanded, as currently \napproximately seventy-five percent of apprenticeship programs already fall within this exemption, and no compelling \nevidence has been presented to increase the apprenticeship threshold for the exemption.\n\n \n\n  However, the Department believes that eliminating the exemption entirely would be detrimental as well. While the \ncreation and management of an AAP need not be an unduly burdensome process, the exemption for programs with \n\n\n\nfewer than five apprentices is a longstanding one. We further disagree with the comment asserting that the \nobligations under \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 are the same as those required by the AAP; the AAP contains data collection and \nanalysis obligations that \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 does not. Although some commenters noted that not all small programs \nhave resource constraints and that, conversely, not all large programs have resources sufficient to conduct AAPs, \nthe Department assumes that programs with fewer than five apprentices will generally have fewer staff members \nadministering the program than those with significantly more apprentices. And, for any larger programs with limited \nresources, these programs are currently subject to the AAP requirements and should therefore have already \nabsorbed the cost of conducting an AAP into their operational budget. Furthermore, the Department will provide \ntechnical assistance to programs in developing their AAPs to ease any burden associated with this requirement.\n\n \n\n  In addition to the Department's concerns regarding the burden imposed on small programs, the Department also \nnotes that programs with fewer than five apprentices may be less likely to generate enough data to provide \nmeaningful utilization analyses, given the smaller sample size presented by each apprenticeship class. Moreover, in \nlight of the stronger equal opportunity standards\u2014as outlined in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3\u2014that now apply to all sponsors, \neven those programs that are not required to maintain AAPs will be required to take specific, proactive steps to \nensure nondiscrimination and increase their recruitment and outreach efforts. The Department believes that these \nrequirements will increase the participation of underrepresented groups across all programs, including those with \nfewer than five apprentices.\n\n \n\n  In response to those comments claiming that the exemption for small sponsors is inconsistent with the \nrequirements imposed upon federal contractors, the Department notes that, while the nondiscrimination provisions \nof Executive Order 11246, which are administered by the Department's OFCCP, apply to contractors regardless of \nsize so long as they have qualifying contracts totaling $10,000 or more in a calendar year, OFCCP's AAP \nrequirements only apply to those contractors with 50 or more employees and a single contract of $50,000 or more.  \n(68) \n\n \n\n  Finally, in response to the SWA's question regarding the application of the exemption, any program that employs \nfewer than five apprentices is exempt from the AAP requirement, regardless of the size of any other programs that \nthe sponsor may administer.\n\n \n\n  With regard to paragraph (d)(2)'s exemption of programs subject to approved equal employment opportunity \nprograms, which is carried over from the existing rule in large part, many commenters supported the exemption for \nprograms that were already in compliance with an AAP, so long as that AAP was extended to cover individuals with \ndisabilities. Some commenters sought clarification on how the exemption would operate. For example, a State \nagency requested clarification as to whether a sponsor would need to develop an AAP under proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4 if apprenticeship is not specifically dealt with as a sub-classification or sub-goal in a plan developed \nfor compliance with other Federal programs such as E.O. 11246. Additionally, an industry association asked for \nclarification as to whether or not there would be an exemption for association program sponsors that obtain \napprentices from participating employers that are already in compliance with other AAP requirements. With regard \nto the issue of including apprenticeship as a sub-classification or sub-goal, the sponsor would need to demonstrate \nthat its plan extended to the operation of its apprenticeship program, meaning that the apprentices would need to \nbe covered by the plan's nondiscrimination and affirmative action standards. The sponsor would not need to \ndevelop separate goals for its apprenticeship program, however, so long as the goals established pursuant to the \npre-existing plan are likely to equal or exceed the goals that would be required pursuant to this Final Rule. With \nregard to the second request for clarification, a sponsor must develop its own AAP and may not simply rely on an \nAAP in place for its participating employers.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.3(e): Written Affirmative Action Plans\n\n \n\n\n\n  Finally, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e) incorporated the existing practice of requiring internal reviews of AAPs on an \nannual basis, but also allowed a sponsor who could demonstrate that it was not underutilized in any of the protected \nbases for which measurements are kept (race, sex, and disability) and that its review of personnel practices did not \nrequire any necessary modifications to meet nondiscrimination objectives, to wait two years to complete its next \nAAP review. The Department sought comments on this proposal, including specifically whether stakeholders \nbelieve such an approach would incentivize AAP success without compromising the overall goals of promoting and \nensuring equal employment opportunity in registered apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Several advocacy organizations expressed support for allowing sponsors to wait two years to complete the next \ninternal AAP review if the review does not indicate underutilization or any necessary modifications. These \ncommenters suggested, however, that this extension on the review period should only be allowed for sponsors that \nhave not received any substantiated complaints of discrimination, arguing that this would provide a strong \nincentive for meeting affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligation. An SWA expressed concern that this \nrequirement might be overly burdensome, and requested guidance on how Registration Agencies should enforce \nthe requirement to self-monitor. Some advocacy groups were also concerned that external review mechanisms \nshould be in place. A few commenters suggested that sponsors should be required to submit their written AAPs, or \na summary of their annual or biannual review, to the Registration Agency upon completion. Similarly, an individual \ncommenter suggested that sponsors should be required to publish written AAPs, goals, and timetables on their \nWeb sites to increase transparency, accountability, and community engagement. In order to better understand \nwhether participation among underrepresented groups is improving, an advocacy organization also urged the \nDepartment to publish the participation of apprentices by sex, race, ethnicity, and disability status annually. Finally, \nan individual commenter asked for clarification as to whether or not AAPs need to be approved by the Registration \nAgency prior to implementation.\n\n \n\n  The Department removes the proposed paragraph 30.4(e) from the Final Rule and instead addresses the timeline \nfor completing and/or updating the particular elements of an AAP within each of those respective sections of the \nFinal Rule. As set forth in these sections, the schedule for each respective AAP element will also apply uniformly \nand will not depend whether a sponsor has met its utilization goals. While the biannual review schedule for \nsponsors meeting their goals would have reduced the burden for those sponsors from what is required under the \nexisting regulations, the Final Rule's timeline for the review of AAP elements in many cases further reduces the \nfrequency with which sponsors need to review certain elements of their AAPs, thereby reducing burden even further \nfor all covered sponsors. This will also increase consistency in sponsor obligations and streamline compliance \nreviews for Registration Agencies.\n\n \n\n  In place of the proposed paragraph 30.4(e), the Final Rule sets forth the obligation for creating a written AAP \ndocument. Written AAPs are already required under the existing regulations, and are required to be updated \nannually per existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. However, in practice, most sponsors did not fully update their written AAPs until \nthey were scheduled for a compliance review, for reasons discussed further in \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, below. Paragraph \n30.4(e) establishes that initial written AAPs must be completed within 2 years of the effective date of the Final Rule \nfor sponsors with existing apprenticeship programs, and within 2 years of registration for all apprenticeship \nprograms registered after the effective date. Written AAPs must be subsequently revised every time the sponsor \ncompletes workforce analyses for race, sex, and disability as required by \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) and 30.7(d)(2) of this \npart. In order to facilitate compliance and ease the burden of this obligation, the Department will provide model \nwritten AAPs that each sponsor may tailor to its own program. The Department will also provide a timeline chart that \nclearly sets out when the sponsor must comply with each AAP obligation.\n\n \n\n  In response to those commenters suggesting that sponsors should publish or submit their written AAPs to the \nRegistration Agency, the Department declines to adopt these suggestions, as doing so would be unnecessarily \nburdensome both for the sponsor and the Registration Agency. Instead, the Registration Agency will ensure \n\n\n\nduring the sponsor's compliance review that the sponsor properly conducted and documented all reviews and \nanalyses that were required between compliance evaluations. OA will also look into providing more information \nregarding diversity in apprenticeship on its Web site. Regarding the requests for clarification, existing written AAPs \ndo not need to be submitted to the Registration Agency, but will be reviewed for compliance with this Final Rule at \nthe sponsor's next compliance review.\n\n \n\n  Utilization Analysis for Race, Sex, and Ethnicity (\u00a7&thinsp;30.5)\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department proposed to move the topic in the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, selection of apprentices, \nto \u00a7&thinsp;30.10. In its place, the Department proposed a new \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, which provided guidelines for \nassessing whether possible barriers to apprenticeship exist for particular groups of individuals by determining \nwhether the race, sex, and ethnicity of apprentices in a sponsor's apprenticeship program is reflective of the \npopulation available for apprenticeship by race, sex, and ethnicity in the sponsor's relevant recruitment area. This \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 clarifies and expands upon the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e), \u201cAnalysis to determine if \ndeficiencies exist,\u201d which requires the sponsor to compute availability for minorities and women in its program. The \nexisting \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e) required that sponsors take at least five factors into account when determining whether \ndeficiencies exist. It did not, however, explain how these factors relate to the availability of qualified individuals for \napprenticeship, nor did it indicate how a sponsor should consider or weigh each of these factors when determining \navailability.\n\n \n\n  In short, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 was intended to incorporate elements of the existing process for analyzing race, \nsex, and ethnicity utilization while clarifying and streamlining the process for determining availability and utilization. \nThis was to be accomplished by decreasing the number of data sources sponsors must analyze in determining the \nlabor market composition, clarifying the steps required to do the utilization analysis, and providing clear directions \nfor establishing goals. However, we received a number of comments that the revisions were not clear, and placed \nadditional burden on sponsors to conduct analyses that they historically had not undertaken, but rather were \nperformed with the assistance of Registration Agencies at compliance reviews. As described below, in response to \nthese comments, the Final Rule provides further clarity sought by the commenters and reassigns the burden \nassociated with these analyses so they more closely resemble existing practice.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.5(a): Purpose\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(a) explained that the purpose of a utilization analysis was \u201cto provide sponsors with a \nmethod for assessing whether possible barriers to apprenticeship exist for particular groups of individuals by \ndetermining whether the race, sex, and ethnicity for apprentices in a sponsor's apprenticeship program is reflective \nof persons available for apprenticeship by race, sex, and ethnicity in the relevant recruitment area.\u201d It further \nexplained that where there was significant disparity between availability and representation in the sponsor's \napprenticeship program, the sponsor was required to establish a utilization goal.\n\n \n\n  The Department received one comment on this paragraph, which asked the Department to define or clarify what it \nmeant by \u201csignificant disparity.\u201d As discussed in reference to \u00a7&thinsp;30.6, a sponsor may use several different \nmethods for calculating underutilization, although the most frequently used are the \u201c80 percent rule,\u201d and the \u201ctwo \nstandard deviation rule.\u201d A finding of underutilization pursuant to either of these methods means that there is a \nsignificant disparity between the sponsor's utilization of that particular group within its apprenticeship workforce and \nthat group's availability in the relevant recruitment area.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.5(b): Analysis of Apprenticeship Program Workforce\n\n \n\n\n\n  The NPRM laid out the first step of the utilization analysis in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b), which required sponsors \nto identify the racial, sex, and ethnic composition of their apprentice workforces. Rather than review the composition \nfor each occupational title represented in a sponsor's apprenticeship program, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) simplified \nthe analysis by only requiring the sponsor to group the occupational titles represented in its registered \napprenticeship program by industry.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters were confused about the extent of the sponsor's workforce that would be included in the \nprogram's workforce analysis. For example, a State Department of Labor questioned whether journeyworkers \nshould be included in the apprentice workforce, and a national union urged the Department to state that entities \noperated by the sponsor under another name should also be covered for purposes of the utilization analysis. For \npurposes of conducting the apprentice program workforce analysis, sponsors should include all active apprentices. \nSponsors should not include apprentices or employees who are not enrolled in the program in question. Unlike laws \ngoverning federal contractors, this Final Rule only regulates sponsors with regard to the administration of its \napprenticeship program; this Rule does not require sponsors to conduct utilization analyses for its non-apprentice \nworkforce.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters, including an SWA and a national union, expressed concern with assessing the racial, sex, \nand ethnic composition of a program by industry, as opposed to by occupation. Some commenters argued that \ngrouping occupations by industry could result in industries that consist of occupations with varying skill level \nrequirements, advancement opportunities, and compensation, and that this grouping could be conducted in an \narbitrary manner. Other commenters were concerned that grouping occupations by industry would make it more \ndifficult to know if female or minority apprentices were being concentrated in lower paying positions within an \nindustry, or in positions with little potential for advancement. One commenter also asserted that the industry-wide \nrequirement conflicts with the directive in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c)(3) that \u201cin determining availability, the sponsor \nmust consider at least the following factors for each occupational title represented in the sponsor's registered \napprenticeship program.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with many of these comments, and therefore the Final Rule requires each sponsor to \ngroup its apprenticeship programs by occupational title, rather than by industry, for purposes of conducting the \nworkforce analysis. This will require the sponsor to identify each occupation within its apprenticeship program \naccording to the methods currently used (either by RAPIDS code or the appropriate six-digit Standard Occupational \nClassification (SOC) or O*NET code&thinsp; (69)  ) and then, for each occupation represented, the sponsor must \nidentify the race, sex, and ethnicity of its apprentices within that occupation. The Department believes that this \napproach will provide a more precise mechanism for assessing the demographic composition of a sponsor's \napprenticeship program, using the most discrete data set, and will allow each sponsor to review its workforce for \nthose issues identified in the comments, such as channeling or the concentration of women and minorities in certain \noccupations that may earn lower wages or have fewer advancement opportunities than other similar occupations. \nThis method will also be more consistent with the methods many sponsors currently employ to evaluate their \nworkforces, thereby making it easier for sponsors to come into compliance with this Final Rule. With regard to the \nlast comment, the inclusion of \u201coccupational title\u201d in the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c)(3) was an inadvertent error; it \nwas intended to be \u201cindustry,\u201d for consistency with the remainder of the utilization analysis. As discussed below, \nhowever, the Final Rule contains a slight revision to the utilization and availability analyses, requiring that they be \ndone according to \u201cmajor occupation group\u201d rather than industry, and so this provision has been changed in the \nFinal Rule to say \u201cmajor occupation group.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule also clarifies the timing for conducting the apprenticeship program workforce analysis. As detailed \nbelow, the Department received many comments from sponsors expressing concern with the potential burden of \nconducting their own availability analysis. In response, the Final Rule incorporates a procedure much more similar \nto the existing one, wherein Registration Agencies actively assist sponsors in conducting their availability analysis \nand setting their utilization goals. Under paragraph (c), therefore, a sponsor will be required to work with the \n\n\n\nRegistration Agency at the time of its regular compliance review to reassess the availability of women and minority \ngroups within its relevant recruitment area and to update its utilization goals, if necessary. Under paragraph (b), \nhowever, each sponsor will retain the responsibility for conducting its workforce analysis pursuant to the steps \ndiscussed above. The Department is adding paragraph 30.5(b)(2) to clarify that each sponsor must conduct a \nworkforce analysis at each regular compliance review, and again if three years have passed without a compliance \nreview.\n\n \n\n  The Department is also clarifying, in new paragraph 30.5(b)(3), when each sponsor will first need to come into \ncompliance with this provision and conduct its initial workforce analysis pursuant to this section. For a sponsor \nregistered with a Registration Agency as of the effective date of this Final Rule it will have up to two years from the \neffective date in which to conduct its initial workforce analysis. As discussed above, this does not require the \nsponsor to conduct an availability analysis, or to set utilization goals. Each sponsor should continue operating under \nits existing goals until its next compliance review. A new sponsor registering after the effective date of this Final \nRule will have two years from the date of its registration in which to complete its first workforce analysis. Following \nthe initial workforce analysis, a covered sponsor will conduct workforce analyses at each regular compliance review \nand once between compliance reviews, no later than three years after the sponsor's most recent compliance \nreview, as mentioned above.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.5(c): Availability Analysis\n\n \n\n  The next step in the utilization analysis, under existing practice and pursuant to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c), was to \ndetermine the availability of qualified individuals by race, sex, and ethnicity. The purpose of the availability analysis, \nas explained in the NPRM, is to establish a benchmark against which the demographic composition of the \nsponsor's apprenticeship program can be compared in order to determine whether barriers to equal opportunity \nmay exist with regard to the sponsor's apprenticeship program. Proposed paragraph \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c) described the \nsteps required to perform an availability analysis, simplifying the process by reducing the number of factors \nsponsors must consider from five to two. The two factors proposed were: (i) The percentage of individuals available \nwith the present or potential capacity for apprenticeship in the sponsor's relevant recruitment area broken down by \nrace, sex, and ethnicity; and (ii) the percentage of the sponsor's employees with the present or potential capacity for \napprenticeship broken down by race, sex, and ethnicity. In addition, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 required that a sponsor \nconsider the availability of qualified individuals for apprenticeship by race, sex, and ethnicity, rather than continue \nthe current approach, which requires the sponsor to analyze availability and utilization for women and then for \nminorities as an aggregate group.\n\n \n\n  The Department received numerous comments on the availability analysis. The majority of comments received \nfrom sponsors expressed confusion over how to conduct an availability analysis and concern that conducting such \nan analysis would be unduly burdensome for sponsors. Many commenters urged the Department to retain current \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(g), which states that the Department shall provide data and information on minority and female labor \nforce characteristics for each Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, rather than placing the burden on sponsors to \nderive this information. Two national unions said its survey of affiliates' apprenticeship programs indicated that the \nprocess of establishing this benchmark is not something in which most sponsors currently engage, and that they \nwere unaware of any data sources that measure abilities and interests. An industry association also sought \nguidance on how the construction industry specifically should be determining availability.\n\n \n\n  As mentioned above, in response to the perception held by many sponsors that conducting an availability analysis \nand setting a utilization goal would be challenging for sponsors to do themselves, the Department is revising \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c) to comport more closely with the current practice wherein Registration Agencies work closely with \neach sponsor at its regular compliance reviews to develop and conduct an availability analysis and to set or \nreassess utilization goals for race, sex, and ethnicity, if necessary. Paragraph 30.5(c)(3) has been revised to clarify \n\n\n\nthat the responsibility for conducting availability analyses will not fall solely to the sponsor, and that the sponsor and \nthe Registration Agency will work together to conduct availability analyses. The Department is also revising \nparagraph 30.5(c)(5) to remove references to specific data sources for use in availability analyses. This was \nincluded in the NPRM in order to help sponsors complete utilization analyses, but the Final Rule instead will follow \nthe existing practice of Registration Agencies taking the lead in performing these analyses. Accordingly, paragraph \n30.5(c)(5) of the Final Rule includes a more general statement that availability \u201cwill be derived from the most current \nand discrete statistical information available.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The Department also notes that, although it is adopting commenters' suggestion that the workforce analysis be \nconducted at the occupation level, the Final Rule requires that availability and utilization analyses be conducted \naccording to major occupation group. A major occupation group, or job family, is a grouping of occupations based \nupon work performed, skills, education, training, and credentials.  (70)  All Standard Occupational Classification \n(SOC) codes are organized into 23 major occupation groups and the first two digits of an O*Net or SOC code \ncorrespond to the appropriate major occupation group.  (71)  As explained in the NPRM, the Department had \nproposed grouping occupations by industry in order to allow sponsors with small numbers of apprentices in each \noccupation to aggregate their apprentices in a way that would provide a more meaningful statistical analysis. The \nDepartment has determined that aggregating by major occupation group serves the same general purpose as \naggregating by industry, but is more consistent with the format used for the occupation-level workforce analysis. \nSponsors and Registration Agencies will more easily be able to group the program's occupations into major \noccupation groups than industries.\n\n \n\n  This system that combines occupation-level workforce review with major occupation group-level utilization \nanalyses will allow each sponsor to review its workforce for barriers or problems at a more discrete level, but to then \nuse a more aggregated data set for purposes of assessing availability (and setting utilization goals, if necessary). \nFurthermore, permitting sponsors to aggregate occupations into major occupation groups would minimize the \nadministrative burden for sponsors and Registration Agencies performing the analyses, particularly for those \nsponsors who have apprenticeship programs in which more than one occupational title is represented. Accordingly, \neach sponsor will organize the occupational titles represented in its apprenticeship program by major occupation \ngroup or job family, and will then compare the racial, sex, and ethnic representations within each of those major \noccupation groups to the representations of those groups available in the relevant recruitment area according to \neach major occupation group. For the many sponsors with only one major occupation group represented in their \nprogram, this may involve performing a single utilization analysis for the entire program.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule adds a paragraph 30.5(c)(6) to establish the schedule for conducting availability analyses. As \nindicated above, this new paragraph makes clear that a sponsor need only conduct an availability analysis in \nconjunction with the Registration Agency at the time of the sponsor's compliance review. A sponsor need not \nconduct separate availability analyses in between compliance reviews. At a sponsor's compliance review, the \nsponsor will work with the Registration Agency to define its relevant recruitment area, and the Registration \nAgency will assist the sponsor in calculating the availability of women and minorities in the relevant recruitment \narea.\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department referred to those individuals who were eligible and available for apprenticeship as \nhaving \u201cpresent or potential capacity for apprenticeship.\u201d This term was drawn from \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e)(5) of the \nexisting regulations. This fact notwithstanding, several commenters were unsure of what it meant to have present or \npotential capacity for apprenticeship, and how they were supposed to identify those available individuals that have \npresent or potential capacity for apprenticeship within the broader labor force. An industry association said the \nrequirement to measure \u201cpotential\u201d capacity should be deleted because an applicant must have immediate capacity \nto enter the program. Relatedly, commenters also sought clarification on how to apply educational or skill \nrequirements when calculating availability. Some commenters noted that, in addition to any educational \n\n\n\nrequirements, an individual's mechanical aptitude, high school transcript, prior work experience, and interest were \nall factors that should be considered in deciding who has \u201cpresent or potential capacity.\u201d A national union also \nasked whether JATCs may exclude persons who fail to meet physical standards in determining potential capacity \nfor apprenticeship. An individual commenter asked if \u201cpotential capacity for apprenticeship\u201d would refer to \napprenticeship programs requiring prior occupational training as a minimum requirement.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters, on the other hand, were concerned that limiting the availability analysis to those individuals \nwho had \u201cpresent or potential capacity\u201d could exclude relevant individuals from the sponsor's availability analysis. \nMany commenters urged the Department to clarify explicitly that apprenticeships are entry-level positions, generally \nrequiring no previous experience or minimal requirements other than being at least 18 years of age and holding a \nhigh school diploma or equivalent and that a particular group's availability figures for apprenticeship programs \nwould largely correspond its representation within the overall civilian labor force in the relevant recruitment area. To \ndo otherwise, these commenters argue, could perpetuate existing underrepresentation of women and people of \ncolor in apprenticeship industries.\n\n \n\n  As discussed above, the Department hopes that its continued involvement in assisting sponsors with performing \nthe availability analysis will help to answer these questions and allay commenters' concerns. Additionally, in \nresponse to the comments received, the Department is replacing the term \u201cindividuals available with the present or \npotential capacity for apprenticeship\u201d with \u201cindividuals who are eligible for enrollment in the apprenticeship \nprogram.\u201d This change makes clear that the availability analysis should focus on those individuals who meet the \nbasic qualifications for the apprenticeship program. However, in following with basic precepts of employment law, \nsponsors may not use basic qualifications or other criteria that have an adverse impact on one or more protected \ngroups unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. This does not mean that every available \nindividual would be accepted into an apprenticeship program, only that any one of those individuals could \npotentially be selected as an apprentice. A sponsor may still refine its applicant pool, through interviews or other \nselection procedures, by determining which individuals would be best suited for an apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  In response to commenters inquiring about the source of data to use for determining availability, we note that this \nmay vary depending on the nature of the apprenticeship, and so the Final Rule states only that current and discrete \ndata shall be used. In some cases, such as in certain entry-level apprenticeships, the best data to determine \neligibility may be the civilian labor force participation rate. Sponsors that apply minimum educational or certification \nrequirements may work with their Registration Agency to further refine the relevant labor pool by calculating the \navailability of those individuals meeting the requirements of that program.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters also sought guidance on how to define their relevant recruitment area. One commenter was \nconfused as to how to draw its relevant recruitment area because it advertises on the internet and could possibly \ndraw applicants from anywhere. Another commenter asserted that the labor market areas cited in the existing rule, \nwhich are based on metro- and micro-politan statistical boundaries and reflect workforce commuting patterns, are \nthe most objective, unbiased, and realistic scope for recruitment. An SWA also explained that some sponsors are \ncorrectional facilities that recruit apprentices solely from inmates assigned to their facility and requested clarification \nthat, in those cases, the \u201crelevant recruitment area\u201d for a correctional program could be limited to the actual facility, \nrather than the surrounding area.\n\n \n\n  The relevant recruitment area is defined in paragraph 30.5(c)(4) as the geographical area from which the sponsor \nusually seeks or reasonably could seek apprentices. A relevant recruitment area is similar to a labor market area, \nbut focuses more on where the sponsor draws apprentices from, rather than where workers reside in surrounding \ngeographic areas. A relevant recruitment area recognizes that individuals may be willing to relocate in order to \nparticipate in an apprenticeship program. So, for instance, if the sponsor regularly advertises and recruits in areas \nthat would require an individual to relocate, that would make the sponsor's relevant recruitment area broader than \ntheir labor market area.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Each sponsor's relevant recruitment area is unique and may depend on how that sponsor chooses to advertise its \napprenticeship program and the distance that past apprentices were willing to travel to attend the apprenticeship \nprogram. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 attempted to offer sponsors greater flexibility in defining this area so long as the \nsponsor justified the scope of its recruitment area and did not draw the relevant recruitment area in such a way as \nto have the effect of excluding individuals based on race, sex, or ethnicity from consideration. A sponsor may \ndetermine that a metro- and micro-politan area, such as those used under the existing regulation, is the best \nrepresentation of its relevant recruitment area. In that case, a sponsor may continue to utilize the availability data \nfor that metro- and micro-politan area.\n\n \n\n  While it is possible that a sponsor could attract an applicant from outside its standard recruitment area, the \nsponsor's availability analysis need only account for those individuals available for apprenticeship who are likely to \nbe reached by the sponsor's recruitment efforts and who are likely able to commute or relocate to the program. For \nthose sponsors advertising on the internet, the advertisement may reach a national or international audience, but \nthe sponsor would need to consider whether individuals from other cities or states are likely to commute from those \nlocations when the sponsor is drawing its relevant recruitment area. Similarly, a correctional facility sponsor that \nonly recruits from within its own inmate population would simply need to explain in its written AAP that the \nrecruitment area is limited to that facility because of the focus and requirements of the apprenticeship program. The \nDepartment will provide technical assistance to sponsors in determining the appropriate relevant recruitment area, \nand sponsors are encouraged to work with their Registration Agency in unique situations.\n\n \n\n  With regards to the second factor in the availability analysis, two commenters took issue with the use of the term \n\u201cemployees\u201d in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c)(3)(ii). An industry association said the requirement to analyze the \nnumbers of current \u201cemployees\u201d does not make sense for program sponsors that do not \u201cemploy\u201d any apprentices. \nThe commenter suggested that perhaps the proposed rule intended to reference minorities and women \n\u201cparticipating\u201d as apprentices, which is not as confusing as use of the term \u201cemployees.\u201d Similarly, a national union \nstated the term \u201cemployee\u201d is inapplicable to JATCs that do not employ apprentices or persons seeking to become \napprentices. The commenter recommended that the Department provide guidance that is germane to joint labor-\nmanagement committees in determining the availability of qualified individuals for apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges that not all sponsors will recruit from within their own workforce, and that the \nsponsor's current employees, or the employees of participating employers, may not be relevant to the sponsor's \navailability. In response to these comments, the Department notes that sponsors may accord the two factors in \ndetermining availability different weights. So, for example, a sponsor that conducts only external recruiting, and \ndoes not accept any of its employees into the apprenticeship program, would not give this factor any weight. On the \nother hand, a sponsor that drew apprentices equally from external sources and from within its own workforce would \nweigh the two factors equally. Additionally, the Final Rule revises this factor to reflect that any employees being \nconsidered in the availability analysis should be those \u201cwho are eligible for enrollment in the apprenticeship \nprogram\u201d rather than who have \u201cthe present and potential capacity for apprenticeship,\u201d for the reasons discussed \nabove.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.5(d): Rate of Utilization\n\n \n\n  Finally, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(d) required each sponsor to establish a utilization goal when the sponsor's \nutilization of women, Hispanics or Latinos, or individuals of a particular racial minority group is \u201cless than would be \nreasonably expected given the availability of such individuals for apprenticeship.\u201d This requirement is largely carried \nover from the existing regulations at \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d)(3) and (4).\n\n \n\n\n\n  Some commenters, including numerous advocacy organizations, urged the Department to clarify that the phrase \n\u201cless than would be reasonably expected\u201d means that the sponsor's utilization of women, Hispanics or Latinos, \nand/or individuals of a particular ethnic or racial minority group is \u201cless than the percentage available for \napprenticeship in the relevant recruitment area.\u201d Another advocacy organization asked the Department to clarify \nthat \u201cutilization\u201d should be understood as a measure of the number of hours worked by women apprentices and \napprentices of color, rather than a measure of the number of women apprentices or apprentices of color accepted \ninto the program. A State Department of Labor requested that the language from the preamble clarifying the \nmethods by which a sponsor can calculate underutilization (e.g., \u201cthe 80 percent rule\u201d) be promulgated as part of \nthe rule.\n\n \n\n  The Department adopts \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(d) largely as proposed, but clarifies that a sponsor's utilization of women, \nHispanics or Latinos, or individuals of a particular racial minority group is \u201cless than would be reasonably expected\u201d \nwhen the utilization falls significantly below that group's availability in the relevant recruitment area. Sponsors are \npermitted to calculate their utilization using any appropriate model, but recognizing that the \u201c80 percent rule,\u201d (i.e., \nwhether actual employment of apprentices, broken down by race, sex, and ethnicity, is less than 80 percent of their \navailability) or the \u201ctwo standard deviations\u201d analysis, (i.e., whether the difference between availability and the \nactual employment of apprentices by race, sex, and ethnicity exceeds the two standard deviations test of statistical \nsignificance) are most commonly employed. The Department declines to include this in the regulatory text, but \nnotes that either of these methods would be considered appropriate under the Final Rule. The Department also \ndeclines to measure utilization in terms of hours, as the availability data used in utilization analyses is recorded in \nterms of individuals, not hours worked, so it is unclear what benchmark a sponsor could use to compare the number \nof hours worked by individuals of particular racial, sex or ethnic groups. Additionally, sponsors are required to make \njob assignments in a non-discriminatory manner.\n\n \n\n  The Department also reiterates that a finding of underutilization does not by itself constitute a violation. However, \nas described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, upon determining that the sponsor is underutilizing a particular racial, sex, or ethnic \ngroup, and setting a utilization goal for that group, the sponsor must engage in targeted outreach, recruitment, and \nretention efforts to attempt to reduce or eliminate any barriers facing the underutilized group.\n\n \n\n  Establishment of Utilization Goals for Race, Sex, and Ethnicity (\u00a7&thinsp;30.6)\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department proposed to move current \u00a7&thinsp;30.6, entitled \u201cExisting lists of eligibles and \npublic notice,\u201d to \u00a7&thinsp;30.10, and insert a new \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 that described the procedures for establishing \nutilization goals. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 would carry over, clarify, and expand upon existing procedures set forth in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(f) of the existing part 30, which required a sponsor to establish goals and timetables based on the \noutcome of the sponsor's analyses of its underutilization of minorities in the aggregate and women. The existing \npart 30 does not provide specific instructions on how to set a goal, and the form of goal that a sponsor is required to \nset depends on the nature of the selection procedure used.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 simplified the goal-setting process by requiring only one type of goal, regardless of the \nselection procedure used, and eliminated references to timetables. It also specified that a sponsor's utilization goal \nfor a particular underutilized group in its apprenticeship program must be at least equal to the availability figure \nderived for that group in the utilization analysis, and only required that goals be set for the individual racial or ethnic \ngroup(s) that the sponsor identified as being underutilized, rather than for minorities in the aggregate. Finally, \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 made clear that quotas are expressly forbidden and that goals may not be used to create \nset-asides or supersede eligibility requirements for apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters, including JATCs, individuals, and SWAs, supported the establishment of goals generally, but \nstated that goals equal to the percentage of available apprentices in some segments of the population is unrealistic, \nparticularly with regards to women in certain industries. Sponsors worried that, despite increased outreach efforts to \n\n\n\nwomen, they would still struggle to meet their goals because women were not applying for positions and suggested \nthat sponsors not be unduly penalized in this situation. There were some commenters, though, that objected to the \nuse of goals entirely, arguing that utilization goals would coerce program sponsors to implement unconstitutional \nhiring quotas and cited to  Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod v. FCC&thinsp;  (72)  for the proposition that the \nimposition of goals encourages employers to grant preferences to applicants based on their race, ethnicity or \ngender.\n\n \n\n  Advocacy groups and individuals, however, wanted to ensure that sponsors made real progress in increasing the \nrepresentation of women and minorities in their apprenticeship programs. An individual commenter suggested that \nthe Department require apprenticeship programs with low numbers of female apprentices to report their utilization \nrate to the Registration Agency and that such programs be audited annually until their numbers rise. Others \nsuggested that sponsors should implement interim goals to ensure steady progress towards accomplishing the \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.6 utilization goal. Several commenters urged the Department to make clear that compliance with the \nAAP requirements will be determined by whether the sponsor has made a good faith effort to meet its goals and \ntimetables. These commenters further stressed that good faith efforts should be judged by whether the sponsor is \nfollowing its AAP and attempting to make it work, including evaluation and changes in the program when necessary \nto increase utilization of minorities.\n\n \n\n  The Department largely adopts proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 in the Final Rule, but amends paragraph (a) to make clear \nthat a utilization goal is set for each major occupation group where underutilization is found and that a sponsor will \nset its utilization goals with the Registration Agency at the time of its regular compliance reviews. These goals will \nstill reflect the availability percentage of the particular racial, sex, or ethnic group in the relevant recruitment area, as \ndescribed in the NPRM. Again, the Registration Agency will assist the sponsor in conducting the availability \nanalysis during the sponsor's compliance review and the goals established under this section will reflect the \navailability percentages as determined in that analysis. While some sponsors may fall short of these goals, the \nDepartment reminds sponsors that their determination that a utilization goal is required constitutes neither a finding \nnor an admission of discrimination, and that a sponsor's compliance will be determined based upon its good faith \nefforts to eliminate impediments to equal employment opportunity and not purely on whether the sponsor has met \nits goals.\n\n \n\n  In response to concerns that these aspirational goals nevertheless have the effect of rigid quotas, the Final Rule, \nas did the NPRM, goes to great lengths to explicitly state that these goals are not and should not be interpreted to \nserve as quotas, and that they do not permit sponsors to create set-asides for specific groups. In response to the \ncomment regarding Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod v. FCC, the Department notes that this Final Rule makes \nmerit selection principles the basis for all employment decisions. This regulation requires both that employment \ndecisions be made in a nondiscriminatory manner and that utilization goals may not be used to supersede merit \nselection or justify a preference being extended to any person on the basis of race, sex, or ethnicity. The clear \ndistinction between this framework and a rigid quota system is further evidenced by the fact that sponsors will not \nbe held liable for any violation of this part simply for failing to meet a utilization goal. By contrast, sponsors explicitly \ncan be held liable for any personnel decisions made on the basis of a protected category, which would include \npreferential treatment in order to meet a goal.\n\n \n\n  The Department also declines to set any specific goals for women and minorities that sponsors must reach, and \nfurther declines to require sponsors to reach tiered or interim goals. If the Registration Agency determines that a \nsponsor is not meeting its goals, the Registration Agency will work with that sponsor to identify potential problem \nareas in the program and devise corrective, action-oriented programs pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.8.\n\n \n\n  Commenters also sought clarification on some aspects of proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6. For example, a State agency \nrequested clarification regarding what it meant to have \u201cjust one type of goal\u201d for an apprenticeship program. To \n\n\n\nclarify, the new requirement that a sponsor only set \u201cone type of goal\u201d means that the sponsor will set the same \ntype of utilization goal for each racial, sex, and ethnic group within its apprenticeship workforce, regardless of the \nway in which the sponsor selects its apprentices. This is in contrast to the existing requirement to set a different \ngoal depending on which selection method the sponsor uses. For selections based on rank from a pool of eligible \napplicants, for instance, sponsors are currently required to establish a percentage goal and timetable for the \nadmission of minority and/or female applicants into the eligibility pool. However, if selections are made from a pool \nof current employees, sponsors are required to establish goals and timetables for actual selection into the \napprenticeship program. The Final Rule will simplify this process, such that the sponsor's goals will simply reflect \nthe utilization of that race, sex, or ethnic group in the sponsor's overall workforce.\n\n \n\n  Finally, the Final Rule slightly revises paragraph (d)(3), which reaffirms that goals do not create \u201cset asides\u201d nor \nare intended to achieve equal results, to more closely conform with similar language in OFCCP's 41 CFR part 60-2 \nregulations.\n\n \n\n  Utilization Goals for Individuals With Disabilities (\u00a7&thinsp;30.7)\n\n \n\n  The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.7 is reserved. In the NPRM, the Department proposed to assign a new section entitled \n\u201cUtilization goals for individuals with disabilities\u201d to \u00a7&thinsp;30.7, which would establish a single, national utilization \ngoal of 7 percent for individuals with disabilities that applies to all sponsors subject to the AAP obligations of this \npart. As with utilization goals for race, sex, and ethnicity, the utilization goals for individuals with disabilities is \ndesigned to establish a benchmark against which the sponsor must measure the representation of individuals with \ndisabilities in the sponsor's apprentice workforce by major occupation group, in order to assess whether any \nbarriers to EEO remain. However, in contrast to the framework set forth for establishing utilization goals for race, \nsex, and ethnicity, the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7 established one goal for every covered sponsor, regardless of the \navailability data in that sponsor's particular relevant recruitment area.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(a): Utilization Goal\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(a) put forth the national utilization goal of 7 percent for individuals with disabilities, derived \nin part from disability data collected as part of the American Community Survey. This goal mirrors that established \nby OFCCP in the affirmative action obligations of its section 503 regulations, which now apply to hundreds of \nthousands of Federal contractor and subcontractor and Federally-assisted contractor and subcontractor \nestablishments. Advocacy organizations generally supported the establishment of this utilization goal and stated \nthat the goal, if met, could result in an additional 26,000 job training opportunities for persons with disabilities. Some \ncommenters sought higher goals or inquiry into other data sources to establish this goal. One advocacy \norganization suggested that the utilization rate should be 16.5 percent, which is equal to the current percentage of \nindividuals with disabilities within the working-age population, or that sponsors should base their goal for individuals \nwith disabilities on demographic statistics of persons with disabilities in their geographic location. Other advocacy \norganizations suggested that the Social Security Administration, the Department of Education, academic \nRehabilitation Research and Training Centers, associations for State workforces, vocational rehabilitation agencies, \nspecial education transition programs, disability advocacy organizations, Independent Living Centers, Career One-\nstop centers, and IDEA-funded parent centers could all be sources of information on the availability of individuals \nwith disabilities in the relevant area. Still other advocacy organizations recommended the Department raise the \nutilization goal by adopting a methodology that utilizes the ADA's broader definition of \u201cdisability,\u201d rather than the \nAmerican Community Survey, which the commenter said uses a more narrow definition of \u201cdisability\u201d than the ADA. \nTo ensure that people who have severe disabilities are not neglected, an advocacy organization recommended that \nthe Department establish an additional sub-goal of 3 percent for individuals with targeted severe disabilities.\n\n \n\n\n\n  A number of JATCs and industry associations, on the other hand, worried that the 7 percent goal was \nunrealistically high because of the physical demands of their apprenticeship programs and because self-\nidentification is voluntary and persons with disabilities are reluctant to identify as disabled. For example, an industry \nassociation stated that this utilization goal would be particularly burdensome for the trucking industry because many \nindividuals with disabilities are prohibited from driving commercial motor vehicles, and a local JATC stated that it \nwould be difficult to place disabled individuals with its partner construction contractors because of their workers \ncompensation insurance providers and the fact that a condition of their disability compensation may preclude them \nfrom working on a construction site. Some of these commenters recommended that the goal be phased in, or \ngradually increased over time. One company recommended that the Department observe each industry for two \nyears and establish better-suited goals. Another commenter expressed concern with the proposed 7 percent \nutilization goal, stating that persons with disabilities are already protected from discrimination by existing Federal \nregulations and expressed doubt that utilization goals are attainable given geographic disparities as well as differing \nabilities and qualifications of those seeking employment. An industry association suggested the Department adopt \nthe same goals as established by the OFCCP under section 503, which applies to Federal contractors and \nsubcontractors. A national JATC commented that the Department should review the goal on an annual basis.\n\n \n\n  As stated in the NPRM, the Department believes that a utilization goal for individuals with disabilities is a vital \nelement that, in conjunction with other requirements of this part, will enable sponsors and Registration Agencies to \nassess the effectiveness of specific affirmative action efforts with respect to individuals with disabilities, and to \nidentify and address specific workplace barriers to apprenticeship. Both the unemployment rate and the percentage \nof working-age individuals with disabilities who are not in the labor force remain significantly higher than that of the \nworking-age population without disabilities. The establishment of a utilization goal for individuals with disabilities is \nnot, by itself, a \u201ccure\u201d for this longstanding problem, but the Department believes that the establishment of this \nutilization goal could create more accountability within a sponsor's organization and provide a much-needed tool to \nhelp ensure that progress toward equal employment opportunity is achieved.\n\n \n\n  The Department explained in great detail in the NPRM the process that OFCCP used when it issued revised \nregulations implementing section 503 and established the same national utilization goal of 7 percent for individuals \nwith disabilities for all covered contractors. OFCCP derived this utilization goal in part from the disability data \ncollected as part of the American Community Survey (ACS). Although the definition of disability used by the ACS is \nnot as broad as that in the ADA and proposed here, and therefore may not capture all of the individuals who would \nbe considered disabled under this Final Rule, the Department has concluded, for reasons discussed extensively in \nthe NPRM, that the ACS is the best source of nationwide disability data available today, and, thus, an appropriate \nstarting place for developing a utilization goal. The Department, therefore, declines to change the goal, or to \nimplement tiered goals that would not be reflective of the availability of individuals with disabilities.\n\n \n\n  OFCCP arrived at the 7 percent figure by starting with the mean disability data for the \u201ccivilian labor force\u201d and the \n\u201ccivilian population\u201d across EEO-1 groups, based on the 2009 ACS data, which resulted in 5.7 percent as a starting \npoint. This figure is the Department's estimate of the percentage of the civilian labor force that has a disability as \ndefined by the ACS. However, the Department acknowledges that this number does not encompass all individuals \nwith disabilities as defined under the broader definition in the ADA, as amended, and this part. Further, this figure \nmost likely underestimates the percent of individuals with disabilities who are eligible for apprenticeship because it \nreflects the percentage of individuals with disabilities who are currently in the labor force with an occupation and \nindividuals need not have an occupation or be in the labor force in order to be eligible for apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  The Department was also concerned that this availability figure did not take into account discouraged workers, or \nthe effects of historical discrimination against individuals with disabilities that has suppressed the representation of \nsuch individuals in the workforce. OFCCP estimated the size of the discouraged worker effect by comparing the \npercent of the civilian population with a disability (per the ACS definition) who identified as having an occupation to \nthe percent of the civilian labor force with a disability who identified as having an occupation. Though not currently \n\n\n\nseeking employment, it might be reasonable to believe that those in the civilian population who identify as having an \noccupation, but who are not currently in the labor force, remained interested in working should job opportunities \nbecome available. Using the 2009 ACS EEO-1 category data, the result of this comparison is 1.7 percent. Adding \nthis figure to the 5.7 percent availability figure above results in the 7.4 percent, which OFCCP rounded to 7 percent. \nOA agrees that this calculation reflects the most accurate availability figure currently available, and therefore adopts \nthe 7 percent utilization goal. Pursuant to proposed 30.7(c), which the Department adopts in this Final Rule, OA will \nreview the goal periodically and update the goal as appropriate.\n\n \n\n  The Department revises paragraph (a), however, to reflect that the utilization goal will apply to each major \noccupation group within a sponsor's apprentice workforce, rather than to each industry, as was proposed in the \nNPRM. This is consistent with the changes adopted for the utilization analyses for race, sex, and ethnicity. The \nreasons for using major occupation groups, rather than industry, in the utilization analysis are addressed in the \ndiscussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c).\n\n \n\n  In response to those commenters who advocated that sponsors should be able to derive their own availability \nfigures for individuals with disabilities within the sponsor's relevant recruitment area, the Department notes that \nreplicating the race, sex, and ethnicity goals framework would not be the most effective approach for the \nestablishment of goals for individuals with disabilities. Sponsors establishing goals for minorities and women \ntypically use the Special EEO Tabulation of census data to assist them. The results of the decennial census can be \ntabulated for hundreds of occupation categories and thousands of geographic areas. However, because the ACS \ndisability data is based on sampling, and because the percentage of that sample who identify as having a disability \nis considerably smaller than the percentage that provide race and gender information, it cannot be broken down into \nas many job titles, or as many geographic areas as the data for race and gender. In addition, the race, sex, and \nethnicity goals framework does not include consideration of discouraged workers in computing availability, a factor \nparticularly important in the context of disability. Accordingly, the Department is retaining the 7 percent national \nutilization goal and declines to allow sponsors to set their own goals based on availability in the relevant recruitment \narea.\n\n \n\n  The Department also declines to adopt a sub-goal at this time. The commenters suggesting a sub-goal did not \nprovide a clear methodology or data source for the identification of a sub-goal target. Moreover, establishing a sub-\ngoal would, in many instances require sponsors to ask for detailed disability-related information, beyond the mere \nexistence of a specific condition, so that the sponsor could determine whether an individual has a \u201csevere\u201d physical \nor mental impairment that is encompassed by the sub-goal. This does not mean that sponsors may not, on their \nown, for affirmative action purposes, establish appropriate mechanisms and goals to encourage the employment of \nindividuals with significant or severe disabilities. However, these regulations do not include such requirements.\n\n \n\n  As stated above, many sponsors were concerned that they would not be able to meet the 7 percent utilization goal \nbecause of the physical demands of their industry. First, the Department notes that the goal only applies to \n\u201cqualified individuals with disabilities,\u201d and the application of a utilization goal does not require or authorize a \nsponsor to hire an individual who is not eligible or qualified for apprenticeship. The objection to adopting a utilization \ngoal at all, however, is based on the flawed notion that individuals with disabilities as a group are incapable of \nworking in these jobs. As stated previously in this preamble, the Department acknowledges that some individuals \nwith certain disabilities may not be able to perform some jobs, but this Final Rule does not require a sponsor to hire \nan individual who cannot perform the essential functions necessary for apprenticeship, or who poses a direct threat \nto the health or safety of the individual or others.\n\n \n\n  Additionally, the goal is not a quota and failure to meet the goal will not, in and of itself, result in any violation or \nenforcement action. The Registration Agency will look at the totality of the sponsor's affirmative action efforts to \ndetermine whether it is in compliance with its affirmative action obligations under this section. As discussed below, if \n\n\n\nthe sponsor has complied with the requirements of this part and no impediments to equal employment opportunity \nexist, then the fact that the sponsor does not meet the goal will not result in a violation.\n\n \n\n  Lastly, some sponsors were concerned that the new utilization goal would be unduly burdensome for sponsors to \ncomply with. A regional JATC commented that forcing sponsors to identify individuals with disabilities, especially \nmental or intellectual disabilities, puts a burden on sponsors if the program must hire a psychiatric professional to \nconduct evaluations.\n\n \n\n  First, the Department notes that all sponsors covered by \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(b) are currently required to maintain an \nAAP and conduct a utilization analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity, so the additional utilization analysis for \nindividuals with disabilities will pose minimal burden, especially because the sponsor is not responsible for setting \nthe utilization goal. Second, the identification of individuals within the apprenticeship workforce that have a disability \nis done through self-identification, and the sponsor should not be attempting to identify individuals with disabilities \nwho do not self-identify. If an apprentice has an obvious visible disability (i.e., someone is blind or missing a limb), a \nsponsor may include that individual as an individual with a disability within its workforce analysis. Otherwise, a \nsponsor should be relying only on self-identification as the method for capturing disability within its apprenticeship \nworkforce. A sponsor should also not be attempting to verify whether an apprentice does, in fact, have a disability. \nFurther detail on how the self-identification mechanism should work is set forth in the discussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.11, \nbelow.\n\n \n\n  To further ease any burden upon sponsors associated with the implementation of the utilization goal for individuals \nwith disabilities, sponsors will have additional time to come into compliance with these provisions. The revised \ncompliance dates are detailed in paragraph 30.7(d)(2), below.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(b): Purpose\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(b) explained that the purpose of the utilization goal for individuals with disabilities was to \nestablish a benchmark against which the sponsor must measure the representation of individuals with disabilities in \nthe sponsor's apprentice workforce and that the goal was to serve as an equal opportunity objective that should be \nattainable by complying with all of the affirmative action requirements of part 30.\n\n \n\n  The Department received no comments on this specific paragraph. The Final Rule changes the reference from \n\u201cindustry\u201d to \u201cmajor occupation group\u201d to be consistent with changes in other sections, and makes other non-\nsubstantive edits so the text of the regulation conforms more closely to the corresponding section of OFCCP's \nsection 503 regulations.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(c): Periodic Review of Goal\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(c) stated that the Administrator of OA would periodically review and update the national \nutilization goal, as appropriate. The Department received one comment on this paragraph from a national JATC that \nexpressed support for a fixed utilization goal but cautioned that because of the untested nature of the proposed 7 \npercent goal the Department should review the goal on an annual basis.\n\n \n\n  The Department declines to adopt a set review period for the goal. This flexibility will enable the Administrator to \nreview the goal whenever it is deemed necessary. Accordingly, the Department adopts paragraph (c) without \nchange.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Paragraph 30.7(d): Utilization Analysis\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d) set out the steps that the sponsor must use to determine whether it has met the \nutilization goal. Similar to the utilization analysis required under \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 for race, sex, and ethnicity, proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d) stated that the sponsor must first conduct a review of its apprenticeship workforce to evaluate the \nrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in the sponsor's apprentice workforce grouped by industry. The \nsponsor identifies the number of apprentices with disabilities based on voluntary self-identification by the individual \napprentices. This figure would then be compared to the 7 percent utilization goal to determine if the sponsor is \nunderutilizing individuals with disabilities. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d)(3) required that the sponsor evaluate its \nutilization of individuals with disabilities in each industry group annually (or every two years, if it meets the \nconditions set forth in the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e)).\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization supported the proposed disability workforce analysis requirements in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d)(2) because it would ensure that individuals with disabilities will be represented in all industries. A \nnumber of commenters, however, opposed the utilization analysis because it would require identifying those \nindividuals within the sponsor's program that had a disability. Many commenters worried about asking applicants \nand apprentices to self-identify as having a disability and were concerned that a lack of self-identification would \nmake it difficult for sponsors to meet the utilization goal. An industry association argued that although the D.C. \nCircuit upheld the OFCCP's adoption of a utilization goal for individuals with disabilities in the case of Associated \nBuilders and Contractors, Inc. v. Shiu,  (73)  the holding in that case did not justify extension of the identical data \ncollection and utilization analysis in the apprenticeship context. Finally, a State Department of Labor sought \nclarification as to when, under proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d)(3), sponsors would be required to evaluate their utilization \nof individuals with disabilities and how that timing related to the timing for review of AAPs established in proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.4(e).\n\n \n\n  Comments expressing specific concerns about asking individuals to self-identify are addressed later in the \npreamble under \u00a7&thinsp;30.11. In response to those commenters who expressed concerns with meeting the goal \nas a result of under-reporting by apprentices with disabilities, the Department concedes the possibility that self-\nreported data regarding disability, as with any demographic data employers maintain, will not be entirely accurate. \nWhile not perfect, the data that will result from the invitation to self-identify will nevertheless provide the sponsor \nand the Department with important information that does not currently exist pertaining to the participation of \nindividuals with disabilities in the sponsor's applicant pools and labor force. This will allow the sponsor and the \nDepartment to better identify and monitor the sponsor's hiring and selection practices with respect to individuals \nwith disabilities, and to more effectively ensure that the benefits of apprenticeship are accessible to individuals with \ndisabilities. The Department again reminds sponsors that failure to meet the utilization goal for individuals with \ndisabilities is not itself a violation of this Final Rule, and so sponsors will not be penalized if they fail to meet the \ngoal because some apprentices with disabilities choose not to self-identify.\n\n \n\n  As was the case for OFCCP in Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. v. Shiu, the Department is concerned \nthat individuals with disabilities have lower participation rates in the workforce and higher unemployment rates than \nthose without disabilities. We therefore seek to advance the employment of qualified individuals with disabilities \nthrough this Final Rule. To do so is well within the Department's authority to \u201cformulate and promote the furtherance \nof labor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices . . .\u201d&thinsp; (74)  In ABC v. Shiu, the court \nupheld the 7 percent national utilization goal established by OFCCP and stated that \u201cthe agency adequately \nexplained why the best available data did not allow it to create a tailored goal and why the uniform goal advances \nits regulatory objective.\u201d&thinsp; (75)  The Department sees no reason to depart from that analysis here.\n\n \n\n  As we did for the workforce analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity (discussed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)), the Department is \nrequiring that each sponsor conduct its apprentice workforce analysis for individuals with disabilities at the \noccupation level and its utilization analysis for individuals with disabilities at the major occupation level. This, again, \n\n\n\nwill allow sponsors to be able to review their workforce at a more granular level, but will only require that utilization \ngoals apply at the major occupation group level.\n\n \n\n  With regard to the timing of the workforce analysis that sponsors must conduct under this section, this should be \nconducted at the same time that a sponsor performs its workforce analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity, pursuant to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b). As explained in revised paragraph 30.7(d)(2)(ii), this process should be performed at each regular \ncompliance review and no later than three years after a sponsor's most recent compliance review. Paragraph \n30.7(d)(2) is revised to reflect this new schedule. Again, this schedule will apply uniformly across covered sponsors \nand will not depend on whether a sponsor has met its utilization goals.\n\n \n\n  Furthermore, as mentioned above, the Department is allowing both existing and new sponsors additional time in \nwhich to implement the apprenticeship workforce analysis requirements for individuals with disabilities. Similar to \nthe compliance dates established in \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, an existing sponsor will have two years from the effective date \nof this Final Rule in which to incorporate the 7 percent utilization goal into its AAP and to conduct a workforce \nanalysis under this section. Paragraph 30.7(d)(2)(iii)(A) is revised to reflect this change.\n\n \n\n  Also, as with the workforce analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity, detailed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b), a sponsor registered \nwith a Registration Agency as of the effective date of this Final Rule will have up to two years from the effective \ndate in which to conduct a conforming workforce analysis for individuals with disabilities, pursuant to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d)(2). This section of the Final Rule also establishes that new sponsors registering after the effective \ndate of this Final Rule will have two years from the date of their registration to complete their written AAP.\n\n \n\n  Generally, the workforce analyses required by \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) and 30.7(d)(2) should be performed \nsimultaneously. Following the initial workforce analysis, all covered sponsors will be required to conduct workforce \nanalyses at each regular compliance review and again if they have gone three years since their last compliance \nreview. The schedule of evaluations is discussed in more detail in paragraph (d)(3), below.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(e): Identification of Problem Areas\n\n \n\n  When the percentage of apprentices with disabilities in one or more industry groups was less than the utilization \ngoal proposed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(a), proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) required that the sponsor take steps to determine \nwhether and where impediments to equal opportunity exist. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) explained that when making \nthis determination, the sponsor must look at the results of its assessment of personnel processes and the \neffectiveness of its outreach and recruitment efforts as required by proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9.\n\n \n\n  The Department received a few comments in regards to paragraph (e). An advocacy organization commented that \nthis type of self-education is important to raising sponsors' attention to the pool of individuals with disabilities that \ncould contribute to and benefit from their apprenticeship program. An industry association suggested that the \nDepartment revisit the requirements of \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) as the proposed rule implied that failure to reach the \nutilization goal for individuals with disabilities meant that there must automatically be a barrier to equal employment. \nThe commenter also requested examples of \u201cimpediments to equal opportunity\u201d and sought guidance on how \nsponsors would be able to identify and measure such impediments. A national JATC was concerned that such a \nreview process would require the assistance of a professional. Another national JATC expressed concern that the \nregulations did not account for the fact that non-attainment of the disability utilization goal does not mean that a \nprogram is discriminatory in its practices; rather, non-attainment could be that disabled individuals did not apply to \nthe program, that they could not meet the requirements of the program, or they were unwilling to self-disclose \ndisabilities.\n\n \n\n\n\n  With the exception of two changes discussed below, the Final Rule adopts \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) as it appeared in the \nNPRM. The Department emphasizes that, if a sponsor is underutilizing individuals with disabilities, it does not mean \nthat a problem area definitely exists or that the cause of the underutilization is discrimination. This finding simply \nserves as a notification to the sponsor that they must review their personnel processes and outreach to determine if \nsuch problem areas do exist. A sponsor is only required to engage in action-oriented programs, pursuant to \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f) and 30.8, if it discovers problem areas during the course of this review. To reflect this \nunderstanding, the regulatory text is changed slightly to read \u201cthe sponsor must take steps to determine whether \nand/or where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist\u201d (emphasis added). As for types of \u201cimpediments \nto equal opportunity,\u201d these would be the same as the \u201cbarriers\u201d described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(a)(2) of this Section-by-\nSection Analysis. The Department also revises this paragraph in the Final Rule to indicate that utilization analyses \nwill be conducted according to major occupation group, rather than industry, consistent with changes in other \nparagraphs.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(f): Action-Oriented Programs\n\n \n\n  In proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f), the NPRM stated that if, in reviewing its personnel processes, the sponsor identifies \nany barriers to equal opportunity, it would be required to undertake action-oriented programs designed to correct \nany problem areas that the sponsor identified. Only if a problem or barrier to equal opportunity is identified must the \nsponsor develop and execute an action-oriented program.\n\n \n\n  The Department received no comments on this paragraph that have not already been addressed elsewhere, and \nso adopts proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f) without change.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(g)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(g) clarified that the sponsor's determination that it has not attained the utilization goal in \none or more industry groups would not constitute either a finding or admission of discrimination in violation of part \n30. The Department noted, however, that such a determination, whether by the sponsor or by the Registration \nAgency, would not impede the Registration Agency from finding that one or more unlawful discriminatory practices \ncaused the sponsor's failure to meet the utilization goal and that, in that circumstance, the Registration Agency \nwould take appropriate enforcement measures.\n\n \n\n  The Department received no comments on this paragraph. Accordingly, the Department is only revising this \nparagraph consistent with other changes throughout this section to clarify that the utilization analysis will be \nperformed according to major occupation group.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.7(h)\n\n \n\n  Finally, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(h) stated that the 7 percent utilization goal must not be used as a quota or ceiling \nthat limits or restricts the employment of individuals with disabilities as apprentices. One commenter argued that the \nproposed 7 percent utilization goal was essentially a national hiring quota for individuals with disabilities. An \nindustry association expressed concern that even though the Department stated that the proposed 7 percent \nutilization rate for persons with disabilities was a \u201cgoal,\u201d program sponsors may feel pressure to meet the goal and \nhire individuals who may not be as qualified as other applicants. A local JATC argued that the proposed disability \nutilization goal would invite claims of reverse discrimination and lawsuits by able-bodied persons who were not \nadmitted to the program because of the inclusion of an applicant with a disability.\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department declines to make any changes to paragraph (h), as these comments are premised on a flawed \nunderstanding of the function of the disability goal. The Department has made clear, both in this paragraph and \nthroughout the preamble, that the goal is not a quota and failure to meet the goal will not, in and of itself, result in \nany violation or enforcement action. Rather, a failure to meet the goal simply triggers a review by the sponsor of its \nemployment practices to determine if impediments to EEO exist. The goal is intended to serve as a management \ntool to help sponsors measure their progress toward achieving equal employment opportunity for individuals with \ndisabilities and does not require disability-based decision making. The Department recognizes that a failure to meet \nthe 7 percent utilization goal does not necessarily mean that the sponsor is discriminating against individuals with \ndisabilities and that there may be other explanations. It is for this reason that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(g) stated that \na sponsor's determination that it has not attained the utilization goal in one or more job groups does not constitute \neither a finding or admission of discrimination in violation of this part. Finally, with regard to the comment fearing \nreverse discrimination actions, we note that the ADA, as amended, prohibits claims of discrimination because of \nan individual's lack of disability, and we interpret this Final Rule consistent with that.  (76) \n\n \n\n  Targeted Outreach, Recruitment, and Retention (\u00a7&thinsp;30.8)\n\n \n\n  The Department proposed to revise the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 entitled \u201cRecords\u201d and to move that language to \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12, as discussed later in the preamble. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 instead replaced the current \nrequirements related to outreach and positive recruitment discussed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c) of the existing regulation by \naddressing the regulatory requirements related to targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention. Under proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.8, when a sponsor is underutilizing a specific group or groups pursuant to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.6, \nand/or when a sponsor determines, pursuant to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f), that there were impediments to equal \nopportunity for individuals with disabilities,  (77)  the sponsor was required to undertake targeted outreach, \nrecruitment, and retention activities likely to generate an increase in applications for apprenticeship and improve \nretention of apprentices from the targeted group or groups and/or from individuals with disabilities as appropriate. \nThese targeted activities would be in addition to the sponsor's universal outreach and recruitment activities required \nunder \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3).\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.8(a): Minimum Activities Required\n\n \n\n  Proposed paragraph \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1) set forth the minimum, specific targeted outreach, recruitment, and \nretention activities that the Department proposed to require of a sponsor that had found underutilization of a \nparticular group or groups pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 and/or who had determined pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f) that \nthere were problem areas with respect to its outreach, recruitment, and retention activities impacting individuals with \ndisabilities. These activities included, but were not limited to: (1) Dissemination of information to community-based \norganizations, local high schools, local community colleges, local vocational, career and technical schools, career \ncenters at minority serving institutions (including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities), and other groups serving the underutilized group; (2) advertising \nopenings for apprenticeship opportunities by publishing advertisements in newspapers and other media, electronic \nor otherwise, that have wide-spread circulation in the relevant recruitment area; (3) cooperating with local school \nboards and vocational education systems to develop and/or establish relationships with pre-apprenticeship \nprograms inclusive of students from the underutilized groups, preparing them to meet the standards and criteria \nrequired to qualify for entry into apprenticeship programs; and (4) establishing linkage agreements enlisting the \nassistance and support of pre-apprenticeship programs, community-based organizations and advocacy \norganizations in recruiting qualified individuals for apprenticeship and in developing pre-apprenticeship programs. In \nthe NPRM, the Department requested comments on whether there were circumstances under which sponsors \nwould have difficulty completing any of these activities.\n\n \n\n  In addition, to foster awareness of the usefulness of a sponsor's outreach, recruitment, and retention activities, \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(2) also required the sponsor to evaluate and document the overall effectiveness of its \n\n\n\noutreach, recruitment, and retention activities after every selection cycle for registering apprentices. This review \nwas designed to allow the sponsor to refine these activities as needed, as set forth in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(3). \nFinally, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(4) required the sponsor to maintain records of its outreach, recruitment, and \nretention activities and any evaluation of these activities.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters supported the outreach, recruitment, and retention requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. Multiple \nadvocacy organizations stated that these minimum steps are among the most effective approaches, are more \neffective and efficient than general outreach, and should be reasonable for every program to undertake. Many \nadvocacy organizations expressed support for the inclusion of linkage agreements between sponsors and groups \nrepresenting underutilized populations given their proven success in increasing participation of underutilized \npopulations. In response to the Department's request for information on how the proposed rule's targeted outreach \nrequirements to organizations that serve individuals with disabilities would impact sponsors, an advocacy \norganization for persons with disabilities stated that it would welcome the opportunity to form relationships with \napprenticeship sponsors.\n\n \n\n  Several commenters, on the other hand, asserted that the requirements in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 would be too \nburdensome for apprenticeship programs. Unions and JATCs stated that the proposed requirements would be a \ndrain on their resources and time. A national JATC said that while disseminating information on job opportunities \nwas not a significant burden, as apprenticeship programs already do so, partnering with other groups would add a \nlot of time and work to the program. The commenter recommended that the current outreach, recruitment, and \nretention requirements under 29 CFR part 30 remain the same because the requirements to formally document its \nrecruitment efforts after every apprenticeship cycle, which are continuously occurring, would create even more \nburdens on their program. A number of JATCs and industry associations expressed concern about the proposed \noutreach, recruitment, and retention requirements and suggested that the \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a) activities should be \nsuggestions, rather than requirements, and that sponsors should be given more flexibility in deciding what activities \nare most effective. An SWA also supported giving sponsors greater flexibility to encourage creative and diverse \nmechanisms to diversify their workforce.\n\n \n\n  The Department retains the four specific activities outlined in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1) in the Final Rule, as \nseveral comments reinforced the Department's belief that these were effective mechanisms for outreach, \nrecruitment, and retention, and that sponsors who discover they are underutilized should be required to use them to \nattempt to correct their underutilization. The Department believes that these minimum requirements provide \nsponsors with enough guidance to be effective in improving their outreach methods, but still leaves sponsors with \nflexibility to decide on other, additional recruitment mechanisms. The Department further believes that the four \nminimum activities outlined in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1) will not be overly burdensome for sponsors. As one sponsor \npointed out, the requirements are largely representative of the kinds of good faith efforts the Department has \nrequired to date for a sponsor to meet its EEO obligations required in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.3 and 30.4 of the current part \n30.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters stressed that retention was a major issue for women because they are often targets for \nisolation, harassment, discrimination, stereotyping, and a lack of training rotation on the job. An advocacy \norganization expressed concern with minority apprenticeship completion rates, stating that, in 2013, 30.3 percent of \nAfrican Americans completed their program in the construction industry in comparison to 46.7 percent of whites. \nSome commenters suggested that the Department create a separate section in the rule to address apprentice \nretention specifically, which should include requirements that apprenticeship program sponsors: (1) Analyze their \napprentice retention rates for women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities; (2) set forth in their written \nAAPs the specific retention activities they plan to take for the upcoming program year, as appropriate; (3) conduct \nexit interviews of each apprentice leaving the sponsor's apprenticeship program prior to completion; and (4) \nimplement policy and professional development practices designed to build staff capacity to support and serve \ntraditionally underrepresented groups. Individual commenters recommended using members of the workforce that \n\n\n\nrepresent the marginalized populations to perform outreach to the particular underrepresented group and \nrecommended that the Department encourage mentoring as a means for increasing retention.\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes the importance of retention activities in building greater diversity within apprenticeship \nprograms, but declines to include these specific suggestions as mandatory. Many of the retention activities \nsuggested by commenters were, in fact, already included in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(b). Furthermore, the \nDepartment anticipates that sponsors will evaluate their program's completion rates as part of their review of \npersonnel processes under \u00a7&thinsp;30.9.\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization also recommended that language be added to \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 to require apprenticeship \nprograms to work with their local workforce development system as a fifth required outreach, recruitment, and \nretention activity because the workforce development system serves individuals that are largely members of \npopulations currently underrepresented in the registered apprenticeship system. Similarly, two State vocational \nrehabilitation (VR) agencies recommended that the Department revise \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a) to specifically refer to State \nVR agencies.\n\n \n\n  The Department notes that, pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)(i), all sponsors are already required to maintain a list \nof current recruitment sources that will generate referrals from all demographic groups within the relevant area, and \nthat these sources could include One-Stop Centers. However, recognizing that the public workforce system can \nplay a key role in linking sponsors to a diverse pool of apprenticeship candidates, \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1)(i) of the Final \nRule includes reference to workforce system partners, including One-Stop Career Centers, as examples of entities \nto which sponsors must disseminate information regarding its apprenticeship program.\n\n \n\n  Two advocacy organizations suggested that the Department add the language \u201cincluding those who serve \nunderrepresented populations\u201d to each of the four requirements detailed in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1) through \n(4). The commenters stated that this language would not create an additional burden to apprenticeship programs \nand would signal the Department's intent to reach these populations, creating opportunities for further engagement \nwith these groups.\n\n \n\n  The Department agrees with these comments that the activities outlined in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1) should focus more \non what type of population these outreach and recruitment efforts are reaching, rather than prescribing the specific \norganizations that sponsors must reach out to. Accordingly, \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1)(i) of the Final Rule is revised to \nfocus on disseminating information to organizations serving the underutilized group regarding the nature of \napprenticeship, requirements for selection for apprenticeship, availability of apprenticeship opportunities, and the \nequal opportunity pledge of the sponsor. The Final Rule further specifies that these organizations may include \ncommunity-based organizations, local high schools, local community colleges, and local vocational, career and \ntechnical schools, thus providing the sponsor with greater flexibility in deciding which organizations will serve as the \nbest partners in reaching out to the specific community in which the sponsor is underutilized.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters identified specific outreach, recruitment, and retention activities that they thought were not \neffective. A JATC stated that the proposed rule's newspaper advertising requirement in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1)(ii) \nwould be a waste of money and suggested that the sponsors be given more flexibility to advertise in media formats \nthat are more affordable and more effective in reaching targeted audiences. An industry association argued that \nregistered apprenticeship programs should be encouraged\u2014not required\u2014to establish partnerships with pre-\napprenticeship programs because this would effectively require apprenticeship programs to establish and operate \ntheir own pre-apprenticeship programs. Many commenters were concerned about what they perceived to be a \nrequirement that sponsors establish pre-apprenticeship programs.\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department agrees that some of these requirements, as written, may be overly prescriptive for sponsors. The \nDepartment is therefore making two additional changes to \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a). First, the Department will remove the \nrequirement that sponsors advertise their apprenticeship opportunities in newspapers, referring instead to \n\u201cappropriate media\u201d which have a wide circulation in the relevant recruitment areas. Second, the Department \nreaffirms, as it did originally in the preamble to the NPRM, that linkage agreements need not be highly formal, \ndetailed arrangements, but rather are intended to be straightforward, dynamic partnerships that can be easily \ntailored to meet sponsors' needs. The Department also emphasizes that nothing in the Final Rule requires a \nsponsor to establish a pre-apprenticeship program; the rule only requires that sponsors leverage existing pre-\napprenticeship programs as sources for recruitment into the sponsors' programs. To make this clear, the \nDepartment is amending \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a)(1)(iv) to read: \u201cEstablishment of linkage agreements or partnerships \nenlisting the assistance and support of pre-apprenticeship programs, community-based organizations, advocacy \norganizations, or other appropriate organizations, in recruiting qualified individuals for apprenticeship\u201d (emphasis \nadded). Amending the \u201cand\u201d to \u201cor\u201d also clarifies that linkage agreements need not be entered into with all of these \norganizations, but with any of the types of organizations that may assist in increasing outreach to underutilized \ngroups.\n\n \n\n  Two national unions and a local JATC urged the Department to clarify whether the ERISA would permit joint labor-\nmanagement programs governed by ERISA to use their resources to support pre-apprenticeship programs, such as \nby funding pre-apprenticeship programs or providing pre-apprenticeship training to the community. This comment \nwas addressed within the larger discussion of how this rule coexists with ERISA fiduciary obligations in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.1, above.\n\n \n\n  A number of commenters also suggested examples of technical assistance that the Registration Agency could \nprovide. For instance, several advocacy organizations recommended that the Department develop a standardized \nbut customizable evaluation tool which would include the criteria that should be used to evaluate the effectiveness \nof such outreach, recruitment, and retention activity, and would allow sponsors to self-document deficiencies and \nself-identify remediation activities. Several advocacy organizations also recommended that the Department \nreference in the Final Rule and/or on its Web site the technical assistance tools and materials that can be used to \nfacilitate sponsors' outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts, including those developed by Women in \nApprenticeship Act (WANTO) grantees.\n\n \n\n  As resources permit, the Department will gather effective tools for compliance assistance and will work to provide \nguidance to sponsors reflecting recommended practices for outreach, recruitment, and retention.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.8(b): Other Activities\n\n \n\n  In addition to the activities required in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(a), as a matter of best practice, proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.8(b) encouraged but did not require sponsors to consider other outreach, recruitment, and retention \nactivities that may assist them in addressing any barriers to equal opportunity in apprenticeship. Such activities \nincluded but were not limited to: (1) Use of journeyworkers and apprentices from the underutilized group or groups \nto assist in the implementation of the sponsor's AAP; (2) use of individuals from the underutilized group or groups to \nserve as mentors and to assist with the sponsor's targeted outreach and recruitment activities; and (3) conducting \nexit interviews of each apprentice leaving the sponsor's apprenticeship program prior to receiving his/her certificate \nof completion to understand better why the apprentice is leaving and to help shape the sponsor's retention \nactivities.\n\n \n\n  Several advocacy organizations recommended that the Department make it mandatory for sponsors to conduct an \nexit interview with each apprentice leaving the program early, rather than an encouraged activity under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.8(b), reasoning that it would help program sponsors better understand the reason for early departure. \n\n\n\nAn advocacy organization also recommended that the Department add direct entry as an encouraged, but not \nrequired, approach to outreach. Further, this commenter suggested that the Department should encourage program \nsponsors to administer their own in-house programs to prepare the members of targeted classes for the program's \nentrance exam. The Department declines to incorporate these activities into the regulatory text. Nonetheless, \nsponsors are once again encouraged to use these, or any other outreach, recruitment, and retention method that it \nfeels will be most useful in increasing the diversity of its program.\n\n \n\n  Finally, some commenters put forth suggestions, or sought clarification, on how parties can work together to \nconduct outreach activities. An industry association recommended that the Department give smaller programs the \noption to pool their outreach efforts and have their efforts be executed by a single entity or a third party. An industry \nassociation stated that, while they do not oppose the proposed four required recruitment activities, association-\nsponsored programs that rely primarily on their employer members to supply apprentices to chapter programs \nshould be entitled to rely on the outreach and recruitment efforts of the actual employers of the apprentices in \nquestion. In such circumstances, this commenter suggested that association program sponsors should be \nexempted from requirements of \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, and/or should be permitted to rely on the affirmative action efforts \nthat their participating employer members have engaged in to establish the necessary outreach and recruitment \nefforts.\n\n \n\n  Sponsors are encouraged to work with each other, with their employers, with outside parties and organizations, \nand with industry groups and consortia, as appropriate, to improve the effectiveness of their outreach and \nrecruitment efforts. Ultimately, however, it will be the sponsor's responsibility to ensure that its program is meeting \nthe standards established in this Final Rule. The Final Rule does not provide for exemptions for joint-programs, and \nthe Department declines to include one, for the reasons discussed in previous sections addressing the joint sponsor \nissue.\n\n \n\n  Review of Personnel Practices (\u00a7&thinsp;30.9)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 required that any sponsor subject to the AAP requirements in this proposed rule (i.e., \nthose with five or more apprentices who are not otherwise exempt) must review its personnel processes on at least \nan annual basis to ensure that it is meeting its obligations under part 30.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.9(a)\n\n \n\n  Several advocacy groups supported the proposed annual personnel processes review requirements under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.9 and recommended that it would be beneficial to involve apprentices and journeyworkers in the \nreview. Another advocacy group supported the proposed proactive review approach in \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 and \nrecommended reviewing affirmative action measures as frequently as monthly during the first year, making the \nresults of such reviews public, and involving community stakeholders in the reviews.\n\n \n\n  In contrast, several commenters disagreed with the annual review requirements. A State Department of Labor \nasserted that the proposed annual review of personnel process may be excessive and costly and could deter the \nopening and expansion of apprenticeship programs. A national JATC stated that although personnel process \nreviews were good business practice, the reviews should not be required every year. Instead, the JATC \nrecommended reviews only in the event that data indicate a deficiency in certain demographics and that the review \nwould be a part of the effort to correct the deficiency. An industry association requested the Department eliminate \nthe requirement that program sponsors review personnel practices every year and instead recommended that \nreviews be conducted on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis or no less than every 3 years. Commenting that sponsors do not \nindenture new participants every year, a State Department of Labor recommended that the Department require \n\n\n\npersonnel process reviews only in advance of recruitment and that sponsors maintain records of these reviews to \nsupply to the Registration Agency upon request.\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department commented that this requirement was a good business practice that many entities \nshould already be conducting themselves to help determine whether they are in compliance with the EEO \nobligations that they have undertaken under current part 30. Indeed, the proposal drew upon provisions in the \nexisting regulations, such as those providing for \u201cperiodic audits of affirmative action programs and activities\u201d set \nforth under current \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c)(10). We disagree with the commenter suggesting that such reviews should \noccur only when a sponsor is underutilized in women or a particular racial/ethnic group. This is because the aim of \nensuring that an apprenticeship program is operating free from discrimination goes beyond the simple numbers of \nindividuals from various protected groups, and discrimination can exist absent a finding of underutilization. For \ninstance, a careful review of personnel policies at the program, industry, and occupational level can uncover \noccupational segregation in which women and/or minorities are more likely to be in lower paying occupations than \nhigher paying occupations, as well as unequal treatment in compensation, work assignments, performance \nappraisals, discipline, the handling of accommodation requests\u2014all of which are important elements of equal \nemployment opportunity that may go largely undetected in utilization analyses. Indeed, the idea that an AAP is \npurely numerical-driven helps to feed the flawed notion that it constitutes \u201cquotas.\u201d The Final Rule is revised to \nclarify that these reviews are required whether or not there is underutilization, and that this review must look at \nprogram, industry, and occupational policies and practices to fully examine whether there are impediments to equal \nemployment opportunity.\n\n \n\n  We understand the concerns of commenters asserting that an annual review may be burdensome and serve to \ndiscourage interest in new entities creating apprenticeship programs, but have concluded that this review is a \nvaluable exercise for sponsors to follow so that they can uncover any barriers to EEO within their programs. One \ncommenter suggested that AAP reviews should include employment practices as well as personnel processes and \nadministration of the program, reasoning that diverse work assignments and rotation among work processes are \ncritical to apprenticeship training. The commenter said that creating record systems to capture actual on-the-job \ntraining and maintaining those records throughout the course of an apprenticeship is necessary to ensure quality \ntraining. The proposed rule (and in turn the Final Rule) incorporated these ideas, listing a number of employment \npractices that would be part of the review in \u00a7&thinsp;30.9, and the recordkeeping requirement of \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 \nrequires retaining information relative to the operation of the apprenticeship program, specifying a number of \nemployment actions relevant to apprenticeship including \u201chours of training provided.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Several commenters requested clarification of the requirements in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 as they would relate to \ngroup sponsors. A national union and a national JATC stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 does not distinguish \nbetween JATCs and employers and, thus, imposes obligations on JATCs that are inapplicable to these programs \nsince they do not employ apprentices or individuals seeking to be apprentices. The commenters stressed that \nbecause JATCs do not promote apprentices or establish wages, only the employers have the ability and obligation \nto address harassment and discrimination affecting recruitment and retention. Specifically, an industry association \nrecommended that the Department remove the requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;30.9(a), reasoning that the requirements \nto review the listed personnel practices would be impossible for joint employer apprenticeship programs in the \nconstruction industry to meet. The commenter stressed that construction apprentice programs provide training to \napprentices who at various times work for different construction employers, all of whom have separate employment \npolicies and procedures. The commenter reasoned that the construction apprentice programs have no ability to \nmonitor employment policies or procedures of each individual employer.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule requires the review of all sponsors. As discussed in several previous sections raising the issue of \nhow the obligations will apply to group sponsors, we recognize that certain personnel actions may be undertaken by \nparticipating employers, rather than the sponsors themselves. In such cases, the reviews may correspond to the \nstructure of the sponsor's program, but in keeping with historical practice and provisions of the existing rules, \n\n\n\nsponsors will need to coordinate with the participating employers in order to ensure that the sponsors are not \ncoordinating apprenticeship programs with employers that are actively discriminating against the apprentices placed \nthere. OA will provide further guidance modeling what an appropriate review will look like under these regulations.\n\n \n\n  An industry association requested clarification on how penalties would be assessed in the event of noncompliance \nwith \u00a7&thinsp;30.9. In particular, the commenter asked whether a penalty would be assessed against the sponsor \nentity or the individual EEO officer designated by the sponsor as \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201caccountable\u201d for overseeing \nand implementing the sponsor's AAP, per proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(1). As has been the case historically, OA's \ninterest is in apprenticeship programs that are successful\u2014in the development of apprentices, employers, and in \nthe promotion of equal employment opportunity. To that end, OA concentrates its resources on providing technical \nassistance so sponsors comply in the first place, and in the event violations occur, having sponsors voluntarily \ncorrect them. The latter part is embodied in the Final Rule's discussion of compliance evaluation findings at \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.13(b), below. However, if sponsors refuse to correct deficiencies identified, OA ultimately may seek to \nderegister the program per \u00a7&thinsp;30.15 of the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Finally, as with previous sections describing AAP obligations, the Final Rule adds a new paragraph to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.9, at 30.9(a)(1), describing when sponsors must come into compliance with the obligations specified \ntherein. In short, those who are already sponsors of registered apprenticeships as of the effective date of this rule \nwill have two years to come into compliance with this section. Sponsors who register apprenticeship programs for \nthe first time after the effective date of the rule will have two years from the date of registration to comply with this \nsection.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.9(b)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 also required a sponsor to retain records of its annual review of personnel practices, and \nto identify any modifications that the sponsor has made or plans to make as a result of this review. A SWA \nrequested clarification on the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9(b) requirement that program sponsors \u201cinclude a description \nof its review.\u201d The commenter stated that the language was unclear as to whether the rule required the sponsor to \ndetail when and how steps were conducted and present its findings, or if the program sponsor was required to \npublish the procedure used for the review. Generally speaking, the memorialization of the review could include both \nof these things, but the focus should be on the former\u2014how, when, and which personnel processes were reviewed, \nas well as any modifications made as a result of this review. As stated above, OA will provide further guidance \nmodeling what an appropriate review would look like under this section, including a model written AAP.\n\n \n\n  Finally, a commenter requested that the Department remove the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.9(b) requirement that \nsponsors include descriptions of these reviews in their written AAPs, reasoning that personnel processes may need \nto be revised frequently and should not be tied to AAP review schedules. Furthermore, the commenter argued that \nthese reviews of personnel processes may be difficult for the Registration Agencies to monitor because there \nwould be little consistency among sponsors as to how they perform the review.\n\n \n\n  As to the first point, we first clarify that not all personnel process revisions need to be retained, but only those \nmade to the program \u201cas a result of its review\u201d required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.9(a), that is, the review for EEO compliance. \nWe note that also this review under \u00a7&thinsp;30.9(a) occurs annually and the schedule for updating the written AAP \nis less frequent, occurring at each compliance evaluation and then again three years later if there has been no \nintervening compliance evaluation. As a matter of best practice, we would expect the sponsor to memorialize any \nchanges made to their personnel practice at the time they are being made, but OA will measure compliance by \nwhether the sponsor has memorialized the changes in its written AAP. While updating the written AAP occurs not \nless than every three years, each update should include the results of the reviews from each year since its last \n\n\n\nwritten AAP. As for the point regarding consistency, as stated above, OA will provide models for what the review \nshould include, which should help to promote some consistency.\n\n \n\n  Selection of Apprentices (\u00a7&thinsp;30.10)\n\n \n\n  Under the existing section covering selection of apprentices, \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, sponsors could select any one of four \nmethods of selecting apprentices: (1) Selection on the basis of rank from pool of eligible applicants; (2) random \nselection from pool of eligible applicants; (3) selection from pool of current employees; or (4) an alternative selection \nmethod which allows the sponsor to select apprentices by means of any other method including its present \nselection method, subject to approval by the Registration Agency. Alternative selection methods could include, for \nexample, the use of interviews as one of the factors to be considered in selecting apprentices, pre-apprenticeship \nprograms, \u201cdirect entry\u201d programs,  (78)  or a combination of two or more selection methods.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.10 (renumbered due to reorganization of this part) sought to simplify the current regulatory \nrequirements related to procedures used by sponsors to select apprentices to adopt any method for selection of \napprentices, provided that the method used: (1) Complies with the UGESP at 41 CFR part 60-3; (2) is uniformly and \nconsistently applied to all applicants for apprenticeship and apprentices; (3) complies with the qualification \nstandards set forth in title I of the ADA; and (4) is facially neutral in terms of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nsexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, and disability. Commenters expressed varying views, \nsome general and some specific, on the proposed revisions.\n\n \n\n  With regard to general comments, a State JATC and an industry association supported the streamlined approach \nfor apprenticeship programs articulated in \u00a7&thinsp;30.10 and stated that the proposed rule would provide greater \nflexibility to apprenticeship programs in their selection methods. The State JATC argued that the current approach \nrequiring program sponsors to utilize one apprenticeship selection process prevents programs from attracting a \nbroader range of applicants because it does not account for factors like geographic location, wherein one selection \nmethod may be suitable for one location, but not another. The JATC reasoned that the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach \ndisrupted the administration of intake practices at their training centers and was ineffective at reaching out to \npotential apprentices. Many commenters further supported the proposed requirement that sponsors' selection \nmethod(s) be facially neutral in terms of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or \nolder), genetic information, and disability (\u00a7&thinsp;30.10(b)(4)), as well as the requirement that sponsors must \nevaluate the impact of their selection procedure(s) on race, sex, and ethnic groups (Hispanic or Latino/non-\nHispanic), but some requested that gender identity, pregnancy, and caregiver status be added to this list. We \ndecline to do so, for reasons previously provided.\n\n \n\n  However, several commenters generally preferred the current requirements relating to selection of apprentices \nbecause they were specific and descriptive, and expressed concern that the proposed regulations were lacking in \nthis regard and would not encourage or enable apprentice selection procedures that are more equitable than the \nprocesses already in use by apprenticeship programs. In addition, several commenters expressed concern that \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.10 would impose a significant burden upon sponsors. An SWA argued that the proposed \nregulations would require expenditure of financial and human capital resources to determine if their selection \nprocedures meet the compliance requirements of UGESP, Title I of the ADA, and EEOC regulations. Another State \nagency expressed concern that the requirement to comply with UGESP regulations may drive away potential \nsponsors who find the administration of the regulation overly burdensome.\n\n \n\n  As to the burden concern connected with familiarization of the UGESP, we note that the existing regulations \nrequired that sponsors follow the procedures set forth in UGESP when they were selecting on the basis of rank \nfrom a pool of eligible applicants or any alternative selection methods using qualification standards.  (79)  The \nproposed regulation was therefore in keeping with the existing regulations in that respect, and thus should not add \n\n\n\nany additional burden.  (80)  Relatedly, with regard to some commenters' preference for previous selection models, \nthe Final Rule does not prevent sponsors from using the same selection devices they've used under the previous \nregulations if they prefer to do so, so long as these selection devices do not discriminate as specified in this part. An \nindustry association recommended language like this in the regulatory text, but given that references to \u201cthe \nprevious edition of CFR 29 part 30\u201d will soon become obsolete, we believe the guidance stated here is sufficient.\n\n \n\n  Numerous commenters recommended that the Department explicitly state that sponsors are permitted and \nencouraged to implement a different selection procedure(s) or extend or reopen selection periods if the initial \nselection procedure or period was not effective in complying with EEO requirements and/or making progress \ntowards affirmative action goals. The proposed rule is broadly worded in order to provide flexibility to sponsors so \nthat they may use the selection method or methods that fit their program, including any of the methods included in \nthe formal rule. Thus clarified, there is no need to add this proposed wording to the rule.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters addressed direct entry programs as a selection procedure. An industry association expressed \nsupport for the proposed rule's mention of direct entry programs as a potential selection processes, commenting \nthat many of its members preferred this method. An advocacy organization also supported the Department's \nexpress allowance of direct entry programs to apprenticeship selection, stating that it was an effective method for \nimproving inclusion of underrepresented groups. In the NPRM and in this preamble, the Department has \nunderscored that the flexible approach in the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.10 would permit sponsors to use direct entry as \na selection method, but does not believe that this approach must be explicitly mentioned in the language of the rule \nabove other methods.\n\n \n\n  One national JATC was concerned that the proposed rule's treatment of direct entry processes as a selection \nprocedure would require them to discontinue using their direct entry program. It argued that direct entry methods \nshould not be treated as selection procedures. The commenter asserted that although the proposed rule recognized \ndirect entry programs as an acceptable selection procedure, the language in the preamble requiring that selection \nmethods apply \u201cto all applicants for apprenticeship and apprentices\u201d would result in apprenticeship programs not \nbeing able to obtain apprentices from any other source. The commenter stressed that its direct entry apprenticeship \nprogram was meant to supplement existing pools of applicants, not to be the sole entry into the apprenticeship \nprogram. In a similar vein, an industry association asked the Department to clarify that pre-apprenticeship programs \nare not required to be an exclusive source of apprentice recruitment, and suggested clarifying language to \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.10(b)(2) to address this. A State JATC stated that with the increasing potential for non-union \napprenticeship programs, union apprenticeship programs should be permitted to employ more than one intake \nmethod to ensure that union apprenticeship programs would survive.\n\n \n\n  We have considered the commenters' points, and have clarified the regulatory text in response. The proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.10(b)(2) stated that \u201c[t]he selection procedure must be uniformly and consistently applied to all \napplicants and apprentices.\u201d One reading of that language is that sponsors must use only one selection procedure; \nthat was not the intent. The intent, as stated in the NPRM preamble, was to allow sponsors flexibility to use one or \nmore selection procedures, and that the selection procedures must be uniformly and consistently applied to those \napplicants within each procedure. To clarify this point, the Department has revised \u201cmethod\u201d and \u201cprocedure\u201d to \ninclude the plural as appropriate throughout this provision. The Department has also revised \u00a7&thinsp;30.10(b)(2) \nby adding \u201cwithin each selection procedure utilized.\u201d\n\n \n\n  A few commenters asked the Department to clarify how sponsors should comply with UGESP requirements. An \nSWA stated that the inclusion of UGESP and ADA regulations leave program sponsors with no clear idea of what is \nacceptable. An industry association echoed these comments and suggested that the Department should clarify that \napprenticeship qualifications derived from the 29 CFR part 29 rules on apprenticeship standards are consistent with \nthe UGESP. A State agency and an industry association stated that the UGESP regulations are complex and \nrequested clarification on how the requirements would be applied to apprenticeship programs. For example, a State \n\n\n\nagency stated that 41 CFR part 60-3 requires validation of selection procedures but the proposed rule did not state \nhow this provision would be applied. The commenter also raised a further question suggesting that the \nimplementation of this requirement to follow the UGSEP procedures could be complicated for group sponsors. The \ncommenter stated that 41 CFR part 60-3 applies to individual employers with Federal contracts, whereas \napprenticeship programs may or may not be individual employers. In particular, this commenter said that in the \nconstruction trade often sponsors are a joint apprenticeship committee or non-joint committee. The commenter \nstated that the apprenticeship program sponsors develop the selection procedures and the apprenticeship \ncompliance review is conducted on the sponsor not the individual employer. Therefore, the commenter asserted \nthat the Department's reference to UGESP must be clarified.\n\n \n\n  As noted above, under the current provisions addressing selection procedures, program sponsors, whether \nindividual or group sponsors, are already required to comply with those regulations under the current part 30. In \naddition, as clarification, the procedures in 41 CFR part 60-3 are not limited to individual employers with Federal \ncontracts; rather they provide a uniform framework to a variety of entities for the proper use of tests and other \nprocedures. Nonetheless, the Department expects to provide guidance to stakeholders in order to facilitate \nimplementation of the new rule.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters also encouraged the Department to provide guidance. An advocacy organization suggested \nthat the Department should issue guidance on best practices in selection procedures. The commenter stated that \nthis guidance should include references to linkages with pre-apprenticeship programs as an eligible pool of workers, \nas well as \u201canalysis of selection procedures, such as relying on interviews or base apprenticeship program selection \non a homogeneous pool of current candidates that can reinforce underrepresentation the regulations seek to \nremedy.\u201d An individual commenter suggested that the Department provide uniform guidelines on employee \nselection using the process that created the Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship's guidance on quality pre-\napprenticeship programs. Numerous commenters recommended that the Department establish guidelines for \nstandardizing direct entry into apprenticeships for graduates of pre-apprenticeship programs that adhere to the \nquality framework to be set out in \u00a7&thinsp;30.2. As stated throughout, the Department anticipates issuing technical \nassistance guidance in advance of the applicable effective and/or compliance dates of this rule, and will give strong \nconsideration to incorporating these specific requests.\n\n \n\n  Numerous advocacy organizations suggested that the regulations should explicitly require that skills requirements, \nincluding strength and/or physical abilities tests or standards that are used to screen and/or rank apprenticeship \ncandidates, must be related to and necessary for the actual on-the-job performance requirements and must meet \nthe requirements listed in the current regulations at \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)(1)(iii). Some of these commenters reasoned \nthat these tests had sometimes been used to exclude certain groups of applicants. In response, the Department \nnotes that the requirements of current \u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)(1)(iii) are carried forward by the requirement that the use of \nthe selection procedure comply with the UGESP in 41 CFR part 60-3, as well as the standard non-discrimination \nobligations set forth in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3.\n\n \n\n  Finally, some advocacy organizations stated that, if a program sponsor wanted to maintain a selection procedure \nthat resulted in an adverse impact to underrepresented groups, it must demonstrate there is no alternate procedure \navailable to meet the business necessity. This comment is already addressed by the rule, as it generally states the \nobligations for employers under the UGESP whose selection procedure(s) have resulted in an adverse impact. The \nDepartment notes that the term \u201cunderrepresented groups\u201d is not necessarily synonymous with \u201cprotected groups,\u201d \nunder the rule, and clarifies that UGESP applies only to race, sex, and ethnic groups.\n\n \n\n  Invitation To Self-Identify as an Individual With a Disability (\u00a7&thinsp;30.11)\n\n \n\n\n\n  The Department proposed to move the language in current \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 entitled \u201cComplaint procedure,\u201d to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.14, and to add a new \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 entitled \u201cInvitation to Self-Identify as an Individual with a \nDisability.\u201d This section of the NPRM proposed to require sponsors required to maintain an AAP to invite applicants \nfor apprenticeship to voluntarily self-identify as an individual with a disability protected by this part at three stages: \n(1) At the time they apply or are considered for apprenticeship; (2) after they are accepted into the apprenticeship \nprogram but before they begin their apprenticeship; and (3) once they are enrolled in the program. Thereafter, \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 required sponsors to remind apprentices yearly that they may voluntarily update their \ndisability status, thereby allowing those who have subsequently become disabled or who did not wish to self-identify \nduring the application and enrollment process to be counted. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 also clarified that sponsors \nwould not be permitted to coerce individuals to self-identify, required that sponsors maintain self-identification \ninformation in a confidential manner, and emphasized sponsors' continuing responsibility to take affirmative action \nwith respect to known disabilities and to refrain from discriminating against individuals with disabilities.\n\n \n\n  The Department received a number of comments regarding the requirement to invite self-identification. Many \ncommenters opposed to the requirement argued that applicants or apprentices would not choose to self-identify and \nthat this would result in inaccurate data. For example, unions worried that apprentices and trainees would be \nreluctant to disclose disabilities, particularly those working in the construction industry where the work often requires \ncertain physical capabilities. These commenters also opposed any penalty that would be applied to sponsors for \nfailing to meet their utilization goal for individuals with disabilities when the failure to reach the goal could be due to \napprentices and applicants choosing not to self-identify. A number of other commenters, including SWAs, also \nquestioned the accuracy of the data produced by self-identification and requested clarification on the proper \ndisability eligibility determination procedures, including how apprentices would know if they have an eligible \ndisability and how sponsors can determine if the individual has an eligible disability. One commenter suggested that \nsponsors be permitted to track and report applicants or apprentices who request and document that they need \naccommodations for a disability, even if they have not voluntarily self-identified.\n\n \n\n  The Department is retaining the requirement to invite self-identification in the Final Rule. We concede the \npossibility that there may be underreporting of individuals with disabilities reporting as such, especially at the \nbeginning when the requirement is new. The Department does not think, however, that this is a sufficient reason to \nremove the requirement to invite self-identification. While not perfect, the data that will result from this requirement \nwill provide, for the first time, some degree of quantitative data regarding the participation of individuals with \ndisabilities in the sponsor's apprenticeship workforce and applicant pools. This, in turn, should allow the sponsor \nand the Department to better identify, monitor, and evaluate the sponsor's recruitment and employment practices \nwith respect to individuals with disabilities. We also believe that the response rate to the invitation to self-identify will \nincrease over time, as people become accustomed to the invitation and workplaces become more welcoming to \nindividuals with disabilities. The use of standardized language issued by the Administrator in the invitation will also \nreassure applicants that the request is routine and executed pursuant to obligations created by OA, and will \nhopefully also increase the response rate. Sponsors should also work to develop an inclusive and welcoming \nculture and provide support for its apprentices and applicants with disabilities. OA will provide technical assistance \nand guidance regarding methods for increasing participation in the self-identification process.\n\n \n\n  Additionally, the standardized invitation language contains information to help individuals know if they have, or \nhad, a disability. Sponsors should accept the identification provided by the individual without seeking to further \nverify the nature of the individual's disability. The standardized language proposed in the NPRM, and adopted in the \nFinal Rule, prescribes a narrow inquiry so as to minimize privacy concerns and the possibility of misuse of disability-\nrelated information. The required invitation asks only for self-identification as to the existence of a \u201cdisability,\u201d not as \nto the general nature or type of disability the individual has, or the nature or severity of any limitations the individual \nhas a result of their disability.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Furthermore, the Department reiterates that failure to meet the utilization goal for individuals with disabilities will \nnot, by itself, result in any violations of this part. Therefore, even if apprentices with disabilities choose not to self-\nidentify, the sponsor would not be subject to any enforcement actions as a result of its underutilization. Again, \nfailure to meet the goals would simply require the sponsor to assess whether impediments to equal opportunity \nexist in its program. If a sponsor discovers that apprentices are refusing to self-identify, the sponsor could note that \nas a possible reason for its underutilization, and also attempt to take steps that would encourage apprentices to feel \nmore comfortable self-identifying. We note that OFCCP has published on its Web site a video explaining why job \napplicants and employees are asked to voluntarily self-identify if they have a disability under Section 503, the \nimportant role that self-identifying plays in ensuring equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities, \nand offering employers the option of disseminating the video to their applicants and employees as guidance to \nincrease self-identification.  (81) \n\n \n\n  With regard to the question of sponsors identifying individuals with disabilities who do not self-identify, the \nDepartment agrees that it is important that the reporting of disability demographic information be as accurate as \npossible. The Department therefore believes that it is appropriate to allow sponsors to identify an individual as \nhaving a disability for the purposes of \u00a7&thinsp;30.7, if the individual does not voluntarily self-identify when: (1) The \ndisability is obvious (e.g., someone is blind or missing a limb) or (2) the disability is known to the sponsor (e.g., an \nindividual says that he or she has a disability or requests reasonable accommodation that is clearly related to a \ndisability). This is consistent with the approach that OFCCP has used for disability identification in its Section 503 \nprogram, as well as the approach used to identifying ethnicity for those who have not disclosed under its Executive \nOrder 11246 program.  (82)  The Department believes that this approach strikes the appropriate balance between \nthe privacy concerns of those with disabilities and the need for reporting information to be as accurate as possible. \nSponsors may not guess or speculate when identifying an individual as having a disability. Nor may they assume \nthat an individual has a disability because he or she \u201clooks sickly\u201d or behaves in an unusual way. As one \ncommenter suggested, a sponsor may also include individuals who request reasonable accommodations as \nindividuals with disabilities, even if those individuals choose not to self-identify.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters, including JATCs and a local union, asserted that the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 requirements \nwould place additional human resources, reporting, and cost burdens on apprenticeship programs and would delay \nthe processing of applications. A State agency recommended that the Department should not require program \nsponsors to request that individuals self-identify for one year and that the Department should take additional time to \nwork through an implementation strategy for the new requirements. The commenter also stated that additional \nguidance and technical assistance would be necessary prior to sponsors implementing the requirements in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.11.\n\n \n\n  To ease the burden on sponsors in implementing this provision, the Department is giving sponsors more time to \ncome into compliance with this provision, as detailed below in new paragraph 30.11(h). The Department will provide \ntechnical assistance to sponsors during the transition time. As discussed above, the Department is also prescribing \nthe language that sponsors must use when inviting apprentices or applicants to self-identify. Sponsors, therefore, \nwill not need to spend time creating their own self-identification language. The Department also notes that \napplication processing need not be significantly slowed as a result of including the self-identification invitation form. \nAs the Final Rule states that the invitation must be detachable from the application for apprenticeship, the \napplicant's self-identification form can be reviewed for data analysis purposes at a later time and need not be \nreviewed in conjunction with the application for apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(a): Pre-Offer\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(a) required the sponsor to invite each applicant to voluntarily self-identify as an \nindividual with a disability at the time they apply for or are considered for apprenticeship. Proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.11(a) further explained that the invitation may be included with the application materials, but must be \n\n\n\nseparable or detachable from the application for apprenticeship and that the sponsor was required to use the \nlanguage prescribed by the Administrator, pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(b).\n\n \n\n  Multiple commenters expressed concern with the pre-offer invitation, claiming that it conflicted with the ADA and \nits implementing regulations. One commenter requested that the term \u201cvoluntarily\u201d be inserted prior to \u201cinform the \nsponsor,\u201d as is currently the case under Section 30.11(1)(c). A Member of Congress asserted that, despite the \nEEOC's position that invitations to self-identify as part of an AAP would not violate the ADA, individuals could still \npursue litigation against employers under the ADA. A number of commenters, including a company and a State \nagency, remarked that inquiring about an individual's disability status, particularly at the pre-offer stage, could \nconflict with state law as well. An industry association asked how a person's status as an individual with a disability \ncan be used for affirmative action purposes if it cannot be used by hiring managers in the decision-making process.\n\n \n\n  As detailed in the NPRM, the requirement to give applicants and employees the opportunity to self-identify is \nconsistent with the ADA. Although the ADA generally prohibits inquiries about disability prior to an offer of \nemployment, it does not prohibit the collection of this information by a sponsor in furtherance of its part 30 \naffirmative action obligation to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship for qualified individuals with disabilities. \nThe EEOC's regulations implementing the ADA state that the ADA \u201cdoes not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, \nand procedures of any Federal law . . . that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with \ndisabilities\u201d than does the ADA.  (83)  The OA part 30 rule is one such law. In the course of OFCCP's Section 503 \nrulemaking, counsel for the EEOC provided a letter stating that OFCCP's pre-offer self-identification process, which \nis functionally identical to that included in this Final Rule, was permissible under the ADA. That interpretation would \napply with equal power to this Rule. Accordingly, the Department adopts \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(a) as proposed.\n\n \n\n  With regard to the concern that, notwithstanding the legality of this provision, sponsors may face increased \ndiscrimination complaints as a result, we do not believe this will present a significant obstacle. While knowledge of \nthe existence of a disability, like knowledge of a person's race, ethnicity, or gender, is a component of an intentional \ndiscrimination claim, to find intentional discrimination it must be proven not only that the sponsor knew that a \nperson had a disability but that the sponsor treated the person less favorably because of his or her disability.  (84)  \nWe note, moreover, that sponsors have long had knowledge of the disabilities of applicants who have visible \ndisabilities, such as blindness, deafness, or paraplegia, but that the Department has had no means of knowing that \nsuch individuals were present in the applicant pool or their experience in the application and selection process. \nRequiring sponsors to invite pre-offer self-identification will help fill this void.\n\n \n\n  The Department points out that, generally, self-identification information should not be provided to interviewing, \ntesting, or hiring officials, as it is confidential information that must be kept separate from regular personnel records. \nThis will help ensure that these officials do not, in fact, have knowledge of which applicants have chosen to self-\nidentify as having a disability. In response to the question regarding how self-identification information can be used \nfor affirmative action purposes if hiring managers cannot use it in the decision-making process, this fundamentally \nmisunderstands the purpose of the data collection. The regulations make clear that selection officials should never \nbase their employment decisions on a protected basis, including an individual's disability status. The purpose of the \nself-identification and utilization goal is to collect data that will enable the sponsor to assess whether barriers to \napprenticeship exist for individuals with disabilities, e.g., a decreasing rate of applications from individuals with \ndisabilities over the years may suggest that further or different outreach and recruitment efforts should be \nconducted; it is not designed to encourage sponsors to select individuals based on their disability status.\n\n \n\n  As mentioned above, some commenters claimed that the requirement to invite self-identification could conflict with \nstate laws, but did not indicate any specific provisions of state law that would be problematic. The Department notes \nthat OFCCP's regulations implementing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act also require contractors to invite \nemployees and applicants to self-identify as individuals with disabilities, and no contractor has yet raised the issue \nof a conflicting state law provision. Furthermore, to the extent that any provision of state law did conflict with these \n\n\n\nregulations, the Final Rule would preempt the state law provision, and would not serve as a defense for failing to \ncomply with this Part.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(a)(2) required that the sponsor invite applicants to self-identify \u201cusing the language and \nmanner prescribed by the Administrator and published on the OA Web site.\u201d The Department sought comments on \nthe specific language OA proposed to prescribe that the sponsor use when inviting applicants to self-identify at the \npre-offer stage. That language was as follows:\n\n \n\n  1. Why are you being asked to complete this form? Because we are a sponsor of a registered apprenticeship \nprogram and participate in the National Registered Apprenticeship System that is regulated by the U.S. Department \nof Labor, we must reach out to, enroll, and provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities. [42] To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if \nyou ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are \napplying for apprenticeship, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n \n\n  If you already are an apprentice within our registered apprenticeship program, your answer will not be used \nagainst you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our \napprentices at the time of enrollment, and then remind them yearly, that they may update their information. You \nmay voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not \nidentify as having a disability earlier.\n\n \n\n  2. How do I know if I have a disability? You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental \nimpairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of \nsuch an impairment or medical condition.\n\n \n\n  Disabilities include, but are not limited to: Blindness, deafness, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, autism, cerebral palsy, \nHIV/AIDS, schizophrenia, muscular dystrophy, bipolar disorder, major depression, multiple sclerosis (MS), missing \nlimbs or partially missing limbs, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder, impairments \nrequiring the use of a wheelchair, intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation).\n\n \n\n  Please check one of the boxes below:\n\n \n\n  \u00e2  YES, I HAVE A DISABILITY (or previously had a disability)\n\n \n\n  \u00e2  NO, I DON'T HAVE A DISABILITY\n\n \n\n  \u00e2  I DON'T WISH TO ANSWER\n\n \n\n  Your name:\n\n \n\n  Date:\n\n \n\n  Many advocacy organizations supported the proposed language regarding the invitation to self-identify because it \nmirrored OFCCP language used for Federal contractors in the regulations implementing Section 503 of the \nRehabilitation Act. Some recommended, however, that the instructions for defining a disability should be clearer \n\n\n\nand broader. A state agency also expressed concern that the sponsor may be a committee, rather than an \nindividual employer and that, in that case, the committee may not be the entity extending the bona fide job offer.\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that the invitation language proposed in the NPRM is sufficiently clear to enable \nindividuals to decide whether or not they have a disability. Additionally, the language states that \u201cDisabilities \ninclude, but are not limited to . . .,\u201d indicating that conditions other than those listed on the invitation may qualify as a \ndisability. Furthermore, this language is consistent with that used in other Department programs. As stated before, \nthe Department thus adopts the proposed language without change and will make this invitation form available to \nsponsors. With regard to the question of sponsor structure, as addressed in previous sections where the issue has \narisen, sponsors have historically entered into apprenticeship agreements with participating employers that have \nincluded provisions that the parties will coordinate to satisfy the obligations of part 30, and we expect this practice to \ncontinue. Sponsors should be extending the invitation to self-identify at the point at which apprentices are accepted \ninto the apprenticeship program, even if sponsors are not the ones that would extend ultimate offers of employment \nto apprentices. For sponsors that are not responsible for selecting the apprentices that participate in this program, \nthe sponsor would need to ensure that its participating employers invited apprentices and applicants for \napprenticeship to self-identify at the time the employer reviews and selects the applicant. Sponsors would then be \nunder a continuing duty to remind apprentices that they also have the opportunity to submit their self-identification \nto the sponsor.\n\n \n\n  Lastly, the reference to inviting self-identification as part of a sponsor's \u201cgeneral duty to engage in affirmative \naction\u201d is amended to clarify that the requirement to invite apprentices and applicants to self-identify only applies to \nsponsors that are required to maintain an AAP, and that inviting self-identification is part of their AAP requirements. \nInviting self-identification is not required as part of the sponsor's general duty to engage in affirmative action \npursuant to 30.3(b), and sponsors that do not maintain an AAP should not invite apprentices to self-identify as \nindividuals with disabilities.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(b): Post Offer\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(b)(1) required that the sponsor invite applicants, after acceptance into the \napprenticeship program, but before they begin their apprenticeship, to voluntarily self-identify as individuals with \ndisabilities. This post-offer invitation to self-identify is in addition to the invitation at the pre-offer stage, so that \nindividuals with hidden disabilities who fear potential discrimination if their disability is revealed prior to being \naccepted into the program will, nevertheless, have the opportunity to provide this valuable data. Proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.11(b)(2) again required that the sponsor invite self-identification using the language and manner \nprescribed by the Administrator and published on the OA Web site.\n\n \n\n  The Department did not receive any specific comments on this paragraph that were not already discussed. The \nDepartment therefore adopts proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(b) as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(c): Apprentices\n\n \n\n  In addition to the pre- and post-offer invitations to self-identify, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(c) required that the \nsponsor invite each of its apprentices to voluntarily self-identify as an individual with a disability at the time the \nsponsor becomes subject to the requirements of part 30 and then remind apprentices yearly that they may update \ntheir disability status at any time. Allowing apprentices enrolled in a registered apprenticeship program to update \ntheir status will ensure that the sponsor has the most accurate data possible.\n\n \n\n\n\n  While some commenters supported the requirement to remind apprentices that they can update their disability \nstatus throughout the apprenticeship program, other sponsors questioned whether apprentices would falsely \nidentify as having a disability because they simply do not possess the required skill for the trade and want to \ncomplete the program. These comments appear to misconstrue the proposal and/or the relevant law. At the outset, \nthe Department notes that self-identifying as an individual with a disability does not entitle someone to preferential \nselection\u2014indeed, that is unlawful under the rule\u2014nor does it automatically entitle someone to an accommodation \nto stay in the program. It is a well-established principle of disability law that if the individual is unable to perform the \nessential functions of a position with or without reasonable accommodation, the individual is not entitled to remain \nin that position.\n\n \n\n  The Department is revising paragraph (c) to eliminate the requirement that sponsors must extend an invitation to \nthose in its apprenticeship program \u201ceach time an apprentice is enrolled into an apprenticeship program.\u201d Upon \nreflection, we believe this was largely redundant, given that the one-time invitation to the apprenticeship workforce \nduring the first year of compliance, coupled with the invitation to all those that receive an offer to join the program, \nshould ensure that everyone is provided the self-identification form to complete and return. The one-time self-ID \nsolicitation for existing apprentices is set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of the new rule, and the time for compliance with \nthis one-time self-ID invitation is set forth in new paragraph (h).\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(d)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(d) emphasized that the sponsor is prohibited from compelling or coercing individuals to \nself-identify. A commenter had expressed concern that the proposed rule could cause sponsors to \u201cencourage\u201d or \npressure applicants and apprentices to self-identify in order to meet the utilization goal. The Department adopts \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.11(d) as proposed to make clear that all self-identifications should be submitted on a strictly voluntary \nbasis and that sponsors are not permitted to coerce individuals to self-identify.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(e)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(e) emphasized that all information regarding self-identification as an individual with a \ndisability must be kept confidential and maintained in a data analysis file in accordance with proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.12, and may not be included in an individual's personnel file. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(e) also states \nthat self-identification information must be provided to the Registration Agency upon request and that the \ninformation may only be used in accordance with this part.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters, including various State agencies and JATCs, expressed concerns regarding the interaction \nbetween this provision and the privacy protections afforded by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct (HIPAA). Other commenters stated that the requirement to develop systems to maintain confidentiality and \nsegregate information regarding self-identification from the actual hiring process may disproportionately burden \nsmall sponsors. This commenter suggested that employers would need technical assistance from Registration \nAgencies to comply with the proposed requirement to invite applicants to self-identify a disability.\n\n \n\n  The Department adopts proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(e) without change, and notes that it will provide assistance to \nsponsors in complying with this part. The data analysis file need not be complex, but simply provide a method by \nwhich the sponsor can retain and track self-identification information in the aggregate, rather than as connected to \neach apprentice's personnel file. Maintaining the disability demographic information in a file separate from each \napprentice's personnel file will also make it easier for sponsors to provide the self-identification information to OA \nwhen requested to do so.\n\n\n\n \n\n  In response to the concerns over sharing the self-identification information with the Registration Agency, the \nDepartment notes that HIPAA privacy requirements generally do not apply to employers in their capacity as \nemployers.  (85)  Rather, the privacy standards of HIPAA only apply to covered entities under the statute, which are \ngenerally limited to health plans, health care clearinghouses, health care providers who transmit health information \nin electronic form, and their business associates. The regulations implementing HIPAA also exclude employment \nrecords from the definition of \u201cprotected health information.\u201d&thinsp; (86)  While HIPAA may not apply to this self-\nidentification information, sponsors are obligated, under this part, to maintain this information in a confidential \nmanner. This requirement does not prevent the sponsor from providing this information to the Registration Agency \nwhen requested.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(f)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(f) stated that nothing in this section may relieve the sponsor of its obligation to take \naffirmative action with respect to those applicants and apprentices of whose disability the sponsor has knowledge.\n\n \n\n  Regarding proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(f), an industry association requested that the Department provide further \nclarification of what it means for the sponsor's \u201cobligation to take affirmative action with respect to those applicants \nand apprentices of whose disability the sponsor has knowledge.\u201d The Department included paragraph (f) to remind \nsponsors that they are under a continuing obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation to those individuals \nwith a known disability, even if the individual chooses not to self-identify and even if the individual does not \nspecifically request a reasonable accommodation.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(g)\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(g) clarified that nothing in this proposed section may relieve the sponsor from liability for \ndiscrimination in violation of this part. The Department did not receive any comments on this specific provision, \nand so adopts \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(g) as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.11(h): Compliance Dates\n\n \n\n  As discussed above, in response to those comments expressing concern over the burden associated with \ncomplying with the self-identification requirements of this section, the Department is extending the time in which \nboth current and new sponsors must come into compliance with this section. Paragraph (h) sets a compliance date \ntwo years after the effective date of the Final Rule for current sponsors. This means that the requirement to invite \napprentices and applicants to self-identify will not apply until two years after the effective date of the Final Rule. \nCurrent sponsors will also have up to two years from the effective date in which to invite each of its current \napprentices to voluntarily inform the sponsor whether the apprentice believes that he or she is an individual with a \ndisability. The sponsor would be expected to complete a workforce analysis for individuals with disabilities pursuant \nto \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(d)(2) as soon as it has completed this invitation to current apprentices, as this will provide some \ndata upon which to base the analysis. Subsequent workforce analyses will be based on the pre-offer and post-offer \nself-identification data, as well as any changes to self-identification status that have been made as a result of the \nannual reminder per paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n \n\n  New sponsors will follow a similar timetable, but the two years will be based on the date their program is registered \nrather than the effective date of the rule. During the program's provisional review conducted within one year of \nregistration, the Registration Agency will provide further guidance on the AAP requirements for individuals with \n\n\n\ndisabilities so that when the compliance date arrives the new sponsor is well equipped to take the necessary steps \nto satisfy its obligations.\n\n \n\n  Recordkeeping [\u00a7&thinsp;30.12]\n\n \n\n  Existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 required sponsors to keep records for each applicant, including a summary of the \nqualifications of each applicant, the basis for evaluation and for selection or rejection of each applicant, the records \npertaining to interviews of applicants, the original application for each applicant, and other data. The rule states that \nrecords pertaining to individual applicants, selected or rejected, shall be maintained in such manner as to permit \nidentification of minority and female (minority and nonminority) participants. Sponsors were also required, under the \nexisting regulations, to retain a statement of its AAP required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.4 and review their AAPs annually and \nupdate them where necessary, including the goals and timetables. Sponsors were also required to maintain \nevidence that their qualification standards have been validated in accordance with the requirements set forth in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b), and maintain records for 5 years and make them available upon request to the Department or \nother authorized representative. The NPRM proposed to remove the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 entitled \u201cAdjustments \nin schedule for compliance review or complaint processing\u201d because the information contained within this section \nhas been incorporated into the proposed sections addressing EEO compliance reviews and complaints, and \nreinsert a new section on recordkeeping in its place.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 prescribed the recordkeeping requirements that would apply to registered \napprenticeship program sponsors, and concluded that a sponsor's failure to comply with these requirements would \nconstitute noncompliance with the part 30 regulations. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 retained, in large part, the \nrecordkeeping requirements currently in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, subject to basic editing, and updated them to reflect the \ndevelopment and use of electronic recordkeeping, and the broadened scope of the proposed rule to provide for \nequal opportunity, affirmative action, and nondiscrimination for applicants and apprentices with disabilities.  (87)  \nProposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12, therefore, included a new provision regarding the confidentiality and use of medical \ninformation that is obtained pursuant to part 30, including information regarding whether an applicant or apprentice \nis an individual with a disability.\n\n \n\n  In addition, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 removed the reference to the recordkeeping requirements of State \nApprenticeship Councils. The Department proposed to move these requirements to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18, the \nsection addressing SAAs. This proposed change would ensure that all requirements specific to SAAs can be found \nin one location.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(a): General Obligation\n\n \n\n  Proposed paragraph (a) of Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 required sponsors to collect data and maintain records as the \nRegistration Agency finds necessary to determine whether the sponsor has complied or is complying with the \nrequirements of this part. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(a)(3), in particular, required the sponsor to collect information \nrelative to the operation of the apprenticeship program, including, but not limited to, job assignments in all \ncomponents of the occupation as required under \u00a7&thinsp;29.5(b)(3), promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, \ntermination, rates of pay, other forms of compensation, conditions of work, hours of work, hours of training provided, \nand any other personnel records relevant to EEO complaints filed with the Registration Agency under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.14 or with other enforcement agencies.\n\n \n\n  A national union and a national JATC commented that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(a)(3) includes requirements for a \nsponsor to retain information that is inapplicable to the relationship between a JATC and a registered apprentice, \nincluding information related to promotion, demotion, termination, and layoff. The commenters urged the \n\n\n\nDepartment to revise this section as it applies to JATCs so that only those records that are applicable to the \nrelationship between a JATC and its registered apprentices must be maintained. These commenters said that some \nof the terms that are inapplicable to JATCs may be applicable for programs administered solely by one or more \nemployers since employer-sponsors have direct control over both an apprentice's progression through a program \nand advancement on the job. The commenters suggested that separate recordkeeping requirements for JATCs and \nemployer-sponsors may be necessary to ensure that employer-sponsors retain records that are pertinent to both \nroles.\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes the distinction between group sponsors and their member employers, as well as \nJATC sponsors' concerns about their responsibilities and how their duties to the apprentice are distinct from those \nof employers. However, the information required in \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(a)(3) is important to determining the relative \nsuccess of a sponsor's AAP. The language in \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(a)(3) provides that sponsors must collect and \nmaintain records relative to the operation of the apprenticeship program, and the Department will not require \nsponsors to record information that they do not have access to. The Department anticipates that JATCs will be able \nto collect this information from partner employers. We note that similar recordkeeping obligations were prescribed \nunder the existing regulations and applied to sponsors generally. As has been detailed before, it is common \npractice currently for sponsors and their participating employers to enter into agreements detailing obligations and \nseeking the employers' cooperation in the sponsor's compliance with part 30. We expect that this will continue \nunder this Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  An individual commenter suggested that summary information about gender, ethnicity, and disability status should \nbe available to interested apprentices and journeyworkers in the relevant trade at no cost to them, and sought to \nadd new paragraphs under \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.12(a) and 30.12(f) seeking this data in a format accessible to apprentices \nand journeyworkers. While the information provided on a chart summarizing demographics of apprenticeship \nprograms may be useful, the Department does not feel that creating an additional requirement for apprenticeship \nprograms is necessary at this time. We note further that publication of this data could raise privacy, confidentiality, \nand other legal issues.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(b): Sponsor Identification of Record\n\n \n\n  Proposed 30.12(b) stated that for any record that the sponsor maintains pursuant to the regulation, the sponsor \nmust be able to identify the race, sex, ethnicity, and, when known, the disability status of each apprentice and \nsupply this information upon request to the Registration Agency. When possible, the sponsor should identify the \nrace, sex, ethnicity, and disability status of each applicant and supply this information upon request to the \nRegistration Agency.\n\n \n\n  A State Department of Labor and an industry association expressed concern that current \u00a7&thinsp;29.7(l) appears \nto be inconsistent with proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) in that \u00a7&thinsp;29.7(l) requires a request for demographic data \nwhile proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) requires that sponsors be able to identify this data. The industry association \nrequested clarification about how a program should maintain the information about race, sex, ethnicity, and \ndisability status required in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) in cases where the apprentice refuses to provide the \nrequested information. The industry association said that the \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) language should be amended to \nclarify that the sponsor should be required to make a good faith effort to obtain the described information. A State \nDepartment of Labor similarly requested clarification of \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) to ensure that sponsors must identify the \ndemographics of their apprentices only when it is available.\n\n \n\n  At the outset, we note that sponsors address this issue already, because the existing regulations require them to \nconduct a workforce analysis establishing the race/sex/ethnicity makeup of its apprenticeship program in order to \ndetermine whether they are underutilized. To provide greater guidance on how to do so, the NPRM proposed the \n\n\n\nlanguage in \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b), which is identical to that used in OFCCP's program at 41 CFR 60-1.12(c). This was \npurposeful, in order to set forth similar standards across AAPs to the extent possible, which would likely be more \nfamiliar to those in the employer community. In interpreting its regulation, OFCCP has stated the following:\n\n \n\n  [We have] not mandated a particular method of collecting the information. Self-identification is the most reliable \nmethod and preferred method for compiling information about a person's gender, race and ethnicity. Contractors \nare strongly encouraged to rely on employee self-identification to obtain this information. Visual observation is an \nacceptable method for identifying demographic data, although it may not be reliable in every instance. If self-\nidentification is not feasible, post-employment records or visual observation may be used to obtain this information. \nContractors should not guess or assume the gender, race or ethnicity of an applicant or employee. . . . OFCCP \nwould not hold a contractor responsible for applicant data when the applicant declines to self-identify and there are \nno other acceptable methods of obtaining this information.  (88) \n\n \n\n  OA interprets the NPRM consistent with this interpretation. It does not mandate any particular collection method \nbut notes with favor self-identification, allowing that sponsors may record the data by visual observation if there is a \nfactual basis for doing so. Further, it will not hold sponsors responsible when certain documents cannot be identified \nby protected category if that information has not been provided or cannot otherwise be easily ascertained.\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization urged the Department to amend the language at \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(b) to require programs \nto identify the age of qualified applicants or apprentices so that patterns of age discrimination can be detected. We \ndecline to require this. Generally speaking, data collection is sought in connection with a sponsor's AAP, and the \npart 30 AAP is limited to race, sex, ethnicity, and disability.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(c): Affirmative Action Programs\n\n \n\n  Proposed paragraph 30.12 required that sponsors required to develop and maintain an AAP under \u00a7&thinsp;30.4 \nmust retain that written AAP and documentation of any efforts required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. We note that most \nsections of the regulations comprising the AAP obligations have their own recordkeeping requirements that must be \ncomplied with. However, to ensure a broad overarching recordkeeping obligation, the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(c) is \nrevised to simply state that the AAP recordkeeping obligations applies to each of the component parts of the AAP.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(d): Maintenance of Records\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(d) decreased the amount of time that sponsors are required to keep documentation from \nfive to three years. An SWA suggested that the Department retain the current requirement that sponsors maintain \nrecords for 5 years, reasoning that under the proposal a sponsor that has a 4-year program would have the ability \nto discard an apprenticeship agreement before the apprentice leaves the program. Alternatively, this commenter \nsuggested that the Department revise the requirement to retain records to align with the entire length of the \napprenticeship program, which the commenter said is usually 4 years. An individual commenter recommended that \nthe Department require records be kept for an additional amount of time after an apprentice's term has ended so \nthat data is available for evaluations and tracking a sponsor's progress. The commenter expressed concern that \nrecordkeeping could be disrupted by personnel changes or economic changes within a 3-year span and said that \nthis could lead to incomplete records. In contrast, an industry association remarked that the amount of time \nsponsors are required to retain records should be further reduced to 2 years, reasoning that this would align with \nother labor laws already in place. This commenter also suggested that the rule specify the type of records to be \nretained.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Upon review of the comments, the Department has decided to revert to the existing requirement that records be \nmaintained for 5 years. While the Department sought to decrease the time period for document retention in an effort \nto decrease burden, we believe the concerns raised about a document retention period that is shorter than the \nnormal compliance review cycle, which is approximately 5 years, would be problematic, particularly given that under \nthe Final Rule utilization analyses are to be performed concordant with sponsors' compliance review cycle and with \nsignificant input from the Registration Agency.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(e): Confidentiality and Use of Medical Information\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(e) provided that any information collected that concerns the medical condition or history \nof an applicant or apprentice must be maintained in separate forms and in separate medical files and treated as \nconfidential, and that such information must not be used for any purpose inconsistent with part 30.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters expressed concerns with proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(e). An industry association suggested that \njoint apprenticeship programs will need to develop and implement safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of \nmedical records. An SAA expressed concern that developing systems to maintain confidentiality and segregate \ninformation regarding self-identification from the actual hiring process may disproportionately burden small entities \nor sponsors that do not have highly-developed human resource systems or personnel processes. And several \ncommenters requested further guidance on how to comply with the proposed requirement.\n\n \n\n  We addressed many similar concerns in the discussion of \u00a7&thinsp;30.11, above. As stated there, OA plans to \nprovide guidance materials to sponsors regarding their recordkeeping responsibilities and ensuring the \nconfidentiality of employee records.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters said that there is inconsistent terminology used in part 29 and part 30 to describe \nadvancement of an apprentice through a program. The commenters remarked that the term \u201cprogression\u201d is used in \npart 29 whereas \u201cpromotion\u201d is used in part 30. These commenters also stated that there are discrepancies \nbetween the use of the terms \u201csuspension\u201d and \u201ccancellation\u201d in part 29 and \u201cdemotion\u201d and \u201ctermination\u201d in part 30. \nThe commenters remarked that the term \u201ctransfer\u201d in part 29 means transfer from one program to another instead \nof from one job to another.\n\n \n\n  The Department has reviewed the language and does not believe further clarifying regulatory text is necessary. \nEach of the terms raised above in part 30 has specific significance in the equal employment opportunity context \ndistinguishing them from how they or similar terms are used in part 29. For instance, \u201csuspension\u201d and \n\u201ccancellation\u201d in part 29 refer to actions taken against the apprenticeship program; \u201cdemotion\u201d and \u201ctermination\u201d in \npart 30 are describing personnel actions taken against an apprentice that could potentially be discriminatory if \nbased on a protected basis.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.12(f): Access to Records\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(f) set forth the obligations of sponsors to provide access to records for the purpose of \nconducting compliance reviews and investigations of complaints. We received no comments specific to this section \nnot addressed elsewhere, so we adopt the proposed paragraph as \u00a7&thinsp;30.12(f) in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance Reviews [\u00a7&thinsp;30.13]\n\n \n\n\n\n  The NPRM sought to clarify exactly what is intended by EEO compliance reviews, with more specific \naccountabilities articulated for the sponsor and for the Registration Agency. Thus, the proposed rule provided a \nstand-alone \u00a7&thinsp;30.13 devoted to EEO compliance reviews, as opposed to the existing regulation's \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.9 which addressed compliance reviews of all types. EEO compliance reviews are to be conducted \nalong with overall program performance reviews. There is intended to be uniformity in EEO compliance reviews \nacross Registered Apprenticeship programs and across Registration Agencies. The proposed rule outlined how \ncompliance reviews would be conducted, how sponsors would be notified of compliance review findings, how \nsponsors can come into compliance if there is a finding of a violation, and when enforcement actions may occur.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.13(a): Conduct of Compliance Reviews\n\n \n\n  In paragraph (a), the proposed rule sets forth that the Registration Agency would regularly conduct EEO \ncompliance reviews to determine if the sponsor was in compliance with part 30, and will also conduct EEO \ncompliance reviews when circumstances so warrant. It further detailed the variety of forms compliance reviews \nmight take, including off-site reviews of records, desk audits of records submitted to the Registration Agency, and \non-site reviews at a sponsor's establishment involving document review and interviews with relevant personnel.\n\n \n\n  Commenters expressed concern about what exactly \u201cregularly\u201d means in terms of frequency of conducting reviews \nand/or audits. There are no pre-set timelines for compliance reviews, and the review cycle will vary by the \nRegistration Agency. Historically in states administered by OA, as a general matter reviews have been conducted \napproximately every five years during a program's existence. There is somewhat more variance in states where \napprenticeship is administered by an SAA. One commenter urged OA, once the regulation is adopted, to \ndisseminate a circular detailing the minimum requirements for all EEO compliance reviews and \u201caudits.\u201d OA \ncurrently has a checklist of questions and protocols that can be sent to the sponsor before a compliance review. OA \nwill continue to provide such technical assistance on EEO compliance reviews, but will take the comment under \nadvisement in considering further guidance in the implementation of this rule.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.13(b): Notification of Compliance Review Findings\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule provided that Registration Agencies would provide a Notice of Compliance Review Findings \nwithin 45 days of completing the review. If the review uncovered deficiencies in part 30 compliance, this Notice \nwould identify them, how they could be remedied, the timeframe for doing such remedying, and specifying that \nfailure to do so could result in an enforcement action. The overall intent of this proposed text is that increased \nspecificity would again provide for greater consistency and standardization of procedures across the National \nRegistered Apprenticeship System. We did not receive any specific comments for this provision, so we retain the \nproposed language in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.13(c): Compliance\n\n \n\n  The proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.13(c) set forth the next step in the compliance review process: When a Notice indicated \ndeficiencies in compliance, the requirement that a sponsor must, within 30 business days, implement a compliance \naction plan. This plan included four specific provisions: A commitment to correct the deficiency, a listing of the \nactions that will be taken, how long it will take, and the name of the person responsible. Assuming these steps are \nundertaken, the sponsor would be considered in compliance.\n\n \n\n\n\n  There were a number of comments regarding this paragraph (c) proposed text. An SAA commented that the 30 \nbusiness days for sponsors to develop an effective plan to address EEO compliance deficiencies did not provide \nenough time. This SAA suggested that sponsors should be given 30 business days to submit rebuttal arguments to \nthe Registration Agency, and that the SAA should be given 30 days to respond to the rebuttal argument in writing. \nIf the findings of noncompliance were upheld after the opportunity to contest allegations, this SAA recommended \nthat the sponsor would then have 30 days to submit a remediation plan.\n\n \n\n  In response to these comments, we have modified the Final Rule in two ways. First, the Final Rule states that \nwithin 30 days the sponsor must either implement a compliance action or provide a written response responding to \nthe specific violation(s) cited by the Registration Agency within 30 days. This latter option addresses commenters' \nsuggestions for an opportunity to respond to allegations. If, after reviewing the response, the Registration Agency \nupholds the findings of noncompliance, the sponsor then has 30 days to submit a remediation plan. Second, the \nFinal Rule provides that the 30 day period may be extended for another 30 days by the Registration Agency for \ngood cause shown. We note that this only applies to the original 30 day period; if the sponsor submits a rebuttal \nwhich the Registration Agency then denies, the Rule does not provide for an extension of the resulting 30 day \nperiod to come into compliance.\n\n \n\n  One advocacy organizational commenter suggested that sponsors in need of a compliance action plan should be \nprovided with technical assistance to help rectify the situation: Specifically, a list of reliable technical assistance \nproviders, as well as resources and materials to include in the design, development, and implementation of the \ncompliance action plan (for example, resources developed via the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional \nOccupations program). In particular, for sponsors falling short of EEO goals, this commenter recommended that the \nDOL provide a list of tradeswomen organizations for purposes of technical assistance. This type of technical \nassistance is already a part of Registration Agencies' compliance review process; we will continue to provide this \nassistance, as resources permit, to assist in bringing sponsors into EEO compliance.\n\n \n\n  Several advocacy organizations commented that sponsors found to have deficiencies need more attention and \nresources devoted to rectifying their situations, either through more rigorous EEO obligations or having compliance \nresults published in a national registry for additional visibility. Some commenters went specifically further and \nsuggested that the DOL should require the Registration Agency to evaluate a sponsor's compliance action plan for \neffectiveness \u201cregularly\u201d until the sponsor attains the plan goals. The Department acknowledges the comment, but \ndeclines to add these measures at this time. We believe the enhancements announced in this Final Rule will \nincrease the efficacy of sponsor EEO and affirmative action efforts. Further, the Registration Agency's focus \nhistorically has been on a technical assistance model, helping sponsors succeed and come into compliance \nwherever possible, rather than a more punitive approach. We do note that for programs that will not take corrective \naction to cure violations, the Registration Agency retains the authority to deregister such programs.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters suggested that the Department include completion rates as a factor when evaluating whether a \nsponsor is making a good faith effort to comply with part 30 requirements, reasoning that completion rates are an \nimportant benchmark in assessing economic advancement of groups traditionally underrepresented in registered \napprenticeship programs. As discussed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 above, the Department recognizes the importance of \nretention activities in building greater diversity within apprenticeship programs, and has included some options for \naddressing retention issues in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8(b).\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.13(d): Enforcement Actions\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.13(d) specified that any sponsor that fails to implement its compliance action plan within the \nspecified timeframes may be subject to an enforcement action under proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15. One commenter \n\n\n\nsuggested that the word \u201cmay be subject\u201d be replaced by \u201cmust be subject,\u201d to help underscore the need to enforce \nthe regulation. The Department has reviewed the comment and declines to adopt the suggestion, as it would be \ninconsistent with current practice and eliminate certain flexibilities that may be helpful in a given matter.\n\n \n\n  Complaints [\u00a7&thinsp;30.14]\n\n \n\n  The Department proposed moving the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.14 entitled \u201cReinstatement of program registration\u201d to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.16. In its place, the NPRM proposed a section devoted to complaint processing and handling, \nborrowed in part from the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.11, with additional revisions to improve readability and clarify \nrequirements of program sponsors and Registration Agencies for addressing complaints. For instance, proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.14 incorporated subheadings so that an apprentice or applicant for apprenticeship who wishes to file a \ncomplaint of discrimination under this part with a Registration Agency may easily identify the required \ncomponents. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14 deleted the provisions concerning private review bodies in the current part \n30, at \u00a7&thinsp;30.11(a) and (b). Through feedback received prior to the publication of the NPRM from the SAAs, \nstakeholders at the town hall meetings, and the administration of the National Registered Apprenticeship System, \nthe Department has found that apprenticeship program sponsors generally do not have or use private review \nbodies. Additionally, stakeholders expressed the opinions that such bodies could not objectively evaluate or \nprescribe remedies for complaints of discrimination. Thus, the proposed rule eliminated the use of private review \nbodies.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.14(a): Requirements for Individuals Filing Complaints\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(a)(1) through (3) describe who has standing to file a complaint, the time period for filing \na complaint, and the required contents of the complaint.\n\n \n\n  Relating to the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(a) requirements for individuals filing complaints, a number of comments \nsuggested ways to broaden the procedure for filing complaints in order to increase its potential as an avenue of \nprotecting the rights of apprentices. One commenter made the suggestion to allow journeyworkers or higher status \nworkers to file complaints on behalf of apprentices, as it was believed that apprentices are not well positioned in the \nworkplace hierarchy to file a complaint without fear of risking their job or personal safety. Similarly, another urged \nthe ability to file anonymous complaints. Many commenters recommended that the Department establish \nopportunities for third party complaints from stakeholder organizations (i.e., pre-apprenticeship programs and other \nreferral agencies) challenging policies or practices that result in exclusionary outcomes for apprentices and provide \nsuggested remedial actions. Finally, a commenter suggested a number of suggested changes to complaint \nprocedures, including required onsite diversity and compliance staff who are able to communicate with apprentices, \ngather feedback, identify areas of concern, and ultimately refer repeat offenders for training or additional \ncounseling; dual-path complaint options so complaints are forwarded to a neutral party (to address situations in \nwhich the Registration Agency may not be perceived as neutral); and expansion of the complaint procedure \nwindow to 300 days (in line with EEOC regulations when a State law prohibits the discrimination on the same \nbasis).\n\n \n\n  The Department recognizes that its primary objective is to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, and wishes to \nhave as robust and effective a complaint procedure in order to effectuate the protections of this part. With regard to \nthird-party complaints, either by higher ranking employees or stakeholder groups, we believe the NPRM already \nprovided such mechanisms. The proposed rule allowed for individual complaints filed \u201cthrough an authorized \nrepresentative;\u201d these parties could satisfy that role. Further, the proposed regulations in \u00a7&thinsp;30.13 provide \nthat the Registration Agency \u201cwill also conduct EEO compliance review when circumstances so warrant.\u201d If the \nRegistration Agency receives specific evidence from a third party that a violation of part 30 has occurred, that \n\n\n\ncould be a circumstance warranting such a compliance review. With regard to the question of anonymous \ncomplaints, the regulations are clear that, at least at some juncture prior to perfecting a complaint, the identity of the \ncomplainant must be made known to the Registration Agency so that it can furnish relief to the appropriate \nperson(s). We finally note that, assuming the sponsor or employer that has discriminated is covered by EEOC's \njurisdiction, apprentices may file complaints directly with the EEOC if they so choose. These entities are required to \npost \u201cEEO is the Law\u201d posters in their workplace which would provide information on how to file complaints with the \nEEOC. To clarify this, we have updated the language in the notice poster to indicate that apprentices may also file \ncomplaints with Federal, state, and local agencies assuming they have jurisdiction to review the sponsor and/or \nemployer.\n\n \n\n  As for the filing period, we agree with the comment and extend the filing period to 300 days. As the commenter \nnotes, this matches the statute of limitations for filing with the EEOC in all but the few \u201cnon-deferral\u201d states that do \nnot have their own State employment discrimination law.\n\n \n\n  In order to further effectuate the complaint process, the Department plans to issue guidance that sponsors can use \nto inform apprentices about their rights and the process for filing complaints in the course of the periodic orientation \nsessions set forth in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(iii).\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule retains \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(a) as proposed with one revision\u2014\u00a7&thinsp;30.14(a)(1) of the Final rule \nspecifically lists retaliation as a basis on which individuals may file complaints. Retaliation was specifically \nprohibited in the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.17, but it was inadvertently omitted as a basis upon which individuals could \nfile complaints.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.14(b): Requirements of Sponsors Relating to Complaints\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(b) requires sponsors to provide notice to all applicants for apprenticeship and \napprentices of their right to file a discrimination complaint with the Registration Agency and the procedures for \ndoing so. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(b) also specifies the required wording for this notice. A sponsor may combine \nthis notice and its equal opportunity pledge in a single posting for the purposes of this proposed section and \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(ii). The Department received no comments specific to this section not addressed \nelsewhere, and thus retains the paragraph in the Final Rule as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.14(c): Requirements of the Registration Agency Relating to Complaints\n\n \n\n  Also, in an effort to ensure consistency in how Registration Agencies process complaints and conduct \ninvestigations, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c) would add uniform procedures that Registration Agencies must follow. \nThese uniform procedures would ensure that the Registration Agency acknowledges and thoroughly investigates \ncomplaints in a timely manner, parties are notified of the Registration Agency's findings, and the Registration \nAgency attempts to resolve complaints quickly through voluntary compliance.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c)(3) provides that a Registration Agency may, at any time, refer a complaint to an \nappropriate EEO enforcement agency. This provision would allow Registration Agencies to safeguard the welfare \nof apprentices by making use of existing Federal and State resources and authority. For example, a Registration \nAgency might refer a complaint to the EEOC if it finds a violation of title VII, the ADA, or the ADEA, but does not \nthink it could achieve a complete remedy for the complainant through voluntary compliance procedures or \nenforcement action under proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c)(4) would allow an SAA to adopt different complaint procedures, but only if it submits \nthe proposed procedures to OA and receives OA's approval. This provision would codify the Department's current \npractice and would be consistent with \u00a7&thinsp;29.12(f) of this title.\n\n \n\n  An SWA requested clarification as to whether the failure of SAAs to meet deadlines under \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c)(1) for \nconducting and reporting an investigation would lead to the sponsor being absolved. The commenter expressed \nconcern that some complaints are impossible to analyze or resolve in the mandated time frame. Regarding the \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c)(2) directive that, when a complaint investigation indicates a violation of \nnondiscrimination requirements, a \u201cRegistration Agency must resolve the matter quickly and informally whenever \npossible,\u201d this commenter requested clarification as to what it would mean to resolve a complaint informally. The \nDepartment agrees with this comment, noting that some complaints, depending on the facts and various other \ncircumstances, may take longer to complete than the time proposed in the NPRM. Accordingly, paragraph 30.14(c) \nis revised to redact the specific timetables for Registration Agency completion of the various steps, and instead \nincludes language similar to that suggested by the commenter that Registration Agencies will conduct its \ninvestigation as expeditiously as possible. Additionally, the Final Rule revises 30.14(c)(2) to state that Registration \nAgencies \u201cshould\u201d attempt to resolve matters \u201cat the Registration Agency level\u201d and quickly whenever \n\u201cappropriate,\u201d rather than \u201cmust\u201d resolve them \u201cinformally\u201d and when \u201cpossible,\u201d respectively. This is meant to \ncommunicate three things: First, that informal resolution of some matters, such as those raising particularly \negregious violations, may not be appropriate; second, that the term \u201cinformally\u201d can be interpreted in ways other \nthan intended, which was to signify before referral to a federal or state equal opportunity agency; and third, for \nthose matters where Registration Agency-level resolution may be appropriate, a quick resolution is desirable but \nnot at the expense of arriving at one that effectively addresses the underlying problem. Toward that end, \nRegistration Agencies should pursue resolutions that not only attempt to remedy the individual complainant, but \nthose that include broader programmatic relief\u2014such as trainings, information sessions, or other modifications to \npersonnel policies and practices\u2014that would prevent the issue from recurring when appropriate.\n\n \n\n  A State Department of Labor expressed support for allowing Registration Agencies to maintain complaint review \nprocedures that are already in place. This Registration Agency said that it currently requires discrimination \ncomplaints be referred for review by the State Division of Human Rights or a private review body established by a \nsponsor, and requested clarification as to whether or not it could continue to do so by having its complaint review \nprocedure approved by the Administrator if it is not already permitted by the proposed rule at \u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c)(3) \nwithout such approval. More broadly, this commenter remarked that the expertise in anti-discrimination laws and \nregulations necessary for ensuring compliance with the \u00a7&thinsp;30.3 requirements is beyond the scope of a \nRegistration Agency's role. The agency suggested that States should defer to EEO experts and provide assistance \nas a referral body to the proper regulating agency. In addition, the commenter warned that requiring Registration \nAgencies to assume responsibility for enforcement of laws and regulations already enforced by other entities would \nbe duplicative and not cost-effective. This commenter recommended that the Department clarify or revise the \nregulation to permit complaints of discrimination filed with a Registration Agency to be referred to the proper \noversight agency with jurisdiction over the complaint area.\n\n \n\n  To address these issues, the Final Rule builds in flexibility to adopt complaint review procedures for \ndiscrimination complaints, provided that they are approved by the Administrator, and the rule also allows the \nRegistration Agency the discretion to refer matters to other agencies, including the EEOC or State Fair \nEmployment Practices Agency, that may be more appropriate for a given case. Accordingly, we believe the rule \noffers sufficient flexibility as proposed and we retain it as written in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Finally, an individual commenter recommended that each apprenticeship Registration Agency should have a \ndesignated contact person to handle discrimination complaints related to hiring and training, asserting that this is a \nnormal function in other education and employment entities. We note that the NPRM included a requirement that \nthe notice of rights \u201cmust include the address, phone number, and other contact information for the Registration \nAgency that will receive and investigate complaints filed under this part,\u201d and this is retained in the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  Enforcement Actions [\u00a7&thinsp;30.15]\n\n \n\n  The Department proposed to revise current \u00a7&thinsp;30.15 entitled \u201cState Apprenticeship Councils\u201d by moving that \nlanguage to \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 and incorporating provisions similar to those in the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.13, entitled \n\u201cSanctions,\u201d into the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15. The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.13 stated that when the Department has \nreasonable cause to believe that an apprenticeship program is not operating in accordance with part 30, and where \nthe sponsor fails to voluntarily take corrective action, the Department will initiate deregistration proceedings or refer \nthe matter to the EEOC or the United States Attorney General with a recommendation for initiation of a court action. \nThe rest of the section describes the procedures for deregistration proceedings.\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department proposed to change the title of \u00a7&thinsp;30.15, to \u201cEnforcement actions,\u201d in order to \ndemonstrate the Department's emphasis on enforcing regulations governing discrimination in apprenticeship. \nSecond, we proposed to replace \u201cDepartment,\u201d as used throughout this section, with the term \u201cRegistration \nAgency\u201d to clarify that both the Department (more specifically, OA) and SAAs have the authority to take \nenforcement action against a non-complying sponsor. Third, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(b) introduced a new \nenforcement procedure in which a Registration Agency would suspend registration of new apprentices until the \nsponsor has achieved compliance with part 30 through the completion of a compliance action plan or until a final \norder is issued in formal deregistration proceedings. Suspension pursuant to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(b) was \nintended as a temporary, remedial measure to spur return to compliance with the proposed part 30 regulations; it \nwas not intended to be punitive. If a sponsor had not taken the necessary corrective action within 30 days of \nreceiving notice of suspension, the Registration Agency would initiate de-registration proceedings as provided in \npart 29. Fourth, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(c) would adopt the deregistration procedures of \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;29.8(b)(5) \nthrough (8) of this title, including the hearing procedures in \u00a7&thinsp;29.10, for consistency and simplicity. And \nfinally, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(d) would authorize Registration Agencies to refer a matter involving a potential \nviolation of equal opportunity laws to appropriate Federal or State EEO agencies.\n\n \n\n  Many commenters were concerned about punitive actions being taken against sponsors without the Registration \nAgency having explicitly defined criteria about how the judgment would be made or laying out the exact penalty \nstructure. The continuum of technical assistance to punitive action was a source of concern and confusion for at \nleast one commenter.\n\n \n\n  There were a significant number of comments regarding the Registration Agency's ability to \u201csuspend the \nsponsor's right to register new apprentices\u201d in \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(b). Construction industry related entities (union and \nnon-union) were particularly interested in this text. Although there was some commenter support for the \u201cproposal to \nallow temporary suspension rather than program cancellations in the event of a violation,\u201d other commenters \nexpressed concern that the language could result in \u201cdamage\u201d to Registered Apprenticeship training programs \nbecause of the Registration Agency suspension ability. Due process concerns, particularly related to apprentice \nsuspension, were raised by a number of commenters. For example, some national unions noted that this proposed \nsanction is inconsistent with part 29, which only mentions deregistration as a sanction, not suspension of \napprentices. Union commenters wanted to make clear that due process rights, including notice, hearing, and a \nwritten decision by the Secretary of Labor, must be afforded to a sponsor. There was also concern that the proposal \ncontained \u201cno durational limit\u201d on the suspensions, with a commenter conclusion that \u201cadoption of administrative \nhearing procedures such as those used in deregistration would address the issues discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n  As stated at the outset, the option of suspending a sponsor's right to register new apprentices was not intended as \na punitive measure, but rather as an intermediate step that Registration Agencies could take in an attempt to \npersuade sponsors to remedy violations of part 30 before taking the ultimate action to deregister the program. The \nproposed suspension afforded sponsors notice, in that it required a written notification from the Registration \nAgency of the specific violation(s) and allowed 30 days for the sponsor to address the violation before any action \nwould be taken. It was also limited in duration; if the sponsor did not address the violation within 30 days of the \nsuspension, the suspension would end with the initiation of formal deregistration proceedings, where a hearing is \nafforded. In order to further address the comments raised, however, the Final Rule includes additional steps \nwherein, upon being notified of a violation, rather than requiring compliance within 30 days, the sponsor may submit \na response to the notice of violation within 30 days which the Registration Agency will consider. If the Registration \nAgency upholds its initial determination, the sponsor has 30 days from notification of this decision to implement a \ncompliance plan, or suspension proceedings may ensue. This opportunity to respond, in conjunction with the notice \nof violation and the limited duration of the suspension, affords adequate process rights to sponsors. Moreover, if the \nRegistration Agency does not institute proceedings to deregister the suspended program within 45 days of the \nstart of the suspension, the suspension is then lifted. The Department emphasizes, though, that a Registration \nAgency will work with all program sponsors prior to instituting any deregistration proceedings to offer technical \nassistance and attempt to bring the sponsor into compliance. This process will involve active communication \nbetween the sponsor and the Registration Agency, and a sponsor that disagrees with the Registration Agency's \nfindings regarding its compliance should bring that to the Registration Agency's attention. The Department \nreiterates that enforcement is a last resort for non-complying sponsors.\n\n \n\n  Finally, several national unions warned about difficulty in enforcement due to a \u201clack of clarity as to scope and \napplications of duties of the program sponsor to other entities it owns and controls and to subcontractors,\u201d a \nparticular concern expected in the construction industry. These commenters want to see consistency in \nenforcement activity with that of the OFCCP in order to ensure a \u201cconsistent regulatory scheme,\u201d regardless of \nwhether a sponsor is operating under Federal contracting regulations or under the Registered Apprenticeship \naffirmative action regulations. This issue has been addressed in previous sections; the sponsor is ultimately \nresponsible for maintaining an apprenticeship program that complies with part 30, which has historically included \nagreements between the sponsor and participating employers to ensure that all elements of the apprenticeship \nprogram are operating in accordance with these regulations.\n\n \n\n  Reinstatement of Program Registration [\u00a7&thinsp;30.16]\n\n \n\n  The NPRM removed the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.16, entitled \u201cHearings.\u201d As explained earlier in the preamble, the \nDepartment proposes to incorporate the part 29 procedures for hearings into part 30, so that a sponsor need only \nfollow one set of procedures regardless of whether the issue at hand addresses the labor standards set forth in part \n29 or the equal opportunity standards set forth in part 30. The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.14 stated that any \napprenticeship program that had been deregistered pursuant to part 30 may be reinstated by the Secretary, upon \npresentation of adequate evidence that the program is operating in accordance with part 30. Proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.16 was revised to align with part 29, which provides that requests for reinstatement must be filed with \nand decided by the Registration Agency.\n\n \n\n  These proposed revisions, which are consistent with \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;29.8, 29.9, 29.10 and 29.13 of this title, implement \nSecretary's Order 1-2002, 67 FR 64272, Oct. 17, 2002. Accordingly, the proposal provides that requests for \nreinstatement must be filed with and decided by the Registration Agency. The Department received no comments \nassociated with this issue.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Intimidation and Retaliation Prohibited [\u00a7&thinsp;30.17]\n\n \n\n  The existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.17 stated that a sponsor must not intimidate, threaten, coerce, or retaliate against any \nperson for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by title VII or Executive Order 11246. \nProposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.17 revised this language to state that sponsors would be prohibited from intimidating or \nretaliating against any individual because he or she has opposed a practice prohibited by this part or any other \nFederal or State equal opportunity law or participated in any manner in any investigation, compliance review, \nproceeding, or hearing under part 30 or any Federal or State equal opportunity law.\n\n \n\n  An advocacy organization recommended that the Department include measures that would protect from retaliation \nthose who help educate fellow program participants about the regulations and those who bring forward complaints \nor concerns.\n\n \n\n  The proposed language in \u00a7&thinsp;30.17 prohibited discrimination and retaliation against \u201cany individual\u201d who \nfiles a complaint or opposes a practice prohibited by this regulation, and this language is retained in the Final Rule. \nThis includes program participants and anyone else who brings forward complaints or concerns. As for specific \nscenarios that raise the question of whether protected activity has been undertaken such as the one proposed, we \nnote that it is often a fact-based inquiry and we will follow relevant title VII case law and interpretative guidance in \nanalyzing such claims. The Final Rule does revise slightly paragraphs (a) and (b) to clarify the intent that it is \nunlawful for a participant to be retaliated against by anyone connected with the apprenticeship program.\n\n \n\n  State Apprenticeship Agencies [\u00a7&thinsp;30.18]\n\n \n\n  In the NPRM, the Department proposed to revise the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 entitled \u201cNondiscrimination,\u201d which \nstated that the commitments contained in a sponsor's AAP must not be used to discriminate against an apprentice \nor applicant for apprenticeship on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, and to incorporate those \nrevisions into proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.4, as discussed earlier in the preamble.\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 revised current \u00a7&thinsp;30.15, which requires State Apprenticeship Councils to adopt \nState plans. These proposed revisions were necessary to make proposed part 30 consistent with the part 29 \nprocedures for recognition of SAAs. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 differed significantly from the current \u00a7&thinsp;30.15, \nbecause proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 did not include State Apprenticeship Councils as entities eligible for recognition. \nAs provided in \u00a7&thinsp;29.13 of this title, the Department will only recognize an SAA that complies with the \nspecified requirements, granting that Agency authority to register apprenticeship programs and apprentices for \nFederal purposes. Therefore, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 would delete references to \u201cState Apprenticeship Councils\u201d \nas the entities required to submit a State EEO plan and the entities eligible for recognition, and replace it with the \nappropriate term, \u201cState Apprenticeship Agency.\u201d\n\n \n\n  A company commented that SAAs are underfunded and understaffed, and asserted that the burden of the \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18 requirements would make it difficult to achieve the goal President Obama has set for \napprenticeships.\n\n \n\n  In promulgating this Final Rule, the Department carefully considered balancing the interests of state agencies, \nsponsors, and apprentices, and the Department's need to implement these regulations in an efficient and effective \nmanner. The Department believes that the standards it is establishing in this rulemaking for SAAs will not limit the \ngrowth of apprenticeship programs or create a significant burden for sponsors and state agencies.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.18(a): State Plan\n\n\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a) set forth requirements for a State EEO plan. The proposed rule would require, within \none year of the effective date of the Final Rule, with no extensions permitted, that SAAs provide to OA a State EEO \nplan that includes the State apprenticeship law that corresponds to the requirements of this part and requires all \napprenticeship programs registered with the State for Federal purposes to comply with the requirements of the \nState's EEO Plan within 180 days from the date that OA provides written approval of the State EEO plan. The \nDepartment's determination of compliance with this part is separate from submission of the State EEO plan. \nTherefore, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a) also specified a collaborative, iterative process whereby SAAs seeking \nrecognition can achieve conformity with this part. Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a) also would provide clarity regarding \nrequirements for demonstration of conformity, while maintaining flexibility to accommodate the unique \ncircumstances of a particular SAA.\n\n \n\n  A State Department of Labor said that it would be unreasonable to require SAAs to submit a State EEO plan and a \ncopy of the State's statute within one year from the effective date of the final regulation. Asserting that \nimplementation of the regulation would take well over a year to pass through State legislation, the Administrative \nProcess Act, and internal agency review, the State suggested that the Department grant SAAs three years to \nsubmit a State EEO plan. Another State Department of Labor echoed the concern that one year would be an \ninsufficient amount of time to complete the review process and requested that SAAs be given two years to submit \ntheir plan.\n\n \n\n  Regarding the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a)(1)(i) requirement that the State EEO plan submitted to OA include a \ncopy of the State apprenticeship law that corresponds to the requirements of part 30, an SWA asked the \nDepartment to clarify if this means the SAA must submit proposed draft State regulations before rule finalization.\n\n \n\n  As for the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a)(1)(ii) requirement that the State EEO plan must require all registered \napprenticeship programs in the State to comply with the requirements of the State's EEO plan within 180 days of \nOA approval, an industry association and an SWA said this was not enough time, reasoning that the State would \nneed to host a series of town hall meetings to explain the new regulations to stakeholders and provide other \ntechnical assistance to sponsors. Instead, the SWA recommended that registered apprenticeship programs have \ntwo years to come into compliance with the new State EEO plan, and the industry association said the timeline \nshould be extended to one year from the date of OA State EEO plan approval.\n\n \n\n  The Department has carefully considered SAA's needs in accordance with the proposed regulations and has \ndetermined to amend this clause to require that, within one year, SAAs provide to OA a State EEO plan that \nincludes, at a minimum, draft State apprenticeship authorizing language\u2014which, depending on the State, could be \neither legislation, regulation, or executive order\u2014corresponding to the requirements of this part. The Final Rule \nfurther requires all apprenticeship programs registered with the State for Federal purposes to comply with the \nrequirements of the State's EEO Plan, within 180 days from the date that OA provides written approval of the State \nEEO plan. The State may request an extension from OA to the one-year State's EEO Plan requirement, which the \nAdministrator may grant for good cause shown.\n\n \n\n  The Department believes that one year, with the opportunity for extension if there is good cause, is a reasonable \namount of time to develop an EEO plan. The Department has also determined that 180 days is an adequate \namount of time for registered apprenticeship programs to comply with the requirements of the State's EEO plan. \nThe Department's intent is to have SAAs come into compliance with these regulations as quickly as possible. We \nunderstand there may be logistical difficulties with this in certain circumstances, which we believe the extension \nrequest provision addresses.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.18(b): Recordkeeping Requirements\n\n\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(b) carried forward existing recordkeeping requirements from the existing \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.8(d), using the term \u201cState Apprenticeship Agency\u201d instead of \u201cState Apprenticeship Council.\u201d \nRegarding the proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(b) requirement that SAAs must keep all compliance records for three years \nfrom the date of creation, an individual commenter said that maintaining records on compliance reviews and \ncomplaints for five to 10 years would place SAAs in a \u201cbetter position to monitor the impact of technical assistance \nover the course of an apprenticeship cohort's procession through an apprenticeship cycle as well as identify \nsponsors that exhibit patterns of stagnation in progress toward goals and/or repeated complaints.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The Department considered this suggestion and determined that it will amend the proposed rule to require SAAs \nto keep all compliance records for five years, for consistency across program regulations.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.18(c): Retention of Authority\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(c) also carried forward provisions in \u00a7&thinsp;30.15(a)(4), which state that OA retains \nfull authority to conduct EEO compliance reviews of apprenticeship programs, investigate complaints, deregister for \nFederal purposes an apprenticeship program registered with a recognized SAA, and refer any matter pertaining to \nthese EEO compliance reviews or these complaints to the EEOC, the U.S. Attorney General, or the Department's \nOFCCP. In addition, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(c) clarified that OA retains authority to conduct complaint \ninvestigations to determine whether any program sponsor registered for Federal purposes is operating in \naccordance with this part.\n\n \n\n  An SAA sought to confirm that the OA authority to conduct compliance reviews and complaint investigations only \napplies to programs registered for Federal purposes and not to programs that are not Federally registered or do not \nimplicate Federal purposes. In response, we clarify that, in SAA states the Office of Apprenticeship will only conduct \ncompliance reviews and complaint investigations on national programs that are registered with the Federal \ngovernment, such as federal prisons or military bases.\n\n \n\n  Paragraph 30.18(d): Deregistration\n\n \n\n  Proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(d) clarified that SAAs will be subject to the derecognition procedures established in \n\u00a7&thinsp;29.14 of this title, for failure to comply with the requirements of this part.\n\n \n\n  A SWA remarked that the rule seems to prevent the decertification of SAAs for failure to enforce EEO. The \ncommenter stated that although proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.18(a)(3) and (d) reference \u00a7&thinsp;29.14 deregistration \nproceedings, \u00a7&thinsp;29.14 attributes that authority to parts 29 and 30, which would no longer provide that \nauthority.\n\n \n\n  Section 29.14 is entitled \u201cDerecognition of State Apprenticeship Agencies\u201d and states that \u201cThe recognition for \nFederal purposes of a State Apprenticeship Agency may be withdrawn for the failure to fulfill, or operate in \nconformity with, the requirements of parts 29 and 30.\u201d Furthermore, that section provides that \u201cderecognition \nproceedings for reasonable cause will be instituted in accordance with the following: (a) Derecognition proceedings \nfor failure to adopt or properly enforce a State Plan for Equal Employment Opportunity in Apprenticeship must be \nprocessed in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this part.\u201d Accordingly, we disagree with the comment, \nand believe that \u00a7&thinsp;29.14 provides the Department with the authority to undertake derecognition for failure to \ncomply with \u00a7&thinsp;30.18.\n\n \n\n  Exemptions [\u00a7&thinsp;30.19]\n\n\n\n \n\n  Section 30.19 of the existing rule addresses exemptions. Under the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.19, a sponsor may \nsubmit a written request to the Secretary for an exemption from part 30, or any part thereof, and such a request \nmay be granted by the Secretary for good cause. State Apprenticeship Councils are required to notify the \nDepartment of any such exemptions granted that affect a substantial number of employers and the reasons \ntherefore.\n\n \n\n  The Department proposed minor revisions to this section. First, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.19 required that requests \nfor exemption be submitted to the Administrator, rather than the Secretary, to reflect a shift in Departmental \ndecision-making. Second, proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.19 required that SAAs, not State Apprenticeship Councils, request \nand receive approval from the Administrator to grant an exemption from these regulations. As discussed above, \nState Apprenticeship Councils are not eligible for recognition under \u00a7&thinsp;29.13 of this title. This proposed \nregulatory requirement is to ensure consistency with respect to when exemptions may be granted.\n\n \n\n  Under proposed \u00a7&thinsp;30.19, a sponsor may submit a written request to the Registration Agency for \nexemption from part 30, or any part thereof, and such a request may be granted by the Registration Agency for \ngood cause. A company inquired as to why the proposed part 30 did not include an exclusion for organizations that \nare already in compliance with EEO rules, as exists in the old part 30. The Final Rule does include such an \nexemption, at \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(d)(2).\n\n \n\n  Effective Date [\u00a7&thinsp;30.20]\n\n \n\n  The proposed rule created a new \u00a7&thinsp;30.20 that established the dates by which sponsors needed to come \ninto compliance with certain provisions in the regulations. The Final Rule removes this section and instead \nincorporates the compliance dates in the individual sections to which they apply. Discussion of the comments on \nthe compliance dates provided is therefore found in each of these sections, above.\n\n \n\n  Proposed Amendments to Part 29 Regulations, Labor Standards for Registration of Apprenticeship Programs\n\n \n\n  The part 29 regulations governing Labor Standards for Registration of Apprenticeship Programs include \nreferences to sections in part 30 that are changed through this proposed rule. This NPRM proposed technical, non-\nsubstantive changes for consistency and conformity with the proposed changes to part 30. We received no \ncomments on these changes that have not been addressed in other sections of this preamble, so we adopt the \nproposed language changes to part 29 as proposed.\n\n \n\n  Regulatory Procedures\n\n \n\n  Executive Orders 12866 and 13563: Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n \n\n  Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that \nits benefits justify its costs; tailor the regulation to impose the least burden on society, consistent with achieving the \nregulatory objectives; and in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, select those approaches that \nmaximize net benefits. Executive Order 13563 recognizes that some benefits are difficult to quantify and provides \nthat, where appropriate and permitted by law, agencies may consider and discuss qualitatively values that are \ndifficult or impossible to quantify, including equity, human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Under Executive Order 12866, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs must determine whether this \nregulatory action is \u201csignificant\u201d and, therefore, subject to the requirements of the Executive Order and subject to \nreview by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a \n\u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d as an action likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the \neconomy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \nenvironment, public health or safety, or State, local or Tribal governments, or communities in a material way (also \nreferred to as an \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rule); (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an \naction taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user \nfees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues \narising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.\n\n \n\n  The Office of Management and Budget has determined that the Final Rule is not an economically significant \nregulatory action under paragraph 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. This rulemaking is not expected to adversely \naffect the economy or any sector thereof, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or public health or safety \nin a material way. In fact, the Final Rule is expected to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of EEO compliance \nwithin apprenticeship programs and to reduce the burden imposed on sponsors in several respects. It has, \nhowever, been determined that the Final Rule is a significant regulatory action under paragraph 3(f)(4) of the \nExecutive Order and, accordingly, OMB has reviewed the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  1. Need for Regulation\n\n \n\n  As explained in the preamble, the Department is updating the equal opportunity regulations that implement the \nNational Apprenticeship Act of 1937. The existing regulations set forth at 29 CFR part 30 prohibit discrimination in \nregistered apprenticeship on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, and require that sponsors \ntake affirmative action to provide equal opportunity in such programs. The Final Rule updates the part 30 \nregulations by including age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability among the list of \nprotected bases upon which a sponsor must not discriminate, and by detailing mandatory actions a sponsor must \ntake to satisfy its affirmative action obligations.\n\n \n\n  In part, the Department is making this update so that the part 30 regulations align with 2008 revisions made to the \nDepartment's other set of regulations governing the National Registered Apprenticeship System at part 29. In \naddition, the part 30 regulations have not been amended since 1978 and EEO law has evolved since that time. The \nchanges in the Final Rule will ensure that the National Registered Apprenticeship System is consistent and in \nalignment with EEO laws as they have developed over the past 30 years, as discussed in Section I of the Final \nRule, and to ensure that apprentices and applicants for apprenticeship receive equal opportunity in apprenticeship \nprograms.\n\n \n\n  The Department is concerned that many segments of society continue to face substantial barriers to equal \nopportunity in apprenticeship. Accordingly, a principal goal for the Final Rule is to strengthen the EEO for the \nNational Registered Apprenticeship System, and improve the effectiveness of an apprenticeship program sponsor's \nrequired affirmative action efforts, as well as improve sponsors' compliance with part 30. To achieve this goal, the \nDepartment is making several changes to part 30, including:\n\n \n\n  (1) Updating the equal opportunity standards to include age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, \nand disability to the list of protected bases upon which sponsors of registered apprenticeship programs must not \ndiscriminate;\n\n \n\n  (2) Requiring all sponsors, regardless of size, to take certain affirmative steps to provide equal opportunity in \napprenticeship;\n\n\n\n \n\n  (3) Streamlining the utilization analysis required of sponsors with five or more apprentices to determine whether \nany barriers to apprenticeship exist for individuals based on race, sex, or ethnicity, and clarifying when and how \nutilization goals are to be established;\n\n \n\n  (4) Requiring targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention activities when underutilization of certain protected \ngroups have been found and a utilization goal has been established per \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 and/or where a sponsor has \ndetermined pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) that impediments to equal opportunity exist for individuals with disabilities;\n\n \n\n  (5) Simplifying procedures for selecting apprentices;\n\n \n\n  (6) Standardizing procedures Registration Agencies&thinsp; (89)  must follow for conducting compliance reviews;\n\n \n\n  (7) Clarifying requirements of program sponsors and Registration Agencies for addressing complaints;\n\n \n\n  (8) Aligning more closely with 29 CFR part 29 procedures for deregistration of SAAs, derecognition of \napprenticeship programs and hearings; and\n\n \n\n  (9) Requiring an invitation to self-identify as an individual with a disability.\n\n \n\n  These provisions will help to ensure that all individuals, including women, minorities, and individuals with \ndisabilities, are afforded equal opportunity in registered apprenticeship programs. Moreover, the addition of age (40 \nor older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability to the list of those bases upon which a sponsor must \nnot discriminate will bring the National Registered Apprenticeship System into alignment with the protected bases \nidentified in the various Federal laws applicable to most apprenticeship sponsors. These provisions will also ensure \nthese underrepresented groups have increased access to programs. The Department's interest in updating part 30 \nto improve the effectiveness of sponsors' affirmative action efforts, as well as Registration Agencies' efforts to \nenforce and support compliance with this rule, lies in assuring that the Department's approval of a sponsor's \napprenticeship program does not serve to support, endorse, or perpetuate discrimination.\n\n \n\n  2. General Comments Received on the Economic Analysis in the Notice Period of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n \n\n  The Department received several public comments that addressed the economic analysis in the NPRM. We \ncarefully considered the comments received. The significant comments and summaries of the Department's \nanalyses and determinations are discussed below:\n\n \n\n  a. Specific Steps To Provide Equal Opportunity\u2014Staff Designation\n\n \n\n  Comments: In the NPRM, the economic analysis estimated that no additional burden would be incurred by the \nrequirement to designate an individual to be responsible and accountable for overseeing the sponsor's commitment \nto EEO. Several commenters questioned this assumption by stating that staff already had full time jobs and the \nassumption that a human resource manager is already on staff may be inaccurate.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: Because businesses already have EEO provisions that they have to comply with through \nother federal regulations, it is the Department's interpretation that businesses will not need to provide additional \n\n\n\nstaffing and that these responsibilities will fall under the existing staffing infrastructure. Additionally, the Department \nis committed to providing adequate technical assistance to sponsors and does not expect to increase the sponsor's \nneed for staffing or other resources. The Final Rule language has been modified to clarify that the EEO designation \ncan be provided to one individual or to multiple individuals so it is not a single person that has to address the \nrequirements of this rule.\n\n \n\n  b. Specific Steps To Provide Equal Opportunity\u2014Orientation and Periodic Information Sessions\n\n \n\n  Comments: In the NPRM, the economic analysis estimated that 5 apprentices and 5 journeyworkers would attend \norientation and periodic information sessions. Several commenters stated that many programs could have \nconsiderably more apprentices, which would require much more of their time and possibly entail additional logistical \ncosts associated with hosting meetings of that size.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: Based on program data and the growth model for apprentices and sponsors in this \nanalysis, the Department estimated that 24 apprentices and 24 journeyworkers would attend orientation and \nperiodic information sessions for all sponsors in 2017. Over the 10-year analysis period (2017-2026) these numbers \nwould gradually increase to 34 apprentices and 34 journeyworkers in 2026.  (90)  Because sponsors already have \nin place a system to provide training and messaging to apprentices and journeyworkers, the Department believes \nthat sponsors will be able to work in the additional EEO requirements that need to be communicated into their \nexisting outreach structure with minimal additional cost. Additionally, the Department intends to provide guidance to \nsponsors relating to areas such as relevant recruitment sources and links to materials that sponsors and/or \nparticipating employers can use for anti-harassment communications and training.\n\n \n\n  c. Revised Methodology for Utilization Analysis and Goal Setting\n\n \n\n  Comments: The NPRM estimated that the revised utilization methodology would have streamlined the process \nand resulted in a reduced burden of the Final Rule. Several commenters disagreed with that estimation and \nindicated that the revised guidelines required more statistical expertise than staff typically possess. The inference \nthat the Department would no longer be providing \u201cavailability\u201d percentages would also increase staffing \nrequirements and labor.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: In response to these concerns, the Department has revised the utilization analysis \ndescribed in the Final Rule to largely revert to existing practice, in which the Registration Agency provides \nsignificant support, and lessened the frequency with which the analysis has to be done\u2014resulting in minimal \nadditional burden for sponsors. Further, the Department intends to build a data tool that will assist in future \niterations of the utilization analysis. Although this data tool will reduce burden for sponsors to conduct the utilization \nanalysis in the long-run, the Department's analysis has accounted for additional upfront costs for time associated \nwith familiarization with the tool for sponsors that choose to use it. In total, the Department is providing a data tool \nthat will assist sponsors with conducting their utilization analysis approximately every five years. The Department \nhas calculated costs to sponsors both for familiarization with the data tool and for using the tool to assist in \nconducting the analysis.\n\n \n\n  d. Invitation to Self-Identify as an Individual With a Disability\n\n \n\n  Comments: The NPRM estimated that 10 individuals would apply to each of 5 job postings per year, would choose \nto self-identify their disability status, and that an administrative assistant would spend 30 minutes reviewing and \nrecord-keeping the identification forms. Several commenters pointed out that the proposed rule would require self-\n\n\n\nidentification to happen at 3 different points in the process. Additionally, it was noted that if the Final Rule requires \nadditional outreach, a job posting could receive more than 10 applicants.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: The Department has updated the economic analysis to reflect that the invitation to self-\nidentify takes place two times. In addition, the Department has increased the assumed number of applicants to a \njob posting to 15 individuals based our historical experience and in consultation with program staff. The Department \nhas observed that rural areas tend to receive 10 applications per apprentice opening, high density areas receive 12-\n15, and statewide programs receive more than 15 applications. In order to avoid under-estimating the costs, the \nDepartment assumes 15 applications across all program sponsors. In addition, the Department has updated this \nprovision to allow for a 2-year phase-in of the requirement.\n\n \n\n  e. Overall Rule Costs and ERISA\n\n \n\n  Comments: Several commenters indicated that many apprenticeship sponsors are joint labor-management \napprenticeship funds covered by ERISA. These sponsors are not legally allowed to use funds to promote social, \nenvironmental, or other public policy causes at the expense of the interests of the plans' participants and \nbeneficiaries. Some indicated that this may reduce the number of apprenticeship sponsors because firms subject to \nboth requirements (the Final Rule and ERISA) may leave the apprenticeship program.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: The Final Rule specifies that sponsors who are operating under employee benefit plans \ngoverned by ERISA may now be eligible to use certain plan assets that support quality pre-apprenticeship \nprograms and other workforce pipeline resources. Where support for such programs is necessary to maintain the \nplan's registration, or is otherwise advantageous to the plan, assets of the plan may be used to defray the \nreasonable expenses of such support. Therefore, the Department does not anticipate the number of jointly-\nsponsored apprenticeship programs to decrease because of the requirements of the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  f. Percentage of Firms With Fewer Than Five Apprentices\n\n \n\n  Comments: The NPRM estimated that 75 percent of sponsors would have fewer than 5 apprentices and thus be \nexempt from certain Final Rule requirements. One commenter took issue with the assumption that the 25 percent of \nsponsors with five or more apprentices will be static over time. Due to increased federal funding launching \napprenticeship programs into fields not typically represented (e.g., information technology), the commenter \npredicted that much of the growth of the program would come from new programs with more than five apprentices.\n\n \n\n  Department Response: While the Department agrees that the percentage of sponsors with 5 or more apprentices \nmay change year-to-year and we expect the number of sponsors to increase over time, we expect the increase to \noccur across all industries. This includes those with long-time apprenticeship programs and those within new \nindustries. The Department is not aware of information suggesting that this growth would be biased in favor of large \nor small sponsors, as new programs can be developed by any size of sponsor. Consequently, we assume that the \npercentage of sponsors with 5 or more apprentices will remain constant as the Apprenticeship program grows.  (91) \n\n \n\n  3. Economic Analysis\n\n \n\n  The Department derives benefit and cost estimates by comparing the baseline (the program benefits and costs \nunder the 1978 Final Rule&thinsp; (92)  ) with the benefits and costs of implementing the provisions in the Final \nRule. Only the additional benefits and costs that are expected to be incurred due to the changes in this regulation \nare included in the analysis.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Department sought to quantify and monetize the benefits and costs of the Final Rule where feasible. Where \nwe were unable to quantify benefits and costs\u2014for example, due to data limitations\u2014we describe them \nqualitatively. This analysis covers a 10-year period (2017 through 2026) to ensure it captures major benefits and \ncosts that accrue over time. In this analysis, we have sought to present benefits and costs both undiscounted and \ndiscounted at 7 and 3 percent, respectively, following OMB guidelines.  (93) \n\n \n\n  The 10-year monetized costs of the Final Rule range from $370.27 million to $458.90 million (with 7 and 3 percent \ndiscounting, respectively). The 10-year monetized benefits of the Final Rule range from $4.56 million to $5.83 \nmillion (with 7 and 3 percent discounting, respectively). The annualized costs of the Final Rule range from $52.72 \nmillion (with 7 percent discounting) to $53.80 million (with 3 percent discounting). The annualized monetized \nbenefits of the Final Rule are $0.65 million (with 7 percent discounting) and $0.68 million (with 3 percent \ndiscounting).\n\n \n\n  In addition, we expect the Final Rule to result in several overarching benefits to apprenticeship programs as well \nas some specific benefits resulting from a clearer and more systematic rule. As discussed below, equal opportunity \npolicies may result in both efficiency gains and distributional impacts for society. The Final Rule may reduce \nbarriers to entry in apprenticeship programs for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and LGBT individuals, \nfostering an equitable distributional effect, and may alleviate the inefficiencies in the job market these barriers \ncreate. After considering both the quantitative and qualitative benefits of the Final Rule, the Department has \nconcluded that the benefits would justify the costs of the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  In the remaining sections, we first present the overall benefits of the Final Rule, followed by a subject-by-subject \nanalysis of the costs and benefits. We then present a summary of the costs and benefits, including total costs over \nthe 10-year analysis period. Finally, we conclude with a cost-benefit analysis of five regulatory alternatives \n(including the Final Rule).\n\n \n\n  a. Potential Overall Benefits and Distributional Effects of the Final Rule\n\n \n\n  This subsection presents the economic benefits and distributional effects of policy interventions related to equal \nemployment opportunity. Information on these impacts is derived from an extensive body of empirical labor market \nresearch published over the last two decades in peer-reviewed publications. We assume that similar effects would \nbe attributable to this rule's combination of provisions, not necessarily to a single provision. Some additional \nbenefits associated with specific provisions of the Final Rule are presented in the next section.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule clarifies and improves the regulations on equal opportunity employment from the 1978 Final Rule \nby encouraging better recruiting and hiring practices. These improved affirmative action policies may lead to both \nefficiency effects and distributional effects, as directed by OMB Circular A-4.  (94) \n\n \n\n  Equal opportunity hiring practices increase diversity in the workplace, which has been shown to have positive \neffects. Several studies have found that well-managed diversity can add value by increasing the variety of \nperspectives in a team or company, therefore fostering creativity.  (95)  Research has also proven that diverse \ngroups can perform better on problem-solving tasks than a group of strong individual performers.  (96)  Having \ndiverse perspectives and diverse ways of interpreting and acting on new information improves the collective ability \nto both anticipate challenges and find effective solutions. Increased diversity can also be beneficial to the employer, \nas evidenced by a 2007 paper by Hernandez and McDonald, which studied the effects of hiring workers with \ndisabilities. They found that compared to those without a disability, disabled workers had longer tenure, reduced \nabsenteeism, identical job performance, and did not require significantly more supervision.  (97)  Further, a study by \n\n\n\nSchotter and Weigelt (1992) showed that equal opportunity policies increase the efforts of all workers, not just the \nunderutilized workers.  (98) \n\n \n\n  Among all diversity-improvement measures, affirmative action programs have been shown to lead to the broadest \nincreases in diversity.  (99)  Further, they have not been found to generate losses in efficiency for an organization.  \n(100)  Although evidence suggests that minorities who benefit from affirmative action often have weaker \ncredentials, there is little evidence suggesting that their labor market performance is weaker.  (101)  Even when job \napplicants have comparable credentials, employers have still been found to discriminate based on race, and \ntherefore lose out on this skilled workforce.  (102)  Without policies to combat this discrimination, workers in \ngroups that are subject to discrimination are often left with the belief that certain jobs are unattainable, and lack \nthe incentive to improve their observable skills or invest in education. Personal education and training investments \nnot only help the individual, but may have positive externalities in the long run, as discussed further below. \nAdditionally, by hiring more workers from underrepresented groups, firms naturally create mentors and expand \nnetworking opportunities for these groups.  (103)  These two factors can increase employee retention, directly \nbenefiting the apprenticeship sponsors who will see the return on their initial recruitment and training investments.\n\n \n\n  Anti-discrimination policies provide economic benefits to disadvantaged groups, in the form of both higher wages \nand increased employment. One study estimated that 15 to 20 percent of aggregate wage growth between 1960 \nand 2008 was attributable to the increase in workforce participation by women and minorities, including participation \nincreases from the adoption of civil rights laws and changing social norms.  (104)  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nimproved both employment levels and wages for Black workers, as evidenced in cases such as the South Carolina \ntextile industry.  (105)  The implementation of affirmative action policies has also been shown to increase the odds \nof women and minorities in management.  (106)  Not only do these efforts help disadvantaged workers, but effects \nsuch as reduced unemployment benefit the economy as a whole.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule can also be expected to result in a beneficial distributional effect. The direct beneficiaries of the \nFinal Rule will be underrepresented workers: Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. According to Holzer \nand Neumark (2000), \u201caffirmative action offers significant redistribution toward women and minorities.\u201d Evidence \nindicates that women are more likely than men to be classified as working poor and that Blacks or African \nAmericans and Hispanics or Latinos are more than twice as likely as their white counterparts to be among the \nworking poor.  (107)  In addition, persons with disabilities have a poverty rate of 28.5 percent, over twice as high as \nthe poverty rate of persons without disabilities of 12.3 percent.  (108)  Education and training investments for these \nunderrepresented groups can result in lifetime earnings benefits. Apprenticeship participants see average lifetime \nearnings benefits of nearly $100,000, and for those completing apprenticeships, there are average lifetime earnings \nbenefits of over $240,000 compared to similar individuals who do not enter an apprenticeship.  (109)  Construction, \nthe largest represented industry sector in the National Registered Apprenticeship System, offers a higher median \nwage than many traditionally female-dominated jobs and many other jobs that do not require a college education for \nadvancement, thus providing opportunity to move out of poverty or working poor status.  (110)  Reducing barriers to \nentry in apprenticeship programs for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, people over age 40, and LGBT \nindividuals can have additional long term impacts to beneficiaries; one study found that individuals that participated \nin an apprenticeship program are 8.6 percent more likely to be employed both six and nine years after participation.  \n(111) \n\n \n\n  As apprenticeship expands in the United States, the Department is committed to ensuring that this expansion \nbenefits the entire American workforce, including individuals with disabilities, and that it provides them a path to \ngood jobs and careers with living wages such as those that apprenticeships offer. To illustrate the impacts the Final \nRule will have on individuals with disabilities, the Department estimated the number of individuals with disabilities \nexpected to benefit from its provisions if the Final Rule's utilization targets are met and apprenticeship increases by \nthe growth rates assumed in this analysis. We first obtained estimates of the prevalence of disabilities among \n\n\n\nworkers in different industries by analyzing American Community Survey (ACS) data on workers ages 18 to 64 from \nthe years 2008 to 2012. These estimates are shown in Exhibit 1. Next, in the absence of data relating to the number \nof persons with disabilities enrolled in apprenticeship programs by industry, we assumed that in a given industry the \nshare of new apprenticeship enrollees that are persons with disabilities will be the same as the share of workers in \nthat industry with disabilities. We see, for example that in the Construction industry, 5.4 percent of all workers have \na disability. We assume, therefore, that 5.4 percent of apprentices in the Construction industry similarly have \ndisabilities and that in the absence of the Final Rule that percentage would be maintained as employers enrolled \nnew apprentices with disabilities at the same rate as they dismissed apprentices with disabilities. The utilization \ngoal for individuals with disabilities set forth in the Final Rule is 7 percent of enrollees, thus an additional 1.6 percent \nof enrollees (7 percent goal minus the 5.4 percent assumed to be currently enrolled) will be expected to be persons \nwith disabilities if the utilization goal of 7 percent is attained. Because the number of new apprentices in a 10-year \nspan (2017-2026) in Construction is projected by the Department to be 276,591 the Final Rule's goal of a 7 percent \nenrollment rate would result in (0.07\u22120.054) \u00d7 276,591 = 4,342 more persons with disabilities as new apprentices in \nthe Construction industry.\n\n \n\n  This calculation, when repeated over all industries, gives a total estimate of an additional 9,243 individuals with \ndisabilities who would be enrolled out of the total of 541,061 new apprentices projected over the next 10 years \n(2017-2026).\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    Exhibit 1\u2014Impact Estimates for Individuals With Disabilities\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Industry\n\n     \n\n      Share of workers in industry with disabilities(%)\n\n     \n\n      Projected new apprentices over a 10-year period\n\n     \n\n      Gap(%)\n\n     \n\n      Projected new apprentices with disabilities\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      &emsp;\n\n     \n\n      (A)\n\n     \n\n      (B)\n\n     \n\n\n\n      (C) = 7%\u2212A\n     \n\n      (D) = B * C\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Administrative-Support\n\n     \n\n      5.5\n\n     \n\n      2,389\n\n     \n\n      1.5\n\n     \n\n      36\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Agriculture\n\n     \n\n      6.2\n\n     \n\n      759\n\n     \n\n      0.8\n\n     \n\n      6\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Construction\n\n     \n\n      5.4\n\n     \n\n      276,591\n\n     \n\n      1.6\n\n     \n\n      4,342\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n      Education\n\n     \n\n      4.3\n\n     \n\n      64,686\n\n     \n\n      2.7\n\n     \n\n      1,747\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Oil, Gas, Mineral Extraction\n\n     \n\n      5.7\n\n     \n\n      266\n\n     \n\n      1.3\n\n     \n\n      3\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Finance\n\n     \n\n      3.9\n\n     \n\n      218\n\n     \n\n      3.1\n\n     \n\n      7\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Information\n\n     \n\n      4.8\n\n     \n\n      1,017\n\n     \n\n\n\n      2.2\n\n     \n\n      22\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Medical Services\n\n     \n\n      5.1\n\n     \n\n      8,810\n\n     \n\n      1.9\n\n     \n\n      167\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Manufacturing\n\n     \n\n      5.3\n\n     \n\n      61,516\n\n     \n\n      1.7\n\n     \n\n      1,021\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Professional\n\n     \n\n      4.8\n\n     \n\n      1,096\n\n     \n\n      2.2\n\n     \n\n      24\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n      Retail\n\n     \n\n      5.9\n\n     \n\n      4,747\n\n     \n\n      1.2\n\n     \n\n      55\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Personal Service and Care\n\n     \n\n      8.7\n\n     \n\n      791\n\n     \n\n      \u22121.7\n     \n\n      \u221214\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Service\n\n     \n\n      6.0\n\n     \n\n      2,987\n\n     \n\n      1.0\n\n     \n\n      31\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Transportation\n\n     \n\n      6.2\n\n     \n\n      64,017\n\n     \n\n\n\n      0.8\n\n     \n\n      512\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Utilities\n\n     \n\n      4.5\n\n     \n\n      48,134\n\n     \n\n      2.5\n\n     \n\n      1,208\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Wholesale\n\n     \n\n      4.9\n\n     \n\n      3,576\n\n     \n\n      2.1\n\n     \n\n      75\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Total\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      541,601\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      9,243\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  4. Subject-by-Subject Analysis\n\n \n\n  The Department's analysis considers the expected benefits (beyond those discussed above) and costs of the \nchanges to part 30. This analysis considers the impacts of each change to part 30 separately. This analysis \nmeasures the costs and benefits as they accrue to sponsors, the Office of Apprenticeship at the Department, and \nState partnering agencies. It is estimated that the number of sponsors will grow over time and our annual cost \ncalculations reflect this growth. This analysis primarily discusses how the first-year costs were calculated and \nindicates that the analysis repeats that calculation across the 10-year time frame using the appropriate number of \nsponsors in any given year. Exhibit 2 presents the number of total and new sponsors in each year.

Familiarization With the Final Rule\n\n \n\n  To estimate the cost of initial rule familiarization, we multiplied the number of apprenticeship sponsors in 2017 \n(23,811)\u2014the first full year in which the Final Rule will be in effect\u2014by the amount of time required to read the new \nrule (4 hours) and by the average hourly compensation of a private-sector human resources manager ($73.90).  \n(114)  In the first year of the Final Rule, the cost to sponsors amounts to approximately $7.04 million in labor costs. \nWe repeated this calculation for each remaining year in the analysis period using the estimated number of new \nsponsors for each year, resulting in an annualized cost ranging from $1.69 million to $1.57 million with 7 percent \nand 3 percent discounting, respectively.  (115)  In subsequent years, this cost is only applied to new sponsors \nbecause existing sponsors will have already familiarized themselves with the Final Rule in previous years.\n\n \n\n  b. Addition of Age (40 or Older), Genetic Information, Sexual Orientation, and Disability to the List of Protected \nBases\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule updates the EEO standards to include age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, \nand disability to the list of protected bases upon which sponsors of registered apprenticeship programs must not \ndiscriminate (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a)). As explained in the preamble, the addition of these bases to the types of \ndiscrimination prohibited by part 30 should not result in any significant additional cost to sponsors as most of the \nNational Registered Apprenticeship System's sponsors must already comply with Federal, State, and local laws and \n\n\n\nregulations prohibiting or otherwise discouraging discrimination against applicants and employees based on age \n(40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability. Even among those sponsors not covered by \nsuch laws, many have internal EEO policies that prohibit discrimination on these bases. Therefore, the \nDepartment does not expect that the addition of age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and \ndisability to the list of protected bases in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.1(a) and 30.3(a) would result in any significant costs to \nsponsors.\n\n \n\n  c. Specific Affirmative Steps To Provide Equal Opportunity\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule requires all sponsors, regardless of size, to take certain affirmative steps to provide equal \nopportunity in apprenticeship. The Final Rule language in \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b) will, for the first time, obligate sponsors \nto take the following basic steps to ensure EEO in apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  First, sponsors are required to designate an individual or individuals to be responsible and accountable for \noverseeing the sponsor's commitment to EEO (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(1)). The Department expects the burden of this \nrequirement on sponsors to be minimal. Most, if not all, sponsors have an apprenticeship coordinator who is in \ncharge of the apprenticeship program. The Department anticipates that this requirement will be fulfilled by \nindividuals currently providing coordination and administrative oversight functions for the program sponsor. We \nexpect that the designation will be a relatively minor administrative matter, but one that will result in institutionalizing \na sponsor's commitment to equal opportunity.\n\n \n\n  Second, the Final Rule requires for the first time that sponsors post their equal opportunity pledge on bulletin \nboards and through electronic media, such that it is accessible to all apprentices and applicants to apprenticeship \nprograms (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)). We assume that sponsors choose to put up a physical copy of the pledge and also \npost it on their Web site.  (116)  The cost of this requirement is minimal. The Department assumes it will take a \nsponsor 5 minutes (0.08 hour) to post the pledge and that this task will be performed by an administrative assistant \nat an hourly compensation rate of $23.10.  (117)  We multiplied the time estimate for this provision by the hourly \ncompensation rate to obtain a total labor cost per sponsor of $1.85 ($23.10 \u00d7 0.08). Updating the EO pledge to \ninclude age (40 or older), genetic information, sexual orientation, and disability will not create any new burden \nbecause it is already covered by the existing requirements. To estimate the materials cost, the Department \nassumed that the pledge is one page, and that the cost per page for photocopying is $0.08, resulting in a materials \ncost of $0.08 ($0.08 \u00d7 1) per sponsor. The total cost of putting up a physical copy of the pledge per sponsor is \ntherefore $1.93 ($1.85 + $0.08).\n\n \n\n  The Department also assumes it will take a sponsor 10 minutes (0.17 hours) to post the pledge on its Web site \nand that this task will be performed by a web developer at an hourly compensation rate of $45.24.  (118)  The cost \nof posting the pledge on the sponsor's Web site is $7.69 ($45.24 \u00d7 0.17). The total per sponsor cost of this \nprovision, including the posting of physical copy of the pledge and the posting of the pledge on the sponsor's Web \nsite, is therefore $9.62 ($1.93 + $7.69).\n\n \n\n  Multiplying this sum ($9.62) by the total number of sponsors (23,811) in the first year (2017) results in a cost of \n$229,033 for this provision. The posting of the equal opportunity pledge is a one-time cost; costs after the first year \nare only incurred by new sponsors. Looking over the full ten-year period, the annualized cost of this provision is \n$55,015 (with 7 percent discounting) and $51,044 (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) also requires each sponsor to conduct orientation and periodic information \nsessions for apprentices, journeyworkers who directly supervise apprentices, and other individuals connected with \nthe administration or operation of the sponsor's apprenticeship program to inform and remind such individuals of the \nsponsor's equal employment opportunity policy with regard to apprenticeship. The orientation and information \n\n\n\nsessions required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)(iii) underscore the sponsor's commitment to equal opportunity and its \naffirmation action obligations. These sessions also institutionalize a sponsor's EEO policies and practices, providing \na mechanism by which the sponsor may inform everyone connected with the apprenticeship program of the \nsponsor's obligations under part 30, and ensure that all individuals involved in the program understand these \nobligations and the policies instituted to implement them. Under \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(i), sponsors are also required \nto provide anti-harassment training, which will be incorporated into these periodic orientation and information \nsessions. This training must include active participation by trainees, such as attending a training session in person \nor completing an interactive training online and will include at a minimum communications to apprentices and \njourneyworkers who directly supervise apprentices that harassing conduct will not be tolerated, the definition of \nharassment and types of conduct that constitute harassment, and the right to file a harassment complaint.\n\n \n\n  Using 2015 data from the Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System (RAPIDS) and the growth \nmodel for apprenticeship and sponsors in this analysis, the Department calculated that there are on average 24 \napprentices per sponsor in 2017.  (119)  The Department further assumes a one-to-one ratio between apprentice \nand journeyworker in estimating the cost of orientations and periodic information sessions. The Department first \nestimated that the 23,811 sponsors in the first year (2017) will hold one 45-minute regular orientation and \ninformation session with an average of 24 apprentices ($18.72 per hour)&thinsp; (120)  and 21 journeyworkers \n($31.68 per hour)&thinsp; (121)  per sponsor. The Department estimated that a human resource manager ($73.90 \nper hour) will need to spend 2 hours to develop and prepare written materials for the session in the first year, and \nthe 2 hours also cover maintaining the training materials which were already saved on the computer ($3.52 million = \n23,811 sponsors \u00d7 2 hours \u00d7 $73.90).\n\n \n\n  This calculation results in a total cost for this provision of approximately $26.44 million in the first year (2017).  \n(122)  All sponsors are assumed to hold one 45-minute regular orientation and information session annually. This \ncalculation is repeated in subsequent years (with the requirement that an HR manager develop written materials \nonly applicable for new sponsors). The annualized cost ranges from $34.18 million (with 7 percent discounting) to \n$34.87 million (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  Third, under the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4(c) sponsors are required to engage in appropriate outreach and \nrecruitment activities to organizations that serve women and minorities, and the regulations list the types of \nappropriate activities a sponsor is expected to undertake. The exact mix of activities depends on the size and type \nof the program and its resources; each sponsor, however, is \u201crequired to undertake a significant number of \nappropriate activities\u201d under the existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.4. Under the Final Rule, all sponsors are required to reach out \nto a variety of recruitment sources, including organizations that serve individuals with disabilities, to ensure \nuniversal recruitment (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(3)). Including individuals with disabilities among the groups of individuals to \nbe recruited is a new focus for sponsors. Sponsors are required to develop a list of recruitment sources that \ngenerate referrals of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities with contact information for each source. \nFurther, sponsors are required to notify these sources in advance of any apprenticeship opportunities; while a firm \ndeadline is not set, the Final Rule suggests 30 days' notice if possible under the circumstances. This may lead \nemployers to incur costs due to the additional delay in the hiring process resulting from this rule. The Department, \nhowever, does not have enough information to estimate this potential cost.\n\n \n\n  The kinds of activities we anticipate the sponsor engaging in to satisfy this requirement include distributing \nannouncements and flyers detailing job prospects, holding seminars, and visiting some of the sources that will likely \nprovide access to individuals with disabilities. The Department assumed that the cost to sponsors to distribute \ninformation to persons with disabilities will be the labor cost to comply with this provision. We also assumed that the \nactivity to satisfy this provision will be performed by a human resource manager and an administrative assistant \nwith hourly compensation rates of $73.90 and $23.10, respectively. We assumed that this task will take 30 minutes \n(0.5 hour) of a human resource manager's time and 30 minutes (0.5 hour) of an administrative assistant's time per \ntargeted source. We calculated the cost of this provision per affected sponsor by multiplying the time each staff \nmember devotes to this task by their associated hourly compensation rates. We then multiplied the total labor cost \n\n\n\nby the assumed number of outreach sources (5) and by the total number of sponsors.  (123)  All sponsors are \nassumed to conduct this outreach in all years.  (124)  The resulting cost of this provision is $5.77 million in the first \nyear, with an annualized cost ranging from $6.94 million (with 7 percent discounting) to $7.02 million (with 3 percent \ndiscounting).\n\n \n\n  Because universal outreach may involve a range of activities, the Department conducted a sensitivity analysis on \nthe total time allocated to universal outreach. Mirroring the calculation above, the Department estimated a low \nallocation of time (15 minutes, or 0.25 hour) and a high allocation of time (1 hour and 15 minutes, or 1.25 hour) for \nboth the administrative assistant and the human resource manager. The resulting range of costs for the first year is \n$2.89 million to $14.44 million with an annualized cost ranging from $3.47 million (with 7 percent discounting) to \n$3.51 million (with 3 percent discounting) at the lower bound to $17.35 million (with 7 percent discounting) to $17.56 \nmillion (with 3 percent discounting) at the higher bound.  (125) \n\n \n\n  Fourth, the Final Rule requires that all sponsors develop and implement procedures to ensure that their \napprentices are not harassed because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 \nor older), genetic information, or disability and to ensure that the workplace is free from harassment, intimidation, \nand retaliation (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(4)(iv)). As explained in the preamble, this requirement should not result in new \nburdens on sponsors who are already subject to Federal laws that prohibit harassment in the workplace. Because \ntitle VII, Executive Order 11246 as amended by Executive Order 13672, the ADEA, GINA, and the ADA prohibit \nthese actions, and most sponsors are already subject to these laws. Because time has been calculated for \ncompliance with the periodic orientation/information sessions in 30.3(b)(2)(iii) of which the anti-harassment training \nis a part, the cost of this requirement has already been accounted for in this analysis. As mentioned in the \npreamble, the Department will also provide anti-harassment materials that can be used by sponsors.\n\n \n\n  d. Revised Methodology for Workforce and Utilization Analysis and Goal Setting\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule streamlines the workforce and utilization analysis required of sponsors with five or more \napprentices and clarifies when and how utilization goals are to be established for women and minorities \n(\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5 through 30.7). Specifically, the Final Rule requires sponsors to consider two factors when \ndetermining the availability of individuals for apprenticeships rather than the five currently listed in the part 30 \nregulations: The percentage of individuals eligible for enrollment in apprenticeship programs within the sponsors \nrelevant recruitment area and the percentage of the sponsor's employees eligible for enrollment in the \napprenticeship program, both to be detailed by race, sex, and ethnicity. The Final Rule further reduces the \nfrequency with which the workforce and utilization analyses must be conducted\u2014from annually under the existing \nrule to at the time of the compliance review for the utilization analysis (every five years on average) and within three \nyears of the compliance review for the workforce analysis (effectively every two and a half years on average). In \naddition, the Final Rule explains in clear terms the steps required to determine whether any particular groups of \nindividuals are being underutilized and the Registration Agency will provide direction as to when and how goals \nare to be established. First, sponsors will conduct a workforce analysis to identify the racial, sex, and ethnic \ncomposition of their apprentices. Second, an availability analysis will establish a benchmark against which the \nexisting composition of apprentices will be compared. Sponsors will establish utilization goals and engage in \ntargeted outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts when the sponsor's utilization of women, Hispanics or Latinos, \nor individuals in racial minority groups are \u201csignificantly less than would be reasonably expected given the \navailability of such individuals for apprenticeship.\u201d Registration Agencies will work closely with sponsors during \ncompliance reviews to assist in the development of an availability analysis and setting or reassessing utilization \ngoals for race, sex, and ethnicity. The Department will be further developing a data tool to assist in the collection \nand analysis of relevant demographic data for the purposes of goal setting. The Department has determined that \nthere are three types of costs associated with this provision: Costs associated with the development of and \nfamiliarization with the data tool, costs associated with the workforce analysis, and costs associated with the \nutilization analysis.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Although it is the Department's expectation that this activity will result in long-term efficiencies and burden \nreductions for both the Department and affected sponsors, it understands that there will be costs associated with \nboth the development of the data tool and the time sponsors will need to familiarize themselves with the tool. To \ndevelop the tool, the Department estimates that it will use a GS-13 Department employee at an hourly \ncompensation rate of $64.71 for 60 hours&thinsp; (126)  to advise a contractor to build the tool. Based on the \nDepartment's requirements for similar assignments, the cost of contracting for building the tool is estimated to be \n$55,000. The total one-time cost to the Department for building the tool is therefore estimated to be $58,883.\n\n \n\n  To quantify the cost associated with sponsor familiarization with the data tool, the Department assumed that the \ndata tool is developed in 2017 and that the following year (2018) all sponsors (25,231) with 5 or more apprentices \n(25 percent) will incur one hour of HR manager labor ($73.90 per hour) to familiarize the organization with the tool. \nThis is estimated to have a cost of $466,143 (25,231 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 $73.90 \u00d7 1) in 2018. We repeated this \ncalculation for the following years only for new sponsors to the program who will still need to acclimate themselves \nwith the tool. This provision has an annualized cost of $98,197 (with 7 percent discounting) and $93,348 (with 3 \npercent discounting).\n\n \n\n  To calculate the cost of the new workforce analysis, the Department first determined the baseline (current) cost of \nthe workforce requirements under existing regulations. The existing workforce analysis required 1 hour of HR \nmanager labor ($73.90 per hour) for all sponsors (23,811 in 2017) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent) annually.\n\n \n\n  The Department then determined that the new methodology for conducting workforce analyses under the Final \nRule\u2014including the conducting of workforce analyses for individuals with disabilities\u2014would result in 2 hours of HR \nmanager labor ($73.90 per hour) for all sponsors (25,231 in 2018) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent). All \nsponsors with 5 or more apprentices must conduct their first new workforce analysis within two years of the Final \nRule's effective date and every 2.5 years after that. The Department calculated that the new workforce analyses in \n2018\u2014the first year in which the new workforce analyses would be undertaken per the compliance date set forth in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b)(3) for all sponsors with 5 or more apprentices\u2014will cost $932,285 (2 hours \u00d7 $73.90 \u00d7 (25,231 \u00d7 \n25 percent)). In calculating costs for the year 2019 and afterward, the Department divided the number of applicable \nsponsors in each year by 2.5 to reflect the assumption that in 2019 and after sponsors will conduct the analysis per \nthe 2.5-year timeline. This means that in any given year 40 percent of these sponsors will conduct the new \nworkforce analysis or that it would take 2.5 years to have these sponsors conduct the new workforce analysis. We \nrepeated this calculation for the following years using the appropriate number of sponsors in any given year, \nresulting in an annualized cost of $445,815 (with 7 percent discounting) and $449,806 (with 3 percent discounting) \nfor sponsors.\n\n \n\n  To calculate the cost of the new utilization analysis, the Department determined that the utilization analysis will \nresult in 0.5 hour of HR manager time ($73.90 per hour) for all sponsors (26,606 in 2019) with 5 or more \napprentices (25 percent) every 5 years. There is no baseline cost for this portion of the analysis, as previously the \nDepartment was providing the analysis with minimal burden to sponsors. The cost of conducting the first utilization \nanalyses in 2019\u2014the first year that utilization analyses are likely to be conducted\u2014is $49,155 (0.5 hour \u00d7 $73.90 \u00d7 \n(26,606 \u00d7 25 percent)/5 years). We repeated this calculation for the following years, and conducting utilization \nanalyses has an annualized cost of $41,235 (with 7 percent discounting) and $43,348 (with 3 percent discounting) \nfor sponsors.\n\n \n\n  Benefits\n\n \n\n  Once the data tool is developed, the Department estimates it will reduce the time required for its GS-13 employee \n($64.71 per hour) to conduct a utilization analysis from the existing 2 hours to 1 hour using the data tool jointly with \n\n\n\nsponsors. Furthermore, the frequency of conducting the utilization analysis is reduced from annually to once every \n5 years. This will result in a cost saving to the Department of $774,753 in 2019 ((26,606 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 (2 hour \u2212 (1 \nhour/5 years)) \u00d7 $64.71) and an annualized cost saving ranging from $649,925 (with 7 percent discounting) to \n$683,240 (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  e. Requiring Targeted Outreach, Recruitment, and Retention for Underutilized Groups\n\n \n\n  In addition to the normal outreach, recruitment, and retention activities required of all sponsors under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b), the Final Rule requires a sponsor of an apprenticeship program, whose utilization analyses \nrevealed underutilization of a particular group or groups of individuals pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.6 and/or who has \ndetermined pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(e) that there are impediments to EEO for individuals with disabilities, to \nengage in targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention for all underutilized groups in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. We assume \nthat this additional outreach will happen in the same manner as the universal outreach discussed above.\n\n \n\n  We further assume that this targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention is newly required for individuals with \ndisabilities of all sponsors who employ five or more apprentices, who failed to meet the 7 percent utilization goal, \nand whose existing recruitment efforts are not effective and need to be revised, since the Final Rule now requires \nthat such sponsors engage in affirmative action of individuals with disabilities. The Department recognizes, \nhowever, that some sponsors may already be meeting the 7 percent utilization goal for persons with disabilities. \nOthers may be employing them at less than 7 percent, but nevertheless do not need to engage in targeted outreach \nand recruitment because their review of their activities did not reveal any barriers to equal opportunity. Therefore, \nthe analysis below may overestimate the number of sponsors that need to engage in targeted outreach and \nrecruitment and consequently overestimate total costs of this provision.  (127) \n\n \n\n  We assume that the cost to sponsors to distribute information about apprenticeship opportunities to organizations \nserving individuals with disabilities will be the labor cost. We also assume that the labor for this provision will be \nperformed by a human resource manager and an administrative assistant with hourly compensation rates of $73.90 \nand $23.10, respectively. Lastly, we assume that this additional outreach will first occur two years after the Final \nRule goes into effect. At the first compliance review\u2014which for the first group of sponsors to conduct compliance \nreviews will occur approximately two years after the Final Rule's effective date\u2014sponsors need to conduct a \nutilization analysis and an internal review to identify underutilization for women, minority groups, or individuals with \ndisabilities. Sponsors who need to engage in targeted outreach and recruitment for the first time should continue to \ndo so annually until the next compliance review.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimated that this dissemination task will take 30 minutes (0.5 hour) of a human resource \nmanager's time and 30 minutes (0.5 hour) of an administrative assistant's time per targeted source. A sensitivity \nanalysis for a range of time spent conducting targeted outreach to organizations that serve individuals with \ndisabilities is presented further below. The cost of this provision per affected sponsor is the time each staff member \ndevotes to this task multiplied by their associated hourly compensation rates. This calculation resulted in a labor \ncost of $48.50 (($73.90 \u00d7 0.5) + ($23.10 \u00d7 0.5)) per source. We then multiplied this total labor cost by the number of \noutreach sources (5),  (128)  the share of sponsors with five or more apprentices (25 percent), the share of \nsponsors that will undertake a utilization analysis in any given year (20 percent&thinsp; (129)  ) and the share of \nsponsors that will identify underutilization and/or problem areas in one or more of the relevant demographic \ngroups\u2014(95 percent&thinsp; (130)  ). This calculation ($48.50 \u00d7 26,606 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 20 percent \u00d7 95 percent) \nresults in a total cost of this provision of approximately $306,468 in 2019. The number of sponsors who will \nundertake a utilization analysis and identify underutilization and/or problem areas in 2019 is 1,264 (26,606 \u00d7 25 \npercent \u00d7 20 percent \u00d7 95 percent). Because sponsors who need to engage in targeted outreach and recruitment \nfor the first time must continue to do so annually until the next compliance review, the number of sponsors needing \nto engage in targeted outreach and recruitment in 2020 will become 2,590, which is the sum of 1,264 and 1,326 \n(27,915 sponsors in 2020 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 20 percent \u00d7 95 percent). The number of sponsors who we estimate will \n\n\n\nneed to engage in targeted outreach and recruitment will eventually reach 95 percent of the total sponsors with 5 or \nmore apprentices in 2023 and after.  (131) \n\n \n\n  We repeated this calculation for the following years using the appropriate number of sponsors in any given year. \nThe annualized cost ranges from $936,998 (with 7 percent discounting) to $1.02 million (with 3 percent \ndiscounting).\n\n \n\n  f. Affirmative Action Program Reviews\n\n \n\n  Affirmative action program reviews in the Final Rule result in three additional activities beyond the baseline: \npersonnel process reviews, written affirmative action plan updates during compliance reviews, and written \naffirmative action plan updates within three years of compliance reviews (estimated to occur 2.5 years later in this \nanalysis). The Final Rule requires sponsors with five or more apprentices to review personnel processes annually \n(\u00a7&thinsp;30.9). Requiring this scheduled review of personnel processes emphasizes the philosophy the \nDepartment intends to convey throughout the regulation that affirmative action is not a mere paperwork exercise but \nrather a dynamic part of the sponsor's management approach. Affirmative action requires ongoing monitoring, \nreporting, and revision to address barriers to EEO and to ensure that discrimination does not occur.\n\n \n\n  As required by the 1978 Final Rule (the analysis baseline), sponsors with 5 or more apprentices in a registered \napprenticeship program are required to develop and maintain an affirmative action program. The scope of each \nsponsor's program depends on the size and type of its program and resources. However, each sponsor is required, \nunder the existing rule, to undertake a significant number of appropriate activities to satisfy its affirmative action \nobligations. The 1978 Final Rule lists examples of the kinds of activities expected, including \u201cperiodic auditing of the \nsponsor's affirmative action programs and activities\u201d (29 CFR 30.4(c)(10)). We assume that, at the very least, these \nprogram sponsors currently conduct this audit on an annual basis because elsewhere in the 1978 Final Rule, \nsponsors are required to review their affirmative action programs annually and update them where necessary (29 \nCFR 30.8).\n\n \n\n  To calculate the cost of these three activities, the Department first determined the cost of the baseline that is being \nreplaced by the Final Rule (annual affirmative action program reviews). The Department calculated that all sponsors \n(25,231 in 2018) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent) currently incur 8 hours of HR manager labor ($73.90 per \nhour) to conduct the existing annual reviews. The cost of the baseline in 2017 is $3.73 million (25,231 \u00d7 25 percent \n\u00d7 8 hours \u00d7 $73.90). This baseline is being replaced by less frequent affirmative action program reviews and an \nannual personnel process review for all sponsors (all of these provisions do not begin until the second year (2018) \ndue to the two-year phase-in).\n\n \n\n  To determine the cost of the new annual personnel process review, the Department calculated the cost for all \nsponsors in 2018 (25,231) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent) to spend 8 hours of HR manager labor \nconducting the review. This provision will result in an undiscounted cost of $3.73 million in 2018 (25,231 \u00d7 25 \npercent \u00d7 8 hours \u00d7 $73.90).\n\n \n\n  To determine the cost of the written affirmative action plan update at the time of the compliance review, the \nDepartment calculated the cost for all sponsors in 2018 (25,231) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent) to spend \n12 hours&thinsp; (132)  of HR manager labor every 5 years at the time of the compliance review. With the existing \ncompliance review rate at 20 percent, this means that approximately one in five of these sponsors will undergo a \ncompliance review every year. This provision will result in an undiscounted cost of $1.12 million in 2018 (25,231 \u00d7 \n25 percent \u00d7 12 hours \u00d7 (1/5) \u00d7 $73.90).\n\n \n\n\n\n  To determine the cost of the written affirmative action plan update within three years of the compliance review, the \nDepartment calculated the cost for all sponsors in 2018 (25,231) with 5 or more apprentices (25 percent) to spend 6 \nhours&thinsp; (133)  (estimated to be less because of the lesser workload from not overlapping with the compliance \nreview) of HR manager time every 5 years. This provision results in an undiscounted cost of $559,371 in 2018 \n(25,231 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 6 hours \u00d7 (1/5) \u00d7 $73.90). We repeated this calculation for the following years using the \nappropriate number of sponsors in any given year.\n\n \n\n  The total cost of this provision is $1.68 million in 2018 ($559,371 + $1.12 million + $3.73 million \u2212 $3.73 million). \nThe annualized cost ranges from $1.69 million to $1.75 million at 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively.\n\n \n\n  g. Simplified Procedures for Selecting Apprentices\n\n \n\n  Under the 1978 Final Rule, selection of apprentices must be made using one of four specific selection methods. \nUnder the Final Rule (\u00a7&thinsp;30.10), sponsors are required to adopt any method for the selection of apprentices \nprovided that the method (1) complies with Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (USGEP); (2) is \nuniformly and consistently applied to all applicants and apprentices; (3) complies with the qualification standards set \nforth in title I of the ADA; and (4) is facially neutral in terms of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual \norientation, age (40 or older), and disability. This approach greatly simplifies the regulatory structure currently \ngoverning selection procedures and affords sponsors greater flexibility in fashioning a selection procedure; it also \naligns this provision of part 30 with how other equal opportunity laws regulate employers' use of selection \nprocedures.\n\n \n\n  Benefits\n\n \n\n  This provision, aimed at simplifying selection procedures, is expected to reduce sponsors' cost of compliance \nbecause we expect that sponsors will be able to more quickly and easily adopt a method for selection consistent \nwith how they currently select applicants or employees under other EEO laws. Although this analysis did not \nquantify any benefits under this provision, it is expected that this will result in efficiencies for sponsors.\n\n \n\n  h. Standardizing Compliance Review Procedures for Registration Agencies\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule standardizes procedures Registration Agencies must follow for conducting compliance reviews \n(\u00a7&thinsp;30.13). The provision on compliance reviews carries forward the existing provision at \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 \naddressing compliance reviews and includes several modifications to improve readability. First, the Final Rule \nrevises the title from \u201cCompliance reviews\u201d to \u201cEqual employment opportunity compliance reviews\u201d to clarify that the \nreviews are to assess compliance with the part 30 regulations and not the companion regulations at part 29.\n\n \n\n  Second, the term \u201cRegistration Agency\u201d is used throughout \u00a7&thinsp;30.13 instead of the term \u201cDepartment,\u201d \nbecause this section applies to both the Department and to SAAs when conducting an EEO compliance review.\n\n \n\n  Third, the Final Rule provides more specificity for the procedures Registration Agencies must follow in conducting \ncompliance reviews. This increased specificity provides for greater consistency and standardization of procedures \nacross the National Registered Apprenticeship System. For instance, \u00a7&thinsp;30.13(b) requires the Registration \nAgency to notify a sponsor of any findings through a written Notice of Compliance Review Findings within 45 days \nof completing a compliance review. The Notice of Compliance Review Findings must include whether any \ndeficiencies (i.e., failures to comply with the regulatory requirements) were found, how they are to be remedied, and \n\n\n\nthe timeframe within which the deficiencies must be corrected. The Notice of Compliance Review Findings also \nmust notify a sponsor that sanctions may be imposed for failing to correct the aforementioned deficiencies.\n\n \n\n  These changes add clarity to the procedures but do not fundamentally change the process and, therefore, do not \nrepresent a significant additional burden to sponsors or SAAs. The Department believes the additional specificity \nwill ease some of the burden on States.\n\n \n\n  Sponsors are subject to onsite or offsite compliance reviews by either the SAA or OA where the corresponding \nagency is expected to notify the sponsor of the review findings. Although the notice of compliance reviews already \noccurs with SAAs and OA, the Final Rule makes the practice standard and common among all entities. Under the \nFinal Rule, the notice of review findings is required to be sent via registered or certified mail, with return receipt \nrequested within 45 days of the completed equal opportunity compliance review.\n\n \n\n  The costs associated with this provision are limited to the use of registered mail, the materials, and the labor to \nsend the letter. The actual review process remains unchanged from the 1978 Final Rule. To determine the cost of \nthe notice of compliance reviews, we estimated the labor cost to mail and compile the notice (assumed to be \ncompleted by an administrative assistant) and the cost of materials to send the notice. The labor cost is comprised \nof the time an administrative assistant dedicates to the task (15 minutes, or 0.25 hour) multiplied by the hourly \ncompensation rate ($29.55 for SAAs and $30.68 for OA).  (134)  The total materials cost is the cost to send a letter \nvia registered mail ($12.20) plus the cost of the envelope ($0.07) plus the cost to photocopy the one-page \ndocument ($0.08), or $12.35 ($12.20 + $0.07 + $0.08).\n\n \n\n  To estimate the total cost of this provision in the first year, we summed labor and material costs and then \nmultiplied by the total number of reviewed sponsors resulting in $46,997 for SAAs and $47,670 for OA.  (135)  We \nthen repeated this calculation for each year of the analysis period using the projected number of sponsors for each \nyear. The annualized cost to SAAs ranges from $56,499 (with 7 percent discounting) to $57,163 (with 3 percent \ndiscounting) and the annualized cost to OA ranges from $57,308 (with 7 percent discounting) to $57,981 (with 3 \npercent discounting).\n\n \n\n  i. Clarifying Complaint Procedures\n\n \n\n  In an effort to ensure consistency with how Registration Agencies process complaints and conduct investigations, \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.14(c) adds uniform procedures that Registration Agencies must follow. These uniform procedures \nensure that Registration Agencies acknowledge and thoroughly investigate complaints in a timely manner, that \nparties are notified of the Registration Agency's findings, and that the Registration Agency attempts to quickly \nresolve violations. Since the complaint process is not a new process, the Department does not expect that these \nprovisions will add significantly to the burden on Registration Agencies; they simply standardize the procedures \nand define a timeline. Therefore, while the Department does not expect significant changes in burden, there may \nstill be negligible one-time costs as Registration Agencies adjust their complaint procedures to reflect newly \nstandardized requirements. These procedures will benefit both sponsors and apprentice complainants since claims \nwill be handled in a clear and consistent fashion.\n\n \n\n  j. Adopting Uniform Procedures Under 29 CFR Parts 29 and 30 for Deregistration, Derecognition, and Hearings\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule generally aligns part 30 with part 29 procedures for deregistration of apprenticeship programs, \nderecognition of SAAs, and hearings (\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.15 through 30.16). For consistency and simplicity, \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.15(c) adopts the deregistration procedures of \u00a7&thinsp;29.8(b)(5) through (8) of this title, including the \nhearing procedures in \u00a7&thinsp;29.10. This revision a more closely aligned set of procedures for matters arising \n\n\n\nfrom management of the National Registered Apprenticeship System. These provisions are not expected to impose \na burden because SAAs are already following these procedures in part 29.\n\n \n\n  k. Invitation To Self-Identify as an Individual With a Disability\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule under \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 requires sponsors with 5 or more apprentices to invite applicants for \napprenticeship to voluntarily self-identify as an individual with a disability protected by this part at two stages: (1) At \nthe time they apply or are considered for apprenticeship; and (2) after they are accepted into the apprenticeship \nprogram but before they begin their apprenticeship. Within the first two years of the program, existing sponsors will \nbe required to survey their current apprentices.\n\n \n\n  The purpose of this section is to collect important data pertaining to the participation of individuals with disabilities \nin the sponsor's applicant pools and apprenticeship program. This data will allow the sponsor and the Department \nto better identify and monitor the sponsor's enrollment and selection practices with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities and also enable the Department and the sponsor to assess the effectiveness of the sponsor's \nrecruitment efforts over time, and to refine and improve the sponsor's recruitment strategies, where necessary. In \naddition, data related to apprentices once they are in the program will help sponsors assess whether there may be \nbarriers to equal opportunity in all aspects of apprenticeship and may improve the effectiveness of retention \nstrategies or help sponsors evaluate whether such strategies are necessary.\n\n \n\n  Within the first two years of this program, sponsors with 5 or more apprentices will need to survey their current \nworkforce with the invitation to self-identify. The Department assumed that sponsors would survey their current \nworkforce for the first time in 2018 and calculated that sponsors (33,939 in 2018) with 5 or more apprentices (25 \npercent) will survey an average of 41 apprentices with an invitation to self-identify provided by the Department.  \n(136)  The Department estimated that it would take an apprentice ($18.72 per hour) 5 minutes (0.08 hours) to \ncomplete the form. Furthermore, an administrative assistant ($23.10 per hour) would need to spend 0.5 hour \nannually to record and keep the forms. This provision has a cost in 2018 of $458,811 ((25,231 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 41 \u00d7 \n0.08 hour \u00d7 $18.72) + (25,231 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 0.5 hour \u00d7 $23.10)).\n\n \n\n  In subsequent years, all sponsors with 5 or more apprentices will be required to administer the invitation to self-\nidentify twice: Once to all applicants prior to the offer of apprenticeship, and once after the offer of apprenticeship to \nthose who have been extended offers. The Department estimates that sponsors post 42 positions in 2019 and \nreceive 15 applicants per posting.  (137)  Of those positions, the Department estimated that 42 offers of enrollment \nare made and 42 apprentices choose to enroll in 2019. This requirement has an undiscounted cost in 2019 of $6.84 \nmillion (26,606 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 ((15 applications \u00d7 42 job listings \u00d7 .08) + (42 offers of apprenticeship \u00d7 .08)) \u00d7 \n$18.72 + 26,606 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 $23.10). For the 10-year analysis period, this provision has an annualized \ncost of $6.54 million and $6.91 million (at 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).  (138)  In addition, \nsponsors with 5 or more apprentices are required to remind apprentices yearly that they can update their invitation \nto self-identify. The Department assumed that these sponsors would send out an annual reminder email beginning \nin 2018 at the cost of $12,292 (25,231 \u00d7 0.25 percent \u00d7 0.08 hour \u00d7 $23.10). We repeated this calculation for each \nremaining year in the analysis period using the estimated number of sponsors for each year. This provision in total \nhas an annualized cost of $4.53 million and $4.76 million (at 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n  l. Other\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule will result in three additional costs. First, SAAs will be required to revise their State equal \nopportunity plan to conform to the new requirements. Second, the Final Rule will create an intermediary step \nbetween a registered sponsor and a deregistered sponsor (registration suspension). Third, sponsors will likely hire \n\n\n\nor retain more qualified apprentices with disabilities under the Final Rule and this may result in additional costs of \nproviding appropriate job accommodations.\n\n \n\n  Revision of State Equal Opportunity Plan\n\n \n\n  The process of updating a State equal opportunity plan may potentially involve various different people at different \nstages of implementation. Updating the plan will include drafting the new plan and completing all administrative \nprocedures that may apply, such as revisions to a State's apprenticeship law or policy that may require a public \nnotice and comment period, training for SAA staff on the revised State EEO Plan, and outreach to program \nsponsors to inform them of the relevant aspects of the revised State EEO plan once it has been approved by the \nDepartment. The updates to State equal opportunity plans include changing language and existing requirements \nsuch that they align with the regulatory changes herein. To calculate the costs, the Department assumed that the \nprocess to revise the State equal opportunity plan will take a full year of effort (2,080 hours) to complete.  (139)  \nThis is the Department's best estimate for updating the existing State equal opportunity plan. For simplicity, we \nassumed that an SAA human resource manager will complete the task at an hourly compensation rate of $62.33.  \n(140)  This amounts to a one-time cost of $3.24 million in the first year (2,080 hours \u00d7 $62.33 \u00d7 25).  (141) \n\n \n\n  Intermediate Step Between a Registered Sponsor and a Deregistered Sponsor\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule creates an intermediary step regarding suspending new apprentices before deregistration \nproceedings are instituted (\u00a7&thinsp;30.15(b)). Currently, deregistration of an apprenticeship program occurs when \nthe sponsors fails to demonstrate compliance with the 1978 Final Rule. The new suspension step allows sponsors \nan adequate span of time to update their practices and be in compliance without having to be deregistered and \nthen reregistered at a later date. Under this procedure, a Registration Agency may suspend a registration of new \napprentices until the sponsor has achieved compliance with part 30 through the completion of a voluntary \ncompliance action plan or until deregistration proceedings are initiated by the Registration Agency.\n\n \n\n  The intermediary step represents a benefit because it allows sponsors to comply without having to be \nderegistered and then reregister or abandon their program. The benefits of this provision are difficult to quantify \nbecause some programs eligible for deregistration may seek deregistration voluntarily.\n\n \n\n  Workplace Accommodations for Apprentices With Disabilities\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires sponsors to take \naffirmative action to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship to qualified individuals with disabilities. With respect \nto the sponsor's duty to ensure non-discrimination based on disability, the sponsor must provide necessary \nreasonable accommodations to ensure applicants and apprentices with disabilities receive equal opportunity in \napprenticeship. Since most, if not all, sponsors already are subject to the ADA as amended, and if a Federal \ncontractor to section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, sponsors already have a duty under existing law to provide \nreasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, and thus there is no new burden associated \nwith any duty to provide reasonable accommodation under part 30, as that duty already exists under Federal law. \nFor any sponsor that may not already be required under the law to provide such accommodations (e.g., any \nsponsor with fewer than 15 employees would not be covered by the ADA), we expect the resulting burden to be \nsmall. A recent study conducted by the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a service of the Department's Office of \nDisability Employment Policy (ODEP), shows that the majority of employers in the study (57 percent) reported no \nadditional accommodation costs and the rest (43 percent) reported one-time costs of $500 on average.  (142)  This \n\n\n\nstudy shows that the benefits to employers, such as improving productivity and morale, retaining valuable \nemployees, and improving workplace diversity, outweigh the low cost.\n\n \n\n  4. Summary of Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n \n\n  Exhibit 3 presents a summary of the first-year costs of the Final Rule, as described above. As shown in the exhibit, \nthe total first-year cost of the Final Rule is $42.88 million. The Department was able to only quantify benefits (i.e., \ncost-savings) of the Final Rule resulting from the benefit from more efficient utilization analysis and goal setting by \nthe Department. The Department estimated that this time saving yield $4.56 or $5.83 million in benefits over the 10-\nyear period (with 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  Exhibit 4 presents a summary of the monetized costs and benefits associated with the Final Rule over the 10-year \nanalysis period. The monetized costs and benefits displayed are the yearly summations of the calculations \ndescribed above. Costs and benefits are presented as undiscounted 10-year totals, and as present values with 7 \nand 3 percent discount rates.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  Primary estimates of the 10-year monetized costs of the Final Rule are $370.27 million and $458.90 million (with 7 \nand 3 percent discounting, respectively). The 10-year monetized benefits of the Final Rule are estimated at $4.56 \nmillion or $5.83 million (with 7 and 3 percent discounting, respectively).  (143) \n\n \n\n  Due to data limitations, the Department did not quantify several important benefits to society provided by the Final \nRule. The Final Rule is expected to result in several overarching benefits to apprenticeship programs and specific \nbenefits resulting from a clearer, more systematic rule. As discussed above, equal opportunity policies may lead to \nboth efficiency gains and distributional impacts for society. The Final Rule may reduce barriers to entry in \napprenticeship programs for women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities, fostering a distributional effect, and \nmay alleviate the inefficiencies in the job market these barriers create. It may also benefit businesses, as discussed \nabove.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule focuses on making the existing EEO policy consistent and standard across the National Registered \nApprenticeship System. In doing so, several tasks already undertaken by sponsors, apprentices, and Registration \nAgencies have been simplified. For instance, the clarified complaint process better informs apprentices, sponsors, \nand Registration Agencies of their roles and expectations. The Final Rule also develops a simpler methodology for \nthe apprentice selection process and offers sponsors the flexibility to choose a mechanism that aligns with their \nState's specific equal opportunity regulations. Much of the new language provides consistency with existing equal \nopportunity laws and part 29 already applicable to these affected entities. Finally, the Final Rule streamlines \nprocedures already in place under the 1978 Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  5. Regulatory Alternatives\n\n \n\n  In addition to the Final Rule, the Department has considered four regulatory alternatives: (a) Take no action, that \nis, to leave the 1978 Final Rule intact; (b) increase the Department's enforcement efforts of the 1978 Final Rule; (c) \napply the same affirmative action requirements set forth in this rule to all sponsors, regardless of size; and (d) rely \n\n\n\non individuals participating in the National Registered Apprenticeship System to identify and report to Registration \nAgencies potential cases of discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, \nage (40 or older), genetic information, and disability.\n\n \n\n  The Department conducted economic analyses of the four alternatives to better understand their costs and \nbenefits and the implied tradeoffs (in terms of the costs and benefits that would be realized) relative to the Final \nRule. Below is a discussion of each alternative along with an estimation of their costs and benefits. All costs and \nbenefits use the 1978 Final Rule as the baseline for the analysis. Finally, we summarize the total costs and benefits \nof each alternative.\n\n \n\n  a. Take No Action\n\n \n\n  This alternative yields no additional costs to society because it does not deviate from the baseline, that is, the \n1978 Final Rule. This alternative, however, also yields no additional benefits in terms of ensuring equal \nopportunities for women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, LGBT individuals, and those ages 40 or older.\n\n \n\n  b. Increase Enforcement of Original Regulation\n\n \n\n  This alternative maintains the original 1978 Final Rule but increases the monitoring of apprenticeship programs. \nThis alternative increases the burden on the SAAs and the Department to enforce the equal opportunity standards. \nTo determine the cost of this alternative, we assumed that the frequency of compliance reviews will increase by 50 \npercent, implying that sponsors would be evaluated by the Registration Agency (the Department or SAAs) on a \nmore frequent basis. With the existing compliance review rate at 20 percent\u2014meaning that approximately one in \nfive sponsors undergoes a compliance review every year\u2014a 50 percent increase would constitute an extra 10 \npercent of sponsors (20 percent \u00d7 0.5) undergoing compliance reviews each year for a total of 30 percent of \nsponsors (20 percent + 10 percent) undergoing annual compliance reviews.\n\n \n\n  To calculate the cost of this alternative, the Department assumed that each compliance review takes 40 hours to \ncomplete. This estimate includes time for preparation, conducting the review, writing up the findings and guidance \nto sponsors, reviewing and approving the final documents to be provided to sponsors, and providing technical \nassistance, where appropriate. We multiplied the 40 hours needed to complete a review by the increase in the \nannual number of reviews by 10 percent (2,381 = 23,811 \u00d7 10 percent in 2017) by the hourly compensation rate of \nan SAA human resource manager ($62.33) and by the hourly compensation rate of an OA human resource \nmanager ($64.71).  (144)  We also multiplied this number by 50 percent, assuming that half of the sponsors report \nto a SAA and half report to OA. The cost of increased compliance reviews in the first year is $2.97 million for SAAs \n(23,811 \u00d7 50 percent \u00d7 $62.33 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 10 percent) and $3.08 million for OA (23,811 \u00d7 50 percent \u00d7 $64.71 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 10 \npercent). The annualized costs range from $3.57 million to $3.61 million for SAAs (with 7 and 3 percent discounting, \nrespectively) and from $3.70 million to $3.75 million for OA (with 7 and 3 percent discounting, respectively). The 10-\nyear costs for this alternative range from $51.08 million to $62.77 million (with 7 and 3 percent discounting, \nrespectively).\n\n \n\n  Exhibit 5 presents a summary of the monetized costs of this alternative option over the 10-year analysis period. \nCosts are presented as undiscounted 10-year totals, and as present values, using 7 percent and 3 percent discount \nrates.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n  Increasing monitoring and evaluation of current efforts will increase administrative costs to the Department and \nmay improve compliance to the existing requirements, but it would not modernize the rule to be consistent with \ncurrent law affecting workers with disabilities and older workers. Therefore this would not be a preferred option, as it \nexcludes a major area of focus for the Department: Improving access to good jobs for individuals with disabilities, \nsuch as those offered by Registered Apprenticeship opportunities.\n\n \n\n  c. Apply the Same Affirmative Action Policy to All Sponsors Regardless of Size\n\n \n\n  The 1978 Final Rule and the Final Rule require that all sponsors with five or more apprentices maintain and \nupdate their AAPs. This alternative would apply the same AAP to all sponsors regardless of size. The Department \nbelieves that the incremental benefit of this action would be minimal compared to its incremental cost. This policy \ndirectly impacts the segment of the population that both qualifies as a small entity and also has few apprentices. \nSponsors of small apprenticeship programs often have very few employees. Such sponsors would likely be overly \nburdened by the targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. For example, they \nmight not have the staff and resource capacity to adequately conduct outreach to multiple organizations.\n\n \n\n  We believe that the original 1978 Final Rule restriction of requiring only those sponsors with five or more \napprentices to develop, maintain, and update their AAPs is an appropriate way to not disproportionately burden \nsmall entities.\n\n \n\n  To calculate the cost and benefits of this alternative, the Department completed the same calculations conducted \nfor the Final Rule but increased the number of sponsors who have to establish an AAP. This new calculation \nassumed that all sponsors must determine utilization rates and underutilization and participate in targeted outreach \nand recruitment.\n\n \n\n  To calculate the costs associated with this alternative, we first calculated the cost for all sponsors to complete the \nutilization analysis. As discussed above, we assumed this process takes 0.5 hour of a human resource manager's \ntime at an hourly compensation rate of $73.39. We then divided the number of sponsors by 5 years to reflect that \nnew utilization analyses occur approximately every five years. The resulting cost in 2019 is $196,618 ((0.5 \u00d7 $73.90 \n\u00d7 26,606)/5). We repeated this calculation for each remaining year in the analysis period using the estimated \nnumber of sponsors for each year, resulting in an annualized cost ranging from $164,939 (with 7 percent \ndiscounting) to $173,394 (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  To quantify the cost associated with sponsor familiarization with the data tool for the utilization analysis, the \nDepartment assumed that all sponsors (25,231 in 2018) will incur one hour of HR manager labor ($73.90 per hour) \nto familiarize the organization with the tool. This is estimated to have a cost of $1.86 million in 2018 (25,231 \u00d7 \n$73.90 \u00d7 1). We repeated this calculation for the following years only for new sponsors to the program who will still \nneed to acclimate themselves with the tool. This provision has an annualized cost of $392,786 (with 7 percent \ndiscounting) and $373,391 (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  Once the data tool is developed, the Department estimates it will take one hour for a GS-13 employee ($64.71 per \nhour) to conduct a utilization analysis for sponsors with fewer than 5 apprentices. This will result in a cost to the \nDepartment of $258,251 in 2019 (26,606 \u00d7 75 percent \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 $64.71/5) and an annualized cost ranging from \n$216,642 (with 7 percent discounting) to $178,378 (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  The Department next calculated the costs for all sponsors to conduct a workforce analysis. All sponsors with five \nor more apprentices must conduct the first new workforce analysis within two years of the Final Rule's effective date \nand every 2.5 years after that. For these sponsors, this process is expected to take 2 hours of an HR manager's \ntime ($73.90 per hour) in 2018 compared to a baseline of 1 hour of an HR manager's time. We multiplied this 1 hour \n\n\n\nby an HR manager's wage and by 25 percent of active sponsors, resulting in a cost of $466,143 ((25,231 \u00d7 25 \npercent \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 $73.90). For sponsors with fewer than five apprentices, this process is expected take 2 hours of \nan HR manager's time ($73.90 per hour) and they are currently not required to conduct a workforce analysis. We \nmultiplied $73.90 by 75 percent of active sponsors and 2 hours for sponsors with fewer than 5 apprentices. The \nresulting cost in 2018 is $2.80 million ((25,231 \u00d7 75 percent \u00d7 2 hours \u00d7 $73.90) and the total cost for all sponsors \nin 2018 is $3.26 million ($466,143 + $2.80 million).\n\n \n\n  In subsequent years after 2018, for sponsors with five or more apprentices, this process is expected to take 2 \nhours of an HR manager's time ($73.90 per hour) every 2.5 years compared to a baseline of 1 hour of an HR \nmanager's time annually, for a net saving of 0.2 hour per year. We multiplied this 0.2 hour by an HR manager's \nwage and by 25 percent of active sponsors, resulting in cost savings in 2019\u2014the first year in which new workforce \nanalyses will be conducted\u2014of $98,309 ((26,606 \u00d7 25 percent \u00d7 0.2 hour \u00d7 $73.90). For sponsors with fewer than \nfive apprentices, this process is expected take 2 hours of an HR manager's time ($73.90 per hour) every 2.5 years \nand they are currently not required to conduct a workforce analysis. We multiplied $73.90 by 75 percent of active \nsponsors and 2 hours, dividing by 2.5 years to reflect that the new workforce analyses occur approximately every \ntwo and a half years. The resulting cost in 2019 is $1.18 million ((26,606 \u00d7 75 percent \u00d7 2 hours \u00d7 $73.90)/2.5).\n\n \n\n  The cost for all sponsors to conduct a workforce analysis in 2019 is $1.08 million ($1.18 million less $98,309). This \ncalculation was repeated in subsequent years, resulting in an annualized cost ranging from $1.31 million to $1.32 \nmillion with 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively.\n\n \n\n  We next calculated the costs of expanding the requirements for all apprenticeship sponsors to conduct targeted \noutreach. The cost of targeted outreach and recruitment mirrors the cost above except that we no longer scale it by \nthe 25 percent of sponsors. We again assumed that each sponsor contacts five organizations; that a human \nresource manager would take 30 minutes (0.5 hour) to complete this task at an hourly compensation rate of $73.90; \nand that an administrative assistant would spend 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at an hourly compensation rate of $23.10.\n\n \n\n  The cost of this provision per affected sponsor is the time each staff member devotes to this task multiplied by \ntheir associated hourly compensation rates. This calculation resulted in a labor cost of $48.50 (($73.90 \u00d7 0.5) + \n($23.10 \u00d7 0.5)) per source. We then multiplied this labor cost by the number of outreach sources (5); the number of \nsponsors (26,606 in 2019); 95 percent for sponsors whose utilization analyses revealed underutilization; and 20 \npercent for sponsors who undergo compliance review each year. This calculation results in a total cost of $1.23 \nmillion in 2019 ($48.50 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 26,606 \u00d7 95 percent \u00d7 20 percent). We repeated this calculation for each remaining \nyear in the analysis period using the estimated number of sponsors for each year, resulting in an annualized cost \nranging from $3.75 million to $4.07 million with 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively.\n\n \n\n  Within the first two years of this program, all sponsors will need to survey their current workforce with the invitation \nto self-identify. The Department calculated that sponsors (25,231 in 2018) will survey an average of 26 apprentices \nwith an invitation to self-identify provided by the Department. The Department estimated that it would take an \napprentice ($18.72 per hour) 5 minutes (0.08 hours) to complete the form. Furthermore, an administrative assistant \n($23.10 per hour) would need to spend 0.5 hour annually to record and keep the forms. This provision has a cost of \n$1.27 million in 2018 ((25,231 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 0.08 hour \u00d7 $18.72) + (25,231 \u00d7 0.5 hour \u00d7 $23.10)).\n\n \n\n  In subsequent years, all sponsors will be required to administer the invitation to self-identify twice: once to all \napplicants prior to the offer of apprenticeship, and once after the offer of apprenticeship to those who have been \nextended offers. The Department estimates that sponsors post 27 positions per year and receive 15 applicants per \nposting in 2019. Of those positions, the Department estimated that 27 offers of enrollment are made and 27 \napprentices choose to enroll. This requirement has an undiscounted second year (2019) cost of $17.47 million \n(26,606 \u00d7 ((15 applications \u00d7 27 job listings \u00d7 .08) + (27 offers of apprenticeship \u00d7 .08)) \u00d7 $18.72 + 26,606 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 \n$23.10). For the 10-year analysis period, this provision has an annualized cost of $16.76 million and $17.71 million \n\n\n\n(at 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).  (145)  In addition, all sponsors are required to remind \napprentices yearly that they can update their invitation to self-identify. The Department assumed that sponsors \nwould send out an annual reminder email beginning in 2018 at the cost of $49,168 (25,231 \u00d7 0.08 hour \u00d7 $23.10). \nWe repeated this calculation for each remaining year in the analysis period using the estimated number of sponsors \nfor each year. This provision in total has an annualized cost of $16.80 million and $17.75 million (at 7 percent and 3 \npercent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n  Lastly, we calculated the cost of affirmative action plan reviews for all sponsors. Assuming a two-year phase-in \nand the same time requirements for each element of the review, we estimate that, in 2018, the personnel process \nreview will cost $14.92 million (25,231 \u00d7 8 hours \u00d7 $73.90), the written affirmative action program review at the time \nof the compliance review will cost $4.47 million ((25,231 \u00d7 12 hours \u00d7 $73.90)/5 years between reviews), and the \nwritten affirmative action program review conducted within three years of the compliance review will cost $2.24 \nmillion ((25,231 \u00d7 6 hours \u00d7 $73.90)/5 years between reviews) for a total cost of $21.63 million. We repeated this \ncalculation for each remaining year in the analysis period using the estimated number of sponsors for each year, \nresulting in an annualized cost ranging from $21.82 million to $22.50 million with 7 percent and 3 percent \ndiscounting, respectively.\n\n \n\n  The remaining costs for this alternative are the same as for the Final Rule. The total 10-year costs of this \nalternative range from $589.29 million to $736.27 million (with 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n  d. Rely on Individuals Participating in the National Registered Apprenticeship System To Identify and Report \nPotential Cases of Discrimination\n\n \n\n  Under this alternative, individuals participating in the National Registered Apprenticeship System would be \nresponsible for identifying and reporting potential cases of discrimination to Registration Agencies, in contrast to \nboth the existing and the Final Rule's part 30 regulatory structures, which require Registration Agencies to monitor \nand enforce the EEO and affirmative action obligations via regular compliance reviews. This alternative reduces the \nburden on sponsors by relying on a complaint-based system.\n\n \n\n  Under this alternative, apprentices' rights for non-discrimination would still be protected, but Registration \nAgencies would have a more passive role in how they monitor and evaluate program sponsors' compliance with the \nregulations. OA and SAAs would still conduct compliance reviews (in \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 and existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.9) \nbut not as frequently.\n\n \n\n  Under this alternative, to identify when discrimination may be occurring and whether sponsors are violating the \nnon-discrimination and affirmative action requirements in the part 30 regulations, the Registration Agencies \nwould primarily rely on: (1) The complaints filed under \u00a7&thinsp;30.12 and existing \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 and self-\nevaluations from sponsors, and (2) a process where sponsors conduct a self-evaluation and report back to the \nRegistration Agency. The Department believes that this approach to regulating discrimination and non-\ncompliance with the part 30 regulations would not adequately prevent discrimination and promote equal \nopportunity in apprenticeship programs.\n\n \n\n  Registration Agencies under this alternative would provide sponsors with a format and process to conduct a self-\nevaluation relative to their compliance with these EEO regulations. Sponsors would then submit their self-evaluation \nto the Registration Agency for review and analysis. If the Registration Agency is satisfied with the findings from \nthe self-evaluation, the sponsor would be informed accordingly, and no additional actions would be necessary at \n\n\n\nthat time. If the Registration Agency's review of sponsor's self-evaluation identifies deficiencies, then the \nRegistration Agency would conduct an on-site review and provide technical assistance as appropriate.\n\n \n\n  These complaints and self-evaluations would serve as a \u201ctrigger\u201d for Registration Agencies to adopt a more \nactive role of visiting program sites to conduct compliance reviews and provide technical assistance, as appropriate.\n\n \n\n  The Department assumes that the SAA and OA would reduce the number of compliance reviews by 20 percent. \nTo calculate this cost savings, we multiplied the total number of sponsors (23,811 in 2017) by the percentage \ndecrease in reviews. This results in 952 fewer reviews in the first year (23,811 \u00d7 20 percent \u00d7 20 percent). We then \nmultiplied the total number of reviews by 50 percent assuming that the SAAs handle half the reviews and OA \nhandles the remaining half. Finally, we multiplied the total reduction in reviews for each agency (476 = 0.5 \u00d7 952) by \nthe hours needed to complete each review (40 hours) and by the human resource managers' wages ($62.33 and \n$64.71 per hour for the SAAs and OA respectively). The resulting cost savings in the first year is $1.19 million (476 \n\u00d7 $62.33 \u00d7 40) for SAAs and $1.23 million (476 \u00d7 $64.71 \u00d7 40) for OA. We repeated this calculation for each year \nusing the projected number of sponsors in each year. This results in an annualized savings for the SAAs of $1.42 \nmillion (with 7 percent discounting) to $1.44 million (with 3 percent discounting) and $1.48 million (with 7 percent \ndiscounting) to $1.50 million (with 3 percent discounting) for OA.\n\n \n\n  To estimate the cost of completing the self-evaluations, the Department assumes that each sponsor completes \none evaluation each year and that the sponsor will dedicate 8 hours to complete this review. We multiplied this \nlabor time by the hourly compensation rate of a human resource manager ($73.90) and by the total number of \nsponsors (23,811). The cost to the sponsors is thus $14.08 million (23,811 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 $73.90) in 2017. This \ncalculation was repeated according to the projected number of sponsors each year, with an annualized cost ranging \nfrom $16.92 million (with 7 percent discounting) to $17.12 million (with 3 percent discounting).\n\n \n\n  The self-evaluations will then be reviewed by either the SAAs or OA. The Department calculates this burden by \nassuming that half of the evaluations are completed by the SAAs and the rest are completed by OA; thus each \nagency reviews 11,906 (23,811 \u00d7 50 percent) evaluations in the first year. We multiplied the number of self-\nevaluations by the time needed to review the evaluation, 5 hours, and finally by the corresponding hourly \ncompensation rates ($62.33 and $64.71 for the SAAs and OA, respectively). The cost in 2017 is $3.71 million for \nthe SAAs and $3.88 million for OA. This calculation was repeated according to the projected number of sponsors \neach year, with an annualized cost of $4.49 million (with 7 percent discounting) to $4.54 million (with 3 percent \ndiscounting) for SAAs and $4.66 million (with 7 percent discounting) to $4.71 million (with 3 percent discounting) for \nOA.\n\n \n\n  Lastly, the Department estimated the cost of completing and reviewing the individual complaints. The apprentices \nwould be filling out these individual complaints and although the process existed in the 1978 rule, the Department \nexpects that through general outreach the number of complaints would increase by 100 per year. We assumed that \neach individual complaint takes 15 minutes to file (0.25 hours). We then multiplied the 0.25 hours by the hourly \ncompensation rate for an apprentice ($18.72) to estimate a labor cost of $4.68 and a total cost of $468 ($4.68 \u00d7 \n100) each year of the analysis period.  (146) \n\n \n\n  The Department again assumed that half of these complaints go to SAAs and half go to OA, or 50 complaints total \nfor each agency. To calculate the cost, we multiplied the time needed to review each complaint (8 hours) by 50 \ncomplaints and by the compensation rate for a human resource manager. The resulting cost in 2017 is $24,932 (50 \n\u00d7 8 \u00d7 $62.33) for the SAAs and $25,884 (50 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 $64.71) for OA. This calculation was repeated for the nine \nremaining years in the analysis period. The total 10-year costs of this alternative range from $183.08 million to \n$224.95 million (with 7 percent and 3 percent discounting, respectively).\n\n \n\n\n\n  e. Summary of Alternatives\n\n \n\n  Exhibit 6 below summarizes the monetized benefits, costs, and net present values for the alternatives discussed \nabove. We again use discount rates of 3 and 7 percent, respectively, to estimate the benefits, costs, and net \npresent values of the alternatives over the 10-year analysis period.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\n \n\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104-121 (March 29, 1996), requires federal agencies engaged in \nrulemaking to consider the impact of their proposals on small entities, consider alternatives to minimize that impact, \nand solicit public comment on their analyses.  (147)  The RFA requires the assessment of the impact of a regulation \non a wide range of small entities, including small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and small governmental \njurisdictions.\n\n \n\n  Agencies must perform a review to determine whether a proposed or final rule would have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. As part of a regulatory proposal, the RFA \nrequires a federal agency to prepare, and make available for public comment, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis \nthat describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities. Id. at 603(a). When an agency expects that a \nproposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on small entities, or the number of small entities impacted \nwould be less than substantial, the agency may certify those results to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA). Id. at 605(b). The certification must include a statement providing the factual basis \nfor the agency's determination. Id.\n\n \n\n  Based on the analysis below, the Department has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, under the RFA at \n5 U.S.C. 605(b), and certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities.\n\n \n\n  1. Classes of Small Entities\n\n \n\n  A small entity is one that is independently owned and operated and that is not dominant in its field of operation. 5 \nU.S.C. 601(3); 15 U.S.C. 632. The definition of small entity\n\n \n\n  varies from industry to industry to properly reflect industry size differences. 13 CFR 121.201. An agency must \neither use the SBA definition for a small entity or establish an alternative definition for the industry. Using SBA size \nstandards, the Department has conducted a small entity impact analysis on small entities in the five industry \ncategories with the most registered apprenticeship programs and for which data were available: Construction, \nManufacturing, Service, Transportation and Communication, and Trade.  (148)  These top five industry categories \naccount for 86 percent of the total number of apprenticeship sponsors who had active apprenticeships in FY 2015.  \n(149) \n\n \n\n  One industry, Public Administration, made the initial top-five list but is not included in this analysis because no \ndata on the revenue of small local jurisdictions were available. Local jurisdictions are classified as small when their \npopulation is less than 50,000. 5 U.S.C. 601(5).\n\n \n\n\n\n  Registered apprenticeship program sponsors may be employers, employer associations, industry associations, or \nlabor management organizations and, thus, may represent businesses, multiple businesses, and not-for-profit \norganizations. The requirements of the Final Rule, however, fall on the sponsor, and therefore we used sponsor \ndata to create the industry breakdowns.\n\n \n\n  The Department has adopted the SBA small business size standard for each of the five industry categories. Since \nthe industry categories include multiple NAICS sectors, some industry categories will reflect multiple SBA \ndefinitions. We accounted for industries included in each industry category. In broader NAICS categories, such as \nManufacturing (NAICS 31-33), the SBA has designated different standards for each six-digit NAICS code within the \nlarger category. The Department recorded these narrower standards in its analysis; in this document, we offer the \nlowest and most restrictive standard where multiple standards exist. We follow the SBA standards, which are based \non annual revenue for some industries and on number of employees for other industries.\n\n \n\n  The \u201cConstruction\u201d industry category follows NAICS exactly (NAICS 23) and, thus, we used the SBA definitions of \nrevenue less than or equal to $36.5 million for NAICS 236 and 237 and $15 million for NAICS 238. All sponsors \nincluded in the data fell into one of these three NAICS codes.\n\n \n\n  The \u201cManufacturing\u201d industry category includes the standard sector for Manufacturing (NAICS 31-33), but also \ncovers Logging (NAICS 113310); Sand, Gravel, Clay, and Ceramic and Refractory Minerals Mining and Quarrying \n(NAICS 21232); and Newspaper, Periodical, Book, and Directory Publishers (NAICS 5111). The corresponding \nSBA small size standards are as follows: Manufacturing\u2014500 employees or less; Newspaper, Periodical, Book, \nand Directory Publishers\u2014500 employees or less; Logging\u2014500 employees or less; Sand, Gravel, Clay, and \nCeramic\u2014500 employees or less; and Refractory Minerals Mining and Quarrying\u2014500 employees or less.  (150) \n\n \n\n  The \u201cService\u201d industry category covers the largest number of NAICS sectors, subsectors, and industries.  (151)  \nThe majority of these industries use the SBA small business size standard of revenue of less than or equal to $7.5 \nmillion, with the exception of Motion Picture and Video Production, which uses $32.5 million; and Dental \nLaboratories, which uses 500 employees or less.\n\n \n\n  The \u201cTransportation and Communication\u201d industry category includes transportation and warehousing (NAICS 48-\n49), Marinas (NAICS 713930), Other Nonhazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal (NAICS 562219), \nTelecommunication (NAICS 517), Radio and TV Broadcasting (NAICS 5151), and Utilities (NAICS 221). The SBA \nsize standard for these industries is revenue less than or equal to $7.5 million or 500 employees or less for \nTransportation and Warehousing and Marinas; $32.5 million or 1,500 employees or less for Telecommunication; \n$38.5 million for Other Nonhazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal; and $32.5 million for Radio and TV \nBroadcasting.  (152) \n\n \n\n  The \u201cTrade\u201d industry category includes Merchant Wholesalers, Nondurable Goods (NAICS 424) and Durable \nGoods (NAICS 423); Retail Trade (NAICS 44-45); Retail Bakeries (NAICS 311811); and Food Services and \nDrinking Places (NAICS 722). The associated SBA size standards are: Merchant Wholesalers, Nondurable Goods \nand Durable Goods\u2014less than or equal to 100 employees, Retail Trade\u2014revenue less than or equal to $7.5 \nmillion, Retail Bakeries\u2014less than or equal to 1,000 employees and Food Services and Drinking Places\u2014revenue \nless than or equal to $7.5 million.\n\n \n\n  SBA small business size standards are based on a comprehensive survey of industries, and are specific to each \nindustry. Because each industry category covers multiple sectors, each category includes several criteria that can \nbe used to identify small entities.  (153)  To determine the average number of employees by small entity, the \nrevenue per employee for a small entity, and the percent of entities that qualify as a small entity, the Department \nretrieved data on number of employees and annual revenue from ReferenceUSA, a business information provider, \n\n\n\nfor approximately 1,600 randomly selected companies. Using the SBA small business definitions and through this \ncategorization process, we determined that approximately 91 percent (or 1,459) of the sample are small entities.  \n(154) \n\n \n\n  2. Impact on Small Entities\n\n \n\n  The Department has estimated the incremental costs for small entities from the baseline of the 1978 Final Rule.  \n(155)  This analysis reflects the incremental cost of the Final Rule, as it adds to the requirements of the 1978 Final \nRule. Using available data, we have estimated the costs of the following provisions: posting of the equal opportunity \npledge, disseminating information about apprenticeship opportunities through universal outreach and recruitment, \nselected sponsors disseminating information about apprenticeship opportunities through targeted outreach, the time \nrequired to read and review the new regulatory requirements, offering periodic orientation and information sessions, \ndeveloping a form for individuals to self-identify a disability, conducting utilization and workforce analyses, and \nreviewing affirmative action plans.\n\n \n\n  To examine the impact of this rule on small entities, we evaluated the impact of the incremental costs on a \nhypothetical small entity of average size. The total number of workers for the average small entity in the different \nsectors is as follows, based on ReferenceUSA sample data: Construction, 15.0; Manufacturing, 132.7; Service, \n31.4; Transportation and Communication, 49.6; and Trade, 31.0.  (156) \n\n \n\n  Using 2015 data from ReferenceUSA we received revenue estimates for the sample of firms within each sector. \nThe data showed that small entities within each sector had the following average revenue: Construction, $3.10 \nmillion; Manufacturing, $92.74 million; Service, $1.58 million; Transportation and Communication, $39.14 million; \nand Trade, $11.48 million.\n\n \n\n  A significant economic burden results when the total incremental annual cost as a percentage of total average \nannual revenue is equal to or exceeds 3 percent.  (157)  Because the estimated annual burden of the Final Rule is \nless than 1 percent of the average annual revenue of each industry category, the Final Rule is not expected to \ncause a significant economic impact to small entities. These entities include individual employers, groups of \nemployers, labor management organizations, or industry associations that sponsor apprenticeships.\n\n \n\n  A provision-by-provision analysis of the estimated small entity impacts of the Final Rule is provided below.\n\n \n\n  3. Impacts of Final Rule Provisions\n\n \n\n  The following sections present the impacts that the Final Rule is estimated to have on small entities that sponsor \napprentices.  (158)  These include: posting of the equal opportunity pledge, disseminating information about \napprenticeship opportunities through universal outreach and recruitment to individuals with disabilities, \ndisseminating information about apprenticeship opportunities through targeted outreach and recruitment, reading \nand reviewing the new regulatory requirements, offering periodic orientation and information sessions, providing a \nform for individuals to self-identify a disability, conducting utilization and workforce analyses, and reviewing \naffirmative action plans.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimated the per-entity cost for each one of these changes from the baseline, that is, the 1978 \nFinal Rule. Because all the Final Rule provisions will have a similar impact on entities across economic sectors, we \ncalculated impacts to a representative single entity.  (159)  As explained in detail below, the total impact amounts to \napproximately $1,658.15 per affected small entity in the first year. Average annual cost per affected small entity in \n\n\n\nyears 2 through 10 is $2,098.23).  (160)  The analysis covers a 10-year period (2017 through 2026) to ensure it \ncaptures costs that accrue over time.\n\n \n\n  a. Posting of the Equal Opportunity Pledge\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule requires sponsors to post their equal opportunity pledge at each individual sponsor location, \nincluding on bulletin boards and through electronic media (\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2)). The 1978 Final Rule did not contain \na requirement for posting the pledge. This provision represents a cost to sponsors, and reflects the time needed to \nput up a physical copy of the pledge and post it on their Web site as well as the cost of the materials.\n\n \n\n  To estimate the labor cost of this provision, we assumed that it would take a sponsor 5 minutes (0.08 hours) to put \nup a physical copy of the pledge, and that this task would be performed by an administrative assistant at an \naverage hourly compensation rate of $23.10. We multiplied the time estimate for this provision by the average \nhourly compensation rate to obtain a total labor cost per sponsor of $1.85 ($23.10 \u00d7 0.08).\n\n \n\n  To estimate the materials cost, we assumed that the pledge is one page, and that the cost per page for \nphotocopying is $0.08, resulting in a materials cost of $0.08 ($0.08 \u00d7 1) per sponsor.\n\n \n\n  The Department also assumes it will take a sponsor 10 minutes (0.17 hours) to post the pledge on its Web site \nand that this task will be performed by a web developer at an hourly compensation rate of $45.24. The cost of \nposting the pledge on the sponsor's Web site is $7.69 ($45.24 \u00d7 0.17). Summing the labor and materials costs \nresults in an annual per-entity cost of $9.62 ($1.85 + $0.08 + $7.69) due to this provision.\n\n \n\n  b. Disseminate Information About Apprenticeship Opportunities Through Universal Outreach and Recruitment, \nIncluding to Individuals With Disabilities\n\n \n\n  Under the 1978 Final Rule, sponsors with five or more apprentices are required to develop and maintain an \naffirmative action program, which requires, among other things, outreach and recruitment of women and minorities. \nThe Final Rule requires that sponsors, in addition to contacting organizations that reach women and minorities, also \ncontact organizations that serve individuals with disabilities. Sponsors are required to develop a list of recruitment \nsources that generate referrals from all demographic groups, women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities, \nwith contact information for each source. Further, sponsors are required to notify these sources of any \napprenticeship opportunities, preferably with 30 days advance notice.\n\n \n\n  We assumed that the cost to sponsors to distribute the information about apprenticeship opportunities to \norganizations serving individuals with disabilities will be the labor cost. We also assumed that the labor for this \nprovision will be performed by a human resource manager and an administrative assistant with average hourly \ncompensation rates of $73.90 and $23.10, respectively.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimated that this dissemination task will take 0.5 hours of a human resource manager's time \nand 0.5 hours of an administrative assistant's time per targeted source. The cost of this provision per affected \nsponsor is, therefore, the time each staff member devotes to this task (0.5 hours for a human resource manager \nand 0.5 hours for an administrative assistant) multiplied by their associated average hourly compensation rates. \nThis calculation resulted in a total labor cost of $48.50 (($73.90 \u00d7 0.5) + ($23.10 \u00d7 0.5)) per source. This total labor \ncost is then multiplied by the number of outreach sources (5). The annual per-entity cost for this provision is \n$242.50 ($48.50 \u00d7 5) for each entity.\n\n \n\n\n\n  c. Disseminate Information About Apprenticeship Opportunities Through Targeted Outreach and Recruitment, \nIncluding to Individuals With Disabilities\n\n \n\n  In addition to the normal outreach, recruitment, and retention activities required of all sponsors under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b), the Final Rule requires sponsors of apprenticeship programs, whose utilization analyses revealed \nunderutilization of Hispanics or Latinos, women, or a particular racial minority group(s) and/or who have determined \npursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.7(f) that there are problem areas with respect to its outreach, recruitment, and retention \nactivities of individuals with disabilities, to engage in targeted outreach, as discussed in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8. We assume \nthat this additional outreach will happen in the same manner as the universal outreach discussed above.\n\n \n\n  This additional outreach, recruitment, and retention will be required for sponsors who employ five or more \napprentices and who are not effectively recruiting and retaining a particular underutilized group. We assume that 25 \npercent of all sponsors currently employ five or more apprentices, and are thus required to develop and maintain an \naffirmative action program.  (161)  However, the Department recognizes that some sponsors may already be \nemploying persons with disabilities as registered apprentices and, therefore, this analysis overestimates those who \nneed to set goals. Unfortunately, there are no available data on the number of sponsors who are employing persons \nwith disabilities as registered apprentices.\n\n \n\n  For this analysis, we assumed that the 25 percent of all sponsors employing five or more apprentices remains \nconstant throughout the 10-year analysis period. In reality, this percentage will fluctuate as sponsors take on new \napprentices and as apprentices complete their programs. We also expect that, over time, successful outreach will \nlead to more hiring of persons with disabilities and that sponsors will meet their recruitment goals and not be \nrequired to complete this additional outreach.\n\n \n\n  We assumed that the cost to sponsors to distribute information about apprenticeship opportunities to organizations \nserving individuals with disabilities will be the labor cost. We also assumed that the labor for this provision will be \nperformed by a human resource manager and an administrative assistant with average hourly compensation rates \nof $73.90 and $23.10, respectively.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimated that this dissemination task will take 0.5 hour of a human resource manager's time and \n0.5 hour of an administrative assistant's time per targeted source. A sensitivity analysis for a range of time spent \nconducting targeted outreach to organizations that serve individuals with disabilities is presented below. The cost of \nthis provision per affected sponsor is, therefore, the time each staff member devotes to this task (0.5 hour for a \nhuman resource manager and 0.5 hour for an administrative assistant) multiplied by their associated average hourly \ncompensation rates. This calculation results in a total labor cost of $48.50 (($73.90 \u00d7 0.5) + ($23.10 \u00d7 0.5)) per \nsource. This total labor cost is then multiplied by the number of outreach sources (5), yielding a cost per small entity \nof $242.50 ($48.50 \u00d7 5) beginning in 2019. The total number of estimated sponsors is 26,606 in 2019. We assume \nthat this additional outreach will occur 2 years after the Final Rule goes into effect.\n\n \n\n  d. Reading and Reviewing the New Regulatory Requirements\n\n \n\n  During the first year after implementation of the Final Rule, sponsors will need to learn about the new regulatory \nrequirements. We estimate this cost for a hypothetical small entity by multiplying the time required to read the new \nrule (4 hours) by the average hourly compensation rate of a human resources manager ($73.90, as calculated \nabove). Thus, the resulting cost per small entity is $295.60 ($73.90 \u00d7 4). This cost occurs only in the year after the \nFinal Rule is published.\n\n \n\n  e. Orientation and Periodic Information Sessions\n\n\n\n \n\n  Section \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(b)(2) requires each sponsor to conduct orientation and periodic information sessions for \napprentices and journeyworkers who directly supervise apprentices, and other individuals connected with the \nadministration or operation of the sponsor's apprenticeship program to inform and remind such individuals of the \nsponsor's equal employment opportunity policy with regard to apprenticeship and anti-harassment.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimated that in the first year a sponsor will hold one 45 minute regular orientation and \ninformation session with on average 24 apprentices ($18.72 per hour) and 24 journeyworkers ($31.68 per hour) in \n2017.  (162)  The Department estimated that a human resource manager ($73.90 per hour) would need to spend 2 \nhours to develop and prepare written materials for the session in the first year. The first-year cost per small entity is \n$1,110.43 ((24 \u00d7 0.75 \u00d7 $18.72) + (24 \u00d7 0.75 \u00d7 $31.68) + (1 \u00d7 (2.75) \u00d7 $73.90)). The average annual cost in year 2 \nthrough 10 per a small entity for this provision is $1197.83&thinsp; (163) \n\n \n\n  f. Invitation to Self-Identify as an Individual With a Disability\n\n \n\n  Section \u00a7&thinsp;30.11 requires sponsors to invite applicants for apprenticeship to voluntarily self-identify as an \nindividual with a disability protected by this part at two stages: (1) At the time they apply or are considered for \napprenticeship and (2) after they are accepted into the apprenticeship program but before they begin their \napprenticeship\n\n \n\n  Within the first two years of this program, sponsors with 5 or more apprentices will need to survey their current \nworkforce with the invitation to self-identify. The Department calculated that in 2018 the sponsor will survey an \naverage of 26 apprentices ($18.72) with an invitation to self-identify provided by the Department. Each apprentice \nwill spend 5 minutes (0.08 hour) filling out the form. The Department estimated an administrative assistant ($23.10 \nper hour) would need to spend 0.5 hour annually to record and keep the forms. The cost to the sponsor for this \nrequirement in 2018 is $50.49 (26 apprentices \u00d7 $18.72 \u00d7 0.08 hour) + (0.5 hour \u00d7 $23.10). In addition, the sponsor \nis required to remind apprentices yearly beginning in 2019 that they can update their invitation to self-identify. The \nDepartment assumed that the sponsor would send out a reminder email yearly at the cost of $1.85 (0.08 hour \u00d7 \n$23.10). The total cost of this provision to the sponsor in 2019 is $53.83 ($43.00 + $1.85). The average annual cost \nin year 2 through 10 per a small entity for this provision is $58.45.  (164) \n\n \n\n  g. Utilization Analysis and Goal Setting and Workforce Analysis\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule requires the Department to develop a tool for utilization analyses and provides one hour for \nsponsors to train a human resource manager ($73.90 per hour) on how to use the tool. This results in a one-time \ncost of $73.90 per small entity sponsor in 2018.\n\n \n\n  The Final Rule also requires sponsors with five or more apprentices to conduct the utilization analysis every five \nyears and the workforce analysis every two and a half years. The resulting cost per small entity is $7.39 for the \nutilization analysis (0.5 hour \u00d7 $73.90/5) in 2019. There will be a slight cost-saving for sponsors for conducting the \nworkforce analysis. For sponsors with five or more apprentices, this process is expected to take 2 hours of an HR \nmanager's time ($73.90 per hour) every 2.5 years compared to a baseline of 1 hour of an HR manager's time \nannually, for a net saving of 0.2 hours or $14.78 ($73.90 \u00d7 0.2 hours) per small entity per year. However, this cost \nsaving accruing only to sponsors with 5 or more apprentices was not accounted for in this analysis to conservatively \nestimate the costs to small entities.\n\n \n\n  h. Affirmative Action Plan Reviews\n\n \n\n\n\n  All sponsors are currently required to review their affirmative action plans annually. The Department estimates this \nprocess to take 8 hours of a human resource manager's ($73.90 per hour) time for a baseline cost of $591.20. \nUnder the Final Rule, with a two-year phase-in, an HR manager would spend 8 hours annually conducting a \npersonnel review, canceling out the baseline cost from 2018 forward. The Department also added the costs of \nconducting a written affirmative action plan update at the time of the compliance review every 5 years at 12 hours of \nan HR manager's time (12 \u00d7 $73.90/5) and conducting a written affirmative action plan update within three years of \nthe compliance review every 5 years at 6 hours of an HR manager's time (6 \u00d7 $73.90/5) for a net cost of $266.04 \n($177.36 + $88.68).\n\n \n\n  4. Total Cost Burden for Small Entities\n\n \n\n  For a hypothetical small entity in the top five industry categories, the first year cost of this rule is $1658.15 ($9.62 + \n$242.50 + $295.60 + $1110.43). Average annual cost in years 2 through 10 is $2,098.23 ($9.62 + $242.50 + \n$242.50 + $1197.83 + $58.45 + $7.39 + $73.90 + $266.04).\n\n \n\n  The total cost impacts, as a percent of revenue, are all well below the 3 percent threshold for determining a \nsignificant economic impact. The estimated cost impacts to apprenticeship sponsors for the first year, as a percent \nof revenue, are as follows: Construction, 0.053 percent; Manufacturing, 0.002 percent; Trade, 0.014 percent; \nService, 0.105 percent; and Transportation and Communication, 0.004 percent. None of these impacts for the first \nyear are close to 3 percent of revenues, even if considering only the high cost estimates. The estimated annual cost \nimpacts to apprenticeship sponsors are as follows: Construction, 0.068 percent; Manufacturing, 0.002 percent; \nTrade, 0.018 percent; Service, 0.133 percent; and Transportation and Communication, 0.005 percent. None of \nthese impacts are close to 3 percent of revenues. Exhibit 7 shows the estimated first year and annual cost impacts \nto apprenticeship sponsors by industry.\n\n \n\n  The Department estimates the Final Rule would have a significant economic impact on ten out of the 1,459 small \nentities in the sample from the top five industries. However, this accounts for 0.7 percent of the total number of \nsmall entities in the sample, which is less that the 15 percent threshold set to be considered as substantial number \nof small entities. As a result of this analysis, the Final Rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)\n\n \n\n  The purpose of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., includes minimizing the \npaperwork burden on affected entities. The PRA requires certain actions before an agency can adopt or revise a \ncollection of information, including publishing for public comment a summary of the collection of information and a \nbrief description of the need for and proposed use of the information.\n\n \n\n  As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, the Department conducts a \npreclearance consultation program to provide the public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on \nproposed and continuing collections of information in accordance with the PRA. See 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A). This \nactivity helps to ensure that the public understands the Department's collection instructions, respondents can \nprovide the requested data in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, \ncollection instruments are clearly understood, and the Department can properly assess the impact of collection \nrequirements on respondents.\n\n \n\n\n\n  A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless it is approved by OMB under the \nPRA and displays a currently valid OMB control number. The public is also not required to respond to a collection of \ninformation unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. In addition, notwithstanding any other \nprovisions of law, no person will be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if the \ncollection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control number (44 U.S.C. 3512).\n\n \n\n  In accordance with the PRA, the Department submitted the identified information collections associated with the \nNPRM to OMB when the NPRM was published. The NPRM provided an opportunity for the public to comment on \nthe information collections directly to the Department; commenters also were advised that comments under the \nPRA could be submitted directly to OMB. OMB issued a notice of action for each request asking the Department to \nresubmit the ICRs at the final rule stage and after considering public comments. The Department has submitted the \nrelated ICRs to OMB for approval; the reviews remain pending, and the Department will publish notices in the \nFederal Register to announce the results of those reviews once they are complete. The Department discusses the \npublic comments in this section of the preamble.\n\n \n\n  The Department received three comments concerning the paperwork requirements of this Final Rule. One \ncommenter questioned the overall need for the rule, claiming that organization was already required to comply with \nother equal employment opportunity rules and adding recordkeeping requirements would increase paperwork and \nresult in fewer potential sponsors of registered apprenticeship programs. The other two commenters also \nassociated an increase in paperwork associated with the rule. No commenter, however, quantified the claims.\n\n \n\n  One of the commenters offered suggestions for the substantive provisions. These are addressed in the analysis \nfor sections 30.3, 30.5, 30.7, 30.10, 30.11, and 30.12 in this preamble.\n\n \n\n  The Department acknowledges the final rule adds recordkeeping and paperwork requirements that may slightly \nincrease paperwork burden. However, this final rule reduces paperwork burden in other ways. More specifically the \nfinal rule, streamlines the workforce and utilization analysis required of sponsors with five or more apprentices and \nclarifies when and how utilization goals are to be established for women and minorities (\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5 through \n30.7); reduces the frequency with which the workforce and utilization analyses must be conducted\u2014from annually \nunder the existing rule to at the time of the compliance review for the utilization analysis (every five years on \naverage) and within three years of the compliance review for the workforce analysis (\u00a7&thinsp;30.12). The \nDepartment has reconsidered the paperwork burden estimates and determined the increased recordkeeping \nburdens are substantially offset by the reductions.\n\n \n\n  The information collections in this Final Rule are summarized as follows.\n\n \n\n  Agency: DOL-ETA.\n\n \n\n  Title of Collection: Labor Standards for the Registration of Apprenticeship Programs.\n\n \n\n  Type of Review: Revision.\n\n \n\n  OMB Control Number: 1205-0223.\n\n \n\n  Affected Public: State, Local, and Tribal Governments, Individuals or Households and Private Sector.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain a benefit.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 138,229.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 138,229.\n\n \n\n  Frequency of Responses: Annually.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 14,724.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0.\n\n \n\n  Regulations sections: \u00a7&thinsp;29.3, \u00a7&thinsp;29.7, \u00a7&thinsp;29.5, \u00a7&thinsp;29.13, \u00a7&thinsp;29.14, \n\u00a7&thinsp;29.6.\n\n \n\n  Overview and Response to Comments Received\n\n \n\n  Overview: Title 29 CFR 29.5 requires sponsors to meet apprenticeship standards to have a registered \napprenticeship program. This information collection package contains the ETA Form 671, Apprenticeship \nAgreement Form. The form has been modified to provide voluntary self-identification of an individual with a \ndisability. Such information is collected on a separate tear-off sheet that is maintained separately from the \nApprenticeship Agreement Form and treated as confidential.\n\n \n\n  The Department received no comments on this information collection.\n\n \n\n  Agency: DOL-ETA.\n\n \n\n  Title of Collection: Equal Employment Opportunity in Apprenticeship.\n\n \n\n  Type of Review: Revision.\n\n \n\n  OMB Control Number: 1205-0224.\n\n \n\n  Affected Public: State, Local, and Tribal Governments; Individuals or Households.\n\n \n\n  Obligation to Respond: Required to Obtain or Retain Benefits.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 19,277.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 34,490.\n\n \n\n  Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 3,219 hours.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $0.\n\n \n\n  Regulations sections: \u00a7&thinsp;30.3, \u00a7&thinsp;30.4, \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, \u00a7&thinsp;30.6, \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, \u00a7&thinsp;30.11, \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.16, \u00a7&thinsp;30.19.\n\n \n\n  Overview and Response to Comments Received\n\n \n\n  Overview: This information collection contains the requirements for SAAs to prepare State EEO plans conforming \nto the regulations, to maintain adequate records pertinent to compliance with the regulations, and to notify the \nDepartment of exemptions from the regulations granted to program sponsors.\n\n \n\n  The Department received no comments concerning this information collection.\n\n \n\n  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n \n\n  Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) establishes requirements for Federal \nagencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments, and on the private \nsector. This Final Rule does not impose any Federal mandates on any State, local, or tribal governments, or the \nprivate sector, within the meaning of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\n \n\n  Executive Order 13132: Federalism\n\n \n\n  As with the NPRM, the Department reviewed the Final Rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132. The \nrevisions to part 30 may have substantial direct effects on States and on the relationship between the Federal \ngovernment and the States. Although matters of Federalism in the National Registered Apprenticeship System are \nprimarily established through part 29, Labor Standards for Registration of Apprenticeship Programs, which \nestablishes the requirements for the recognition of SAAs as Registration Agencies, the proposed revisions to part \n30 also have direct effect on a State's method of administering registered apprenticeship for Federal purposes. In \nparticular, the Final Rule requires an SAA that seeks to obtain or maintain recognition as the Registration Agency \nfor Federal purposes, submit, at a minimum, draft State apprenticeship legislation corresponding to the \nrequirements of part 30, and requires all program sponsors registered with the State for Federal purposes to comply \nwith the State EEO plan. This NPRM also requires OA's Administrator to provide written concurrence on any \nsubsequent modifications to the State EEO plan, as provided in paragraph 29.13(b)(9) of this title. The Department \nhas determined that these requirements are essential to ensure that SAAs conform to the new requirements of part \n30, as a precondition for recognition.\n\n \n\n  In the development of this Rule, the Department included several mechanisms for consultation with State officials. \nIn 2010, OA conducted two listening sessions with members of the National Association of State and Territorial \nApprenticeship Directors (NASTAD), the organization representing apprenticeship officials from the District of \nColumbia, 26 States, and three Territories, to request the members' recommendations for updating part 30. \nAdditionally, as discussed earlier in the preamble, OA gave consideration to recommendations from the ACA, \nwhose membership includes representatives from NASTAD and the National Association of State Government \nLabor Officials (NAGLO). OA invited State officials to participate in a series of \u201ctown hall\u201d meetings and a webinar \nconducted in spring 2010 to elicit the agency's stakeholders' recommendations for updating part 30. The \nDepartment considered all of the issues raised in these fora, and incorporated many of them into the NPRM and \nthis Final Rule. Finally, the Department specifically solicited comments from State and local government officials on \nthe NPRM.\n\n\n\n \n\n  In response, the Department received several comments raising questions as to whether the provisions of the \nproposed rule, hereby adopted into the Final Rule, were in conflict with other State or Federal laws, including \nprincipally ERISA and state disability laws regarding self-identification inquiries. This Final Rule has addressed \nthese comments in the Section-by-Section analysis, specifying that no such conflict exists as to ERISA and no \nascertainable conflict exists as to State law. To the extent any such conflict exists, preemption shall be restricted to \nthe minimum level necessary to achieve the objectives of the National Apprenticeship Act.\n\n \n\n  Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families\n\n \n\n  The Department certifies that this Final Rule has been assessed according to \u00a7&thinsp;654 of Pub. L. 105-277, \n112 Stat. 2681, for its effect on family well-being. The Department concludes that this Final Rule will not adversely \naffect the well-being of the Nation's families. Rather, it should have a positive effect by safeguarding the welfare of \nregistered apprentices.\n\n \n\n  Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments\n\n \n\n  The Department has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 13175 and has determined \nthat it does not have \u201ctribal implications.\u201d This Final Rule does not \u201chave substantial direct effects on one or more \nIndian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power \nand responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian tribes.\u201d\n\n \n\n  Executive Order 12988: Civil Justice\n\n \n\n  This Final Rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, \nand will not unduly burden the Federal court system. This Final Rule has been written so as to minimize litigation \nand provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct, and has been reviewed carefully to eliminate drafting errors \nand ambiguities.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   List of Subjects\n\n  \n\n   Apprentice agreement and complaints, Apprenticeability criteria, Program standards, registration and \nderegistration, Sponsor eligibility, State Apprenticeship Agency recognition and derecognition.\n\n  \n\n   Administrative practice and procedure, Apprenticeship, Employment, Equal employment opportunity, Reporting \nand recordkeeping requirements, Training.\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n   Signed in Washington, DC.\n\n  \n\n   Portia Wu,\n\n  \n\n   Assistant Secretary, Employment and Training Administration.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Employment and Training Administration amends 29 CFR parts 29 \nand 30 as follows:\n\n \n\n  Part 29 Labor Standards for the Registration of Apprenticeship Programs\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Regulatory Text\n\n  \n\n   \n\n    1.

The purpose of this part is to promote equal opportunity for apprentices and applicants for \napprenticeship in registered apprenticeship programs by prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, \nnational origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, and disability. This part also \nprescribes affirmative action efforts sponsors must take to ensure equal opportunity for apprentices and applicants \nfor apprenticeship. The regulations set forth the equal opportunity obligations of sponsors, the contents of \naffirmative action programs, procedures for the filing and processing of complaints, and enforcement procedures. \nThese regulations also establish procedures for deregistration of an apprenticeship program in the event of \nnoncompliance with this part and prescribe the equal opportunity requirements for recognition of State \nApprenticeship Agencies (SAA) under part 29.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Applicability.

This assessment must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on \nthe most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an \nindividual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:\n\n  \n\n   (1) The duration of the risk;\n\n  \n\n   (2) The nature and severity of the potential harm;\n\n  \n\n   (3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and\n\n  \n\n   (4) The imminence of the potential harm.\n\n  \n\n   Disability&thinsp; (1)  means, with respect to an individual:\n\n  \n\n   (1) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;\n\n  \n\n   (2) A record of such an impairment; or\n\n  \n\n   (3) Being regarded as having such an impairment.\n\n  \n\n   EEO means equal employment opportunity.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   Electronic media means media that utilize electronics or electromechanical energy for the end user (audience) to \naccess the content; and includes, but is not limited to, electronic storage media, transmission media, the Internet, \nextranet, lease lines, dial-up lines, private networks, and the physical movement of removable/transportable \nelectronic media and/or interactive distance learning.\n\n  \n\n   Employer means any person or organization employing an apprentice whether or not such person or organization \nis a party to an Apprenticeship Agreement with the apprentice.\n\n  \n\n   Ethnicity, for purposes of recordkeeping and affirmative action, has the same meaning as under the Office of \nManagement and Budget's Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, or any \nsuccessor standards.

In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on a \nsponsor, factors to be considered include:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed under this part, taking into consideration the availability \nof tax credits and deductions, and/or outside funding;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable \naccommodation, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources;\n\n  \n\n   (iii) The overall financial resources of the sponsor, the overall size of the registered apprenticeship program with \nrespect to the number of apprentices, and the number, type and location of its facilities;\n\n  \n\n   (iv) The type of operation or operations of the sponsor, including the composition, structure and functions of the \nworkforce of such entity, and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or \nfacilities in question to the sponsor; and\n\n  \n\n   (v) The impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility, including the impact on the ability of other \napprentices to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.3\n\n  \n\n   Equal opportunity standards applicable to all sponsors.\n\n  \n\n   (a)(1) Discrimination prohibited. It is unlawful for a sponsor of a registered apprenticeship program to \ndiscriminate against an apprentice or applicant for apprenticeship on the basis of race, color, religion, national \norigin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability with regard to:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Recruitment, outreach, and selection procedures;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Hiring and/or placement, upgrading, periodic advancement, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, \nright of return from layoff, and rehiring;\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Rotation among work processes;\n\n\n\n  \n\n   (iv) Imposition of penalties or other disciplinary action;\n\n  \n\n   (v) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;\n\n  \n\n   (vi) Conditions of work;\n\n  \n\n   (vii) Hours of work and hours of training provided;\n\n  \n\n   (viii) Job assignments;\n\n  \n\n   (ix) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave; and\n\n  \n\n   (x) Any other benefit, term, condition, or privilege associated with apprenticeship.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Discrimination standards and defenses. (i) Race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or sexual orientation. In \nimplementing this section, the Registration Agency will look to the legal standards and defenses applied under title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. and Executive Order 11246, as applicable, in \ndetermining whether a sponsor has engaged in a practice unlawful under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Disability. With respect to discrimination based on a disability, the Registration Agency will apply the same \nstandards, defenses, and exceptions to the definition of disability as those set forth in title I of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12112 and 12113, as amended, and the implementing regulations promulgated by \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at 29 CFR part 1630, which include, among other things, \nthe standards governing reasonable accommodation, medical examinations and disability-related inquiries, \nqualification standards, and direct threat defense. The Interpretive Guidance on title I of the ADA set out as an \nappendix to part 1630 issued pursuant to title I may be relied upon for guidance in complying with the \nnondiscrimination requirements of this part with respect to the treatment of individuals with disabilities.\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Age. The Registration Agency will apply the same standards and defenses for age discrimination as those \nset forth in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. 623, and the implementing regulations \npromulgated by the EEOC at 29 CFR part 1625.\n\n  \n\n   (iv) Genetic information. The Registration Agency will apply the same standards and defenses for \ndiscrimination based on genetic information as those set forth in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act \n(GINA), 29 U.S.C. 2000ff et seq., and the implementing regulations promulgated by the EEOC at 29 CFR part 1635.\n\n  \n\n   (b) General duty to engage in affirmative action. For each registered apprenticeship program, a sponsor is \nrequired to take affirmative steps to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship. These steps must include:\n\n  \n\n   (1) Assignment of responsibility. The sponsor will designate an individual or individuals with appropriate authority \nunder the program, such as an apprenticeship coordinator, to be responsible and accountable for overseeing its \ncommitment to equal opportunity in registered apprenticeship, including the development and implementation of an \n\n\n\naffirmative action program as required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.4. The individual(s) must have the resources, support of, and \naccess to the sponsor leadership to ensure effective implementation. The individual(s) will be responsible for:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Monitoring all registered apprenticeship activity to ensure compliance with the nondiscrimination and affirmative \naction obligations required by this part;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Maintaining records required under this part; and\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Generating and submitting reports as may be required by the Registration Agency.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Internal dissemination of equal opportunity policy. The sponsor must inform all applicants for apprenticeship, \napprentices, and individuals connected with the administration or operation of the registered apprenticeship \nprogram of its commitment to equal opportunity and its affirmative action obligations. In addition, the sponsor must \nrequire that individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program take the \nnecessary action to aid the sponsor in meeting its nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations under this \npart. A sponsor, at a minimum, is required to:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Publish its equal opportunity pledge\u2014set forth in paragraph (c) of this section\u2014in the apprenticeship standards \nrequired under \u00a7&thinsp;29.5(c) of this title, and in appropriate publications, such as apprentice and employee \nhandbooks, policy manuals, newsletters, or other documents disseminated by the sponsor or that otherwise \ndescribe the nature of the sponsorship;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Post its equal opportunity pledge from paragraph (c) of this section on bulletin boards, including through \nelectronic media, such that it is accessible to all apprentices and applicants for apprenticeship;\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Conduct orientation and periodic information sessions for individuals connected with the administration or \noperation of the apprenticeship program, including all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with \napprentices, to inform and remind such individuals of the sponsor's equal employment opportunity policy with \nregard to apprenticeship, and to provide the training required by paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section; and\n\n  \n\n   (iv) Maintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with these requirements and make them available to \nthe Registration Agency upon request.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Universal outreach and recruitment. The sponsor will implement measures to ensure that its outreach and \nrecruitment efforts for apprentices extend to all persons available for apprenticeship within the sponsor's relevant \nrecruitment area without regard to race, sex, ethnicity, or disability. In furtherance of this requirement, the sponsor \nmust:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Develop and update annually a list of current recruitment sources that will generate referrals from all \ndemographic groups within the relevant recruitment area. Examples of relevant recruitment sources include: The \npublic workforce system's One-Stop Career Centers and local workforce investment boards; community-based \norganizations; community colleges; vocational, career and technical schools; pre-apprenticeship programs; and \nFederally-funded, youth job-training programs such as YouthBuild and Job Corps or their successors;\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (ii) Identify a contact person, mailing address, telephone number, and email address for each recruitment source; \nand\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Provide recruitment sources advance notice, preferably 30 days, of apprenticeship openings so that the \nrecruitment sources can notify and refer candidates. Such notification must also include documentation of the \nsponsor's equal opportunity pledge specified in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (4) Maintaining apprenticeship programs free from harassment, intimidation, and retaliation. The sponsor must \ndevelop and implement procedures to ensure that its apprentices are not harassed because of their race, color, \nreligion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability and to ensure \nthat its apprenticeship program is free from intimidation and retaliation as prohibited by \u00a7&thinsp;30.17. To promote \nan environment in which all apprentices feel safe, welcomed, and treated fairly, the sponsor must ensure the \nfollowing steps are taken:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Providing anti-harassment training to all individuals connected with the administration or operation of the \napprenticeship program, including all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with apprentices. This \ntraining must not be a mere transmittal of information, but must include participation by trainees, such as attending \na training session in person or completing an interactive training online. The training content must include, at a \nminimum, communication of the following:\n\n  \n\n   (A) That harassing conduct will not be tolerated;\n\n  \n\n   (B) The definition of harassment and the types of conduct that constitute unlawful harassment on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, and disability; \nand\n\n  \n\n   (C) The right to file a harassment complaint under \u00a7&thinsp;30.14 of this part.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Making all facilities and apprenticeship activities available without regard to race, color, religion, national \norigin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability except that if the sponsor provides \nrestrooms or changing facilities, the sponsor must provide separate or single-user restrooms and changing facilities \nto assure privacy between the sexes;\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Establishing and implementing procedures for handling and resolving complaints about harassment and \nintimidation based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic \ninformation, and disability, as well as complaints about retaliation for engaging in protected activity described in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.17 of this part.\n\n  \n\n   (5) Compliance with Federal and State equal employment opportunity laws. The sponsor must comply with all \nother applicable Federal and State laws and regulations that require equal employment opportunity without regard \nto race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity, as applicable), sexual \norientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability. Failure to comply with such laws if such \nnoncompliance is related to the equal employment opportunity of apprentices and/or graduates of such an \napprenticeship programs under this part is grounds for deregistration or the imposition of other enforcement actions \nin accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;30.15.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (c) Equal opportunity pledge. (1) Each sponsor of an apprenticeship program must include in its Standards of \nApprenticeship and apprenticeship opportunity announcements the following equal opportunity pledge:\n\n  \n\n   [Name of sponsor] will not discriminate against apprenticeship applicants or apprentices based on race, color, \nreligion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), sexual orientation, genetic information, or \nbecause they are an individual with a disability or a person 40 years old or older. [Name of sponsor] will take \naffirmative action to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship and will operate the apprenticeship program as \nrequired under Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 30.\n\n  \n\n   (2) The nondiscrimination bases listed in this pledge may be broadened to conform to consistent State and local \nrequirements. Sponsors may include additional protected bases but may not exclude any of the bases protected by \nthis part.\n\n  \n\n   (d)  Compliance.\n\n  \n\n   (1) Current sponsors: A sponsor that has a registered apprenticeship program as of the effective date of this \nregulation must comply with all obligations of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this rule.\n\n  \n\n   (2) New sponsors: A sponsor registering with a Registration Agency after the effective date of this regulation \nshall comply with all obligations of this section upon registration or 180 days after the effective date of this \nregulation, whichever is later.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.4\n\n  \n\n   Affirmative action programs.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Definition and purpose. As used in this part:\n\n  \n\n   (1) An affirmative action program is designed to ensure equal opportunity and prevent discrimination in \napprenticeship programs. An affirmative action program is more than mere passive nondiscrimination. Such a \nprogram requires the sponsor to take affirmative steps to encourage and promote equal opportunity, to create an \nenvironment free from discrimination, and to address any barriers to equal opportunity in apprenticeship. An \naffirmative action program is more than a paperwork exercise. It includes those policies, practices, and procedures, \nincluding self-analyses, that the sponsor implements to ensure that all qualified applicants and apprentices are \nreceiving an equal opportunity for recruitment, selection, advancement, retention and every other term and privilege \nassociated with apprenticeship. An affirmative action program should be a part of the way the sponsor regularly \nconducts its apprenticeship program.\n\n  \n\n   (2) A central premise underlying affirmative action is that, absent discrimination, over time a sponsor's \napprenticeship program, generally, will reflect the sex, race, ethnicity, and disability profile of the labor pools from \nwhich the sponsor recruits and selects. Consistent with this premise, affirmative action programs contain a \ndiagnostic component which includes quantitative analyses designed to evaluate the composition of the sponsor's \napprenticeship program and compare it to the composition of the relevant labor pools. If women, individuals with \ndisabilities, or individuals from a particular minority group, for example, are not being admitted into apprenticeship at \na rate to be expected given their availability in the relevant labor pool, the sponsor's affirmative action program must \n\n\n\ninclude specific, practical steps designed to address any barriers to equal opportunity that may be contributing to \nthis underutilization.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Effective affirmative action programs include internal auditing and reporting systems as a means of measuring \nthe sponsor's progress toward achieving an apprenticeship program that would be expected absent \ndiscrimination.\n\n  \n\n   (4) An affirmative action program also ensures equal opportunity in apprenticeship by incorporating the sponsor's \ncommitment to equality in every aspect of the apprenticeship program. Therefore, as part of its affirmative action \nprogram, a sponsor must monitor and examine its employment practices, policies and decisions and evaluate the \nimpact such practices, policies and decisions have on the recruitment, selection and advancement of apprentices. It \nmust evaluate the impact of its employment and personnel policies on minorities, women, and persons with \ndisabilities, and revise such policies accordingly where such policies or practices are found to create a barrier to \nequal opportunity.\n\n  \n\n   (5) The commitments contained in an affirmative action program are not intended and must not be used to \ndiscriminate against any qualified applicant or apprentice on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nsexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Adoption of affirmative action programs. Sponsors other than those identified in paragraph (d) of this section \nmust develop and maintain an affirmative action program, setting forth that program in a written plan. The \ncomponents of the written plan, as detailed in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5 through 30.9, must be developed in accordance with \nthe respective compliance dates and made available to the Registration Agency any time thereafter upon request.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Contents of affirmative action programs. An affirmative action program must include the following components \nin addition to those required of all sponsors by \u00a7&thinsp;30.3(a):\n\n  \n\n   (1) Utilization analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.5;\n\n  \n\n   (2) Establishment of utilization goals for race, sex, and ethnicity, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.6;\n\n  \n\n   (3) Utilization goals for individuals with disabilities, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.7;\n\n  \n\n   (4) Targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8;\n\n  \n\n   (5) Review of personnel processes, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.9; and\n\n  \n\n   (6) Invitations to self-identify, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;30.11\n\n  \n\n   (d) Exemptions\u2014(1) Programs with fewer than five apprentices. A sponsor is exempt from the requirements of \nparagraphs (b) and (c) of this section if the sponsor's apprenticeship program has fewer than five apprentices \nregistered, unless such program was adopted to circumvent the requirements of this section.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (2) Programs subject to approved equal employment opportunity programs. A sponsor is exempt from the \nrequirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if the sponsor both submits to the Registration Agency \nsatisfactory evidence that it is in compliance with an equal employment opportunity program providing for \naffirmative action in apprenticeship, including the use of goals for any underrepresented group or groups of \nindividuals, which has been approved as meeting the requirements of either title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nas amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and agrees to extend such program to include individuals with disabilities, or \nif the sponsor submits to the Registration Agency satisfactory evidence that it is in compliance with an equal \nemployment opportunity program providing for affirmative action in apprenticeship, including the use of goals for \nany underrepresented group or groups of individuals, which has been approved as meeting the requirements of \nboth Executive Order 11246, as amended, and section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 793), \nand their implementing regulations at title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 60: Provided, That \nprograms approved, modified or renewed subsequent to the effective date of this amendment will qualify for this \nexception only if the goals for any underrepresented group for the selection of apprentices provided for in such \nprograms are likely to be equal to or greater than the goals required under this part.\n\n  \n\n   (e) Written affirmative action plans. Sponsors required to undertake an affirmative action program must create \nand update a written document memorializing and discussing the contents of the program set forth in paragraph (c) \nof this section.\n\n  \n\n   (1) Compliance\u2014(i) Apprenticeship programs existing as of January 18, 2017. The initial written affirmative action \nplan for such programs must be completed within two years of January 18, 2017. The written affirmative action plan \nfor such programs must be updated every time the sponsor completes workforce analyses required by \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) and 30.7(d)(2).\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Apprenticeship programs registered after January 18, 2017. The initial written affirmative action plan for such \nprograms must be completed within two years of registration. The written affirmative action plan for such programs \nmust be updated every time the sponsor completes workforce analyses required by \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(b) and \n30.7(d)(2).\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.5\n\n  \n\n   Utilization analysis for race, sex, and ethnicity.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Purpose. The purpose of the utilization analysis is to provide sponsors with a method for assessing whether \npossible barriers to apprenticeship exist for particular groups of individuals by determining whether the race, sex, \nand ethnicity of apprentices in a sponsor's apprenticeship program is reflective of persons available for \napprenticeship by race, sex, and ethnicity in the relevant recruitment area. Where significant disparity exists \nbetween availability and representation, the sponsor will be required to establish a utilization goal pursuant to \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.6.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Analysis of apprenticeship program workforce\u2014(1) Process. Sponsors must analyze the race, sex, and ethnic \ncomposition of their apprentice workforce. This is a two-step process. First, each sponsor must group all \napprentices in its registered apprenticeship program by occupational title. Next, for each occupation represented, \nthe sponsor must identify the race, sex, and ethnicity of its apprentices within that occupation.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Schedule of analyses. Each sponsor is required to conduct an apprenticeship program workforce analysis at \neach compliance review, and again if and when three years have passed without a compliance review. This \n\n\n\nupdated workforce analysis should be compared to the utilization goal established at the sponsor's most recent \ncompliance review to determine if the sponsor is underutilized, according to the process in paragraph (d) of this \nsection.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Compliance date. (i) Sponsors registered with a Registration Agency as of January 18, 2017: A sponsor must \nconduct its first workforce analysis, pursuant to this section, no later than two years after January 18, 2017.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) New sponsors: A sponsor registering with a Registration Agency after the effective date of the Final Rule \nmust conduct its initial workforce analysis pursuant to this section no later than two years after the date of \nregistration.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Availability analysis\u2014(1) The purpose of the availability analysis is to establish a benchmark against which the \ndemographic composition of the sponsor's apprenticeship program can be compared in order to determine whether \nbarriers to equal opportunity may exist with regard to the sponsor's apprenticeship program.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Availability is an estimate of the number of qualified individuals available for apprenticeship by race, sex, and \nethnicity expressed as a percentage of all qualified persons available for apprenticeship in the sponsor's relevant \nrecruitment area.\n\n  \n\n   (3) In determining availability, the following factors must be considered for each major occupation group \nrepresented in the sponsor's registered apprenticeship program standards:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The percentage of individuals who are eligible for enrollment in the apprenticeship program. within the \nsponsor's relevant recruitment area broken down by race, sex, and ethnicity; and\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The percentage of the sponsor's employees who are eligible for enrollment in the apprenticeship program \nbroken down by race, sex, and ethnicity.\n\n  \n\n   (4) In determining availability, the relevant recruitment area is defined as the geographical area from which the \nsponsor usually seeks or reasonably could seek apprentices. The sponsor must identify the relevant recruitment \narea in its written affirmative action plan. The sponsor may not draw its relevant recruitment area in such a way as \nto have the effect of excluding individuals based on race, sex, or ethnicity from consideration, and must develop a \nbrief rationale for selection of that recruitment area.\n\n  \n\n   (5) Availability will be derived from the most current and discrete statistical information available. Examples of \nsuch information include census data, data from local job service offices, and data from colleges or other training \ninstitutions.\n\n  \n\n   (6) Sponsors, working with the Registration Agency, will conduct availability analyses at each compliance review.\n\n  \n\n   (d) Rate of utilization. To determine the rate of utilization, the sponsor, working with the Registration Agency, \nmust group each occupational title in its apprenticeship workforce by major occupation group and compare the \nracial, sex, and ethnic representation within each major occupation group to the racial, sex, and ethnic \nrepresentation available in the relevant recruitment area, as determined in paragraph (c) of this section. When the \nsponsor's utilization of women, Hispanics or Latinos, or a particular racial minority group is significantly less than \n\n\n\nwould be reasonably expected given the availability of such individuals for apprenticeship, the sponsor must \nestablish a utilization goal for the affected group in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7&thinsp;30.6. \nSponsors are not required or expected to establish goals where no significant disparity in utilization rates has been \nfound.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.6\n\n  \n\n   Establishment of utilization goals for race, sex, and ethnicity.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Where, pursuant to \u00a7&thinsp;30.5, a sponsor is required to establish a utilization goal for a particular racial, \nsex, or ethnic group in a major occupation group in its apprenticeship program, the sponsor, working with the \nRegistration Agency, must establish a percentage goal at least equal to the availability figure derived under \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5(c) for that major occupation group.\n\n  \n\n   (b) A sponsor's determination under \u00a7&thinsp;30.5 that a utilization goal is required constitutes neither a finding \nnor an admission of discrimination.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Utilization goals serve as objectives or targets reasonably attainable by means of applying every good faith \neffort to make all aspects of the entire affirmative action program work. Utilization goals are used to measure the \neffectiveness of the sponsor's outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.\n\n  \n\n   (d) In establishing utilization goals, the following principles apply:\n\n  \n\n   (1) Utilization goals may not be rigid and inflexible quotas, which must be met, nor are they to be considered \neither a ceiling or a floor for the selection of particular groups as apprentices. Quotas are expressly forbidden.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Utilization goals may not provide a sponsor with a justification to extend a preference to any individual, select \nan individual, or adversely affect an individual's status as an apprentice, on the basis of that person's race, sex, or \nethnicity.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Utilization goals do not create set-asides for specific groups, nor are they intended to achieve proportional \nrepresentation or equal results.\n\n  \n\n   (4) Utilization goals may not be used to supersede eligibility requirements for apprenticeship. Affirmative action \nprograms prescribed by the regulations of this part do not require sponsors to select a person who lacks \nqualifications to participate in the apprenticeship program successfully, or select a less-qualified person in \npreference to a more qualified one.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.7\n\n  \n\n   Utilization goals for individuals with disabilities.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Utilization goal. The Administrator of OA has established a utilization goal of 7 percent for employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities as apprentices for each major occupation group within which the sponsor has \nan apprenticeship program.\n\n\n\n  \n\n   (b) Purpose. The purpose of the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section is to establish a \nbenchmark against which the sponsor must measure the representation of individuals with disabilities in the \nsponsor's apprentice workforce by major occupation group. The goal serves as an equal opportunity objective that \nshould be attainable by complying with all of the affirmative action requirements of this part.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Periodic review of goal. The Administrator of OA will periodically review and update, as appropriate, the \nutilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (d) Utilization analysis\u2014(1) Purpose. The utilization analysis is designed to evaluate the representation of \nindividuals with disabilities in the sponsor's apprentice workforce grouped by major occupation group. If individuals \nwith disabilities are represented in the sponsor's apprentice workforce in any given major occupation group at a rate \nless than the utilization goal, the sponsor must take specific measures outlined in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this \nsection.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Apprentice workforce analysis\u2014(i) Process. Sponsors are required to analyze the representation of individuals \nwith disabilities within their apprentice workforce by occupation. This is a two-step process. First, as required in \n\u00a7&thinsp;30.5, each sponsor must group all apprentices in its registered apprenticeship program according to the \noccupational titles represented in its registered apprenticeship program. Next, for each occupation represented, the \nsponsor must identify the number of apprentices with disabilities.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Schedule of evaluation. The sponsor must conduct its apprentice workforce analysis at each compliance \nreview, and again if and when three years have passed without a compliance review. This updated workforce \nanalysis, grouped according to major occupation group, should then be compared to the utilization goal established \nunder paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Compliance date. (A) Sponsors currently registered with a Registration Agency: A sponsor must conduct its \nfirst workforce analysis, pursuant to this section, no later than two years after January 18, 2017.\n\n  \n\n   (B) New sponsors: A sponsor registering with a Registration Agency after January 18, 2017 must conduct its \ninitial workforce analysis pursuant to this section no later than two years after the date of registration.\n\n  \n\n   (e) Identification of problem areas. When the sponsor, working with the Registration Agency, determines that the \npercentage of individuals with disabilities in one or more major occupation groups within which a sponsor has \napprentices is less than the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor must take steps \nto determine whether and/or where impediments to equal opportunity exist. When making this determination, the \nsponsor must look at the results of its assessment of personnel processes required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.9 and the \neffectiveness of its outreach and recruitment efforts required by \u00a7&thinsp;30.8 of this part, if applicable.\n\n  \n\n   (f) Action-oriented programs. The sponsor must undertake action-oriented programs, including targeted outreach, \nrecruitment, and retention activities identified in \u00a7&thinsp;30.8, designed to correct any problem areas that the \nsponsor identified pursuant to its review of personnel processes and outreach and recruitment efforts.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (g) Utilization goal relation to discrimination. A determination that the sponsor has not attained the utilization \ngoal established in paragraph (a) of this section in one or more major occupation groups does not constitute either \na finding or admission of discrimination in violation of this part.\n\n  \n\n   (h) Utilization goal not a quota or ceiling. The utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section must not \nbe used as a quota or ceiling that limits or restricts the employment of individuals with disabilities as apprentices.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;30.8\n\n  \n\n   Targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Minimum activities required.
