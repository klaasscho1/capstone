{"title": "'In-State' Tuition for Illegal Immigrants at the Expense of Americans", "body": "\nFeb 16, 2017( Western Free Press: http://www.westernfreepress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  On Tuesday, \nFebruary 07, 2017, Ed Lee, Mayor of San Francisco, released an announcement; a plan to provide access to free \ncollege[1] for San Francisco residents. It received media attention. Some people praised his decision while others \nwere reminded that San Francisco is still a sanctuary city in defiance of President Trump's orders. When Trump \nannounced that city officials who chose not to comply with such orders would lose federal funding, San Francisco \nfiled a lawsuit against the president (City and County of San Francisco v. Donald J. Trump[2]). The city stood firm \non its refusal to follow the president's orders. \n\nWith illegal immigration being such a debated topic, the logical question that follows that decision is: will \nundocumented students receive free college as well? It is important to get clear answers. So, let us explore the law. \nEach year, millions of students graduate from American high schools. Among those graduates, about 65,000 are \nundocumented[3] students. In 1982, the Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe decided that all students, regardless of \ntheir immigration status, were guaranteed a K-12 education. At the time, the Court's decision did not extend to \nhigher education. Over the years, many states changed their policies to allow undocumented students to attend \ncolleges and universities, and after 2001, 18 states\u2014California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, \nMaryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, \nWashington, and Wisconsin\u2014passed legislation[4] offering in-state tuition rates to undocumented students. \nWisconsin revoked its law in 2011. But what does the law say today? Do states allow undocumented immigrants \nto be considered for in-state college tuition rates while Americans and lawful residents have to pay out-of-state \ntuition? The simple answer is: Yes*. Since 2012, Democrats have managed to implement policies that provide \nadvantages and financial benefits to undocumented students at the expense of Americans. Obviously, these \npolicies have not served as a deterrent, on the contrary; they have fostered an environment that invites immigrants \nto flock to this country illegally instead of following the proper immigration route.  Fibonacci Blue [5]/cc-by-2.0 [6] \nMany people have expressed their discontent with the fact that the government sets restrictions for out-of-state \nstudents, yet allows illegal immigrants to access opportunities that are otherwise unavailable for American citizens \nand lawful residents. For example, students in the state of Washington, who were admitted to colleges in \nCalifornia, Colorado, and Michigan, were discouraged by the fact that they were required to pay out-of-state tuition \n\u2014which made it unaffordable\u2014 so they had to settle for other options. This is an unfair policy that perpetuates an \nalready unmanageable situation. Those students who spoke to me, said: 'I am an American citizen. I have lived \nhere my entire life, I should be given priority.' Others, who came as international students and later became lawful \nresidents, said: 'I came here legally. I followed the rules and I obeyed the law, but I could have come illegally and I \nwould have a better deal right now.' 'I came here on a proper Visa, but it seems as if by showing up at the border \nwithout papers, you get access to everything; cheaper college, legal representation, and other benefits, so why did I \ngo through all this trouble then?' Proper immigration procedures are lengthy and costly, and if people can come \nhere illegally and receive a benefit for it, why would they not? After all, these policies have become a way to reward \ncriminal behavior. To this day, Americans cannot come to terms with the fact that previous administrations chose to \ngive preference to illegal immigrants while they neglected every American who attended college in a different \nstate. I contend that if undocumented students are able to access in-state tuition rates, then every American and \n\n\nlawful resident should receive the same benefit. If these policies are to continue, I would invite readers to contact \ntheir representatives and demand that every student who has paid out-of-state tuition be reimbursed for it. It is \nonly fair. Public officials should not be allowed to disregard the voices of millions of Americans who are against \nthese policies. Our representatives are here to serve people, not to reward illegal immigrants for breaking the law. \nGiven that the reward of coming here illegally is greater than the risk, one has to wonder if President Trump's \nadministration will be able to address this issue, but we certainly hope that he will deliver the promises he made \nthroughout his campaign despite the resistance he encounters.

Therefore, undocumented students pay into institutional \naid but cannot access need-based assistance.11 District of Columbia The District of Columbia has not introduced \nlegislation to provide in-state tuition or financial aid to undocumented students. The District of Columbia does not \ngrant or prohibit in-state tuition for undocumented students at the University of the District of Columbia\u2014currently \nthe only public university in Washington, D.C.  Delaware In 2014, the Delaware Senate proposed S.B. 183, which \nwould have allowed undocumented students to pay in-state tuition if they attended a Delaware secondary \neducational institution for three years.

The Georgia \nGeneral Assembly passed S.B. 492 in 2008, which bars unauthorized immigrant students from in-state tuition \nbenefits.14 The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia adopted policy 4.1.6 in 2010 that prohibits \nmost selective institutions\u2014schools that admit fewer than apply\u2014from admitting undocumented students.15 The \nGeorgia Board of Regents states that immigrants with 'lawful presence' can receive in-state tuition. Although the \nDepartment of Homeland Security confers 'lawful presence' to DACA recipients, the Georgia Board of Regents \ndoes not recognize this and denies these students in-state tuition and enrollment in selective colleges and \nuniversities.16 Hawaii  In-state tuition and financial aid are available for undocumented students. In 2013, the \nHawaii State Legislature passed Hawaii Statute 304A-402, giving the University of Hawaii Board of Regents power \n\n\n\nto waive or reduce tuition fees for nonresidents.

It is the first time a state DREAM Act was approved \ndirectly by voters. Maryland is the only state that requires undocumented students to attend community college first \nbefore they receive in-state tuition benefits at four-year public colleges and universities.  Massachusetts In 2011, \nthe Massachusetts legislature proposed S.B. 577 and H.B. 1078. The bills would have allowed undocumented \nstudents to pay in-state tuition if they met residency requirements.28 Work permits make individuals eligible for in-\nstate tuition regardless of immigration status.  Michigan  Michigan has no set policy that allows undocumented \nstudents access to in-state tuition.

If they cannot confirm immigration status, this law requires schools to report students to \nimmigration authorities. The law explicitly denies admission and financial aid to undocumented students.33 After \n2014, university authorities declared that it is not bound by L.R. 121 and intends to admit eligible students \nregardless of their immigration status.  Nebraska In-state tuition is available for undocumented students. The \n\n\n\nNebraska Legislature passed L.B. 239 in 2006, which allows qualifying undocumented students to pay in-state \ntuition.34  Nevada The Nevada Senate proposed S.B. 415 in 2007, which would have banned undocumented \nstudents from paying in-state tuition and receiving state financial aid, including the Governor Guinn Millennium \nScholarship Program.35 Undocumented students are eligible for the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship \nProgram, which offers as much as $10,000 in financial aid.

However, NCCCS reversed its decision that same year when the Department of Homeland \nSecurity advised that admission of undocumented students was not illegal under federal law. In 2011, the NCCCS \nadded code 1D SB CCC 400.2 'Admission to College,' which officially states that the NCCCS colleges can admit \nundocumented students, but they must pay out-of-state tuition.43  North Dakota  North Dakota has not introduced \nlegislation to provide in-state tuition or financial aid to undocumented students.
