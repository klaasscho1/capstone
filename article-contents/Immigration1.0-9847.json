{"title": "The Stock Scam Has Many Faces", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Welcome to America, and to Stock Fraud\" (front page, May 15):\n\n     Affinity fraud affects more than recent immigrants to the United States. \n\nState securities regulators are also troubled by the rise of religious affinity fraud. Hundreds of millions of dollars \nhave been lost in scams like the Florida-based Greater Ministries International, a so-called gifting program that was \nin fact a vast Ponzi scheme (estimated losses: nearly half a billion dollars). \n\n Earlier this year, the leaders of Greater Ministries were convicted of conspiracy and fraud and face prison terms, \nyet the problem continues to grow. Witness the criminal case involving the Baptist Foundation of Arizona (losses of \nmore than $600 million). The lesson: Whether you hear it from your pastor or from a parishioner, if something \nsounds too good to be true, it is.\n\nMARC BEAUCHAMP\n\nExecutive Director\n\nNorth American Securities\n\nAdministrators Association\n\nWashington, May 15, 2001\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
