{"title": "Mayor Renews Talks On Immigrant Policy", "body": "\nJust minutes before members of the City Council planned to declare an impasse yesterday in their efforts to get \nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg to amend a policy on how city workers should deal with illegal immigrants, the \nmayor called them back to the negotiating table.\n\n     Mayor Bloomberg's decision to personally call one of his most outspoken critics on the issue, Councilman Hiram \nMonserrate of Queens, and to form a new group to try once more to reach a compromise reflects how politically \nsensitive the matter has become for him. \n\n For years the city forbade its workers from disclosing information on a person's immigration status to federal \nauthorities, so as not to discourage illegal immigrants from reporting crimes, seeking medical help or getting other \nvital services. But after Congress changed the law, a federal court ruled that the city's policy was illegal. \n\nSo the mayor issued a new policy, effectively replacing the old \"don't tell\" one with a new \"don't ask\" one in all but \na few cases. But the outcry that greeted the decision might be enough by itself to frighten people without green \ncards from seeking city services. So he agreed to amend the policy. So far efforts to find common ground with the \nCouncil have failed. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
