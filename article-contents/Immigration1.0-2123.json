{"title": "Asian Immigrants Help New York Thrive;Apology Demanded", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs an elected member of the New York City Council, Julia Harrison should acknowledge the contributions that \nAsians have made to Flushing, Queens, which is now a vitally thriving business center. She should be trying to \nbring about a good working relationship among the diverse populations that live in her district. Instead, she lights a \nfire where none existed before and castigates and denigrates all Asian-Americans (front page, March 31).\n\nYou report that she alludes to Asians as \"criminal smugglers,\" \"robbers\" and \"paupers,\" and \"talks about rude \nmerchants and illegal aliens.\" She says that the arrival of Asian-American businesses was \"an invasion, not an \nassimilation.\"\n\nAsian-Americans are only 12.3 percent of the registered voters in the 20th Council District, and many more are \npolitically apathetic. Still, the Asian-American community demands a public apology from Mrs. Harrison. The City \nCouncil should condemn her statements in a public session. And all Asian-Americans should take note and vote.\n \nJOSEPHINE CHUNG\n\nNew York, April 3, 1996\n \n\nThe writer is president of the New York chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans.\n \n"}
