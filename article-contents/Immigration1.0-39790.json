{"title": "Political Conditions Greece", "body": "\nPolitical Chronology from the post-Civil War era to the 1980s:\n\nAfter the 1944-1949 Greek civil war, Greece sought to join the Western democracies and became a member of \nNATO in 1952. From 1952 until late 1963, Greece was governed by conservative parties, the Greek Rally of \nMarshal Alexandros Papagos and its successor, the National Radical Union, or ERE, of Constantine Karamanlis. In \n1963, the Center Union Party of George Papandreou was elected and governed until July 1965. It was followed by \na succession of unstable coalition governments.\n\nOn April 21, 1967, just before scheduled elections, a group of colonels led by Colonel George Papadopoulos seized \npower in a coup d'etat. Civil liberties were suppressed, special military courts were established, and political parties \nwere dissolved. Several thousand political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands. In \nNovember 1973, following an uprising of students at the Athens Polytechnic University, General Dimitrios Ioannides \nreplaced Papadopoulos and tried to continue the dictatorship.\n\nGeneral Ioannides' attempt in July 1974 to overthrow Archbishop Makarios, the president of Cyprus, brought \nGreece to the brink of war with Turkey, which invaded Cyprus and occupied part of the island. Senior Greek military \nofficers then withdrew their support from the junta, which toppled. Leading citizens persuaded Constantine \nKaramanlis to return from exile in France to establish a government of national unity until elections could be held. \nKaramanlis' newly organized party, New Democracy, or ND, won the elections held in November 1974, and he \nbecame prime minister.\n\nFollowing the 1974 referendum that resulted in the rejection of the monarchy, parliament approved a new \nconstitution on June 19, 1975. The parliament then elected Constantine Tsatsos president of the republic. In the \n1977 parliamentary elections, New Democracy again won a majority of seats. In May 1980, Prime Minister \nKaramanlis was elected to succeed Tsatsos as president. George Rallis was then chosen party leader and \nsucceeded Karamanlis as prime minister.\n\nPolitical Chronology from 1980s to 2000:\n\nIn 1981, Greece became the 10th member of the European Community, which is now known as the European \nUnion or EU. In parliamentary elections held on Oct. 18, 1981, Greece elected its first socialist government when \n\n\nthe Panhellenic Socialist Movement, also known as PASOK, led by Andreas Papandreou, won 172 of 300 seats. \nOn March 29, 1985, after Prime Minister Papandreou declined to support President Karamanlis for a second term, \nthe Greek parliament elected Supreme Court Justice Christos Sartzetakis as president and head of state.\n\nGreece had two rounds of parliamentary elections in 1989, both of which produced weak coalition governments with \nlimited mandates. Party leaders withdrew their support in February 1990, and elections were held on April 8. In the \nApril 1990 election, \"Nea Dimokratia\" (New Democracy or ND) won 150 seats and subsequently gained two others. \nThe new prime minister, Mitsotakis, fired his first foreign minister, Andonis Samaras, in 1992; Samaras then formed \nhis own political party, Political Spring. A split between Mitsotakis and Samaras led to the collapse of the New \nDemocracy government and new elections in September 1993.\n\nIn October 1993, Papandreou was re-elected prime minister when PASOK won 170 seats. After his election, Prime \nMinister Papandreou focused on improving Greece's relations with its northern neighbors. The PASOK government \nalso reversed two major privatization projects undertaken by Mitsotakis involving the national telephone system and \nthe Athens bus system.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1996, following a protracted illness, Prime Minister Papandreou resigned and was replaced by former \nMinister of Industry, Costas Simitis. In elections held in September 1996, Costas Simitis was elected prime minister \nafter PASOK won 162 parliamentary seats over New Democracy's 108 seats.\n\nThe Simitis government faced severe opposition to its fiscally strict budget, which was devised to obtain Greek \nentry into the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU. Throughout 1997, millions of public workers went on strike \nprotesting the PASOK government's economic program.\n\nPrime Minister Costas Simitis called for elections in April 2000 - six months before the end of the maximum term of \nfour years. The Simitis government had been in office during several major foreign policy events and had also \noverseen significant domestic political and economic developments.\n\nTwo major foreign policy events in particular affected the Simitis government's popularity and the electoral fortune \nof  PASOK. First, Greece had participated in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization action against its neighbor Serbia \nfrom March until June 1999, despite widespread domestic opposition to the war. Second, following the Abdullah \nOcalan affair, there was an initial deterioration of relations with Turkey. In brief, Greece attempted to harbor Ocalan, \nthe leader of the Kurdish rebels, whom the Turks wanted to stand trial. Greek-Turkish relations subsequently \nimproved after Greece and Turkey provided mutual aid after each experienced devastating earthquakes (in August \nand September 1999). The substantial diplomatic rapprochement led Greece to be somewhat more accepting of \nTurkey's possible future accession to the European Union, historically a point of much contention. Relations \nbetween Greece and Turkey have also been affected by developments in Cyprus  -- a matter which will be \ndiscussed below.\n\nOn the domestic front, the Simitis government had overseen the steady improvement of the Greek economy, after \nimplementing unpopular economic reforms, and had applied for membership in the Economic and Monetary Union, \nor EMU, which would allow Greece to adopt the European single currency, the euro. Greece wanted to join the \nEMU in 1999, but failed to meet the economic criteria (limits on the budget deficit, public debt and inflation) \nnecessary for membership. \n\nPolitical Developments from 2000 to 2004\n\nIn 2000, while the Simitis government enjoyed popular support, PASOK faced substantial competition from the \nconservative New Democracy.\n\nPASOK maintained its parliamentary majority in the April 2000 elections, winning 43.8 percent of the vote and, due \nto the reinforced proportional representation electoral system, 162 of the 300 seats in parliament. New Democracy, \n\n\n\nhowever, substantially increased its electoral fortunes from the 1996 elections, winning 42.7 percent of the vote for \n125 seats, having previously won 38.1 percent and 108 seats.  The \"Kommounistiko Komma Ellados,\" the \n(Communist Party of Greece or KKE), won 5.5 percent of the vote and kept its 11 parliamentary seats. The socialist \n\"Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu,\" the Coalition of the Left and Progress or SIN, experienced something of a \ndecrease in electoral support, winning 3.2 percent of the vote and six seats, having won 5.1 percent and six seats in \n1996. The socialist \"Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima\" (the Democratic Socialist Movement or DIKKI) also failed to \nimprove its electoral standing, winning only 2.7 percent of the vote and no seats, after winning 4.4 percent and nine \nseats in 1996.\n\nA major goal of the Simitis government was met when Greece was formally accepted into the EMU on Jan. 1, 2001. \nThe decision to allow Greece entry was reached at a meeting of EU finance ministers in June 2000. As noted \nabove, the Simitis government had implemented a number of austerity measures to bring the Greek economy more \ninto line with the other members of the EMU. While attaining EMU membership was a great success for the Simitis \ngovernment, its fellow EMU members warned Greece that further reforms to the Greek economy would \nbe necessary. Thus, maintaining fiscal discipline and further privatizing state-owned industries, especially in utilities, \ntransportation, and communications, would continue to be the main domestic public policy issues on the second \nSimitis government's agenda.\n\nOne area slated for reform involved the system of taxation. Greece had the same taxation system for 50 year \nuntil April 2002 when the Greek government announced plans to reform the tax structure in an effort to stimulate the \neconomy. The government's goal with the new system was  to simplify Greece's complex taxation regime.\n\nThe government was also faced with balancing the need to maintain its \"stability pact\" with the rest of the EMU with \nthe increasingly pressing need to address ailing social services, especially the health, education, and pension \nsystems. Because PASOK had typically drawn significant electoral support from those groups most likely to bear \nthe costs of rationalizing these systems (for example, labor unions), Prime Minister Simitis' job was not to be easy \nand his objectives would not be painlessly realized.\n\nA more symbolic success for the government occurred when Greece won its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games \nin Athens. Since winning the bid, however, Greece was criticized internationally for its lack of progress in improving \nits infrastructure. Olympic officials had even threatened to award the games to a different country if Greece failed to \nimprove its ability to house, transport, service, and protect the thousands of athletes and visitors that accompany \nthe games. The slow pace of preparations had been partially blamed on political infighting among the government's \nsupporters. Indeed, Prime Minister Simitis was compelled to replace the culture minister in charge of preparing for \nthe games due to criticism of the government's policies.\n\nBy 2002, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that Greece had made some progress. However, the \nIOC still strongly encouraged the Greek government to meet its agreed-upon deadlines for Olympic construction \nprojects. The Greek government continues to promise to have all the venues ready in time for the Games.\n\nThe potential for acts of terrorism also had many concerned about the games being held in Athens. Previously, in \nJune 2000, a group known as \"November 17\" assassinated the British military attach\u00e9 in Greece. The \"November \n17\" group first became public in 1975 and was blamed for an estimated two-dozen deaths. By 2003, 18 men and \none women were arrested and faced trial in regard to the killings. The group's strong anti-Western sentiments \n(including anti-European Union and anti-NATO sentiments) were of significant concern to Greek and international \nofficials responsible for the Olympic Game preparations. The September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon also heightened the security concerns of the Greek government and the International Olympic \nCommittee.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in 2002, relations between Greece and Turkey improved when the Greek and Turkish governments \nsigned an agreement to build a gas pipeline along which Turkey would supply Greece with gas. Then, in 2003, the \nforeign ministers of Greece and Turkey offered remarks at a joint news conference held at Kas, in Turkey's \nsouthwestern Antalya province, where the Turkish foreign minister had been hosting all the foreign ministers of the \nEuropean Union. The two ministers announced their respective countries could work together with regard to the \nOttawa Treaty, which prohibits anti-personnel landmines. Although Athens and Ankara had yet to ratify the treaty, \nthey were to submit documents on their joint agreement to the United Nations, which would make both Greece and \nTurkey party to the Ottawa Treaty. The concurrence and willingness to work together in regard to the landmine \ntreaty was intended to symbolize strengthened bilateral relations.\n\nIn 2003, relations between the two countries were challenged by the matter of Cyprus. The island of Cyprus has \nbeen divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides since 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern third of \nthe island, following a short-lived coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Cyprus' northern third has \nbeen occupied by Turkish Cypriots ever since and is backed by the government of Turkey. For its part, Greek \nsupports the Greek Cypriot government, which is also recognized by the international community. The United \nNations tried to broker the reunification of Cyprus but negotiations failed. Recent decisions to lift restrictions on \npassage from and to the two sides of Cyprus were well-received by the Greek government in the wake of failed \nunification talks.\n\nMeanwhile, Greece held the European Union presidency. Turkey has applied for membership in the regional body \nand George Papandreou -- in his role as the European Union president -- said that he hoped for a positive outcome \nfor Turkey in 2004.\n\nOn the issue of the war in Iraq, in April 2003, the European Union -- headed by a Greek presidency as noted above \n-- stated that the United Nations should have a \"central role\" in rebuilding Iraq, while noting that the United States-\nled forces in the country should have the responsibility of restoring stability. The function of the European Union, \nhowever, was left unspecified until further details could be determined in regard to the roles of the coalition forces \nand the United Nations, respectively.\n\nIn May 2003, two informal texts -- one dealing with European Union participation in Iraq's reconstruction, and the \nother with the prospective common European security and defense policy -- were prepared by the Greek \nPresidency of the European Union. They were then presented to the informal European Union General Affairs and \nExternal Relations Council. In regard to participation in Iraq's reconstruction, the text restated the European \nUnion's intent to assist in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq. Included was a provision for \nhumanitarian aid on the day after which sanctions against Iraq were lifted. The second text presented by the \nEuropean Union Presidency was a prioritization of a European security and external relations policy.\n\nOn the domestic agenda, despite speculative reports that Costas Simitis would step down from the leadership of \nPASOK, the prime minister's office stated he would remain as the head of the party, at least until the next national \nelections, which were scheduled for 2004.  In fact, in early 2004, when Simitis called for elections in March, he also \nstated he would not stand as PASOK leader and that Minister of Foreign Affairs George Papandreou would \ninstead hold the reins as the head of that political party.  Papandreou came from a Greek political dynasty as the \nson and grandson of former Greek leaders. \n\nOne the rationales behind the call for elections was the impetus for reaching a settlement on the matter of Cyprus \nahead of the May 1, 2004, date for that country to join the European Union.  Domestic concerns, however, were of \nparamount importance to the Greek citizenry as people complained about inflation, unemployment, the sense of a \ndecreasing standard of living, as well as apparent corruption.  Indeed, with these issues burning in the \n\n\n\nconsciousness of voters, and with the opposition New Democracy party offering an economic program that included \ntax cuts, that party seemed to have an eight point advantage ahead of the incumbents in polls leading up to the \nelection.\n\nOn election day in March 2004, PASOK's dominance in Greek government for over a decade ended when the \nconservative New Democracy party, led by Konstantinos Karamanlis, won the vote. The victory for Karamanlis and \nNew Democracy heralded a significant shift in Greek politics.\n\nExpressing jubilation about his success, Karamanlis said, \"This is a victory for democracy. We've been handed a \nmandate to move the country forward.\"  He went on to become prime minister and formed a government.  \n\nThe actual results of the election were as follows: \"Nea Dimokratia\" or\n\nNew Democracy (ND), conservatives -- 45.4 percent  and 165 seats;  Panellino Socialistiko Kinima  or Pan-Hellenic \nSocialist Movement (PASOK, socialists/social-democratics -- 40.5 percent  and  117 seats; Kommounistiko Komma \nEllado  or Communist Party of Greece (KKE),\n\ncommunists --  5.9 percent  and 12 seats; Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu  or Coalition of the Left and \nProgress (SIN),\n\nleft-wing socialists -- 3.3 percent and  6 seats; Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos  or Populist Orthodox Rally (LAOS), \nright-wing populists -- 2.2 percent and 0 seats; Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima  or Democratic Social Movement \n(DIKKI), left-wing socialists --  1.8\n\npercent and 0 seats. \n\nIn May 2004, a police station in Athens was the target of  three bomb attacks as fears of terrorism again emerged \nahead of the Olympics. Leading up to August of that year, attention in Greece was on the  preparations for the \nOlympics.  (See \"Special Entry\" below for details about the Olympics.)\n\nMeanwhile, in June 2004, indications from the European Union (EU)  parliamentary elections suggested there had \nbeen a record low turnout of only 44.2 percent for the EU.  Reports also suggested that turnout among the 10 new \nmember states was even lower than the overall average at only 26 percent. In some countries such as Greece, \nsunny weather was deemed to have been the culprit as people left their homes and headed for the coast rather \nthan toward the polls. Still, officials from the Interior Ministry of Greece claimed that turnout had exceeded 60 \npercent. \n\nIn December 2004, the European Commission issued a warning to Greece after it was discovered that the country \nhad falsified data regarding its budget deficit in the period prior to joining the Euro zone. \n\nSpecial Entry on the Olympic Games:\n\nFrom Aug. 13, 2004 to Aug. 29, 2004,  the XXVIII Summer Olympic Games were held in the Greek capital city of  \nAthens.  Greece is the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games, dating back to 776 BC, according to the historic \nrecord.  These Olympic Games marked the second time Greece has hosted the Olympics in modern times.  Athens \nplayed host to the first modern Olympics in 1896.\n\n\n\n\"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were the Olympic mascots whose symbolism were rooted in the legacy of an Olympian god \nand an Olympian goddess.  \"Phevos\" was known as the god of light and music, also known as Apollo in Greek \nmythology.  His sister, Athena, was regarded as the goddess of wisdom.  Fittingly, she has also been known as the \npatron of the city of Athens.  The choice of \"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were illustrative of the rich and compelling \nhistory and culture of Greece and Greek civilization.  The concept of Olympic mascots  first came into being during \nthe Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble in 1968.  Greek history and culture were also emblazoned on the Athens \nOlympic torch which was designed to resemble an olive leaf.  As well, the emblem of the Olympic Games depicted \nthe  \"kotinos\" or an olive wreath.  The olive tree was considered to be of great cultural importance and going back to \nthe ancient Olympic Games, the \"kotinos\" was awarded to the champion.\n\nIn these modern games in Athens, 28 sporting events took place at 38 venues.  Three hundred and one medal \nceremonies also took place.  More than 10,500 athletes competed in the Olympic Games, representing more than \n190 countries.  Notably, the country of Afghanistan participated in the Olympics following a suspension, in some \nmeasure due to the now-ousted Taliban regime's refusal to allow female athletes to compete.\n\nOn the ground in Athens, security was a major concern.  Approximately  45,000 security personnel were on duty \nduring the course of the games along with 60,000 trained international volunteers. \n\nDevelopments from 2005 to 2007\n\nIn March 2005, the domestic scene in Greece was dominated by the launch of a spate of strikes by trade unions \nacross the country.  The strikes were carried out to protest against the country's increasing unemployment rate, in \nconjunction with the rising rate of inflation.  By December 2005, strikes were ongoing with a specific focus on \nprotesting the  parliament's approval of changes to labor laws, which would essentially end  lifetime employment \ntenure within the public sector. (See \"Recent Developments\" below for information about further strike activity.)\n\nThe year 2005 was also marked by ratification of the European constitution among Greeks. In April 2005, Greece's \nparliament voted during a special session in favor of the proposed constitution of the European Union (EU).  The \nproposed constitution was backed by 268 votes in the 300-member parliament, with  17 parliamentarians voting \nagainst it and another 15 abstaining.  According to European Union mandates, all member states must vote in \nsupport of the document  either by public referendum or parliamentary vote.\n\nAlso in 2005, Karolos Papoulias became the country's new president after being elected by the \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" \nor parliament for a five-year term.\n\nThe first part of 2006 was marked by strike action undertaken by a constellation of public and private sector unions \nin Greece. In March, the 24-hour general strike led to disruption in services across the country, including public \ntransportation in the capital city of Athens, but also affecting banks, hospitals, schools and government offices.  \nCities such as Athens were particularly hard-hit with log-jammed streets filled with workers marching to government \nfacilities to attend rallies.  \n\nThe strike was called by the unions in order to protest the conservative government's economic reform program.  \nAmong the Greek people, there is an increasing sense of frustration regarding high prices of goods and services, \nalong with low wages.  Indeed, the union leaders have argued that the minimum wage in Greece is half that of the \nEuropean Union average.  At the broader level, there was intensifying uneasiness about the government's intent to \nprivatize state enterprises amidst a climate of high unemployment.\n\nFor its part, the government had to go forward with these plans in order to bring the Greek economy in line with \nEuropean Union mandates to cut the budget.  It is a mandate that is more stringent for countries that do not use \nthe Euro as the currency.  As well, the government has argued that its economic reforms have been intended to \nincrease Greece's competitiveness within the global economy\n\n\n\nThe first part of 2006 was also marked by a brewing phone tapping scandal. In March 2006,  George Koronias, the \nhead of mobile phone company Vodafone Greece, began giving testimony before a parliamentary committee's \ninquiry into the apparent surveillance of various officials.  A month prior, the government of Greece acknowledged \nthat the mobile phones belonging to the prime minister and over 100 other officials, including politicians, security \npersonnel, and journalists, had been bugged.  The surveillance was said to have begun before the Olympics held in \nAthens in 2004 but continued after until it was detected in 2005. Once the matter came to light, there was increased \nsuspicion that the matter involved United States intelligence agents in some manner.\n\nThe alleged suicide of a Vodafone network manager just days after the surveillance was revealed only added to the \nsense of scandal surrounding the matter.\n\nThe company's denial that the man's death was connected to the scandal seemed to have had little effect in \nminimizing public concern.\n\nParliamentarians participating in the committee's inquiry tried to determine why it took a year for the surveillance to \nbe uncovered. Clearly, issues surrounding the death of the Vodafone manager were also expected to be \naddressed. As well, parliamentarians on the investigating committee were hoping to determine how the \nsophisticated software, which was used for intercepting calls,  was able to be installed and activated in a \nclandestine manner within the Vodafone system shortly before the Olympics.\n\nIndeed, it has been this very question that led to allegations that the United States may have been involved, as \nexpressed by Liana Kanelli, a Member of Parliament.  Kanelli's charges were not out of the mainstream. In fact, \nthere has been a widespread belief among the Greek public that the Vodaphone tapping scheme was orchestrated \nby agents of the United States in the first place.\n\nThe claim by a former American diplomat that the United States was involved has only bolstered that perception.  \nThe diplomat, who was based at the United States embassy in Athens until his resignation, said that the United \nStates  did not believe the Greek authorities could be trusted to protect the Olympics from a possible terrorist \nattack, hence their involvement, which including the phone surveillance. \n\nIn response to the phone tapping scandal, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced that there would be strict rules \nregulating mobile phone operations.  The new regulations would be oriented toward ensuring a higher level of \nprivacy in communications, along with harsh punishments for violators.\n\nIn May 2006, a powerful bomb exploded in the Greek capital city of Athens. Although there were no casualties, the \nbomb was apparently aimed at Greek Culture Minister George Voulgarakis.  There was, however, no claim of \nresponsibility.  The former Public Order Minister took on the Culture portfolio following a cabinet shuffle that some \nhave said was a demotion of sorts.  The shuffle appeared to be associated with the telephone tapping scandal \n(discussed above)  that had been the center of the political purview in Greece for some time.  That issue aside, \nVoulgarakis was also associated with claims made by 28 Pakistani immigrants that they were abducted and  \ntortured by Greek authorities at unknown locations following the 2005 terrorist attacks in London.  For his part, \nVoulgarakis denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAlso in May 2006, Greek and Turkish fighter planes collided in the air and crashed into the Aegean Sea. The Greek \npilot died in the incident although the Turkish pilot ejected safely and was rescued.  It was believed that the \ncollision, which ensued near the island of Karpathos, may have occurred as a result of efforts by the Greek \nauthorities to scramble a jet in order to intercept a Turkish aircraft. \n\nThe area in the Aegean has been the site of a prevailing territorial dispute between Greece and Turkey \nbecause both countries do not agree about the jurisdiction of air space.  There were some fears that the incident \nmight hinder the trend toward improved bilateral relations that had been ongoing in recent years.  Putting some rest \nto these anxieties,  Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul immediately extended his country's sympathies to his \nGreek counterpart, Dora Bakoyanni.  For its part, the Greek Foreign Ministry released a statement that read, \"The \n\n\n\ntwo foreign ministers expressed their regret at today's incident and agreed that this should not affect the two \ncountries' efforts to improve their relations.\"\n\nFebruary 2007 saw the conservative government of Prime Minister  Kostas Karamanlis survive a non-confidence \nmotion in parliament and stave off the possibility of fresh elections.  The motion, which was brought by the Socialist \nopposition, was defeated by a 164-122 vote in parliament after three days of debate.  The Socialists accused the \ngovernment of incompetence over the three years it held office.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis said that his New Democratic government would complete its term.  He also \npromised to move forward with his reform agenda, saying, \"We will continue our reforms in health, education and \nthe economy, and nothing will stand in our way.\" But, in fact, for his reform agenda to move ahead, it would require \na constitutional amendment.  It would also have to withstand popular opposition, as evidenced by mass protests in \nthe capital of Athens in January 2007, which were intended to register opposition to such changes.\n\nSpecial Note\n\nIn August 2007, forest fires ravaged significant portions of Greece.  The affected areas included Athens, Evia Island \nand the  Peloponnese.  More than 50 people had died at the times of writing.  The fires have left several revered \ncultural sites,  artifacts  and other historic interests at grave risk of destruction.  Among the vulnerable sites was the \nancient Olympia, renowned for being the birthplace of the Olympics.  Firefighters were attempting to keep the site \nfrom being affected, however, flames were edging close to the original Olympic stadium as well as the yard of the \nmuseum housing some of Greece's greatest archaeological artifacts.  As a result, fire engines were deployed to the \narea to stand ready to defend the country's cultural legacy.  As well, a new fire protection and sprinkler system, \nwhich had been installed prior to the 2004 Olympics, was turned on.\n\nElections of 2007\n\nThe Greek people went to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections on September 16, 2007.  Voter turnout was in \nline with normal levels, however, there was a reduced rate of participation in the Peloponnese peninsula south of \nAthens, which suffered terribly as a result of forest fires a month earlier.  That region saw dozens of people killed as \na result and the government came under fire for its slow reaction and poor handling of the crisis.\n\nNevertheless, despite the shadow of the forest fire crisis, exit polls indicated that the governing New Democracy \nparty of  Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was expected to win over George Papandreou's socialist party,  Pasok.  \nWith most of the votes counted, it appeared that the outcome would be in line with the exit poll data.  Indeed, New \nDemocracy had about 43 percent of the vote share over Pasok, which took 38.5 percent of the vote share.  The \nresult meant that New Democracy would have the most seats in the 300-seat parliament -- albeit with a reduced \nmajority.  Indeed, control over 154 seats meant that it had an advantage of four seats in parliament -- far fewer than \nthe situation following the previous elections but enough to claim an absolute majority.\n\nAs such, Prime Minister Karamanlis claimed victory saying that his government had a \"clear mandate\" from the \npeople to continue its reform agenda.  His policy program was thus expected to concentrate on economic \ndevelopment, poverty alleviation,  pensions increases,  and the creation of a social state for the future.  In a gesture \nintended to rectify the government's handling of the forest fire crisis, Prime Minister Karamanlis promised that the \ngovernment was committed to helping victims. He also expressed his sense of responsibility saying, \"I feel doubly \nresponsible to be more effective and avoid mistakes.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Papandreou thanked his supporters for their \"love and trust\" in him and his party, \nbut conceded defeat saying, \"Pasok fought a battle and lost it.\"  Attention then turned to the question of whether  \nPapandreou would  resign as Pasok leader.  Former Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos was mentioned in the \npublic purview as a possible successor.\n\n\n\nThe Macedonia Controversy\n\nAlthough there were hopes that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Greece would find their \nway toward  an improved and allied relationship, difficulties have continued over questions of names and insignias \nused by FYROM. This country, FYROM, has looked to Greece's historic enemy, Turkey, for diplomatic support. \nGreek refusal to recognize FYROM under the name \"Republic of Macedonia\" has been an important issue in Greek \npolitics since 1992.\n\nGreece was adamantly opposed to the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the government in Skopje, claiming that \nthe name is intrinsically Greek and should not be used by a foreign country. Furthermore, Greece believes that an \nindependent \"Republic of Macedonia\" bordering the Greek region of Macedonia would fuel irredentist tensions in \nFYROM. The dispute led to a Greek trade embargo against FYROM in February 1994.\n\nMediation efforts by the United Nations, United States and European Union brokered an interim solution to some of \nthese differences in September 1995, leading to the lifting of the Greek embargo. Since the signing of these interim \naccords, the two governments have concluded agreements designed to facilitate the movement of people and \ngoods across their common border and improve bilateral relations. Talks on remaining issues were still being held \nunder United Nations auspices several years later. \n\nThat said, the issue emerged strongly in the spring of 2008 when FYROM was moving toward accession to the \nEuropean Union and NATO.  Greece, which is a member state of both organizations and holds the power of veto, \nhas strenuously objected to FYROM's accession, again on the basis of the \"name\" controversy, objecting to new \nforms of the country's name.  On the other hand, FYROM has said that it has gone the extra mile in trying to \nassuage Greece's anxieties over the issue by changing its flag and amending its  constitution to make clear that it \nheld no territorial aspiration against any neighbors, including Greece.  Nevertheless, in March 2008, Greece \nblocked FYROM's bid to join NATO over the ongoing controversy. \n\nSpecial Entry:\n\nGlobal credit crisis; effects felt in Europe\n\nSummary:\n\nA financial farrago,  rooted in the credit crisis, became a global phenomenon by the start of October 2008. In the \nUnited States, after failure of the passage of a controversial bailout plan in the lower chamber of Congress, an \namended piece of legislation finally passed through both houses of Congress.  There were hopes that its passage \nwould calm jitters on Wall Street and restore confidence in the country's financial regime.\n\nHowever, a volatile week on Wall Street followed, most sharply characterized by a precipitous 18 percent drop of \nthe Dow Jones.  With the situation requiring rapid and radical action, a new proposal for the government to bank \nstakes was gaining steam. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe, with banks also in jeopardy of failing, and with \nno coordinated efforts to stem the tide by varying countries of the European Union, there were rising anxieties not \nonly about the resolving the financial crisis, but also about the viability of the European bloc.\n\nNevertheless, European leaders were able to forge an agreement aimed at easing the credit crunch in that region \nof the world.  Following is an exploration, first, of the situation in the United States, and, second, of the situation \nunfolding in Europe.\n\n\n\nReport:\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2008, as the United States was reeling from the unfolding credit crisis, Europe's banking sector was \nalso hit by its own woes  when the Dutch operations of the European banking and insurance entity, Fortis, was \npartly nationalized in an effort to prevent its ultimate demise.  Radical action was spurred by anxieties that Fortis \nwas too much of a banking and financial giant to be allowed to fail.  The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg \nforged an agreement to contribute more than 11 billion euros (approximately US$16 billion) to shore up  Fortis, \nwhose  share price fell precipitously due to worries about its bad debts.\n\nA day later, the  mortgage lender -- Bradford and Bingley -- in the United Kingdom was  nationalized when the \nBritish government took control of the bank's  mortgages and loans.  Left out of the nationalization scheme were the \nsavings and branch operations, which were  sold off to Santander of Spain. Earlier, the struggling mortgage lender, \nNorthern Rock, had itself been nationalized.  The head of the British Treasury,  Alistair Darling, indicated that  \"big \nsteps\" that would not normally be taken were in the offing, given the unprecedented nature of the credit crisis.\n\nOn the same day, financial  woes came to a head in Iceland when the government was compelled to seize control \nof the country's third-largest bank , Glitnir, due to financial problems and fears that it would go insolvent.\n\nIceland was said to be in serious financial trouble, given the fact that its liabilities were in gross excess of the \ncountry's GDP.  Further action was anticipated in Iceland, as a result.\n\nOn Sept 30, 2008, another European bank -- Dexia -- was the victim of the intensifying global banking and financial \ncrisis.  In order to keep Dexia afloat, the governments of France, Belgium,  and Luxembourg convened talks and \nagreed to contribute close to 6.5 billion euros (approximately US$9 billion) to keep Dexia from suffering a demise.\n\nOnly days later, the aforementioned Fortis bank returned to the forefront of the discussion in Europe.  Belgian Prime \nMinister Yves Leterme said he was hoping to locate a new owner with the aim of restoring  confidence in Fortis, and \nthusly,  preventing a further downturn in the markets.  Leterme said that the authorities were considering takeover \nbids for the Belgian operations of the company (the Dutch operations were nationalized as noted above.)\n\nBy Sept. 5, 2008, one of Germany's biggest banks, Hypo Real Estate, was at risk of failing.  In response, German \nChancellor Angela Merkel said she would exhaust all efforts to save the bank.  A rescue plan by the government \nand banking institutions was eventually agreed upon at a cost of 50 billion euros (approximately US$70 billion).  \nThis agreement involved a higher cost than was previously discussed.\n\nMeanwhile, as intimated above, Iceland was enduring further financial shocks to its entire banking system.  As \nsuch, the government of Iceland was involved in intense discussions aimed at saving the country's financial regime, \nwhich were now at severe risk of collapse due to insolvency of the country's commercial banks.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sept. 4, 2008, the leaders of key European states -- United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy -- \nmet in the French capital city of Paris to discuss the financial farrago and to consider possible action.  The  talks, \nwhich were hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended without consensus on what should be done to deal \nwith the credit crisis, which was rapidly becoming a global phenomenon.  The only thing that the four European \ncountries agreed upon was that  there would not be a grand rescue plan, akin to the type that was initiated in the \nUnited States.  As well, they  jointly called for more greater regulation and a coordinated response.  To that latter \nend, President Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"Each government will operate with its own methods and means, but in a \ncoordinated manner.\"\n\nThis call came after Ireland took independent action to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis.\n\nNotably, the Irish government decided days earlier  to fully guarantee all deposits in the country's major banks for a \nperiod of two years.  The Greek government soon followed suit with a similar action.  These  actions by Ireland and \nGreece raised the ire of other European countries, and evoked questions of whether Ireland and Greece had \n\n\n\nviolated any European Union charters.  An investigation by the European Union was pending into whether or not \nIreland's guarantee of all savings deposits was anti-competitive in nature.\n\nNevertheless, as anxieties about the safety of bank deposits rose across Europe, Ireland and Greece saw an influx \nof new banking customers from across the continent, presumably seeking the security of knowing their money \nwould be safe amidst a financial meltdown.\n\nAnd even with questions rising about the decisions of the Irish and Greek government, the government of Germany \ndecided to go down a similar path by guaranteeing all private bank accounts. For his part, British Prime Minister \nGordon Brown said that his government would increase  the limit on guaranteed bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \n\u00a350,000.\n\nIn these various ways, it was clear that there was no concurrence among some of Europe's most important \neconomies. In fact, despite the meeting in France, which called for coordination among the countries of the \nEuropean bloc, there was no unified response to the global financial crisis.  Instead, that  meeting laid bare the \ndivisions within the countries of the European Union, and called  into question the very viability of the European \nbloc.\n\nPerhaps that question of viability would be answered at a forthcoming G8 summit, as recommended by those \nparticipating in the Paris talks.\n\nA week later, another meeting of European leaders  in Paris ended with concurrence that no large institution would \nbe allowed to fail.  The meeting, which was attended by leaders of euro zone countries,\n\nresulted in an agreement to guarantee loans between banks until the end of 2009, with an eye on easing the credit \ncrunch.  The proposal, which would apply in 15 countries, also included a plan for capital infusions by means of \npurchasing preference shares from banks.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which is outside the euro zone,  had already announced a similar strategy.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy  argued that these unprecedented measures  were of vital importance.  The \nFrench leader said, \"The crisis has over the past few days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for \nprocrastination and a go-it-alone approach.\"\n\nHe also tried to ease growing frustration that such measures would benefit the wealthy by explaining that the \nstrategy would not constitute  \"a gift to banks.\"\n\nWhile these developments were aimed at restoring confidence in the financial regime in Europe, Iceland continued \nto struggle.  Indeed, the country's economy stood precipitously close to collapse.  Three banks, including the \ncountry's largest one -- Kaupthing  -- had to be rescued by the government and nationalized.  Landsbanki and \nGlitnir had been taken over in the days prior.  With the country in a state of economic panic, trading on the OMX \nNordic Exchange  was suspended temporarily, although it was expected to reopen on October 13, 2008.  Iceland's \nPrime Minister Geir Haarde said that his country was considering whether to seek assistance from  the International \nMonetary Fund to weather the crisis.\n\nIn early 2009, according to the European Commission, European banks were in need of as much as several trillion \nin bailout funding. Impaired or toxic assets factored highly on the European Union bank balance sheets, with credit \ndefault swaps on Irish debt running at 355 basis points higher at the time of writing -- the highest rate in Europe and \nwell on its way down the path of Iceland. Anxieties were so high in Dublin that tens of thousands of people took to \nthe streets to protest the growing financial crisis.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the housing bubble was deleteriously affecting the United Kingdom, with anxieties being \nstoked about whether British banks could at all be saved.\n\nIn Spain, unemployment was in double digit territory and industrial production plunged 20 percent from where it was \na year earlier. It was anticipated that credit default swaps for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece would double over \nthe course of the next year. In other parts of Europe, according to economist Nouriel Roubini, the economies of \nUkraine, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania appeared to be on the brink of disaster.\n\nRegarding Ukraine, there were fears that it would might not abide with terms of a loan from the International \nMonetary Fund and thusly default on its debt. Meanwhile in Poland, the currency was falling and in Russia, even as \nthe rouble fell, the Kremli warned of economic contraction.\n\nOverall, Eastern European countries borrowed heavily from Western European banks. Thus, even if the currencies \non the eastern part of the continent collapse, effects will be felt in the western part of Europe as well. For example, \nSwiss banks that gave billions of credit to Eastern Europe cannot look forward to repayment anytime soon. As well, \nAustrian banks have had extensive exposure to Eastern Europe, and can anticipate a highly increased cost of \ninsuring its debt.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has warned that as many as 16 European Union countries will require \nassistance. Indeed, his statements suggest the need for a regional rescue effort. Of consideration is the fact that, \naccording to the Maastricht Treaty, state-funded bailouts are prohibited.\n\nBy the close of February 2009, it was announced that the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe would \nreceive a rescue package of $31 billion, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the \nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. The rescue package was aimed at assisting the survival of \nsmall financial institutions and included equity and debt financing, as well as access to credit and risk insurance \naimed at encouraging lending.\n\nAlso in February 2009, with the global financial crisis intensifying, leaders of European Union countries backed \nsweeping financial regulations. Included in the package of market reforms were sanctions on tax havens, caps on \nbonus payments to management, greater hedge fund regulation, and increased influence by the International \nMonetary Fund. European leaders also backed a charter of sustainable economic activity, that would subject all \nglobal financial activities to both regulation and accountability by credit rating agencies.\n\nThese moves were made ahead of the Group of 20 summit scheduled for April 2, 2009, in London. It was not \nknown whether other countries outside Europe, such as the United States, Japan, India and China, would support \nthe new and aggressive regime of market regulation. That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin \nthat Europe had a responsibility to chart this track. She said, \"Europe will own up to its responsibility in the world.\"\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Greece was gripped by public sector strikes and other forms of mass action, aimed at \nprotesting the government's pension reform plan.  Despite the public's outcry over the proposed reform proposal, \nthe Greek parliament narrowly passed the legislation oriented toward putting the plan into action.\n\nIn October 2008, further strikes and mass  action ensued by both public sector employyes and professionals  in \nreaction to proposals for privatization and caps on compensation.  \n\n\n\nThe start of December 2008 in Greece was marked by violence as masses took to the streets in Athens to protest \nthe shooting death of a youth --  Alexandros Grigoropoulos -- by police.  Students took to the streets, even throwing \ngas bombs, rocks and stones at a police station during more than a week of ongoing violence.\n\nPolice retaliated with tear gas but the crowds were only deterred temporarily, rallying again to set three banking \ninstitutions ablaze and damaging cars.  About 400 people were detained as a consequence of the chaotic situation \non the ground, which also resulted in injuries to at least 70 people. As the protests entered mid-December, an \nuneasy calm returned to Athens.  That said, student protestors  said they intended to launch a demonstration \noutside police headquarters.\n\nBy mid-month, the situation was ongoing and Athens continued to be the site of further violent clashed between \nprotestors and police.  The protestors, most of whom were youthful students, were using the National Technical \nUniversity of Athens, known locally as the Polytechnic, as their base of operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the general sentiment in Greece was that the protests, which began in reaction to the shooting of \nGrigoropoulos by police, had evolved into a broader social uprising.  Of particular note was the fact that a \nsubstantial number of the young people involved in the protests were unemployed and further unrest could be in the \noffing, with more loss of jobs anticipated in 2009.\n\nThe situation had political implications for the government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, which was viewed \nas having handled the situation poorly, according to polling data on the matter.\n\nSeizing upon the popular sentiment of discontent, George Papandreou,  the leader of the opposition Pan-Hellenic \nSocialist Movement (Pasok), called for fresh elections.  He accused the government of being  \"incapable of steadily \ndriving the country towards change.\" For his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis rejected calls for either his resignation \nor early elections.  Instead, he said that Greece was in need of a \"steady hand\" to deal with the economic strife.\n\nPrimer on 2009 Parliamentary Elections  in Greece\n\nBackground\n\nOn Sept. 2, 2009, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis  announced that a snap general election would be held \nin the near future. The Greek head of government said he would meet with President Karolos Papoulias to discuss \nthis decision to hold early elections ahead of the expected 2011 date when the tenure of his ruling conservative \nNew Democracy government would normally come to an end. A day later, it was announced that the snap election \nwould be held a month later on Oct. 4, 2009.\n\nPrime Minister Karamanlis explained that his decision to call the snap election was \"an act of responsibility,\" and it \nhad been advanced in the country's best interest.  Prime Minister Karamanlis said that Greece was in need of  \nsignificant reforms to deal with the after-effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, as well as enduring challenges in \nthe domestic economy and public sector. Indeed, Greece has seen a sharp rise in its unemployment rate, \nnegatively matched by declining economic growth, in recent times -- both of which Prime Minister Karamanlis said \nhad been the result of the previous Socialist government's mismanagement.  Accordingly, the Greek head of \ngovernment called for strict fiscal discipline, structural reforms, and a \"war\" on tax evasion -- a problem that has \nplagued the country and added to its economic woes. Prime Minister Karamanlis wasted no time in calling for the \npublic to give his  party a \"fresh mandate\" to address these issues.\n\nSome critics surmised that despite this noble agenda, the Karamanlis government was under pressure due to a \nnumber of scandals and criticisms for handling various crises,  and was thusly acquiescing to the call for an early \nvote. Complicating the matter was the fact that Socialist leader George Papandreou was agitating for another early \npoll. He said he wished to force an early presidential election.\n\nElection Issues\n\n\n\nThe main issue surrounding the election was the path to dealing with Greece's economic challenges.  Whereas \nKaramanlis advanced an austerity measure program to tackle this issue,  Papandreou promised a significant \nstimulus package, movement toward the building of a green economy, and the introduction of technocratic experts \nto help Greece tackle its problems.\n\nPolling Data\n\nPolling data indicated that Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party was trailing the Socialists by six percent \nin the month ahead of the election.\n\nResults\n\nAfter the votes were counted following the October 4, 2009 parliamentary elections, it was clear that Greece's \nPanhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) had won the country's snap general elections.  The results showed that \nthe Socialists garnered more than 43 percent of the vote count, while New Democracy obtained 35 percent. The \nCommunist Party of Greece (KKE) remained as the third largest party in parliament, winning 7.6 percentage of the \nvote. The right People's Orthodox Rally (LAOS) was estimated to have  received 5.6 percent of the vote.\n\nThe\n\nCoalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) was expected to garner 4.5 percent of the vote.\n\nWhile the  Green Ecologists party  secured 2.5 percent of the votes, it would not enter parliament due to the three \npercent threshold required by electoral law.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis conceded defeat, resigned as leader of the  conservative New \nDemocracy party,  and congratulated Socialist leader, George Papandreou. In this way, the Socialists ended their \nfive-year stay in opposition and prepared to take the reins of government once again.  In an address to jubilant \nsupporters in Athens, Papandreou said: \"We stand here united before the great responsibility which we undertake.\"\n\nDays after the election, Socialist leader,  was sworn into office as Greece's new prime minister by Archbishop \nIeronymos of Athens and All Greece, and in the presence of President  Karolos Papoulias.  The new head of \ngovernment paid tribute to the contributions of his predecessor, Costas Karamanlis.  For his part,  Karamanlis \ncongratulated Papandreou and wished him \"all the best for the benefit of the country.\"\n\nThe process of government formation was expected to follow with Prime Minister Papandreou's impending \nannouncement of the composition of the new cabinet.  To that end, the new head of government noted that the \ncabinet would be both small and include several women. Attention was also focused on the leadership race for the \nNew Democracy party, which was now officially in opposition.\n\nWeeks later, the incumbent Greek President Karolos Papoulias was asked by newly-elected  Prime Minister \nGeorge Papandreou to serve a second term as Greece's head of state.  In response, Papoulias said, \"I accept the \nnomination for my re-election to the Presidency of Greece.\"  With both the ruling PASOK party and the main \nopposition New Democracy party backing Papoulias' second term, the actual parliamentary vote in March 2010 was \nexpected to formalize the second term in office.\n\nBriefing on 2010 Presidential Election in Greece\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias was re-elected to a second term in an internal vote in \nparliament with an overwhelming majority.  Papoulias won 266 of the votes cast in the 300-seat parliament.  The \nincumbent president  was supported by the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the main opposition \n\n\n\nNew Democracy (ND), as well as some smaller opposition  parties.  Parliamentarians belonging to the Communist \nParty of Greece (KKE) and the Coalition of the Radical Left abstained from the vote.\n\nNote: Papoulias was born in 1929 and served as a former government minister and member of parliament.\n\nSpecial Entry on Greece's Debt Crisis\n\nSummary:\n\nSince late 2009, attempts to resolve Greece's economic crisis have been at the forefront of the national agenda. \nThere have also been serious concerns about Greece's economic viability on the regional landscape across Europe \nand internationally.  At issue have been deep anxieties about Greece defaulting on its debt, along with subsequent \nspeculation about whether the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have to step \nin to prevent such an outcome.  By April 2010, the prospects of Greece resolving the matter without help from some \ntransnational body came to a head when the Papandreou administration formally said it would accept the EU-IMF \nfinancial rescue package to ensure debt service.\n\nCrisis Landscape:\n\nIn December 2009, the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister George Papandreou, announced a series of \nharsh spending cuts in order to address the country's economic woes.  He warned that without action such as a \nhiring freeze on  public sector jobs, closure of overseas tourism offices, and decreased social security spending, \nGreece was at risk of \"sinking under its debts.\"  He also said that  his country had  \"lost every trace of credibility\" on \nthe economic front and would have  to \"move immediately to a new social deal.\"\n\nFears of a government debt default in Europe emerged in the first week of February 2010, with all eyes focused on \nGreece.  Of concern was the rising cost of insuring Greek debt against default, and fears were rising that a bailout \nby the International Monetary Fund  might be in the offing.\n\nFor its part,  the Greek government pledged to reduce its budget deficit by three percent of gross domestic product \nby 2012. That move was welcomed by the European Commission but met with the threat of strikes by Greece's \nlargest union, which has railed against the prospect of austerity measures.  By Feb. 10, 2010, the strike by the \ncountry's largest public sector union in Greece was going forward.  Simultaneously, Prime Minister George \nPapandreou promised to \"take any necessary measures\" to reduce Greece's deficit including a freeze on public \nsector pay, increased taxes and the implementation of changes to the pension system.\n\nThe next day, leaders of the European Union said that while Greece had not asked for assistance, they stood \nready to help ensure stability within the euro zone.  A statement issued from a summit in Brussels read as follows: \n\"We fully support the efforts of the Greek government and their commitment to do whatever is necessary, including \nadopting additional measures to ensure that the ambitious targets set in the stability program for 2010 and the \nfollowing years are met.\"  The statement, however, did not specify the nature of such support although there were \nindications that a loan might be in the offing.  Following a meeting of European leaders on Feb. 11, 2010,  Austria's \nChancellor Werner Faymann explained the need to support fellow European Union member states saying, \"It is \nimportant to have solidarity.\"  However, he added, \"We are not going to give the  money as a present, it will be as \nloans.\"\n\nOnly a few days later, however, the news emerging from Europe was more grim as regards to Greece's situation.  \nAs reported by the British publication, the Telegraph, the council of European Union finance ministers issued an \nultimatum to Greece, warning that if that country did not comply with austerity measures by March 16, 2010, it \nwould lose sovereign control over its tax and spend policies.  The council also warned that the European Union \nwould invoke Article 126.9 of the Lisbon Treaty to take control from Athens and impose requisite cuts.  This threat \nwas likely to have more of a practical effect on Greece than an earlier move by the European Union to suspend \nGreece's voting rights, although both measures indicated a severe blow to Greek sovereignty within the European \nbloc.  From the point of view of the European Union, the verdict was that Greece's austerity plan contained \ninsufficient spending cuts and uncoordinated measures, and compelled the need for such drastic action.\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Greece took a different view.  Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou argued \nthat  his country was \"doing enough\" to reduce its public deficit from 12 percent to eight percent of GDP in 2010 by \nundertaking emergency fiscal cuts.\n\nAccordingly, Greece has also been reticent about taking further austerity measures, such as an increase in the \nvalue added tax or VAT, as well as further public sector wage cuts, which the European Central Bank has said \nmight be necessary. But the rest of Europe was unlikely to receive Greece's claims on faith alone, given  the \nemerging revelations that Wall Street likely helped Greece hide its balance sheets problem for the purpose of \nadvancing euro zone accession.\n\nBy the third week of February 2010, as talks in Brussels commenced about the financial crisis in Greece, there was \nno consensus on the possible path toward helping stabilize the situation in that country.  In fact, member states of \nthe European Union appeared divided on the issue.  Germany has said it wants to protect its own financial \ninterests by constructing a \"firewall\" to prevent Greece's debt crisis from spiraling out of control.  It was not known if \nthat \"firewall\" was distinct from, or an actual euphemism for, a bailout  for Greece funded by German funds.  \nCertainly,  Germany has been careful not to expressly state that it supports some sort of bailout measure for \nGreece, under the aegis of the European Union , using Germany funds.  Indeed, Berlin would have to contend with \nan outraged domestic reaction, as well as a resistant coalition partner in government whose libertarian inclinations \nwould leave them far from sanguine about such a move.\n\nAt the start of March 2010, in the face of pressure from the European Union, the Greek government agreed to a  \nnew package of austerity measures, including tax increases and spending cuts, aimed at resolving the budget \ncrisis.  The new package was met with approval from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, \nwho respectively hailed the move as evidence that Greece was taking necessary measures to reduce its precarious \ndebt.  The reactions of these two bodies were regarded as crucial, since Greece was hoping for German-funded \nassistance from the European Union, with the International Monetary Fund in line as an alternative avenue of \nassistance.\n\nNevertheless, since the measures included reductions in holiday bonuses paid to civil servants as well as a pension \nfreeze, it effectively raised the ire of public sector workers and trade unions.  From their point of view, the financial \npackage would exact a punishing toll on the workers of the country.  Not surprisingly, the country was hit by strikes \nwith workers angrily protesting the deficit-cutting government measures detailed above.  With schools closed, public \ntransportation, flights and ferries at a halt, and garbage left uncollected, it was clear that the strike was in full-force.  \nOn the streets of Athens, striking workers registered discontent, while riot police were deployed across the city.\n\nRegional Considerations:\n\nAlso at issue have been the fiscal challenges of  Portugal and Spain, which like Greece, have to contend with debt \nand weakened public finances. One challenge for Spain is the fact that the central government (leaving the social \nsecurity administration aside)  controls only one third of public sector spending.  Accordingly, while the central \ngovernment can set guidelines for the regional and municipal authorities, it has a fairly limited effect on overall fiscal \npolicy. In Portugal, the government does not command a majority in parliament, effectively complicating the process \nof implementing fiscal policies, and necessitating broad national consensus on the matter of the country's economic \nhealth.  Ireland, like Greece,  suffers from budget deficits that exceed 12 percent of their economic output. \nHowever, Ireland's record in navigating difficult economic times (late 1980s, early 1990s) was believed to be in that \ncountry's favor.\n\nThusly, at the broader level, the European Union has been faced with the moral hazard of having to consider going \ndown a similar path with Spain and Portugal, not to mention other European countries.  Clearly, the European \nUnion had no appetite for such a precedent being set in Greece.  Not surprisingly, non-euro zone European Union \nmembers, such as the United Kingdom  and Sweden, were recommending the International Monetary Fund  route.  \nThey argued that an entity such as the IMF possessed the technocratic acumen and experience to orchestrate and \nsupply a loan bailout to Greece.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Fitch ratings agency decided to downgrade Greece's credit rating two notches amidst anxieties that \nthe country will be unable to solve its financial farrago without assistance from external parties.? The downgrade \nwas significant since Greece was now at risk of losing its investment grade status, at least according to Fitch.? \nGreece retains marginally higher ratings with Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Earlier, Portugal's credit rating was \nalso downgraded by the Fitch ratings agency over concerns regarding its debt woes.? Ironically, the move by Fitch \ncame weeks after Portugal passed an austerity budget aimed at reducing its high budget deficit.? At the broader \nlevel, the decision to downgrade the credit ratings of both Greece and Portugal, along with attention on the possible \nrescue package for Greece,? renewed anxieties about the? problem of heavily indebted economies across the \ncontinent.\n\nThe situation in these European countries -- specifically on their debt burdens -- has focused attention \nconcomitantly on the European Union where countries of the euro zone share currency but not economic policies, \nand whose collective fates would be affected by a devalued euro.  Indeed, the euro itself has seen its value slide as \na result of rising economic anxieties, and questions have once again surfaced regarding its viability.\n\nLast Resort:\n\nBy late March 2010, a proposal was advanced to address Greece's debt crisis.  The rescue package proposal was \nintended to be a last resort for Greece, should that country fail to borrow sufficient funds under normal conditions. It \nwould require all euro zone countries to  vote unanimously to fund individual loans to Greece, although not all \ncountries would be required to contribute.  No actual dollar amount was specified for the possible rescue package \nalthough there were suggestions that it would be valued at around 22 billion euro, with the lion's share of the \nfunding being derived from the European Union (EU), and a small remained from the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).\n\nOn April 10, 2010, euro zone countries agreed to fund up to 30 billion euros -- above the amount originally \nenvisioned -- in emergency loans for debt-hit Greece.? The price of the loans would be about five percent and in \nline with IMF formulas.  The loans would not be activated by the euro zone; instead, it would be up to Greece to \ndecide whether or not to avail itself of the funds, which would be co-financed by the IMF, although to what degree \nwas unknown.  For its part, Greece has said it does not want to go down the road of such loans, preferring to \nauction treasury bills.  Greece was hoping that the very notion of an EU-IMF rescue package would ease volatile \nmarkets and advance an economic recovery, without actually having to activate the loans. However, such a path \nwas viewed as potentially unavoidable, given the fact that Greece has no choice but to finance its debt obligations.  \nAs well, there have been the wider considerations at play -- that is, the impact on markets across Europe and the \nconfidence in the euro.\n\nBy the close of April, 2010, Greece officially requested that the EU-IMF \"last resort\" loan package be activated, in \norder to deal with its debt-ridden economy and to prevent the unacceptable outcome of default by a sovereign \nEuropean country. The EU and IMF responded by noting that they believed the details of the rescue plan could be \nworked through quickly.  That being said, since much of the funding for the package will go through the EU, several \neurozone countries will have to ratify the use of funds.  For example, France would have to garner parliamentary \napproval for its contribution to Greece's rescue package.  In Germany, where -- as discussed above -- the political \nramifications of such a plan were expected to be pronounced -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel was warning \nthat there would be \"very strict conditions\" attached to her country's contribution of assistance.\n\nAs well, it was still to be determined how much the IMF would itself finance, along with interest rates by both the \nIMF and EU. With such hurdles yet to be crossed, it was unlikely that Greece would be in receipt of the much-\nneeded funds until the second week of May 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister George Papandreou was expressing confidence in the path going forward.  Speaking \nfrom the Aegean island of Kastellorizo, he said: \"Our partners will decisively contribute to provide Greece the safe \nharbor that will allow us to rebuild our ship.\"  But the Greek people were not easily assuaged by these words or the \nEU-IMF rescue package.  Instead, they were still railing against the austerity measures enacted by the Greek \ngovernment with  tens of thousands of Greek civil servants taking to the streets to participate in mass strike.\n\n\n\nFurther reluctance by Germany to to fund the largest portion of the rescue package for Greece did not help the \nsituation.  In fact, with Greece acknowledging that it cannot service its forthcoming debt obligations without the EU-\nIMF loan, plus the realization that German funds will likely not come quickly, there were escalating fears that \nGreece could well default by May 19, 2010 -- a significant deadline when billions in bond payments would be due.  \nAlthough Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou insisted his country would  \"absolutely and without any \ndoubt\"  service that debt, prevailing anxieties led another credit rating downgrade for Greece. Indeed, Standard and \nPoors downgraded Greece's credit rating  to junk status.  That move, in addition to a slight downgrade to Portugal's \ndebt on the basis of heightened risks, renewed attention to euro zone stability.\n\nRegional Considerations as regards the euro\n\nIn May 2010, the European Union (EU) agreed on a euro stability package valued at 500 billion euros, aimed at \npreventing the aforementioned Greek debt crisis from deleteriously affecting other countries in the region. Countries \nwithin the EU's euro zone would be provided access to loans worth 440 billion euros and emergency funding of 60 \nbillion euros from the EU.  As well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would earmark an additional 250 billion \neuros.  The European Commission would raise the funds in capital markets, using guarantees from the \ngovernments of member states, for the purpose of lending it to countries in economic crisis.\n\nIn addition, it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was prepared to participate in exceptional \nmarket intervention measures, such as the purchase of euro zone government bonds, for the purpose of shoring up \nthe value and viability of the euro currency.\n\nThese moves were aimed at defending  the euro, which has seen its value drop precipitously as a result of the \nGreek debt crisis has gone on, and as anxieties have increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to \nother EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland.\n\nThese mostly  southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural \neconomic weakness.\n\nBut even these overtures, as drastic as they might appear, would do little to address  Europe's soaring public debt, \naccording to some economic analysts.  Indeed, among this core of economists, the argument resided that this \nrescue package could actually exacerbate the situation.  Of concern has been the collective impact of low economic \ngrowth, high unemployment, and governments unwilling to take requisite austerity  measures to not only decrease \nspending but also increase productivity.  Rather than relying on heavy government spending to spur growth, \ngovernments in euro zone countries have opted to decrease their debt levels --  or at least to make the promise of \nmoving in that direction.  However, another core of economic analysts has argued that too much debt reduction -- \nwithout government stimulus -- could itself stymie economic growth.  To this latter end, Daniel Gros of the Center \nfor European Policy Studies warned that \"the patient is dead before he can get up and walk.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the economic crisis in Europe was spreading to the domestic political sphere in Germany.  With the \nGerman cabinet of Chancellor Merkel poised to approve that country's part in the euro rescue deal, German voters \nissued a punishing blow to Merkel's conservatives in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia.  The voters' \nreaction appeared to register discontent over the German federal government's decision.  Germans, according to \npolling data, were already incensed over funding of the bail out plan for Greece.\n\nThat  separate package was also approved by the government and parliament.\n\nVulnerable countries take action:\n\n\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing its troubling debt, the  Spanish government on May 20, 2010, approved an austerity \nplan.  The move was also aimed at soothing fears that Spain would devolve into the same type of\n\ndebt crisis that had gripped Greece, with deleterious consequences for the value of the euro and the stability of the \nentire euro zone.  A month later in June 2010, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-\nKahn, was hailing Spain for taking corrective measures to move the country on the path toward economic stability.  \nHowever, as was the case in Italy  (see below) and Greece,  the citizenry and unions were railing against the harsh \nactions.\n\nItaly moved on May 25, 2010 to address its debt challenges by launching its own austerity program on the heels of \nSpain doing the same.  Like Spain, Italy  wanted to hold the confidence of international investors and prevent sliding \ninto a Greek-style debt crisis.  To these ends, the Italian government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi approved \nausterity measures worth 24 billion euros for the years 2011-2012.\n\nUltimately, Italy's government  was hoping to reduce its deficit down to below three percent of GDP by 2012.  In \nresponse, Italian unions took to the streets in protests.  Indeed, Italian civilians, particularly those from the public \nsector, were expected to rail against these moves.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nLetter bombs in Greece sent to embassies and foreign governments\n\nIn the first week of November 2010, a series of letter bombs were sent to embassies in Greece as well as some \nforeign government, prompting the Greek authorities to stop deliveries of foreign mail. More than a dozen such \nincidences occurred during this period. In one case, a letter bomb dispatched to the French embassy in Athens had \nto be safely detonated after an explosive device was found hidden in a book.  In another case, a courier was injured \nwhen a bomb exploded in her hands.  Devices were found at the embassies of Switzerland and Russia. Bombs \nwere earlier mailed to  French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister \nSilvio Berlusconi, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nSince the level of explosives contained in the devices was small, the consensus was that the mailed bombs were \nnot intended to fatally kill anyone.  Nevertheless, two Greek men were arrested and charged with terrorism, \nbelonging to a criminal organization, and possession and use of bombs and explosives in regard to the dispatching \nof these letter bombs.  It was believed that they were members of a far-left extremist organization carrying out \ndomestic terrorism.  To this end, Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said, \"All evidence shows this is a clear \ndomestic case, with no connection with international terrorism.\"\n\nOn December 23, 2010, mail bombs exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome. Two employees of the \nrespective embassies were seriously injured as a result. Concerns about security reached new highs at diplomatic \nmissions across Europe since only a month prior, mail bombs targeted embassies in the Greek capital of Athens. \nSuspicions rested on anarchists, with authorities suggesting a connection between Italian and Greek anarchists in \nregard to the spate of mail bomb attacks.\n\nPolitical Update:\n\nOn November 7, 2010, following a favorable outcome in local Greek elections, Greek Prime Minister George \nPapandreou ruled out the possibility of calling a snap parliamentary election. The local elections were regarded as \nsomething of a referendum on the handling of the dire state of the Greek economy by Papandreou's socialist party \n(PASOK). Elected only a year prior, PASOK has been beset by policy challenges as Greece has tried to survive \ndevastating economic conditions, on the brink of default, and requiring both harsh austerity measures and \n\n\n\nassistance from the European Union. With the local elections ending without massive losses for PASOK, the Greek \nprime minister was interpreting the election results as measured approval from the Greek citizenry. To that end, \nPapandreou said, \"Today voters confirmed their will for change. We will continue our work.\" Indeed, he was making \nit clear that his government had a mandate to move forward with necessary budget cuts, austerity measures and \nrelated reforms, and accordingly, there was no need to call snap elections.\n\nIn mid-December 2010, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens to register their anger \nregarding the government's austerity measures. Those measures, that included caps of salaries of workers in state-\nrun entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a massive bailout package \nfunded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package was intended to save \nGreece from default. A general strike was also taking place with transportation at a standstill, schools closed, and \nflights grounded at Greek airports. The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; they grew \nviolent as demonstrators threw petrol bombs at buildings close to the parliament and set luxury hotels ablaze. As \nwell, one former conservative government minister, Kostis Hatzidakis, was attacked by an angry mob screaming \n\"Thieves! Shame on you!\" The violent clashes resulted in Greek police using tear gas to try to disperse the crowds.\n\nIn February  2011, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens in a 24-hour general strike. \nThe protesters, numbering more than 30,000 in total, rallied toward the parliament building. At issue for the \nprotesters has been their anger over the government's austerity measures. Those measures, which included caps \nof salaries of workers in state-run entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a \nmassive bailout package funded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package \nwas intended to save Greece from default.  The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; \nthey grew violent as demonstrators threw petrol hurled petrol bombs and stones, prompting police to respond with \nthe firing of tear gas.  Meanwhile, the city public transport system was left paralyzed, at least 100 flights were \ncancelled, and schools, hospitals and businesses were forced to close. The deputy leader of one of Greece's most \nimportant unions, Stathis Anestis, said in an interview with the Associate Press that the government measures were \ndisproportionately hurting working people.  He said, \"We are facing long-term austerity, with high unemployment \nand destabilizing our social structure.\" He also promised that mass actions of this sort would not only continue but \nincrease.  Anestis said, \"What is increasing is the level of anger and desperation... If these harsh policies continue, \nso will we.\"\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nThe Greek Debt Crisis and Effects on the Euro Zone\n\nSummary:\n\nAn ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and \nthe International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default.  In a separate but related development, \nthe euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into the European Financial Stability \nFacility (EFSF). Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European \nUnion has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that \ncountry meeting necessary conditions  -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with \nthe relief package. To that end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a national \nreferendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan.  However, with the angry  and outraged Greek citizenry unlikely to \nratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea.  Prime Minister Papandreou also \nresigned from office, and made way for the formation of a national unity government, tasked with pushing through \nthe necessary legislation to implement  austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue \nfunds aimed at averting default.  Without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt \n\n\n\ncommitments -- essentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, yielding to deleterious effects for the euro zone and \nEuropean banks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments remain the prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt \ncrisis, and extending to other countries, such as Italy and Spain in the euro zone, and the global economy at large.  \nDebt woes in Italy and Spain were already leading to political consequences.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn Greece, protesters were taking to the streets in strikes and mass action to register their rejection of the \ngovernment's plan to implement austerity measures.  Such measures were associated with the loans extended to \nGreece to prevent an ongoing debt and default crisis, which  stands at the forefront of the national agenda in that \ncountry. At issue have been deep anxieties about the country of Greece defaulting on its debt, the rising cost of \ninsuring Greek debt against default, along with subsequent speculation about whether the European Union (EU) \nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have to step in to prevent such an outcome.\n\nFears of a government debt default in Europe emerged in the first week of February 2010, with all eyes focused on \nGreece. By April 2010, the prospects of Greece resolving the matter without help from some transnational body \ncame to a head when the Papandreou administration formally said it would accept the EU-IMF financial rescue \npackage to ensure debt service.\n\nIn May 2010, the European Union (EU) agreed on a euro stability package valued at 500 billion euros, aimed at \npreventing the Greek debt crisis from deleteriously affecting other countries in the region. Countries within the EU's \neuro zone would be provided access to loans worth 440 billion euros and emergency funding of 60 billion euros \nfrom the EU.  As well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would earmark an additional 250 billion euros.  The \nEuropean Commission would raise the funds in capital markets, using guarantees from the governments of \nmember states, for the purpose of lending it to countries in economic crisis.\n\nIn addition, it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was prepared to participate in exceptional \nmarket intervention measures, such as the purchase of euro zone government bonds, for the purpose of shoring up \nthe value and viability of the euro currency.\n\nThese moves were aimed at defending  the euro, which has seen its value drop precipitously as a result of the \nGreek debt crisis has gone on, and as anxieties have increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to \nother EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland.\n\nThese mostly  southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural \neconomic weakness.  The situation in such European countries focused attention concomitantly on the European \nUnion where countries of the euro zone share currency but not economic policies, and whose collective fates would \nbe affected by a devalued euro.  Indeed, the euro itself had seen its value slide as a result of rising economic \nanxieties, and questions had once again resurfaced regarding its viability.\n\nEvents from May 2011-June 2011\n\nA year later in May 2011, the Greek debt crisis was ongoing.  Mass action, strikes, and protests had become \nregularized fare as Greek citizens railed against the requisite austerity measures to be implemented as part of the \nagreed up rescue package.\n\nIndeed, May 2011 saw Athens in negotiations with the EU and the IMF to receive a fifth tranche of its rescue \npackage, valued at 110 billion euros.  Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the body that makes up  finance \nministers in the euro zone, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned that the latest installment of the bailout might not be \nadvanced if Greece could not make the case for its solvency within the next year.  The public's clear rejection of \n\n\n\nausterity measures -- manifest in the aforementioned mass action, strikes and demonstrations -- was not helping \nGreece to demonstrate that it could achieve this end.\n\nGiven this landscape, by the start of June 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's,  downgraded Greece from B1 \nto Caa1 -- just short of default and indicated a 50 percent possibility that the country would default on its debt. \nMoody's explained that it was highly concerned about Greece's \"highly uncertain growth prospects.\"  In this way, \nGreece's credit rating had fallen in tandem with the rising fears that the country was not capable of stabilizing its \ndebt burden in a timely fashion.  Moody's additionally held its outlook for Greece in the negative column, indicating \nthat further downgrades could be in the offing.  Now, though, Greece was now located at the bottom of the Moody's \nranking -- below Montenegro -- in a listing of Europe's credit-worthy countries.  As mid-June 2011 approached, yet \nanother credit ratings agency --  Standard & Poor's -- downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing the \ncountry to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries.\n\nFaced with these emerging challenges, as well as the prevailing burden of debt servicing and ultimate solvency, \nattention refocused on strategies to address the crisis.  One option that surfaced was the  restructuring of Greece's \ndebt.  As suggested by Chairman  Jean-Claude Juncker, repayments on Greece's shorter-term debt could be \npostponed, if lenders would agree to terms.  This type of \"debt re-profiling\" would be voluntary and would not be \nclassified as default by credit ratings agencies. The European Central Bank (ECB) has indicated that while typical \nrestructuring schemes would be opposed, a voluntary debt re-profiling arrangement might be deemed acceptable.\n\nNote that by the second week of June 2011, the Greek cabinet had backed budget cuts as part of a fiscal and \nstructural adjustment program required by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as part of the \nconditions associated with the aforementioned rescue package.  The plan would now have to be voted on in \nparliament; that vote was expected to take place by the end of the month (June 2011) -- the deadline specified for \nthe next tranche of rescue loans to be made available.\n\nMeanwhile, early June saw public sector  unions take to the streets in a mass strike in protest of harsh austerity \nmeasures to come.  By the second week of June, the anti-austerity riots continued with thousands of people \ninvolved in demonstrations.  Syntagma Square in Athens was becoming \"ground zero\" of the protest movement.  \nThat being said, protest action was spread across other terrain. Ports and state-run companies were shut down, \npublic transportation was disrupted, while banks and hospitals could only offer limited service. The scene eventually \ndevolved into violent territory, forcing police to fire teargas to disperse crowds outside the parliament building.  This \nscene erupted as members of parliament were about to debate the new fiscal and structural adjustment program \n(discussed above), which the Greek cabinet had already passed, and which was a required condition for the EU \nand IMF bail-out packages.\n\nFurther strike action was expected by protesters, self-termed \"the Indignants,\" and calling for \"resistance\"  ahead of \nthe parliamentary vote.\n\nAt the political level, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was facing an all-out revolt from his own Socialist \nParty (known by the acronym, PASOK), the members of whom were  reacting to the scene on the streets of Athens. \nIn fact, at least one member of PASOK defected to the opposition to register his personal protest against the \nausterity measures, while another PASOK member warned that he intended to vote against him.  Several other \nPASOK members of parliament were making it known that their votes were not assured.  It was apparent that they \nwere showing solidarity with \"the Indignants\" in the streets.\n\nWhile the members of parliament were accountable to the citizens of the Hellenic republic, the fact remained that \nGreece -- as a sovereign state within the EU -- was itself accountable to the economic bloc of which it is a member.  \nUnderstanding the gravity of the political situation and the potentially devastating economic fallout -- not only for \nGreece nationally, but for its standing in the EU, and the future of the euro --  Prime Minister  Papandreou proposed \nthe formation of a unity government, with an eye on passing the measures in the national interest.  To this end, the \nprime minister convened talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias, arguing passionately that \"a national effort\" \nwas required at this \"historically crucial moment\" to resolve the situation.  Prime Minister  Papandreou, therefore, \nmet with conservative New Democracy Party  leader, Antonis Samaras, to discuss the possible formation of a \n\n\n\npower-sharing government. For its part, the conservatives demanded that Papandreou step aside and that the \nrescue package be renegotiated.  While Prime Minister\n\nPapandreou made it clear that he would be willing to resign as the head of government, the notion of a potentially \nprotracted process of renegotiating the bail-out terms was viewed as untenable at a time of dire instability.  Thus, \nthe  prime minister abandoned the idea of a unity government and instead announced that he would reveal a new \ncabinet.  The new government, which could very well exclude Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, the \narchitect of unpopular austerity budget, would have to be ratified via a  vote of confidence in the parliament.\n\nIndeed, on June 17, 2011, as Prime Minister Papandreou unveiled his cabinet changes, it was apparent that \nFinance Minister Papaconstantinou would no longer be in that role; instead, outgoing Defense Minister Evangelos \nVenizelos would take on the finance portfolio.  Having moved forward with a cabinet shuffle, Greek Prime Minister  \nPapandreou was calling for \"national accord\" in parliament to address the crisis.  In a speech to parliament, the \nGreek head of government said,  \"I have asked for a renewal of confidence in the government, because the country \nfinds itself at a crucial point.\"\n\nThe move  to appoint  Venizelos  as the new finance minister was geared toward assuaging the rising tide of \ndiscontent among the prime minister's party, PASOK; however, the elimination of  Papaconstantinou  was \nsimultaneously delivering a negative message to the international community about Greece's ability to seriously \nand effectively tackle its economic problems. Venizelos statement that he would forge a deal with Greece's bail-out \nlenders that would allow Greece to implement a less painful reform package indicated that the incoming finance \nminister would be a weaker voice in the austerity thrust.\n\nThe crisis was seeping outside Greek borders as finance ministers of the euro zone failed to find concurrence on \nthe measures associated with garnering contributions from private creditors towards a second Greek rescue \npackage. Of concern was the potential destabilization of the financial markets as this process played out -- and \nfailed -- in the Belgian capital in Brussels. Now other \"secure\" countries were being affected as news emerged that \nMoody's might downgrade some French banks -- BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generaledue  -- due to \ntheir exposure to Greek debt.  With an eye on calming the situation, the French government made it clear that its \nposition was consistent with that of the European Central Bank (ECB), which warned that the German plan to \nconvince bondholders to share part of the costs  in a new Greek aid package could be risky and lead to default.  It \nwas also announced that  French President Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on \nJune 17, 2011, to address and resolve the matter.\n\nOn June 19, 2011, finance ministers of the euro zone were meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the anticipated \napproval of the latest tranche of funds associated with the EU/IMF rescue package for debt-ridden Greece.\n\nThe group was also expected to consider a second bail-out package for Greece.  The new Greek finance minister,  \nVenizelos,  attended the meeting and said that his country was committed to meeting the targets of the EU/IMF \nagreement. In an interview with the media, Venizelos said, \"It is a great opportunity for me to repeat the strong \ncommitment of the Greek government and the strong will of the Greek people for the implementation of the \nprogram.\"  That being said, recent surveys of the Greek citizenry suggested that the vast majority of Greeks at \nhome were in fact opposed to the austerity measures associated with the rescue package and were increasingly \nsaying that the country should just default.  Of course, such a fate would  increase exposure of other euro zone \ncountries, increasing the possibility of default elsewhere in the region.\n\nNote that as June entered its fourth week, the newly-shuffled  Greek government was set for a confidence vote.  To \nthat end, the government indeed survived the vote with a comfortable majority.\n\nIndeed, Prime Minister George Papandreou's new cabinet was approved by 155 votes to 143, with two \nabstentions.  Another vote  in parliament on the austerity budget had yet to transpire by the close of June  2011.  \nRelease of the EU/IMF rescue package funds would only be released if the austerity measures were passed into \n\n\n\nlegislation in the parliament.  Accordingly, the finance ministers of the euro zone postponed their decisions \nregarding the release of the funds as well as a second rescue package until after the anticipated  vote.  The new \nhead of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, called on the Greek members of parliament to act to avoid default saying: \"If I \nhave a message this evening about Greece, it is a call to the Greek opposition... to join in national unity with the \nparty which is currently in power. The country's destiny is at stake.\" Warning of global consequences, EU President \nHerman Van Rompuy  said, \"The coming hours will be decisive, crucial for the Greek people, but also for the euro \nzone and the stability of the world economy.\"\n\nOn June 28, 2011, ahead of the parliamentary vote on the austerity budget, thousands of people had gathered \noutside the parliamentary building as part of an anticipated mass strike. To that end, as before, transportation and \nother public services, hospitals, banks, and the Athens international airport, were all either closed down or severely \ncurtailed.  In a corner of Syntagma Square, the protest movement, which was intended to be a peaceful gathering, \ntook a violent turn as anarchist youth dressed in black hoods hurled stones, bottles,  debris, and even \nsledgehammers at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.  As well, protesters set mobile \ntelecommunications transmitting vehicles were set ablaze, seemingly having been mistaken for being satellite \ntelevision trucks. Members of trade unions tried to persuade anarchists to stop their violent actions and exit \nSyntagma Square; they argued that the violence only hurt the objectives of the protest movement. However, the \nscene had already devolved into some degree of chaos.  Indeed, several people were injured in the fracas, \nincluding 20 police officers, while a number of demonstrators were detained by authorities.\n\nWith the vote in parliament set to go forward on June 29, 2011, regardless of the chaos in the streets, Greek Prime \nMinister  Papandreou  warned that without affirmative action, and further, without being able to  secure new loans, \nthe Greek national coffers would fall empty before long.  Newly-installed Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos \nadmitted that the austerity measures were \"unfair,\" but argued that there was no other alternative.  Greece's Central \nBanker George Provopoulos warned that  a negative vote against the austerity budget  vote would constitute  \n\"suicide\" for the country. But on the other side of the equation, the main opposition leader, Antonis Samaras of the \nNew Democracy party,  was not keen to assent to the austerity package  as it stood (including tax hikes), saying \nthat tax rates should be lowered in order to stimulate the economy.  In addition to resistance from the opposition, \nPrime Minister  Papandreou would also have to deal with the aforementioned revolt from within his own PASOK \nparty.\n\nNevertheless, on June 29, 2011, when the much-anticipated vote on the austerity budget was held in parliament, \nthe measure passed with a slim majority of  155 votes in its favor to 138 votes against it.  Ultimately, only one \nmember of parliament form the ruling PASOK party voted against the bill, although there were a handful of \nabstentions and \"non\" votes.  Contained in the austerity budget were tax increases, cuts to salaries, as well as \naction on privatizations and public sector redundancies. Greek Prime Minister  Papandreou welcomed the passage  \nof the legislation as \"a crucial step\" for Greece.  At the multilateral level,  European Commission President Jose \nManuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy issued a joint statement that hailed the \nvote as a measure of national responsibility.  The statement included the following sentence: \"The country has \ntaken an important step forward along the necessary path of fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing structural \nreform.\"  However, the vote outcome prompted an angry renewal of violence  by protesters in the streets of Athens.  \nA second vote ensued a day later on June 30, 2011, and passed with a majority of votes in its favor.  The second \nbill would reform laws and effectively facilitate the implementation of the rescue package.\n\nStatus of Events in mid-2011\n\nAll eyes were on the deadline in the first week of July 2011 for the euro zone whereby the EU would have to \napprove the latest rescue loans to Greece. It was assumed that with the parliament voting favorably on the austerity \nand privatization program, the funds by the EU and IMF would, indeed, be released.  To that end, on July 2, 2011, \nfinance ministers of the euro zone said that they would clear the release of the funds for Greece.  Yet to be decided \nwere the details surrounding a second bailout package for Greece.\n\nNote that in mid-July 2011, at an  emergency euro zone summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel cast the \nsecond  rescue package for Greece in some degree of doubt when she said that there would be no  \"spectacular\" \n\n\n\nmeasures aimed at  resolving Greece's debt crisis, such as the restructuring of Greek debt.  The German \nchancellor made it clear that there needed to be a concrete plan for a second Greek rescue package, if there was \nany hope that the debt crisis in that country would be prevented from spreading across the euro zone.  Merkel's \nstatement appeared to reflect an ongoing disagreement between her country and the European Central Bank \n(ECB) over the matter of private investors sharing the costs  of another rescue deal.  Germany, backed by Finland \nand the Netherlands, has made it clear that private investors need to share the pain, rather than only burdening \ntaxpayers.  On the other hand, the ECB has held the view that forcing private investors to take losses on their loans \nwould be akin to  a default by Greece on its debts.  This impasse did not bode well for the core objective in bailing \nout Greece in the first place -- the prevention of contagion across the euro zone.\n\nUltimately, though, concurrence was reached on July 21, 2011, with a rescue package of about 109 billion euro. \nEarly drafts of the plan indicated that it would entail several proposals to reduce Greece's debt, including \nexchanging existing bonds for new  lower interest rate bonds, and could result in short-term or \"partial\" default for \nGreece. To be clear, the plan provides for the Germany-endorsed position that private lenders, including banks, \nwould have to do their part in contributing to the package.  Any  measures that would allow Greece easier \nrepayment terms could be viewed  by credit rating agencies as acknowledgment that its  borrowing was \nunsustainable -- and therefore,  \"partial default.\"\n\nGiven this possibility, it was perhaps not surprising that on July 25, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, cut \nGreece's rating further, this time from Caa1 to Ca -- only two notches short of a default rating.  Moody's said that \nthe plan discussed above to exchange existing bonds for new lower interest rate bonds, would  constitute default. \nMeanwhile, the ratings agency, Fitch, said that this very deal would be understood as \"selective debt default\" by \nGreece.  Already, as noted above, Standard & Poor's had downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing \nthe country to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries.  Then on July 27, 2011, Standard & Poor's \nfurther downgraded Greece  from a CCC rating to CC, reflecting its view that the euro zone restructuring debt plan \ndiscussed here would constitute a \"selective debt default\" by Greece.  Fitch indicated it would follow in a similar \ndirection.\n\nRecent Developments (Sept. 2011)\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2011, Greek labor unions convened a 24-hour mass action strike to register discontent over further \nausterity measures instituted by  the government.  The unions targeted the public transport sector with workers from \nbus, taxi, train services involved, as well as air traffic controllers stopping work for several hours.  Teachers and \nother civil servants were additionally joining the strike.  Athens was expected to shut down, including the  airport.\n\nAt issue were the additional strict measures to  be taken  up by the Greek government to cut pensions and suspend \ncertain civil service jobs, in an effort to satisfy the European Union (EU)  and the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), and thus procure the latest installment of loan funding  intended to assist Greece in paying its massive debt \nand avert default.\n\nTo date,  the European Commission, the EU, and the IMF have been unimpressed by Athens' slow pace of reform \nand have warned that further measures would be needed to qualify for the funding. For the people in the streets, \nthough, there was no appreciation for the need to meet the terms set forth by the EU and the IMF, with many of \nthem disconnected from the financial realities of the scenario, such as default avoidance and maintaining EU status.\n\nAs stated by Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, \"The situation is extremely critical and I could say \ndangerous. There is great nervousness in the euro zone, the European banking system and the world economy.\" \nWhereas Finance Minister Venizelos was saying that the Greek government was prepared to do \"anything\" to avoid \ndeleterious consequences, many Greek citizens were under the impression that they were being faced with years of \nausterity in order to pay French and German banks, with Greek newspapers striking populist tones and accusing \nthe government of placing Greek citizens on the \"sacrificial altar.\"\n\nAs September 2011 drew to an end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was engaged in talks with German \nChancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the efforts by the Greek government to reduce its budget deficit.  With \n\n\n\nGermany funding the bulk of the  EU rescue package, support from German quarters was essential.  To that end, \nthe Greek head of government also delivered a speech to German business leaders, in which he made his case for \nGerman funding assistance in resolving the Greek debt crisis.  That being said, the European Commission, the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF were yet to travel to Athens to review Greece's progress in reducing  \ndebt levels, and to make a decision on the release  of the latest tranche of bailout funds.  See below for information \nrelated to the decision made on that matter.\n\nStatus of Greek Debt Crisis (Oct. 2011)\n\nAt the start of October 2011, the Greek government in Athens adopted its 2012 draft austerity budget. That news \nwas somewhat overshadowed by the Greek government's announcement that the country was likely to miss  its \ndeficit reduction targets.\n\nAthens blamed its shortfall on meeting deficit reduction targets on the country's deepening recession, pointing \ntoward an economic contraction  of 5.5 percent in 2011 rather than a rate of 3.8 percent, as expected months \nearlier.  A statement from the Greek Finance Minister read as follows: \"Three critical months remain to finish 2011, \nand the final estimate of 8.5 percent of GDP deficit can be achieved if the state mechanism and citizens respond \naccordingly.\"  But the Greek citizenry was in no mood to respond favorably and, instead, continued to take to the \nstreets in strikes and protests.\n\nIn an attempt to cast the scenario in the most positive light, the Greek finance ministry said that it was moving \nforward with its highly unpopular austerity measures, regardless of the outrage coming from the Greek citizenry. \nIncluded in the austerity provisions was a plan to put 30,000 civil service staff on \"labor reserve\" by the end of 2011, \nas well as cuts to salaries and wages, and a package of tax increases.  These  austerity measures were intended to \nshow the economic rescue \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU), and the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) that Greece was taking on necessary measures to address its debt crisis.\n\nTo this end, representatives of the IMF, the EU, and the ECB, were set to review Greece's progress in reducing  \ndebt levels, and to make a decision on the release  of the latest installment of bailout funds. However, before a \ndecision could be made, the finance ministers from the euro zone put the metaphoric \"brakes\" on the decision-\nmaking.  After hours of talks in Luxembourg, the finance ministers from the 17-nation euro zone urged Greece to \ntake on more sacrifices and warned that banks in region should prepare for further challenges.\n\nWith a delay on the decision on releasing the latest tranche of bailout funds for Greece, it was yet to be seen if the \nIMF, EU, and ECB would ultimately recommend the release of eight billion euros in bailout funds for Greece. Some \ndeadlines of significance included mid-October 2011, when the decision would finally be made, and the actual \nrelease of funds to come (pending approval) at the close of October 2011.  However, the current scenario \nsuggested that Greece might not receive its needed installment of rescue funds until November 2011.  Presumably \nwith the aim of preventing a sense of panic, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos wasted no time in stating \nthat the Greek government would have no funding problems until November 2011.  Of course, Greece had earlier \nindicated it would be in need of funds by the middle of October 2011.\n\nNote that as October 2011 entered its final week, finance ministers of the euro zone finally approved the tranche of \nrescue funds needed for Greece to escape disastrous default.  The International Monetary Fund would also have to \nsign off on the release of the bail out money, but all expectations were that  Athens would receive the much-needed \nfunds by mid-November 2011.\n\nShould Greece fail to service its debt commitments, there would be deleterious effects for the euro zone, European \nbanks, and at the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.\n\nChairman of the euro zone finance ministers (known as the euro group), Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of \nLuxembourg,  foreclosed the possibility of a debt default by Greece, while simultaneously warning that Greece's \nprivate sector creditors should anticipate further losses on their Greek sovereign debt holdings \u2013 indeed, greater \n\n\n\nthan the 21 percent  \"haircut\" that was previously agreed upon months earlier.  At that time in July 2011, private \nsector creditors had agreed to join the euro zone and the IMF in providing a second bailout package for Greece.\n\nThe European Financial Stability Facility\n\nIn mid-October 2011, all euro zone countries had ratified a plan to expand a rescue  fund for  Europe's heavily \nindebted countries, known as the European Financial Stability Facility.  By the end of the month, European leaders \nannounced that an agreement had been reached to help to resolve the euro zone debt crisis.  Central to the \nagreement was acceptance from the banks that they would  take a 50 percent loss on the face value of their Greek \ndebt.  Banks would also have to  raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future \ngovernment defaults. As well, the actual rescue or \"bail out\"  fund, known as the European Financial Stability \nFacility (EFSF), would be boosted to one trillion euros.\n\nThe hope was that the move would aid in reducing Greek debt to 120 percent of GDP by the year, 2020.  While this \nremained a significant enduring debt, it was deemed to be far more sustainable for a recession-plagued economy \nundertaking harsh austerity measures.  It was hoped that the accord would contain the debt crisis and prevent \ncontagion into other vulnerable euro zone countries, such as Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.  It was also hoped \nthat the deal would serve to revitalize the credibility of the euro.\n\nThe issue has been an extremely contentious one, with the participants of the global economy anxious for action to \nbe taken in response to the debt crisis, but with  stakeholders in various euro zone countries infuriated that they \nwould be funding  bailout packages that would benefit countries, such as Greece. It should also be noted that there \nwas a growing chorus of complaints about the slow and protracted political response to the debt crisis and \nconcomitant euro zone challenges, which was largely due to the EU's institutional structure.\n\nReferendum for Greece?\n\nBy the start of November 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was seeking national consensus for the \nimplementation of the series of harsh  and unpopular austerity measures, which were required elements of the debt \nrelief plan to stabilize Greece and the euro zone.  To that end, the embattled Greek head of government was \nconsidering seeking the public's ratification of the European Union plan in a national referendum.  However,  all \nindications pointed toward a definitively negative outcome at the polls, given the incensed Greek citizenry's \nantipathy toward the massively unpopular austerity measures, and the belief that the country should simply default \nand exit the euro zone. The international community reacted in a state of collective horror, given the likely \noutcome of this risky move. Clearly, a \"no\" vote would return Greece to the brink of economic disaster, as it would \neffectively be a rejection of the debt relief plan. Prime Minister Papandreou was also facing by a rebellion in his own \ngovernment and in parliament, with various players outraged at the various options going forward -- austerity or \nbankruptcy.\n\nAccordingly, Prime Minister Papandreou on Nov. 3, 2011 backed away from the controversial referendum notion \nand, instead, suggested that he would pursue coalition talks, with the intention of forming a stable unity (or \n\"salvation\") government that would be tasked with bringing the Greek economy from the precipice of crisis.  Prime \nMinister Papandreou  said, \"We had three alternatives, to call general election, hold a referendum, or achieve a \nwide consensus.\"\n\nWith the main Greek opposition party reversing course, and now expressing support for the European Union debt \nrelief  deal (discussed above), Prime Minister Papandreou  was pursuing the third option.  The beleaguered Greek \nhead of government said that he had no intention of resigning from office, but that he would  seek a confidence vote \nin parliament, and then move forward with the formation of \"a national salvation government.\"\n\nTwo days later on Nov. 5, 2011, Prime Minister Papandreou survived the crucial confidence vote in parliament and \npromised to form the aforementioned \"national salvation government.\" Despite open rebellion among the ranks of \nthe ruling Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK), all PASOK members of parliament stood in solidarity with the \nprime minister on the confidence motion discussed above. The final vote result was  153 favorable votes and 147 \nagainst the Papandreou government.  Clearly, it was a narrow victory and may have averted the another potentially \n\n\n\nnegative outcome -- immediate elections, which clearly would have been politically catastrophic for Greece, which \nwas already dealing with economic crisis.\n\nNew Government for Greece\n\nWith the confidence vote behind him, Prime Minister Papandreou pledged that he would commence negotiations to \nform a national unity (re: \"salvation\") government immediately, saying that he would soon visit Greek President \nKarolos Papoulias to start the process, and indicating that he was even ready to step aside as head of government, \nif necessary. After that meeting, the Greek head of government said, \"I informed the president on my intention to \nseek wide consensus in order to proceed with the implementation of the historic decisions of October 26 upon \nwhich depends our membership inthe euro zone.\" The outcome of the negotiations, though, remained hazy.\n\nAt issue was a brewing disagreement on the tenure of the interim government and the timeline leading to fresh \nelections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the main opposition New Democracy (ND) party, was insisting that the \ninterim government have only a limited term, given the immediate objective at hand (re: rescuing Greece from the \nbrink of economic disaster under the aegis of national consensus), with  snap elections to be held by the year's \nend.  Samaras argued, \"The masks have fallen. Mr. Papandreou has rejected our proposals in their entirety. The \nresponsibility he bears is huge. The only solution is elections.\"\n\nIt was possible that Prime Minister Papandreou could form a coalition government with two minor opposition \nparties, whose leaders have expressed their willingness to join a temporary coalition. These two right-wing parties \nappeared more amenable to a longer timeline of cooperation with Papandreou, expressing doubt that any coalition \ngovernment would be able to easily push through parliament the necessary legislation to enact the provisions of the \nEuropean Union debt relief deal.  They were particularly skeptical that the interim government would be effective \nwithout the involvement of the ND, which was emphatic in its demands for snap elections by the end of 2011.\n\nBy Nov. 6, 2011, opposition leader Samaras of the ND was demanding that Prime Minister Papandreou resign from \noffice, arguing that the head of government was taking too long to enact reforms.  In an interview with the media, \nSamaras said, \"The prime minister must decide what he wants to do, as by not resigning he hampers any solution.\" \nSamaras also made it clear that  his party would not  participate in a national coalition plan if Papandreou remained \nas prime minister. For his part, Prime Minister Papandreou had made it clear that he was willing to relinquish his \npost -- but only after a national unity government was formed, rather than as a condition of that possible outcome.  \nIt was evident that the two main political parties in Greece -- PASOK and the ND -- were embroiled in a high-stakes \ngame of political brinkmanship, with the national, and indeed, the international community as the metaphoric \nvictims in the center of the political cross-fire.\n\nNevertheless, later on that very day, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government \nhad been formed, without Prime Minister George Papandreou, who had agreed to step down as the head of \ngovernment.  Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias  would prevail on all parties to join the \nnew government. All eyes were on current Finance Minister Venizelos or former Deputy President of the European \nCentral Bank Lukas Papademos, as possible candidates to head the new national government.\n\nUltimately, on Nov. 7, 2011, it was Papademos who was tapped  to be the interim leader of the new transitional  \nGreek administration.  With academic gravitas as an economist who has written extensively about the debt crisis as \nwell as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, \neconomic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the European Union,  Papademos was regarded \nas a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" government.  Papademos' background at the helm of \nthe European Central Bank augured the possibility of a cooperative relationship with the European Union and the \nInternational Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.\n\nNote that Prime Minister Papademos' government won a confidence vote in parliament on Nov 16, 2011.  The \ngoverning coalition garnered a substantial majority of 255 favorable votes.  The successful  vote was a significant \ndevelopment for the new government, despite strong concerns from opposition parties  --  the conservative New \n\n\n\nDemocracy party and the far right Laos party -- regarding the austerity measures that are part of the plan to address \nthe Greek debt crisis.\n\nIt was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and \nuncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone.  Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister \nEvangelos Venizelos was warning that the Greek economy remained in \"mortal danger,\" ultimately requiring that \nthe interim government to remain in power long enough to ensure the full implementation of all necessary \nprocedures to stabilize the Greek economy.  Indeed, the interim government would be tasked with implementing the \nfull slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would  have to ensure the release of the \nnext European Union / International Monetary Fund loan installment in the near future,  and would also have to \nfinalize legislation for the new rescue package. Most importantly, that legislation would have to be passed into law.  \nMoreover, Greece would have to look to private creditors for assistance in writing off its debt.\n\nRecent Developments --\n\nBy the start of December 2011, the leaders of the two biggest players in the euro zone -- French President Nicolas \nSarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- issued a joint call for serious changes to Europe's governing \ntreaties, aimed at ameliorated economic governance for the 17 countries that make up the euro currency bloc. \nFrench President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel met for talks on the matter in Paris as the euro zone \ncountries continue to grapple with the regional debt crisis, emanating from Greece but extending across the euro \nbloc.\n\nIncluded in their proposal were:  (1) the creation of a monetary fund for Europe, (2) automatic penalties for countries \nthat exceed European deficit limits, and (3) monthly meetings of European leaders. The proposal entailed \ncompromises by both European leaders.  President Sarkozy had to accept the notion of automatic sanctions for \ncountries in violation of debt limit rules, while Chancellor Merkel had to accept that the European Court of Justice \nwill not be empowered with the power of veto over budgets.  Meanwhile, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), \nwhich was intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility in 2013, would be advanced earlier in 2012.\n\nPresident Sarkozy said that they were looking to March 2012 to complete negotiations on the new treaty.  Ideally, \nthe new treaty would be ratified by all 27 member states of the European Union.  However, if concurrence at that \nlevel proved impossible, then the 17 states of the euro zone would have to approve it.  It should also  be noted that \nEuropean Council President Herman Van Rompuy has said that tougher budget rules for the euro zone may not \nrequire changing any existing European Union treaties.  To that\n\nPresident Sarkozy emphasized the imperative that such a crisis not re-emerge in the future.  He said, \"We are \nconscious of the gravity of the situation and of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders.\" For her part, \nChancellor Merkel said her country, working in concert with France, was \"absolutely determined\" to maintain a \nstable euro.  She also advocated for \"structural changes which go beyond agreements.\"\n\nWhile the new measures would certainly go a long way to addressing the issue of improved economic governance \nin the euro zone, they did not deal with the question of how many euro zone countries would deal with their debt \nchallenges in a climate of low growth. Nevertheless, in the short run, the steadfast and unified message of intent by \nthe two European leaders was, at least. expected to calm markets and facilitate lower borrowing costs for debt-\nridden economies such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.\n\nMeanwhile, on Dec. 5, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, placed the countries of the euro zone \non a \"credit watch\" with negative implications.  Even power house economies of Germany and France were \nincluded in the move, which presaged a downgrade to come in the future.  A day later,  Standard and Poor's even \nwarned that the euro zone bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- could lose its own AAA rating.  \nThese moves have raised eyebrows across the world as regards the credibility of the ratings agency, which failed to \nwarn the world of the sub-prime meltdown in 2008 that ultimately let to the global financial crisis.  There were \nsuggestions that this downgrade threat to euro zone countries, in conjunction with the downgrade of the United \n\n\n\nStates months earlier following a particularly ferocious debt ceiling debate in that country, were evidence that the \ncredit ratings agency was trying to \"save face\" by proving its tougher standards at this time.  However, Standard \nand Poor's newly-discovered hard-line stance was being questioned by analysts, who pointed to the timing of the \nwarning against euro zone countries.  Indeed, this warning came precisely at a time when France and Germany \nwere leading the charge in the European Union to solve the regional debt crisis emanating from Greece, which has \nleft the euro vulnerable, risked fragmenting the currency union, and which could yet imperil the fragile global \neconomic recovery.\n\nIn January 2012, the credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, downgraded the status of a number of European \ncountries.  That being said,  Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nGreece on the brink; Athens in flames as Greek members of parliament vote to approve austerity measures\n\nBackground\n\nIn recent years, an ongoing debt crisis has raged across the euro zone countries of the European Union (EU).  \nSince 2010, Greece has stood as \"ground zero\" of the crisis, evoking deep anxieties about that country defaulting \non its debt.\n\nAnxieties  also increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, \nSpain, Italy and even Ireland. There were  prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt crisis, but \nextending to these mostly  southern European economies, which were plagued not only by high deficits but also \ninherent structural economic weakness.\n\nThe crisis in Greece led to the development of a rescue plan by the European Union and the International \nMonetary Fund, which was aimed at  averting sovereign default by Athens.  In a separate but related development, \nthe euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into what has been known as the \nEuropean Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).\n\nDespite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, the European Union has not been \nquick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting \nnecessary conditions  -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief \npackage.\n\nA new technocratic government was  formed and tasked with pushing through the necessary legislation to \nimplement the required austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue funds aimed at \naverting default. But no government can function divorced from the reality of the political realm, and the political \nscene in Greece was one in which the politicians -- fearing the reaction of an infuriated citizenry -- were not going to \neasily assent to the stringent transformations needed to secure rescue funds.\n\nOf course, without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt commitments -- \nessentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, and yielding  deleterious effects for the euro zone and European \nbanks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.\n\nJust past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform \npackage needed to secure rescue funds.  But outside the parliament in the streets of Athens, the city was literally \nablaze as rioters and protesters set fire to buildings to register their outrage.\n\nLandscape at the start of 2012\n\n\n\nIn late January 2012, Greek authorities were set to meet with private creditors to forge a debt write-off agreement \nthat would reduce Greece's debt.  At issue was the lack of concurrence over an interest rate on new bonds that \nwould replace existing debts.  The Institute  of International Finance ( IIF), which was representing Greece's private \ncreditors in negotiations with the Greek authorities, said that it desired a four percent interest rate on newly-issued \nbonds.  Athens, however, sought a lower rate. Should an agreement be reached, Greece would be positioned for \nadditional rescue funding.  Indeed, forging an agreement with private creditors has been mandated before further \nrescue funds can be dispatched by  the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International \nMonetary Fund.  Of course, without those funds, Athens would default on its forthcoming loan repayments.\n\nThere remained questions about whether the intervention of the private creditors would be enough to provide \nGreece with relief.  Accordingly, Christine Lagarde -- the head of the International Monetary Fund -- said that if the \nlevel of Greek debt held by the private sector was  not sufficiently renegotiated, then public sector holders of Greek \ndebt should also participate in the effort. An unfavorable outcome to this process could result in Greece being \nforced to exit the euro zone.\n\nIt should be noted that in January 2012,  credit ratings agencies downgraded the status of a number of European \ncountries.  That being said,  Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"\n\nBy the start of February 2012, there was no consensus within the Greek leadership regarding the terms of certain \nreforms and austerity measures  needed to secure an aid package.  While Greek politicians agreed to cut \nsignificant government jobs in 2012, there was also no consensus over reductions in salaries.  Indeed, Greek \npoliticians were refusing to yield to the demands of the European Union that severe austerity measures be \nimplemented. There were rumors circulating that interim technocratic  Prime Minister Lucas Papademos might \nconsider resigning from office if he failed to gain the support of the three political parties backing the coalition \nadministration.  That objective became harder to accomplish when Greek unions closed ranks with management \ngroups and made it clear that they were opposed to  proposed salary reductions.  They said that wage reductions \nwere unacceptable.  Moreover, two of the largest trade unions  in Greece were set to commence strikes to register \ndiscontent over the plans for pay cuts.\n\nGiven the lack of progress made regarding necessary reforms and austerity measures, Finance Minister Evangelos \nVenizelos blasted the political parties for failing to approach the talks with a sense of urgency.  He said, \"Instead of \nlooking at this tragic dilemma... there are many who spend their effort on a conventional, outdated, party \nconfrontation as if nothing has happened. Sadly, we are distracted and we are not telling the Greek people the \ntruth,\" he said in a statement.\n\nEuro zone leadership frustrated by Greece's lack of action\n\nAt the broader level, other countries of the European Union were making it clear that Greece needed to \nimmediately take the necessary steps -- already agreed upon -- to avoid default.  As stated by French President \nNicolas Sarkozy, \"Greece's leaders have made commitments and they must respect them scrupulously.\"  German \nChancellor Angela Merkel warned the refusal of Greece to take the necessary steps toward austerity and reform \nthreatened \"the entire euro zone .\" The German Chancellor said, \"There can be no new Greece program if \nagreement is not reached... All those who bear responsibility in Greece must know -- we will not deviate from this \nposition.\"  She also expressed frustration over the slowness of Greece to take action, saying,  \"I honestly can't \nunderstand how additional days will help. Time is of the essence. A lot is at stake forthe entire euro zone.\"\n\nLikewise, Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro zone group of finance ministers, said in an interview with Der \nSpiegel that he had lost his patience with Greece.  He warned that if  Athens failed to move forward the required \nreforms and austerity measures,  and failed to forge a debt write off agreement with private creditors, \"Then there \nwould not be a new program and that would mean that in March a declaration of bankruptcy would occur.\"\n\nLatest Developments (February 2012)\n\nOn Feb. 9. 2012, Greek  political leaders finally announced they had reached an agreement by which  a package of \nharsh austerity and reform measures would be enacted into law, as demanded by Greece's financial backers.\n\n\n\nThe package included 15,000 public-sector job cuts (as discussed above), the lowering of the minimum wage by 20 \npercent (a key sticking point that was now  going to go forward), the liberalization (or reform) of labor laws, and \nnegotiations aimed at a debt write-off with banks.  The package was presented to a gathering of euro zone \nministers in Brussels; there, leaders of the European bloc expressed the view that the package was short on \nsavings and that they needed  \"strong political assurances\" on the implementation of the packages.\n\nTo that latter end, attention was soon refocused  on the approval of the associated legislation by the Greek cabinet \nand final passage in the Greek parliament.\n\nWhile approval in the Greek cabinet occurred, five government ministers resigned from office presumably to show \ndisapproval for the harshness of the measures.  Now, the action shifted to the parliament where the bill had to \npassed if Greece hoped to receive funds needed to avoid bankruptcy in March 2012.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2012,  Prime Minister Papademos took to the air waves in Greece to warn the Greek citizenry that \nfailure to pass the legislation  would be \"disastrous\" for the country.  He said, \"The social cost of this program is \nlimited in comparison with the economic and social catastrophe that would follow if we didn't adopt it.\"  Prime \nMinister Papademos warned that without the passage of the bill and the infusion of rescue funds, the Greek \ngovernment would be unable to pay wages, and there would be disruptions to the importation of fuel, medicine and \nmachinery.  He argued affirmatively for the legislation asserting, \"It would be a huge historical injustice if the country \nfrom which European culture sprang ... reached bankruptcy and was led, due to one more mistake, to national \nisolation and national despair.\"\n\nBy Feb. 12, 2012, members of parliament were soon ensconced in the process of debating the bill and introducing \nthe legislative measures.  The general consensus was that the legislation would be passed since PASOK, along \nwith its  coalition ally, New Democracy, controlled more than 230 seats in the 200-seat unicameral \"Vouli ton \nEllinon\" or parliament.  Members of the Greek legislative body would also have to vote on an additional bill dealing \nwith the debt write-off agreement with private banks.\n\nAs members of parliament debated the legislation, Greeks outside of parliament were opposing the move.  While \nthe international community understood that default in Greece could imperil the financial stability of Europe, Greek \ncitizens had a different perspective.  Greek citizens, by and large, haveviewed themselves to be already suffering \nunder the weight of an economic disaster and have vociferously opposed further measures that would worsen their \nliving conditions.  Indeed, large swaths of the country believed that Greece should exit the euro zone, return to a \ndevalued \"drachma\" (the former currency), and dealing with the consequences with less of an acute stranglehold.  \nOf course, the wishes  of the Greek masses and decision makers in Athens and across Europe were on a collision \ncourse.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to voice their outrage over the proposed \nausterity and reform legislation.  Indeed, for successive days, mass protests rocked Athens. The scene turned \nviolent in Athens on Feb. 12, 2012, as black-masked protesters protesters hurled stones and petrol bombs, leaving \nbuildings damaged and scores of people injured.  Battles between protesters and security forces were ongoing \nthroughout the capital.  Meanwhile, riots were breaking out in other parts of the country, such as the northern city of \nThessaloniki, but also spreading to islands such as Corfu and Crete.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister  Papademos condemned the breakdown of social order  saying, \"Vandalism, violence \nand destruction have no place in a democratic country and won't be tolerated.\"\n\nJust past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform \npackage needed to secure rescue funds.  The economic reform and austerity bill passed overwhelmingly with 199 \nvotes in its favor, 74 votes against it, and 27 abstentions.  After the vote, Greece's coalition government expelled 43 \nmembers of parliament from its ranks for voting against the cuts.  Members of parliament also voted affirmatively to \ngive Prime Minister  Papademos' interim government authority to sign a new loan agreement with foreign lenders,  \nand to forge debt write off deal with private banks.\n\n\n\nBut outside the parliament in Syntagma Square -- the center of Athens -- tear gas filled the air as security forces \ntried to disperse angry crowds. In the streets of Athens, the city was literally ablaze as rioters and protesters set fire \nto buildings to register their outrage.\n\nAmong the facilities set on fire were cafes, theaters, banks, and historic buildings -- all necessary interests in a \ncountry reliant on tourism for revenue.  The irony seemed lost of demonstrators who were intent only on expressing \ntheir rage at the situation.  Left unstated, however, was the fact that Greece has had a long history of tax evasion -- \na phenomenon that led to the fact that there has been insufficient means to fund the very social welfare programs \nand benefits that the citizenry wants to preserve.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Costis Hatzidakis, a conservative member of parliament, called on his fellow \nlegislators to stand strong in favor of the austerity and reform package saying, \"We are facing destruction. Our \ncountry, our home, has become ripe for burning, the center of Athens is in flames. We cannot allow populism to \nburn our country down.\"\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2012, the Greek cabinet approved the final austerity package, which aimed to secure further \ninternational financing. Greek  Prime Minister Lucas Papademos -- speaking during the extraordinary meeting of the \ncabinet -- expressed confidence for a positive outcome.  As before, Greek activists took to the streets and rallies in \nfront of parliament and at Syntagma Square to register their opposition to the austerity and reform agenda, which \nthey argued has placed an undue burden on the shoulders of the poor and the working class of the country.\n\nThe Rescue Deal\n\nA meeting of the finance ministers of the euro zone took place on Feb. 20, 2012; participants there would decide \nwhether or not to approve the funding needed for Greece to avoid bankruptcy.  Reports were emerging that some \neuro zone finance ministers needed further assurances  of Greece's commitment to actually implementing all \nnecessary measures. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro group, called for further oversight \nregarding Greece's implementation of its austerity plans. That spirit of skepticism left the likely outcome of the \nmeeting very much in doubt.\n\nLate into the night, euro zone finance ministers were holding talks aimed at securing rescue funds for Greece.  \nEarly on Feb. 21, 2012, Reuters reported that an agreement had been forged on a 130 billion euro rescue package, \nand a 121 percent debt to GDP ratio; the deal also included strict conditions and aimed to avert imminent Greek \nbankruptcy.  Still, many economists argued that the deal might serve only to delay default, with recovery of the \nGreek economy expected to take up to a decade to accomplish.\n\nAccording to Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, the deal meant that his country would avoid a nightmare \nscenario.  He also cast the agreement as the most important in Greece's post-war history.  Venizelos additionally  \nurged the rest of cabinet to find ways to implement the measures mandated by international lenders, such as  \nfurther massive cuts and increased monitoring  by the euro zone.\n\nSince Greece has already been subject to harsh austerity measures due to the previous bailout or rescue package, \nmany in the citizenry were in no mood for further hardship.  Not surprisingly, unions were calling for more strikes \nand other such protest actions.\n\nOn Feb. 29, 2012, the Greek parliament passed  a fresh package of spending cuts  intended to secure the release \nof the aforementioned rescue funds, and avoid  bankruptcy. The  measures -- valued at 3.2 billion euros -- were \npart of the action plan  required by international creditors and suggested by the Greek finance minister, in order to \nsecure the release of the vital rescue package.\n\nGiven the reality of further austerity measures, protesters again took to the streets.  The latest round of mass action \nwas organized by Greek labor unions demanding  \"employment and social justice.\"  Included in the demonstrations \nand strikes  were doctors and nurses from public hospitals protesting the cutbacks on health care and prescribed \n\n\n\nmedicines to slash deficits. They argued that these moves would create risks for patients and consign medical \npersonnel to poverty.  They were joined by pharmacists protesting an extension on the working hours, as well as \npublic servants outraged over supplementary spending cuts. Meanwhile, the umbrella trade union of civil servants \nand private sector employees closed ranks  to protest the reduction of the minimum wage in the private sector, \nwhich the Greek government said would spur competitiveness and growth. Not to be left out, lawyers, civil \nengineers, and other professionals participated in a protest facing the Greek Finance Ministry.\n\nAs the first week of March 2012 came to a close, Greek authorities said they were close to forging a debt swap deal \nwith  bondholders.  Then, on March 12, 2012, Greece said it had forged  a debt swap deal with  bondholders to \navert default. Under the Private Sector Involvement (PSI) scheme sanctioned by the European Union and  the \nInternational Monetary Fund lenders, old bonds would be exchanged for new ones with lower value, lower interest \nrates, and extended maturities. The majority of private investors holding bonds gave their assent to the plan. That \nbeing said, the collective action clauses (CACs) activated by the Greek government to force losses on reluctant \nbondholders resulted in further downgrades of Greece's credit ratings by international agencies, which now \ncategorized Greece as being in a state of \"restricted default.\"\n\nFurther Recent Developments:\n\nOn April 5, 2012, a man committed suicide outside the Greek parliament.  The 77-year old retired chemist shot \nhimself to death to protest the government's austerity measures, which included cutting his pension.  According to \nGreek media, a suicide note was found in which the man accused the government of reducing his pension to \nnothing.  As reported by the Athens News, the suicide note read as follows: \"The government has annihilated all \ntraces for my survival, which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid for 35 years with no help from \nthe state. And since my advanced age does not allow me a way of dynamically reacting... I see no other solution \nthan this dignified end to my life, so I don't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance.\"\n\nFlowers were laid in remembrance of the man at the spot where he died, along with notes reading messages such \nas \"Enough is enough\" and \"Who will be next?\"  Meanwhile, enraged Greek protesters took to the streets of the \nGreek capital city of Athens to register their horror.  Violence erupted as the protesters hurled rocks and petrol \nbombs at the riot police, who used tear gas to disperse the angry crowds.\n\nWith the capital city in a state of uproar, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos issued a statement.  He said, \"In these \ndifficult hours for our society we must all -- the state and the citizens -- support the people among us who are \ndesperate.\" Evangelos Venizelos, of the socialist Pasok party that holds a majority in the coalition government, \ncalled on colleagues to refrain from \"political commentary\" and \"show solidarity and togetherness.\" Antonis \nSamaras, the head of the conservative New Democracy party, said politicians had to do more to \"help Greeks \nescape from despair.\"\n\nAccording to a report in Reuters, suicides have increased by 18 percent in Greece in 2010 from the previous year; \nin Athens alone, the rate of suicide rose 25 percent over 2011 rates.\n\nPrimer on 2012 Elections in Greece:\n\nSummary --\n\nElections were held in Greece on May 6, 2012.  That vote yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a \nmajority or able to form a viable government coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. \nAccordingly, a new \"re-run\" election was set for June 17, 2012. At stake in the parliamentary elections of Greece \nwould be the 300 seats of the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" (Parliament).\n\nBackground --\n\nAn ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and \nthe International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief \n\n\n\npackage and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release \nof rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions  -- the \nimplementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package.\n\nTo that end, in late October 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a \nnational referendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan.  However, with the angry and outraged Greek citizenry \nunlikely to ratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea.  Prime Minister Papandreou \nsoon resigned from office, as demanded by the opposition, making way for the formation of a national unity \ngovernment.\n\nAt the start of November 2011, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government had \nbeen formed.  Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias  would prevail on all parties to join the \nnew government.\n\nUltimately, it was former Deputy President of the European Central Bank Lukas Papademos who was tapped  to be \nthe interim leader of the new transitional  Greek administration.  With academic gravitas as an economist who has \nwritten extensively about the debt crisis as well as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial \nmarkets, monetary analysis and policy, economic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the \nEuropean Union,  Papademos was regarded as a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" \ngovernment.  Papademos' background at the helm of the European Central Bank augured the possibility of a \ncooperative relationship with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.\n\nIt was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and \nuncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone. As noted above, the new government would be tasked with \nimplementing the full slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would also have to \nfacilitate the release of the next installment of  European Union/International Monetary Fund loan funds,  including \nthe passage of legislation associated with the rescue package.  Before that could take place, Greece would have to \nhave its economic affairs in order since the country would run out of money by December 2011, thus risking default. \nAll eyes were on the spring of 2012 for a likely election timetable.\n\nPre-election developments (ahead of the May 2012 vote) --\n\nOn March 19, 2012, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos resigned from his cabinet post to take over the \nleadership of the ruling Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)  in its campaign for the general \nelections to be held in late April or early May 2012. Outgoing PASOK President George Papandreou expressed \nhope for a new beginning, saying: \"This is a new start for both of us ... We will continue to work together for the \nsake of the country.\"\n\nIt should be noted that  the major parties participating in the ruling coalition posted dismal approval ratings ahead of \nthe elections, but all expectations were that the new government would also involve a coalition of various parties.\n\nAs March 2012 came to a close, polling data from the Kathimerini newspaper showed the conservative New \nDemocracy party, which supports the outgoing technocratic government as well as its harsh austerity and structural \nreform measures, in the lead with 22.5 percent. The socialist PASOK, which was also in the outgoing coalition,  \nfollowed in second place with 15.5 percent of the vote. The communists and the leftist SYRIZA were posting about \n12 percent of support respectively, while the newly-formed Democratic Left, Independent Greeks, the Greek \nEcologist Greens, and the far-right neo-Nazi \"Golden Dawn\" were all trailing behind, but still expected to gain \nparliamentary representation.\n\nTogether, the two main parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- could \ncollectively secure enough votes to meet the  38 percent threshold required to obtain a parliamentary majority, thus \nratifying their coalition for a new term in office.  Still, a larger contingent of voters -- 48 percent -- would prefer a left-\nwing coalition that would oppose the austerity and structural reform  agenda.\n\n\n\nNote that in April 2012,  Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced that elections would be held on May 6, 2012, \nand called on President Karolos Papoulias to dissolve parliament. With his technocratic government set to end, \nPrime Minister Papademos said he believed his  government  left behind \"an important legacy.\"  He also urged \ncabinet  ministers and political parties to prevail in their efforts to overcome the debt crisis, and cautioned that any \nfuture administration would  \"have to make decisions promptly in order to complete the efforts to revive our \neconomy.\"\n\nGreece's two main parties --  the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- were expected to \ncapture the lion's share of the vote.  The main question was whether the two parties -- which support the reform \nagenda -- could garner the  38 percent threshold necessary to secure a majority in the 300-member parliamentary \nchamber.  There was also some indication that left-wing and right-wing parties, which have been opposed to the  \nunpopular austerity measures associated with the bailout funds, could make significant gains. The leftist SYRIZA \ncoalition,  the Democratic Left, the Greek Communist Party,  the new Rightist Independent Greeks, and the far-right \nGolden Dawn could well post historic performances at the polls, given the Greek public's outrage over the austerity \nprograms being put into place.\n\nOf course, electoral success for anti-austerity parties could  threaten the rescue funding structure currently in place, \nrisk disorderly default for Greece, and thus imperil the entire euro zone.\n\nIn the week ahead of the vote, PASOK  leader Evangelos Venizelos promised to lead the country out of its debt \ncrisis by 2015 if the party was elected in the upcoming elections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the conservative \nNew Democracy (ND), made the same election promise.  Polling data at the close of April 2012 gave Samaras and \nthe ND the edge, although neither party was likely to have enough seats to command a parliamentary majority. \nAccordingly, a new coalition was likely in the offing.\n\nResults of the May 2012 election --\n\nAs the votes were being counted, it was clear that the two main governing parties of Greece were suffering \nsignificant losses. Samaras' conservative New Democracy party was leading the country's general elections by a \nnarrow margin with 19 percent of vote share.  Center-left PASOK had slipped to third place with just over 13 \npercent.  Left-wing SYRIZA was boosted to second place with close to 17 percent. The right-wing Independent \nGreeks secured ten percent while the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn managed to garner seven percent and could be \npositioned to enter parliament for the first time.\n\nThe result suggested that the coalition  -- composed of New Democracy and PASOK, which formed the outgoing \npro-austerity and reform government -- would not command a majority in parliament.  The result also showed the \nascendancy of SYRIZA , which has argued vociferously against austerity  and reform.  Indeed, this result for \nSYRIZA and even Golden Dawn was illustrative of the impassioned anger by the Greek people against the harsh \nmeasures, which  were imposed in conjunction with the international rescue packages, in order to prevent Greece \nfrom defaulting on its debt.\n\nGovernment Formation --\n\nHaving won the plurality of the vote share, Samaras and New Democracy would have the first opportunity to try to \nform a  government. To that end, Samaras said he would form a national salvation government, aimed at keeping \nGreece in the euro zone.  He also said he would try to  \"amend\" Greece's  bailout agreement with the European \nUnion and the International Monetary Fund in order to increase economic growth. But if Samaras failed to be able \nto form a government after a three-day period, then SYRIZA\n\nwould have three days to form a coalition government. To that end, SYRIZA leader, Alexis Tsipras, said he wanted \nto form a left-wing coalition that would set aside arrangements related to the Greek bailout scheme. Tspiras said the \nvote made clear that the Greek party had rejected the path of rescue plans and reform.  He explained, \"The parties \nthat signed the memorandum (with the EU and the IMF) are now a minority. The public verdict has de-legitimized \n\n\n\nthem.\"  PASOK would have its own chance to form a government if Syria's effort ended in failure after three days.  \nFor his part, Venizelos called for a broad coalition or unity government including  pro-European parties.\n\nThe government formation process promised to be difficult since New Democracy and PASOK would likely search \nfor pro-euro zone partners, and those options were limited.  Meanwhile, the likes of SYRIZA sought to step away \nfrom the euro zone-endorsed rescue package and reforms -- stances that both New Democracy and PASOK do not \nsupport.  Thus, the path toward a viable new coalition was limited. Should all of the three successive efforts toward \ngovernment formation fail, then Greeks would have to return to the polls in another election.  In this way, the scene \nin Greece after the May 6, 2012, was one of turmoil and turbulence.  Indeed, without a stable government willing to \nadhere to the arrangement forged with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, Greece would \nnot have access to rescue funds.  This would return Greece to its prevailing risk of defaulting and possibly exiting \nthe euro zone.\n\nNote that on May 7, 2012, after one day of serious government formation negotiations, Samaras, the leader of the \nconservative New Democracy Party, said he was not able to forge a workable coalition and that he returned the \ngovernment formation mandate to President Karolos Papoulias. \"We did everything we could,\" said Samaras. \"It \nwas impossible. I handed back the mandate.\"  Although parties actually have three days to try to form a \ngovernment, Samaras said he did not want to waste any time, given the dire situation for Greece.\n\nThe leftist bloc, SYRIZA ,  would now be charged with the mandate of trying to form a ruling coalition.  Speaking of \nhis task, SYRIZA leader Tsipras said:\n\n\"We will exhaust all possibilities to reach an understanding, primarily with the forces of the left.\" But Tsipras then \nfollowed in the footsteps of New Democracy  and failed to form a ruling coalition. For the SYRIZA leader, it was \nimperative that his party not compromise its anti-austerity stance. \"The bailout austerity has already been \ndenounced by the Greek people with its vote, and no government has the right to enforce it,\" Tsipras said.\n\nThe charge for forging a workable coalition then fell on the Socialist leader, Venizelos. That effort likewise resulted \nin a similar manner.  PASOK was able to close ranks with New Democracy but unable to find a third coalition \npartner.  Accordingly,  Venizelos formally returned the mandate to the president.\n\nSuch an end had been highly anticipated as the combination of seats for certain parties with corresponding \nideologies simply did not add up to a workable result.\n\nStated in plain terms, SYRIZA had firmly rejected the terms of the EU-IMF bailout plan, which required the \nimplementation of harsh austerity measures and structural reforms in return for loan funding. Without the \nparticipation of SYRIZA , however, it was unlikely any coalition could be forged. Meanwhile, as explained here, \nSYRIZA was itself unable to form a workable alliance without one of the two pro-bailout parties -- New Democracy \nand PASOK.  The result was a political impasse.\n\nPresident Karolos Papoulias convened emergency meetings on May 13, 2012, with an eye on forming some sort of \nunity government, of a technocratic variety.  The president invited the three largest parties -- center-right New \nDemocracy,  socialist PASOK, and the far-left bloc SYRIZA -- for talks. That move was not welcomed by the Greek \npopulace who did not look kindly on the outgoing  technocratic government of Papademos; they viewed it as not \ndemocratically-elected  and responsible for ushering in the dark age of structural economic reform.  Ultimately,  with \nthe parties divided  over the key issue of austerity, the last-ditch effort by the president to form a unity technocratic \ngovernment ended in failure.  Indeed, SYRIZA reiterated its uncompromising stance that it would not join any ruling \ncoalition that instituted further cuts or harsh measures.\n\nFuture Course --\n\nAs of mid-May 2012, with efforts at either forming a governing coalition or a new technocratic government ending \nwithout resolution, Greek voters would be returning to the polls, possibly as soon as June 2012. There were strong \n\n\n\nindications that a new vote could end with SYRIZA winning a plurality of the vote share, possible paving the way for \na government willing to walk away from the aforementioned EU-IMF bailout plan.\n\nOf course, such a course would augur default, act as a catalyst for the possible exit of Greece from the euro zone, \nand facilitate a return to the drachma.  The consequences for Greece -- and Europe at large -- could be dire, as \npredicted by Germany. The head of Germany's central bank, Jens Weidmann, offered this warning: \"For Greece the \nconsequences would be much more grave than for the rest of the euro zone.\" He continued, \"If Athens does not \nstand by its word, then that's a democratic decision. The  result is that there is no more basis for further financial \naid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, credits ratings agencies were predicting that Greece's exit from the euro zone would affect all the \nremaining euro zone countries.  Specifically, the  Fitch ratings agency warned that if Greece abandoned the euro, \nnot only would Greece would be deleteriously affected, but all the sovereign ratings of all the 16 remaining euro \nzone countries would be placed on negative watch in anticipation of a downgrade.\n\nRatings aside, the exit of Greece from the euro zone would also be a blow to the entire framework of Europe's \nmonetary union. Although Jean-Claude Juncker -- the prime minister of Luxembourg and the head of the euro zone \n--  dismissed the notion of Greece's withdrawal from the bloc as  \"nonsense,\"  the fact that such a prospect was \nnow being openly debated in Europe illuminated the tumultuous landscape.\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, fear and doubt about the economic landscape in Greece led to the \nwithdrawal of nearly $900 million from local banks by Greek depositors on May 14, 2012, alone.  The withdrawal of \nfunds was confirmed by President  Papoulias who said the withdrawals, in conjunction with \"buy orders\" received by \nGreek banks for German bonds, placed  Greece's lenders in a difficult position and that the banks were  \"very weak \nright now.\"  $900 million in one day was clearly a concerning event since outflows in the last two years have \namounted to between one and two billion on a monthly basis.\n\nA \"re-run\" election in June 2012 --\n\nA caretaker government was formed on May 16, 2012, with elections set to be held in mid-June 2012. Panayiotis \nPikramenos, the head of one of Greece's high courts, was  named to head Greece's caretaker government ahead \nof the next elections to be held on June 17, 2012.\n\nThere were serious anxieties that the second elections in the span of a month would, likewise, yield an inconclusive \nresult.  Indeed, another divided parliament would do little to resolve the state of impasse in the country as it wrestles \nwith its debt crisis.  There was an additional dimension to these anxieties from among some national and \ninternational factions that leftist parties could eke control of parliament.  Such an end would serve a decisive death \nknell to the austerity and reform agenda required by the EU and IMF rescue funding deal, and could well spell \ncatastrophic default for Greece.\n\nPolling data in mid-May 2012 showed that the conservative pro-reform agenda New Democracy  was on track to \nwin the most votes.  PASOK (also pro-reform despite its Socialist leanings) was expected to post another third-\nplace finish after SYRIZA.  This time, though, the two parties in favor of the rescue and reform agenda were \nexpected to have enough seats to form a government, effectively avoiding the impasse of the previous elections.  \nThis polling result was a shift from polling data the previous week that showed SYRIZA poised to win the elections.  \nIt would seem that after having vented their anger against the establishment parties in the May 2012 elections, \nvoters were slowly coming to the realization that the stakes were high.\n\nMeanwhile, news emerged that  New Democracy would forge an agreement with the other conservative party, the \nDemocratic Alliance, to come together for the June 17, 2012, polls and foreclose vote splitting.  This agreement \nbetween New Democracy and Democratic Alliance would open the door for a wide alliance of pro-European, pro-\nreform agenda, parties to form a government.\n\nSYRIZA party leader Tsipras insisted that the terms of the bailout would have to be replaced, and that his party was \nconfident that new terms could be negotiated with international lenders.  Explaining his approach as follows: \"We \n\n\n\nwill not go to the table of dialogue aggressively,\"  Tsipras was quite sure that SYRIZA could convince international \nlenders  that austerity in return of the two rescue packages would be catastrophic for Greece's economy, and \ntherefore, they would be amenable to the notion of a new deal that would yet furnish necessary rescue funds.  \nTsipras  was undaunted by the prospect of lenders  halting the disbursement of further loans to Greece, and \ndismissed the notion  that a chaotic default on the part of Greece would end its that country's exit from the euro \nzone.  In regards to SYRIZA's participation in a future Greek government, Tsipras expected to lead that \ngovernment, which he said would consist of a \"left-wing coalition\" and would include the Greek Communists and the \nDemocratic Left.\n\nThe Socialists (PASOK) and the Democratic Left were offering similar political agendas, with an eye on the \nnecessary formation of a  government of \"shared national responsibility\" after the June 2012 general elections.  \nBoth parties appeared to concur that Greece could not be governed by slim majorities during its time of need. As \nnoted by PASOK leader Venizelos at the start of June 2012, a weak government would not be able to push through \nimportant reform measures  required to solve Greece's debt crisis.  Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis called for \na \"progressive unity government.\"  He threaded the political needle carefully as he argued that while Greece could \nnot afford to go down the path of exclusive austerity, he nonetheless rejected the idea of annulling already-\nestablished rescue deals and risking default.  In this way, Kouvelis was taking quite a different position as \ncompared with SYRIZA leader Tsipras, who has advocated the path of annulment.\n\nIt should be noted that SYRIZA leader Tsipras was winning the rhetorical contest and effectively shifting the debate. \nAs noted just above, Tsipras has consistently asserted that should he win the election and lead a future Greek \ngovernment, Greece would walk away from the prevailing international agreements concerning billions of dollars in \nbailout assistance and their associated harsh mandates for  the budget, including the abolition of collective \nbargaining and the reduction of the minimum wage.  He has also said that he would suspend the repayment of \ninternational loans until Greece, which has suffered from a continuing recession, sees economic growth.  Now, \nahead of the repeat elections, even the leaders of the two main reformist and pro-rescue package parties, New \nDemocracy and  Socialist PASOK, were moving a bit away from the singular pro-austerity agenda, and towards the \nnotion that the rescue deals should -- at least -- be renegotiated on less harsh terms.\n\nNote that at the start of June 2012, the  final set of pre-election polls ahead of the repeat elections showed  a tight \nrace between leftist SYRIZA and  the center-right New Democracy party.  Two of three polls showed the two parties \nessentially tied, while the third poll showed SYRIZA holding 32 percent  over New Democracy with 26 percent.  It \nshould be noted that Greece suspends election polling in the two weeks prior to election day, so these results \noffered the final pre-election picture.\n\nAs the first week of June 2012 came to a close, the drama of the political contest in Greece reached new heights \nwhen a member of parliament from the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, Ilias Kasidiaris, was caught on a televised \nbroadcast assaulting a female SYRIZA politician, Rena Dourou, with a glass of water, and then slapping another \nfemale left-wing politician, Liana Kanelli of the Communist Party. Although an arrest warrant was issued for  \nKasidiaris, the Golden Dawn member of parliament placed the blame for the incident on the two female politicians, \nsaying that they provoked him by bringing up his alleged involvement in a 2007 armed robbery case. He also \npromised to sue them.  The wider Greek public appeared shocked by the display and took to the streets on June 8, \n2012, in massive protests against Golden Dawn and neo-Nazis.  The rallies were organized by left-wing and anti-\nracism groups in Athens and were attended by thousands of people.\n\nJune Elections\n\nOn June 17, 2012, Greeks returned to the polls to cast their ballots in the second general elections in a month in a \nrenewed attempt to form a government.  Exit polls indicated the elections would be a close contest but with the \ncenter-right New Democracy in a narrow lead ahead of the leftist SYRIZA, and with the socialist PASOK in third \nplace.  With the lion's share of the ballots counted, the Greek Interior Ministry said that New Democracy secured \nclose to 30 percent and was on track to carry as many as 130 seats in the 300-seat parliament; SYRIZA garnered \n26.7 percent and  was likely to control between 71 and seats;  PASOK acquired 12.5 percent and was estimated to \n\n\n\nwin about 33 seats. Several smaller anti-bailout parties were expected to win between 13 and 21 seats; these \nparties included the Independent Greeks, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, the Democratic Left, and the Communists.\n\nAccordingly, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, reportedly telephoned the New Democracy leader, Samaras, to concede the \nelections and offer congratulations. Given these results, Samaras, at the helm of his New Democracy Party, was \nexpected to commence coalition talks on June 18, 2012.  Samaras urged all the major political parties to close \nranks and form a  national salvation government. Since his financial plan  for the country going forward would entail \nspending cuts and the implementation of  other reform measures as required by international creditors he would \nhave to find coalition partners with compatible goals.  Such goals clearly ran counter to the position of SYRIZA, \nwhich has made clear that it would stand against austerity measures demanded as part of the existing rescue deal.  \nA future coalition led by New Democracy, therefore, was unlikely to include SYRIZA.  More likely was the possibility \nthat New Democracy, boosted by an additional 50 parliamentary seats as the winning party, would be able to form a \nmajority coalition with PASOK.\n\nFor Samaras, the election result was a ratification of Greece's continued  presence in the euro zone.  To this end, \nhe said, \"The Greek people voted today to stay on the European course and remain in the euro zone.\"  Samaras \npromised that his country would \"honor its obligations.\"  He also said, \"There will be no more adventures. Greece's \nplace in Europe will not be put in doubt.  Samaras continued by noting that the flirtation with default, an exit from the \neuro bloc, and a return to the drachma -- a possible outcome if SYRIZA had won the election -- was now over.\n\nTo be sure, the election result was likely to calm some of the global fears about a SYRIZA victory and a \nconcomitant Greek exit from the euro zone.  It was likely to quell speculation for the immediate future about debt \ndefault contagion spreading through the European bloc and adding to the sense of turmoil brewing at the \ninternational level.  In Greece, however, the public's sense of discontent over the austerity conditions would \npresumably continue, along with anxieties about the future of the country.  In a bid to address these anxieties, \nSamaras promised light at the end of the proverbial dark tunnel, saying, \"The sacrifices of the Greek people will \nbring the country back to prosperity.\"\n\nNew Government for Greece\n\nAs attention turned towards the government formation process, the question arose as to whether or not a national \nsalvation government -- composed of as many parties as possible -- would be possible.  But such an end was not to \nhappen as SYRIZA made it clear that it would neither join such a government.  Indeed, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, \nrejected a proposal from Samaras and New Democracy to join a coalition government.  For his part, Tsipras \nindicated that his party's role was to operate as the official opposition saying, \"The main opposition party's role is to \nbe critical and responsible. We will do just that.\"\n\nBy June 20, 2012, three parties were able to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Greek government.  As \nthe winner of the June 17, 2012 elections, the main coalition partner would be center-right New Democracy, while \nthe Socialists, PASOK, as well as Democratic Left, would participate in the new government.  Speaking of the need \nto establish a stable Greek administration as soon as possible, and to deal with the political and economic \nchallenges facing the country,  Evangelos Venizelos of PASOK said: \"Greece has a government ... that is the \nmessage that we need to send abroad.\"\n\nNote that on that day -- June 20, 2012 -- Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, was to be sworn in \nas Greece's new prime minister at a brief ceremony at the presidential palace in Athens, presided over by the \narchbishop of Greece. After being sworn in as the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister Samaras said \nthat he  would demand \"hard work\" from the new government\" and that he intended to \"give hope\" to the Greek \npeople.\n\nOf course, for the Greek people, they were looking for relief from the harsh terms of the rescue package from the \nEuropean Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  To that end, the new government would seek to \nrenegotiate the bail out agreement.  As noted by Fotis Kouvelis, the leader of the\n\n\n\nDemocratic Left, he wanted to see the country \"released\"  from the \"painful terms\" of the bail out deal.  One \nprovision sought by the new coalition government was a change in the schedule for austerity cuts to be spread over \nfour years rather than two years, as currently outlined.\n\nIn truth, however, there was probably limited room for the new Greek government to negotiate a more pleasing \nagreement.  While leaders in Europe were undoubtedly relieved that the political crisis in Greece had abated and \nthere was a reasonably coalition government with which to talk, they were unlikely to offer much flexibility.  \nGermany was certainly making it clear that few  concessions were in the offing.  As stated by German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel, \"Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made. We cannot compromise on the \nreform steps we agreed.\"\n\nUpdate (2012/2013):\n\nIn the fall of 2012, trade unions launched a general strike to register opposition and outrage against the  \ngovernment's stringent austerity measures.\n\nThe strike attracted the participation of anarchists who gathered\n\noutside the  parliament, thus compelling security forces to use tear gas to disperse the crowds. \n\nMeanwhile,  the Greek government was crafting the budget for 2013, which was intended to confront the reality that \nthe Greek economy would be subject to further economic  contraction as well as a continuing heavy debt burden.\n\nRecently-elected Prime Minister Samaras warned the country that his government's coffers would be empty by the \nend of November 2012 without the infusion of funds -- presumably via international aid.\n\nWith an eye on securing further installments of rescue loans from the European Union and the International \nMonetary Fund, the Greek government passed a  13.5bn-euro austerity plan.  The budget provisions  included \nincreases to taxes along with cuts to  pensions.  Not surprisingly, union organizations reacted with ire to these \nmeasures.\n\nNevertheless, the budget plan achieved its objective as the  European Union and the International Monetary Fund \nagreed to release its latest installment of rescue loans by the end of 2012.\n\nThe move also achieved the end of preventing Greece from leaving the euro zone.\n\nNote that as of January 2013, Greece's unemployment rate had increased to 26.8% -- the highest figure recorded in \nthe European Union (EU).  Indeed, Greece had the dubious distinction of being the country  with the highest \nunemployment rate in Europe.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the  Democratic Left Party -- a participant in the ruling coalition  in Greece -- said it was \nwithdrawing from the government amidst disagreements over the shutdown of the state broadcasting service, ERT.  \nAt issue was accusation  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' accusation that ERT suffered from a lack of \ntransparency.  Accordingly, ERT transmissions were shut down on June 11, 2013.  Efforts to forge an agreement \nleading to the resumption of broadcasts ended in failure. For its part, Democratic Left criticized the prime minister's \nhandling of the situation, and more importantly, the fact that he did not consult with his coalition partners before \nmaking the decision.\n\nIt should be noted that the ruling coalition came to power after the last elections in mid-2012 and was composed of \nthe center-right New Democracy, the Socialists (PASOK), as well as Democratic Left. The coalition government \n\n\n\nwas intended to be a representative and unifying force for Greece, which has been embroiled in a debt crisis in \nrecent years. The loss of any party effectively weakened the coalition government in a country beset by political \ninstability and eager for unity as the government makes difficult decisions aimed at addressing Greece's crushing \ndebt crisis.\n\nOn July 17, 2013, protesters in Greece took to the streets of Athens to rally against a public sector reform bill that \nwould lead to massive job cuts. Under the provisions of the legislation, as many as 4,000 government employees, \nincluding teachers, would lose their jobs in 2013.  By the end of the year, another 25,000 government employees \nwould be placed in \"mobility pool\" by the end of the year. Those employees in the mobility pool would garner only \n75 percent of their salaries for an eight-month period in which they would be expected to seek  redeployment; at the \nend of that period, if they were unable to secure transfers to other government departments, their jobs would be \ndeclared redundant and they would thus be unemployed.  In a country with an unemployment rate of 27 percent, \nthe path of further joblessness was not welcomed by the people.\n\nRegardless of the unpopularity of the bill -- especially among public sector employees -- it was regarded by Greek \npoliticians as a necessary measure intended to secure a fresh tranche of bailout funding.  As such, the bill was \npassed with 153 affirmative votes to 140 negative votes in the Greek parliament, with conservative  Greek Prime \nMinister Antonis Samaras saying that there was no option but to move forward with the painful legislation, in the \ninterests of keeping Greece financially afloat.  Previous austerity measures included reductions of public sector \nsalaries and pension cuts.  Yet despite this constellation of austerity measures, the fact of the matter was that \nGreece's debt has continued to be alarmingly high.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nAn ongoing GDP-debt crisis has plagued Greece in recent years. Greece's burdensome debt resulted in the need \nfor a rescue plan from the European Union, the European Central Bank,  and the International Monetary Fund, \nwith an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief (or \"bailout\")  package, the European \nUnion, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have not been quick to agree to the \nrelease of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions  -- the \nimplementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package. But those very austerity \nmeasures -- while deemed vital by international lenders in order to release bailout funds to Greece -- have been \nrejected and condemned by the Greek public.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nPolitical turmoil  in Greece involves relations with far-right elements and threat of extremism\n\nIn January 2014, two members of parliament from the  neo-fascist  Golden Dawn party  were arrested and jailed \npending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization.  The two individuals placed under arrest --  \nPanagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them and emphasized the legitimacy of \nhis party's political\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Greek prosecutors have long argued that they possess evidence connecting \nGolden Dawn to  several acts of violence, including the murder of a Greek rapper in 2013.  To that end, they have \nbeen carrying out a crackdown against the new-Nazi far-right group. The arrests and detainment of Iliopoulos  and \nGermenis  were the latest manifestations of that crackdown.\n\nGoing back to September 2013, several far-right members of the Greek parliament  were arrested as part of a \ngovernment crackdown on extremism.  Among those taken into custody at the time was Nikos Mihallkiakos, the  \nleader of the neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn.  The offices of Golden Dawn were raided, while Mihallkiakos was \narrested and charged with forming a criminal organization.  Soon thereafter, the  party's deputy leader, Christos \nPappas, was also taken into custody.  Several other members of parliament also faced the same fate.\n\n\n\nThe arrests of  Mihallkiakos, Papas, and other Golden Dawn members occurred only weeks after a man claiming to \nbe a supporter of Golden Dawn allegedly murdered a Greek rapper, known as \"Killah P,\" whose music protested \nthe rise of fascism in Greece.  \n\nIn another case in September 2013, 50 Golden Dawn members  wielding crowbars violently attacking members of \nthe Communist Party as they distributed posters in a working-class district of Athens. That  incident left nine people \nhospitalized with grave injuries.  The  Communist Party of Greece released a statement in regard to the attack that \nread as follows: \"The way in which they [the attackers] acted and the weapons employed \u2026 are evidence of the \nmurderous nature of the attack.  Among the Golden Dawners, some of whom had covered their faces or wore \nhelmets or [party] shirts, were their leaders, well-known fascists and thugs.\" \n\nMuslims and Jews were not exempt from the apparent campaign of extremism and hatred.  On the anniversary of \nthe Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, Golden Dawn posted an anti-Semetic message on its website in which it claimed \n\"world Zionism\" was the \"architect of global terrorism.\"  Meanwhile, the  Muslim Association of Greece was gifted \nwith a letter in which members were told they would be \"slaughtered like chickens\" unless they left Greece.\n\nThe murder of Killah D, the violent attacks on the Communists, and the hate-filled diatribes against Muslims and \nJews  sparked mass protests across Greece and  may have contributed to the government's decision to take \naction.\n\nFor its part, the government of Greece has said that the arrests of the Golden Dawn members of parliament were \npart of its decision to push back against extremism --  with particular attention to the rise of neo-Nazism in Greece.  \nThe government also said that it had commenced an investigation into whether or not whether extremists \nassociated with Golden Dawn had infiltrated the country's police and military forces.\n\nPrime Minister made it clear that Golden Dawn would not be allowed to \"undermine\" democracy and he \nemphasized the government's stance that the neo-fascist party should  be treated as a \"criminal organization.\"  In \nresponse, Golden Dawn railed against the arrests of its leaders, and urged supporters to back its \"just struggle \nagainst the corrupt system.\"\n\nOn Nov. 1, 2013, a shooting outside the office of the neo-Nazi and far-right Golden Dawn political party  in Greek \ncapital city of Athens left two party members dead and a third individual wounded.\n\nAccording to accounts from Golden Dawn members of Parliament as reported by the Athens-Macedonian News \nAgency, two  assailants on a motorcycle approached the party's office in the  northern suburb of Neo Iraklio and \nopened fire with a rifle  before escaping the scene.  The party official claimed that the assailants \"literally emptied \ntheir guns\" on the victims, ensuring their deaths.  In their post-crime investigation, police were able to recover the  \nmotorcycle believed  to have been stolen and used in the attack. \n\nWhile no Greek official was willing to suggest that the killings were political, it was certainly true that in 2013, politics \nin Greece have been dominated by acrimonious relations between the government and Golden Dawn.\n\nIn November 2013, in the aftermath of the attack on the Golden Dawn office and the deaths of two party members, \nit was possible that certain factions of Greek society were carrying out revenge attacks against the neo-fascist \nparty.  The Greek government was making it clear that such actions were not welcomed and would only lead the \ncountry into the realm of lawlessness. Nikos Dendias, the Greek cabinet minister responsibility for domestic security \nand order, said that the government would \"not allow the country to become an arena for scores to be settled, for \nwhatever reason.\"  Dendias  was clearly  referencing  recent events involving Golden Dawn.\n\n\n\nIn the second week of January 2014, two members of parliament from the  neo-fascist  Golden Dawn party  were \narrested and jailed pending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization.  The two individuals placed \nunder arrest --  Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them.  For his part,  \nIliopoulos insisted that they were innocent and emphasized the legitimacy of his party's political cause.  In front of \nthe media and amidst far-right supporters, he declared: \"Golden Dawn is a legitimate political party taking on a \nsincere political struggle. We will not buckle. Golden Dawn will be victorious - Greece will be victorious.\" \n\nIt should be noted that Golden Dawn has won representation in parliament, with 18 members holding seats in the \nlegislative chamber.  Indeed, the party has enough support, irrespective of its neo-fascist tendencies, to claim being \nthe third most popular party in Greece.  While Golden Dawn itself denied being a neo-Nazi organization, its \nmembers tend to have pro-Hitler orientations, with Golden Dawn members notorious for participating in Nazi-style \nsalutes,  and the group's emblem is reminiscent of the Nazi swastika.\n\nHuman rights groups have warned that  Golden Dawn has a record of terrorizing immigrants and political \nopponents, while Greek police have allowed them to do so with impunity.  In fact, as indicated by the \naforementioned investigation, there were suggestions that extremist members of the Golden Dawn had infiltrated \nthe security forces.  Those suggestions were somewhat backed by news reports in Greece detailing the suspension \nof several police officers who were believed to be associates of Golden Dawn, as well as the arrest of a police \nofficer who was  working as a bodyguard for Golden Dawn itself.\n\nPresidential Election of 2014\n\nA presidential election was set to be held in Greece in December 2014.  A first round would be held on Dec. 1, \n2014, with a second round on Dec 23, 2014, and a third round on Dec. 29, 2014.  The elections were not expected \nto be held until the spring of 2014; however, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos \nVenizelos  called for the vote to be moved forward.  They were looking for an ally to occupy the office of the \npresidency in Greece, which has been in the throes of a debt crisis in recent years.  At issue was an impending \ndebt bailout package review and plans for a negotiated exit from that regime.\n\nStavros Dimas, the preferred candidate of the ruling New Democracy\u2013PASOK coalition, for the presidency, was \nbeing backed by the prime minister. Dimas' main competition would come from Alexis Tsipras, the candidate of the \nopposition  and anti-bailout party, Syriza.  Indeed, with polling data indicating that Syriza, was more popular with the \npeople of Greece that Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy, it was quite possible that this dynamic would play \nout in the presidential race to Tsipras' benefit and to Dimas' detriment.  A survey by GPO  for MEGA TV showed \nsupport for Syriza at 28 percent  while only 23 percent favored New Democracy. PASOK, which was in coaliton with \nNew Democracy had five percent. Still, it was difficult to offer reliable prognostications since as many as 15 percent \nof Greeks remained undecided.\n\nOf course, the presidential vote would ensue internally within parliament.  But should New Democracy and Prime \nMinister Samaras fail to see their candidate, Dimas, elected as president by the third round of voting, it was quite \nlikely that snap parliamentary elections would be triggered as a result.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2014,  the first round of voting ended inconclusively with no candidate winning enought votes outright \nto secure the presidency. With only 160 members of parliament voting for Dimas, 135 against him, and with only \nfive members of the opposition voting with the ruling party, the outcome of Round One was something of an alarm \nbell for the prime minister ahead of the voting session later in the month.\n\nAhead of those subsequent rounds of voting, Prime Minister Samaras suggested that members of parliament \ndischarge their duties seriously, given the stakes.  He said, \"Conditions are difficult, Greek lawmakers are aware \nthat the country cannot afford adventures.\"  But Alexis Tsipras, the leader and presidential candidate of the \n\n\n\nopposition  and anti-bailout party, Syriza, lauded the poor performance of Dimas in the first round. He noted that  \nthe government's \"strategy of fear\" was not working, and added,  \"Democracy cannot be blackmailed.\"\n\nUltimately, at the end of December 2014 in the third and final round of voting, those aforementioned alarm bells \nturned out to be prescient. The parliament rejected Dimas -- Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's nominee for \npresident.  Indeed, Dimas fell short of the 180 votes in parliament needed to secure the presidency. The defeat of \nDimas effectively triggered snap parliamentary elections, which were now set for Jan. 25, 2015.\n\nNote on Feb. 18, 2015, a new president was elected to a five year term by the parliament.  The winner of the \npresidential election was Prokopios Pavlopoulos.\n\nParliamentary Elections of 2015\n\nParliamentary elections were set to be held in Greece on Jan. 25, 2015.  A presidential election had been held in \nGreece in December 2014 and ended in the government's failure to elect the prime minster's selection to the post of \nhead of state.  This outcome made it clear that the political landscape in Greece was fractious and effectively \ntriggered parliamentary elections to be held at the start of 2015.\n\nSee discussion of the presidential contest above for details.\n\nThe parliamentary contest -\n\nAt stake in the snap parliamentary elections to be held on Jan. 25, 2015, would be the composition of the \nunicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon.\"  That parliamentary body was composed of 300 seats with members elected by a \nsystem of reinforced proportional representation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat \nconstituencies; there is a three percent threshold to obtain seat and members are elected to serve maximum four-\nyear terms.\n\nIn the previous voting exercise of 2012, there were actually two elections. An initial election was  held in Greece on \nMay 6, 2012, but yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a majority or able to form a viable \ngovernment coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. Accordingly, a new \"re-run\" election \nwas set for June 17, 2012.  At the end of that voting exercise, the center-right New Democracy won the most votes \nnarrowly and formed a coalition government with the Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK) as well as \nDemocratic Left.  The 2012 election result was regarded, at the time, as a  ratification of Greece's continued  \npresence in the euro zone, and thus acceptance of the austerity measures needed to guarantee a debt rescue \nprogram.\n\nIn 2015, however, the political and economic climate had shifted.  While the elections would again be dominated by \nthe debt crisis rocking Greece,  the Greek citizenry was now deeply frustrated -- and even angry -- over the \nausterity terms of a massive bail-out package funded by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union \nto rescue the country from default.  With a review of that package on the horizon, and with hopes for an early exit \nfrom the bail-out program looming, the radical leftist Syriza party, which wants to cancel that arrangement, had \ngained support.  Indeed, Syriza was now consistently leading the polls.\n\nShould Syriza's advantage prevail on election day, Greece could well be positioned to make some radical economic \nmoves, which were sure to send shockwaves through the entire euro zone.  For its part, Prime Minister Samaras' \nNew Democracy was campaigning on the fact that under its stewardship, Greece had actually turned an economic \ncorner, and were finally posting some growth and had ended a four-year exile from bond markets.\n\n\n\nThat argument appeared to hold resonance as in the first week of January 2015, Syriza's polling lead was \ndecreasing and New Democracy was seeing a rebound. The Socialists (PASOK) were trailing far behind -- in fact, \nbehind the far-right xenophobic (regarded as neo-Nazi) Golden Dawn, which was in third place, according to \nvarious polling outlets.  The Socialists' prospects were not likely to be boosted by an internal split, which was \ntriggered by former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's announcement of a new breakaway party, called \n\"Movement for Change.\" Since there is a three-point threshold for participation in parliament, if the loyal Socialist \nvoters were split between PASOK and Movement for Change, neither party might end up positioned to participate in \nparliament.\n\nIn the second week of January 2015, the trend discussed above was holding steady.  Syriza had a small but \nconsistent lead of about three percent, according to various polling outlets, over New Democracy.\n\nIn the third week of January 2015, Syriza appeared to be consolidating its advantage with a series of polls showing \nthe anti-bailout party leading Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy party by a margin of at least five percentage \npoints.  Of note was the fact that the newly-formed  centrist party To Potami (River) had narrowly edged out both \nthe Communists and the far-right xenophobic Golden Dawn to be in third place.  Trailing far behind and unlikely to \nmake up enough ground to enter parliament were the Socialists or PASOK (in government with New Democracy) \nand Movement for Change.  Going into the elections, these basic trendlines were holding with Syriza holding a \nsteady and significant lead over the other parties of between five and six percentage points. \n\nAt a final election rally ahead of the vote, Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, declared: \"Light has won over darkness. \nVictory and a majority are within our grasp.\"\n\nIt was to be seen if Syriza's expected victory would come to pass on election day, and if the party would yet gain \nenough seats to command an outright majority in parliament.  Without an outright majority, a governing coalition \nwould have to be formed and it was unclear that Syriza would be the type of entity prepared for compromise.\n\nOn election day on Jan. 25, 2015, Greek voters went to the polls to cast their ballots.  After the polling stations \nclosed, the task of counting the ballots commenced.  At the time of writing, the results showed a big win for the anti-\nbailout party, Syriza.\n\nIn fact, Syriza was holding 36 to 38 percent of the vote share and was on track to win as many as 149 seats -- just \ntwo seats short of an absolute majority.  The outgoing ruling party, New Democracy, was trailing behind in second \nplace with between 26 and 28 percent.  Vying for third place were the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the newly-\nestablished centrist party, Potami (River).  The other parties made up the remainder.\n\nNew Democracy wasted little time in conceding defeat while Syriza said that its victory was \"a return of social \ndignity and social justice.\"  In an interview with Greek media, Syriza spokesperson Panos Skourletis said, \"What's \nclear is we have a historic victory that sends a message that does not only concern the Greek people, but all \nEuropean people.\"\n\nGovernance and government formation:\n\nAt the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout \npackages. With Greece's arrangement with the euro zone set to expire on Feb. 28, 2015, even with continued \nsupport from the International Monetary Fund, Greece would have to be part of a European treaty entity to procure \nremaining rescue loans and  be positioned to receive future support from the  European Central Bank.  Thus, \nGreece would essentially have to retain its position as a euro zone country within the European Union.  However, \n\n\n\nSyriza leader, Tsipras, was showing no urgency on the matter of negotiating an agreement to address these \ncollective concerns, insisting that he had at least half a year to negotiate a deal with Greece's creditors.\n\nGoing back to 2010, Greece was in the midst of a debt-to-GDP crisis and at risk of sovereign default.  As a result of \nthat crisis, and with the contagion effect on other euro zone countries in the European Union at stake,  Greece was \nthe recipient of a rescue package from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  That \npackage was dependent on Greece's agreement to implement austerity measures and other structural reforms, and \nultimately repay its bailout funds.  These terms have long been regarded as harsh by the Greek citizenry, giving rise \nto the popularity of Syriza, the anti-bailout party, which emerged as a protest entity to the dictates of the global \nfinancial system.  Worth noting, however, is the fact that as painful as most countries tend to find austerity \nmeasures characteristic of structural adjustment programs, Greece's debt problems have at least partially been due \nto the fact that a wide swath of the Greek population does not pay its taxes.  Without taxes, a country simply does \nnot have sufficient funds in its coffers to service its debts. Also contributing to Greece's debt crisis has been its \nbloated public sector -- an area targeted for reform to the great consternation of Greeks.\n\nBut for the incoming leader of Greece, the focus was not so much on continuing the work of the previous New \nDemocracy government and reforming the economy; instead, it was on delivering a message of defiance to \nGreece's creditors.  The keystone of Alex Tsipras'  victory speech as as follows:\n\n\"Our victory is of all the peoples of Europe who are struggling. I would like to assure you the new Greek \ngovernment will be ready to co-operate and negotiate with our friends, with a just and useful solution so that Greece \nwill return Europe to development and social stability and values like democracy and solidarity.  In this sincere \ndialogue, Greece will come with its own proposals, its own national plan of reforms and radical changes with a four-\nyear plan, without shortages, without unrealistic proposals about our debt. The new Greek government will prove \nthe Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great \nopportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2015,  Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional \naccompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for  a secular \nceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.\n\nTsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has \nopposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program.  That was likely the beginning and end \nof the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given the two arties' divergent views on  \nimmigration.  In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on immigration that repelled the centrist group, \nPotami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, to stay out of the new coalition government.\n\nNevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a \nmajority in the 300-seat parliament.  Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide \na shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.\n\nIn his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet.  The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no \nshortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his \nplan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts.  Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, \nYanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of \nthe right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.\n\nSpecial Report\n\n\n\nJob 1:  Servicing Greek debt --\n\nWith its future in Euro zone at stake, Greece finally strikes an agreement with its creditors; new bailout deal filled \nwith harsh austerity measures and major compromises for Greece\n\nSummary:\n\nThe spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and \ndebt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue \nfunds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro \nzone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to \nbe submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to \nrein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have \nmade clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election \npromises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, \nthose demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.\n\nFaced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, \nwould give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European \nfinance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit \nthe Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; \nhowever, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus \nconcomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable \nseveral years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so \nclose to the June 2015 deadline.  That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its \nreform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.\n\nAs talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation \nabout either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek \nexit from the Euro zone.  Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a \nrescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default.  Instead, Greek Prime \nMinister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he \nurged fellow citizens to vote against it.  His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to \nGreece's leverage against its creditors.  Those creditors, however,  reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal \nwith them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur \ncatastrophic consequences for Greece.\n\nGreeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the \nGreek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as \nGreeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was \nnow effectively wading  into uncharted territory.\n\nWith a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new \nproposals for consideration.\n\n\n\nWith two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the  new slate of  proposals from Greece were \nessentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015.  A key distinction in  this new blueprint \nwas the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.\n\nFinally, on July 13, 2015,  a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached.  The new agreement \nmandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. \nThere were also harsh demands by hardliners  that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists.  It was apparent \nthat Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power.  The  good news for \nGreece was that the  full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" \nwould be held immediately.  But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of \nthe matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be \nunpopular with the Greece citizenry.\n\nTo that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government  of \ndisloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has \ntaken.  That attempt was not yielding desired results.  Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form \ntheir own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a \nparliamentary majority.  While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the \nmatter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary \nelections.  It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe radical left wing and anti-bailout party, Syriza, won the January 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece. In the \naftermath of those polls, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a \nfringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue \nprogram.\n\nAt the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout \npackages. With Greece's arrangement with the euro zone set to expire on Feb. 28, 2015, even with continued \nsupport from the International Monetary Fund, Greece would have to be part of a European treaty organization to \nprocure the remaining rescue loans and to be positioned to receive future support from the European Central Bank. \nThus, Greece would essentially have to retain its position as a euro zone country within the European Union. \nHowever, Syriza leader Tsipras was showing no urgency on the matter of negotiating an agreement to address \nthese collective concerns, insisting that he had at least half a year to negotiate a deal with Greece's creditors.\n\nGoing back to 2010, Greece was in the midst of a debt-to-GDP crisis and at risk of sovereign default. As a result of \nthat crisis, and with the contagion effect on other euro zone countries in the European Union at stake, Greece was \nthe recipient of a rescue package from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That \npackage was dependent on Greece's agreement to implement austerity measures and other structural reforms, and \nultimately repay its bailout funds. These terms have long been regarded as harsh by the Greek citizenry, giving rise \nto the popularity of Syriza, the anti-bailout party, which emerged as a protest movement in response to the dictates \nof the global financial system. Worth noting, however, is the fact that as painful as most countries tend to find \nausterity measures characteristic of structural adjustment programs, Greece's debt problems have at least partially \nbeen due to the fact that a wide swath of the Greek population does not pay its taxes. Without taxes, a country \nsimply does not have sufficient funds in its coffers to service its debts. Also contributing to Greece's debt crisis has \nbeen its bloated public sector -- an area targeted for reform to the great consternation of Greeks.\n\n\n\nBut for the incoming leader of Greece, the focus was not so much on continuing the work of the previous New \nDemocracy government and reforming the economy; instead, it was on delivering a message of defiance to \nGreece's creditors. The keystone of Alex Tsipras' victory speech as follows:\n\n\"Our victory is of all the peoples of Europe who are struggling. I would like to assure you the new Greek \ngovernment will be ready to co-operate and negotiate with our friends, with a just and useful solution so that Greece \nwill return Europe to development and social stability and values like democracy and solidarity. In this sincere \ndialogue, Greece will come with its own proposals, its own national plan of reforms and radical changes with a four-\nyear plan, without shortages, without unrealistic proposals about our debt. The new Greek government will prove \nthe Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great \nopportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2015, Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional \naccompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for a secular \nceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.\n\nTsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has \nopposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program. That shared opposition to the bailout \npackage was likely the beginning and end of the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given \nthe two parties' divergent views on immigration. In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on \nimmigration that repelled the centrist group, Potami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, \nto stay out of the new coalition government.\n\nNevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a \nmajority in the 300-seat parliament. Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide \na shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.\n\nGreek seeks rescue funds; Greece's creditors seek reform commitments --\n\nIn his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet. The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no \nshortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his \nplan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts. Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, \nYanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of \nthe right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.\n\nVaroufakis, who was a professor at the University of Texas, gained notoriety due to his vociferous excoriation of the \nbailout regime, referring to it as \"fiscal waterboarding\" while warning that it was transforming Europe into a \n\"Victorian workhouse.\" But it was apparent that he was prepared to moderate such language as finance minister, \nsaying to media that he had participated in an \"encouraging and inspiring\" conversation with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, \nthe head of the euro zone's finance ministers. However, Varoufakis insisted that he would not negotiate with the so-\ncalled \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek debt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central \nBank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he suggested that he would look to negotiating with individual \nEuropean countries and organizations. It was to be seen if such a path was even feasible.\n\nFor his part, Dijsselbloem said that Greeks should not hold on to unrealistic expectations, and that the act of \nelecting Syriza did not change the realities that Greek debt would have to be repaid. He said, \"We all have to \nrealize and the Greek people have to realize that the major problems in the Greek economy have not disappeared \nand haven't even changed overnight because of the simple fact that an election took place.\"\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the new Greek government had high hopes that its debt obligations would be forgiven. German \nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who warned Greece that its tactics would not be indulged, including its \ndemands to have its debt written off, quickly dissolved those high hopes. He said, \"There's no arguing with us about \nthis, and what's more we are difficult to blackmail.\"\n\nLikewise, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear the European Union would not be renegotiating the terms \nof the Greek rescue package. In an interview with the newspaper, Die Welt, Merkel said, \"I do not envisage fresh \ndebt cancellation. There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors, banks have already \nslashed billions from Greece's debt.\" That being said, Merkel added that she hoped Greece would remain in the \neuro zone. She said, \"The aim of our policy was and is that Greece remains permanently part of the euro \ncommunity. Europe will continue to show its solidarity with Greece, as with other countries hard hit by the crisis, if \nthese countries carry out reforms and cost-saving measures.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Athens was showcasing its defiance as it moved forward with its anti-austerity agenda. Prime Minister \nTsipras soon halted privatization plans for the Port of Piraeus that had been agreed under the country's rescue \npackage, and said that similar moves were in place as regards the privatization of Public Power Corporation of \nGreece, Greece's biggest utility company, as well as the refiner, Hellenic Petroleum. In truth, Greece's privatization \nprogram had, thus far, yielded far les revenue than had originally been envisioned; thus, a halt in this arena was to \nbe expected.\n\nIn the offing, however, were further measures aimed at reconstituting the welfare state, such as free electrical \npower and food stamps for Greeks, as well as labor changes, including the reversal of the reduced minimum wage \nand the restoration of collective bargaining rights for unions. These moves, along with Tsipras' promise to abolish \nthe higher \"crisis\" taxes that were implemented in the midst of the Greek debt fracas, have spurred questions as to \nhow exactly the Greek government intended to pay for all the programs mentioned above.\n\nOne measure of funding for Greece was through Germany -- but not via the contemporary European Union \nchannels; instead, it relied on history and the notion of historic debt. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras demanded that \nGermany pay reparations for World War Two, including the repayment of a loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of \nGreece to pay when they occupied Greece. According to the Greek prime minister, there was an outstanding \"moral \nobligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism.\" It \nwas to be seen if, in 2015, this argument would be regarded as valid.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his \ncountry for the \"terrible events\" in Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944. However, he made clear \nthat Germany had already addressed those responsibilities, saying, \"We are firmly convinced that all reparations \nissues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all.\"\n\nIn February 2015, weeks after coming to power, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that his newly-elected \ngovernment was committed to moving forward with its pre-election promises, irrespective of the questions as to how \nthose social programs would be paid for. In a speech before parliament on Feb. 8, 2015, Tsipras declared that the \ngovernment's \"irreversible decision is to implement in full our pre-elections pledges.\"\n\nThe prime minister also said that his country was seeking a bridge loan rather than an extension of its current \nrescue package to service its massive debt. In a speech to parliament, he said, \"The bailout failed. The new \ngovernment is not justified in asking for an extension... because it cannot ask for an extension of mistakes.\"\n\nOf course, the European Union had a different view. Already the European Union had made it clear that it was not \nprepared to renegotiate Greece's bailout terms. Now, in response to Prime Minister Tsipras' call for a loan rather \n\n\n\nthan an extension of the existing bailout package, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance \nministers, said that the only option on the table was for Greece to apply for a bailout extension. Dijsselbloem said, \n\"We don't do bridging loans.\" Placing more pressure on the new Greek government was the move by the European \nCentral Bank making it clear that Greek banks could no longer access ECB credit by using Greek government \nbonds.\n\nFor its part, Germany, the euro zone's main player and Greece's biggest creditor, maintained its strict stance that \nGreece would have to go forward with its structural reforms if it wished to have continued support. German Finance \nMinister Wolfgang Schaeuble made a point of noting that Greece had lived beyond its means for far too long time. \nLeft unsaid was the reality that German taxpayers should not have to pay for Greek social programs when that \ncountry refused to attend to its unsustainable financial regime.\n\nAt home in Greece, the new anti-bailout and anti-austerity government had popular backing for its stance at home. \nGreeks were taking to the streets to rally in support of the Syriza-led government's position, and polling data \nshowed that as many as 75 percent of Greeks supported the hardline policies of the prime minister. That position \nwas ratified in parliament in the second week of February 2015 when Tsipras won a confidence vote, paving the \nway for the cancellation of the rescue program discussed here. In an address to parliament, he declared: \"We are \nnot negotiating the bailout; it was cancelled by its own failure.\" He continued, \"I want to assure you that there is no \ngoing back. Greece cannot return to the era of bailouts.\"\n\nIn mid-February, Greek Finance Minister said in an article in the New York Times that his country would not be \ntreated as a \"debt colony\" subjected to \"the greatest austerity for the most depressed economy.\" Meanwhile, Greek \nDefense Minister Panos Kammenos also indicated that if the European Union was unwilling to bow to its demands, \nthen it would look to Russia or China for funding. Seemingly, Greece preferred to become a client state of one of \nthe eastern powers -- Russia or China -- rather than seek a compromise with the West in the form of the European \nUnion.\n\nBy Feb. 16, 2015, talks between Greece and the euro zone finance group collapsed when the government of \nGreece rejected a proposal by the Euro bloc that would entail a request for a six-month extension to the existing \nbailout package. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, said that Greece would have \nuntil Feb. 20, 2015, to apply for an extension or the rescue program would expire, on schedule, at the end of \nFebruary 2015. But the government of Greece rejected the proposal, casting it as unacceptable. With the extension \nnow off the proverbial table, and with the new government committed to reversing austerity measures, it was \nunclear how Greece intended to service its debt and pay for its social welfare programs.\n\nA new attempt to address Greece's debt woes was expected to take place on Feb. 18, 2015, when Greece would \napparently seek an extension on a loan -- but not one coinciding with the current rescue regime. Stated differently, \nthe \"extension\" would have to be crafted in such a way as to maintain the appearance of continuity while also \nending the current austerity programs demanded by Greece. It was to be seen if such a creative resolution could be \nforged -- and accepted -- by all key parties.\n\nAfter days of contentious and intense negotiations, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to \nextend Greece's bailout package for four months. The deal, which was reached during emergency talks between \nthe Greek government and euro zone finance ministers, would allow Greece to access US$271 billion in rescue \nfunds (roughly 240 billion euro).\n\nWhile this agreement would give Greece some time to address its economic woes, it was hardly an enduring \nresolution for the debt-stricken country. Nevertheless, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance \n\n\n\nministers, hailed the agreement, saying, \"I'm glad to report to you that the work has paid off. We have established \ncommon ground again.\" He continued, \"I think tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you \nknow trust leaves quicker than it comes. Tonight was a very important, I think, step in that process.\" Greek Finance \nMinister Varoufakis signaled a similar message, as he said, \"The four-month period will be a time to rebuild new \nrelations with Europe and the IMF.\"\n\nCentral to the deal was Greece's commitment to honor its debt obligations, and its vow to unveil a list of economic \nreform measures aimed at addressing its debt woes. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said he would be \nworking hard in the following days to come up with a new plan aimed at introducing reforms, presumably not of the \ntype the Greek people would view as harsh austerity measures. That list was presented late on Feb. 23, 2015, and \nincluded measures such as combating tax evasion, tacking corruption, pausing on a reversal of the privatization \nprocess, eliminating incentives for early retirement, reducing the number of government ministries, and reforming \nthe public sector.\n\nThe European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to the Greek reform proposal by \nnoting that it was a \"valid starting point.\" However, they were still looking for further measures to be implemented. \nThe head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, said that the Greek proposal \"differs from existing programme commitments in \na number of areas.\" He added that there would have to be an assessment process by which some listed reforms \nwere \"replaced with measures of equal or better quality.\" The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nChristine Lagarde, struck a similar tone saying, \"In some areas like combating tax evasion and corruption, I am \nencouraged by what appears to be a stronger resolve on the part of the new authorities in Athens. In quite a few \nareas, however, including perhaps the most important ones, the letter is not conveying clear assurances that the \ngovernment intends to undertake the reforms envisaged.\"\n\nGreece seeks external support -\n\nIn the first part of April 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras traveled to the Russian capital of Moscow for \ntalks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia had been one of Greece's leading trading partners; however, \nbilateral trade between the two countries had decreased due to sanctions on Russia for its military engagement in \nUkraine, and also because of the Greece's own existing economic challenges.\n\nTsipras's meeting in Russia sparked speculation about a potential bid by Greece to curry favor with alternative \nglobal powers, given its strained relations with the European Union over a financial rescue package. For some \ntime, Greece has argued that it should not be burdened by strenuous structural adjustment and debt reform \nprograms required by a prevailing bailout regime. This position was not shared by Greece's rescue funding \ncreditors at the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, who have insisted that Greece meet its \nfinancial obligations. Given this climate of dissonance, in February 2015, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis \nwarned that his country would not bend to the will of the so-called \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek \ndebt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he \nsaid Greece would look to other countries for support. The April 2015 trip by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to \nRussia was thus being viewed as a means to cultivate relations with new international partners.\n\nReports from Russia indicated that while Russian President Putin offered moral support to Greece, there was no \nsignificant financial aid coming from Moscow. Putin said that Russia would entertain granting Greece loans for join \nprojects, likely in the energy sector, which might be mutually beneficial. To this end, Putin explained, \"We discussed \ncooperation in various sectors of the economy, including the possibility of developing major energy projects.\" He \ncontinued, \"Under these plans, we could provide loans for certain projects.\" One possible arena for energy \ncooperation could be the extension to the Turkish Stream pipeline, which would transport Russian gas from Turkey \nto Europe via Greece. Putin also said that bilateral trade relations with Greece should be restored. While Putin \n\n\n\nmight be interested in bringing Western countries into its orbit, the fact of the matter was that Russia had its own \nfinancial woes to confront, thus limiting its own capacity to extend a more direct financial hand in Greece.\n\nNevertheless, the trip marked a strengthening of overall relations between the two countries. Indeed, Greek Prime \nMinister Tsipras distanced his country from the rest of Europe in its stance towards Russia, which had become \nsomething of a global pariah after the annexation of Crimea and ongoing intervention into the Ukrainian crisis. \nTspiras insisted, \"Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy.\" He then broke \nranks with the European Union, condemning the punitive measures imposed by the West on Russia and urging an \nend to the \"vicious cycle of sanctions.\" Tsipras was also anxious to dismiss suggestions that he had flown to \nMoscow to ask for financial aid. He said, \"Greece is not a beggar going around to countries asking them to solve its \neconomic problem, an economic crisis that doesn't only concern Greece but is a European crisis.\"\n\nNegotiating Rollercoaster --\n\nGreece has insisted that Germany -- the most powerful player in the euro bloc -- should pay war reparations for the \nNazi occupation during World War Two, when the Bank of Greece was forced to pay loans to the Nazi-led \ngovernment of Germany at the time. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras was on the record declaring that there was an \noutstanding \"moral obligation\" by Germany to address this debt. But German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter \nSteinmeier had already acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his country for the \"terrible events\" \nin Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944, and he had already reminded Greece that Germany had \naddressed those war reparations responsibilities. For his part, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel referred \nto this ongoing argument by Greece as \"dumb.\"\n\nMid-April 2015 was the stated schedule for Greece to produce a revised list of reforms that would be needed to \nsecure forthcoming rescue funds. While Greece managed to meet a deadline to repay 460 million euros to the \nInternational Monetary Fund earlier in the month, the country would be faced with larger and more pressing debt \nrepayments (to renew Treasury bonds and to repay loans). It was to be seen if it would be able to meet those \nobligations.\n\nFollowing talks in Belgium in mid-April 2015, Euro zone officials were shocked that Greece did not meet this \nrequirement. Instead, Greece produced no serious structural reform plan, and refused to discuss reductions of civil \nservice pensions or any other expensive aspects of the welfare state. Making matter worse, one source said in an \ninterview with the German publication, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, that the Greek representative \ndemanded rescue funds \"like a taxi driver.\" Greece was given a deadline of April 24, 2015, to produce a revised \neconomic reform plan. Euro zone officials warned that the new plan would have to be ambitious. It was to be seen if \nthat deadline would be met and if the proposal would be deemed acceptable by Greece's European creditors.\n\nIn the third week of April 2015, with a loan repayment due the following month, Greece was under pressure to pay \nits bills. In its desperation to find available cash to pay its bills (public wages and pensions), Greece was tapping \ninto public cash reserves from municipalities. Local governments and opposition parties railed against the move, \nwith local officials threatening to ignore the demand for funds, and with opposition politicians accusing the Syrize \ngovernment of acting arbitrarily and not respecting the constitution.\n\nPressure was also coming from outside Greek borders, with Euro bloc powers demanding that the Greek \ngovernment submit a substantive reform plan in order to secure future rescue funds, and with a significant \nrepayment to the International Monetary Fund due. There were challenges on both fronts. First, as discussed here, \nGreece was not actively pursuing a structural reform agenda of the type needed to satisfy the country's creditors. \nSecond, it was reported by the Financial Times that Greece had asked for a delay its loan repayment to the \nInternational Monetary Fund but was rebuffed. In truth, a delay in a repayment to a developed country like Greece \n\n\n\nwould be unprecedented, while delays of this sort to developing countries in the past had not yielded positive \nresults. As such, the International Monetary Fund was not inclined to move in this direction.\n\nEuro bloc powers were eager to remind Greece that it was not likely to find creditors elsewhere, with German \nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble noting that while the Greek government could try to curry favor -- and funding \n-- from Russia or China, the reality was that it would be difficult to actually secure other creditors. He said, \"The \nEuropeans have said, OK, we are ready to do it [lend money] until 2020... If you find someone else, whether it's in \nBeijing, in Moscow, in Washington D.C., or in New York who will lend you money, ok, fine, we would be happy. But \nit's difficult to find someone who is lending you in this situation amounts [of] 200 billion euros.\"\n\nFor his part, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras seemed determined to project an image of optimism as he insisted that \nthe Greek government would reach a deal with its creditors. He said, \"Despite the cacophony and erratic leaks and \nstatements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end \nof the month.\" He said that progress had been made in the arenas of tax collection, tax distribution, and corruption. \nHowever, he admitted that there remained disagreements in certain arenas, such as privatization, labor and \npension reforms, and value-added taxes. Of course, those were the very arenas that the Euro bloc was targeting for \nGreek structural adjustment.\n\nIt should be noted that Euro zone finance ministers had a completely different tone from the optimism imbued in \nPrime Minister Tsipras' claims discussed above. Instead, during a meeting with Greek Finance Minister Yanis \nVaroufakis, Euro zone officials characterized the talks as \"going nowhere.\" Some even suggested that as Greece \nmoved close to the precipice of bankruptcy, it was time to prepare for default, believing that the effort to try to save \nGreece had gone on long enough. They indicated that Greece's refusal to get serious with a reform agenda made it \nclear that Greece did not want to be \"saved\" in the first place.\n\nAs April 2015 came to a close, finance ministers from the Euro zone warned Greece that no further financial aid \nwould be advanced without the submission of a comprehensive economic reform and restructuring plan. Jeroen \nDijsselbloem, the finance minister from the Netherlands, said: \"A comprehensive and detailed list of reforms is \nneeded.\" Dijsselbloem also warned that funds to Greece would be frozen until Greece presented a complete reform \nproposal as he added, \"A comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursement can take place ... We are all \naware that time is running out.\"\n\nNo further meetings between the Greek government and Euro zone officials were scheduled until the second week \nof May 2015 -- the very deadline when Greece would be expected to make a large repayment to the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF).\n\nAhead of that meeting between the Greek government and Euro zone officials in mid-May 2015, Greek Finance \nMinister Yanis Varoufakis acknowledged that an agreement to abate Greece's money woes was not going to be \nreached easily. In an interview with Greek media, Varoufakis said, \"The Greek government is struggling in a very \ntough negotiating fight to achieve an agreement that will not only be an agreement to have a disbursement but one \nthat will deliver a substantive hit to the crisis.\" He continued. \"I think the solution will be given in the coming days \nand not necessarily today. We will do whatever we can to achieve [re: liquidity] relief today.\n\nBut officials of the Euro zone warned that they did not foresee any moves that would allow the European Central \nBank to raise the limit on short-term Treasury bills that Greek banks could buy. That was the measure Greece was \nhoping to achieve in order to avert bankruptcy. Not surprisingly, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis thusly \nwarned that his country's financial situation was \"terribly urgent\" with a liquidity crisis in the offing. He added, \"The \n\n\n\nliquidity issue is a terribly urgent issue. It's common knowledge, let's not beat around the bush.\" Indeed, Greece's \nfinancial coffers were so low that the government was raiding public funds to pay for its commitments.\n\nTo that end, reports from Greece indicated that the country did indeed meet its obligations by the mid-May 2015 \ndeadline for repayment of 750 million euros (approximately US$834 million) to the International Monetary Fund. The \nGreek finance ministry reported that the order for repayment was executed on May 11, 2015. According to the \nmayor of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, the funds came from his country's cash reserves. However, some of the \nmoney also ironically came from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself.\n\nDeadlines and Default --\n\nThe end of May 2015 would see Greece needing about 2.5 billion euros funds to pay for its salary and pension \nobligations. The next major deadline would come in late May-early June 2015 when Greece would be expected to \nsubmit a comprehensive reform deal in concert with its international creditors, in order to secure a tranche of rescue \nfunds. That would also be the period when European powers, particularly Germany, would need a viable \nagreement on the table to be approved in parliament before moving forward one way or another. Increasingly, \nGerman lawmakers were turning sour on the idea of saving an unwilling Greece from its own economic perils. As \nsuch, sufficient time was needed to persuade a majority of members of parliament to approve the deal. Also of \nsignificance was the fact that the actual bailout agreement between Athens and the Euro zone was set to expire at \nthe close of June 2015.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Euro zone finance ministers, Chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that any further \ndisbursements of funds to Greece would be contingent on the formation of a complete agreement. He said, \"There \nare time constraints and liquidity constraints and hopefully we will reach an agreement before time runs out and \nbefore money runs out.\"\n\nIn the streets of Greece, the Greek people have made it clear that the radical Syriza government they elected had \nto keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social \nwelfare state. However, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international \ncreditors, who require a comprehensive structural adjustment program to be implemented in Greece before it will \nprovide further rescue funds. Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government has said that it \nmight have to hold a referendum in order to ratify any agreement forged with European finance ministers.\n\nIt was an idea that was gaining resonance across the European Union. Euro zone authorities were realizing that \nGreece -- and specifically the Greek government operating on behalf of the people -- needed a mandate to move \nforward, while the Greek people themselves had to be committed to its continued participation in the regional \nmonetary body. That commitment required a reshaping of Greek economic behavior, and specifically, required \nGreece to live within its means rather than  repeatedly violating the financial rules set for all Euro zone countries.\n\nAccordingly, Germany Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble said of the referendum idea, \"Maybe this would be the \nright measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary.\" He expanded on his stance \nsaying, \"If the Greek government thinks it must hold a referendum, then let it hold a referendum. That might even \nbe a helpful measure for the Greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary, or whether it \nwants something different.\"\n\nBut the chairman of the Euro bloc, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, was not so sanguine on the notion of a referendum, \nwarning that the schedule of such an endeavor would slow down the entire process, including the disbursement of \n\n\n\nbillion euros in frozen bailout funds. He said, \"Presumably if you have a referendum you will not start implementing \nbefore you have done it and then it doesn't seem to make sense.\"\n\nIt should be noted that polling data by Marc pollsters for the Ton Syntakton newspaper in mid-May 2015 showed \nthat the vast majority of Greeks wished to stay in the Euro zone. Indeed, 76.9 percent of Greeks expressed that \nview with only 19.2 percent favoring a return to the Drachma. Polling data also indicated some breathing room for \nthe radical Syriza government, with 51.1 percent of respondents saying that the government should continue to \ngovern from the helm even if negotiations with international creditors arrive at an impasse; only 22.8 percent \nactually favored a referendum on Greece's future in the euro zone, while a small minority -- 16.6 percent -- favored \nfresh elections.\n\nAnother option available to Greece would be default and a Greek exit from the Euro zone, known colloquially as \n\"Grexit.\" Some Greek politicians were calling for a default and the withdrawal from the Euro zone, insisting that the \nterms for continued participation were too onerous for the Greek people. Left unstated by these individuals was the \nlikely catastrophic consequences of this path, which would very likely include capital controls on banks, the collapse \nof some financial entities, inflation particularly on imports, and the complete collapse of investment.\n\nOf note was the fact that the year 2015 was quite different from the 2011 period when the notion of a Greek default \nfueled fears of contagion across the southern countries of the Euro bloc. Since 2011, a bailout fund had been \nestablished in the Euro zone, and other banking protections had been introduced. As such, the Euro zone was now \nbetter positioned to withstand a theoretical Greek default. Moreover, with other Southern European countries on \nthe brink, such as Spain, where the populist party, Podemas, was gaining steam, a more unwieldy economic crisis \nwas looming ahead with a much bigger economy to consider. For some European countries, a Greek refusal to \nreform, followed by inevitable default, could function as an economic cautionary tale of sorts.\n\nAs May 2015 came to an end, Greece was in a financially perilous position with no deal on the horizon to be forged \nwith its international creditors.  Moreover, Greek Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis admitted that his country had \"no \nmoney\" to fund  scheduled repayments to the International Monetary Fund , which were set to commence on June \n5, 2015.\n\nAhead of that first repayment deadline, a spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund,  William Murray, \nwarned that  Greece would be denied additional financing if it missed a loan payment.  Murray  noted: \"Any country \nthat doesn't meet its commitment with the [International Monetary] Fund... is declared in arrears and they have no \naccess to IMF funding.\"\n\nIn a statement,  the head of the International Monetary Fund,  Christine Lagarde, acknowledged that no agreement \nwas imminent; she said, \"It is very unlikely that we'll reach a comprehensive solution in the coming days.\"  Despite \nsome encouraging expositions of rhetoric from various parties following a series of meetings, Lagarde archly noted, \n\"We've been sobered again in the last week.\"  Lagarde also admitted that a Greek exit from the euro zone  was a \nreal possibility as she said \"It's a complicated issue and it's one that I hope the Europeans will not have to face \nbecause hopefully they will find a path to agree with the future of Greece within the eurozone.\"\n\nLagarde foreclosed any kind of preferential agreement for Greece, fueling speculation that the European Union's \neuro zone and the International Monetary Fund intended to showcase Athens as a cautionary example for other \neuro zone countries on the brink and vulnerable to populist notions of opposing austerity measures, economic \nreforms, and  programs of structural readjustment.\n\n\n\nReminding all countries that have sought assistance  that loans and rescue packages comes with obligations, \nLagarde declared: \"We have rules. We have principles. There will be no half-baked program review.\"\n\nJust ahead of the June 5, 2015, deadline when Greece was due to dispatch its first repayment to the  International \nMonetary Fund,  Greek Prime Minister Tsipras angrily rejected what he cast as the  \"absurd\" terms of proposed aid \nfrom the European bloc.  During a speech to the Greek parliament, he said,  \"The Greek government cannot \nconsent to absurd proposals. I want to believe that this proposal was a bad moment for Europe or at the very least \na bad negotiating trick and will soon be withdrawn by the masterminds themselves.\"  The Greek finance minister \nhad an even more vituperative response to the terms proposed by European bloc creditors. In an interview with a \nGreek newspaper,  Finance Minister Varoufakis characterized the reform proposal plan  as \"an aggressive move \ndesigned to terrorize the Greek government\" and declared that \"this Greek government cannot be terrorized.\"\n\nSoon thereafter, Prime Minister Tsipras' government in Athens informed the International Monetary Fund that it \nwould delay the 300 million euros due at that time.  Instead, Greece would bundle all four of its June repayments to \nthe International Monetary Fund -- totaling 1.5 billion euros in all --  and dispatch the funds on June 30, 2015.  Of \ncourse, there was no actual understanding of where Greece would procure this money since on the very same day \n-- June 30, 2015 -- the rescue deal with the  International Monetary Fund and the European Union was set to \nexpire.\n\nAs discussed here, there was no viable deal on the table to provide additional bailout funds.\n\nAs unorthodox as the delaying+bundling tactic might have been,  and as unpalatable a prolonged impasse might \nbe, there was, in fact,  a  precedent dating back to the 1970s.  That precedent made it possible for governments to \nbundle together multiple principal payments  due in a calendar month and thus simplfy the process of making \nmultiple payments in a short period.  Indeed, in the mid-1980s, the African country of Zambia used the bundling \noption to repay the International Monetary Fund.  Still, the prevailing problem remained at hand for Greece:  Even if \nthe schedule of repayment was adjusted,  was it even possible for Greece to cobble together the  necessary funds?\n\nThe negotiations aimed at staving off default continued to be characterized by conflicting reports of progress.  \nGreek Prime Minister  Tsipras  insisted that  an agreement with his country's  international creditors was \"in sight,\" \nwhile the finance ministers of the Euro Zone made clear that concurrence was a significant distance away.  Indeed, \nGreece remained unprepared to assent to its international creditors' demands for a reform plan including want \npension cuts,  reforms to the value added tax (VAT),  labor reforms,  increased private sector investment, and \nstructural changes to the  civil service.\n\nIn fact, Greece had its own long list of demands that include highly generous debt relief and threats to re-impose \ncollective bargaining rights for  Greek workers.\n\nSuddenly, snap elections were being considered as a possible option as the Greek government might need to  gain \nthe public's approval of the difficult path forward.  To this end, Greece's Deputy Social Security Minister Dimitris \nStratoulis was quoted as declaring: \"The lenders want to impose hard measures. If they do not back down from this \npackage of blackmail, the government ... will have to seek alternative solutions, elections.\"  Stratoulis also indicated \nthat the postponement and bundling of the repayment to the International Monetary Fund was a negotiating tactic \nas he declared, \"The government's move is a message that it wants to wait and see how far they (lenders) will take \nit, if they will back off from this unreasonable, inhumane, colonialist package they are proposing.\"  If Stratoulis was \ncorrect,  then the response of Greece's international creditors would certainly be instructive.\n\n\n\nWith the June 30, 2015, deadline looming ahead  for both the repayment bundle due to the International Monetary \nFund, as well as the presentation of a comprehensive economic reform plan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel \nexpressed cautious hopes that Greece would remain in the euro zone, while warning that Athens would have to \nseriously address the concerns of its creditors. She said,  \"We want Greece to stay in the euro but in order to \nachieve that, Greece has to make the necessary efforts, and these are the subject of our ongoing discussions, and I \nwant to see them come to a positive result.\"\n\nGermany's vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel offered a more harsh assessment as he noted that other  countries in \nEurope were losing patience with Greece.  In an article in the German  Bild magazine,  Gabriel said that while \nGermany ideally would prefer to see Greece remain in the Euro zone, \"not only is time running out, but so too is \npatience across Europe.\"  In something of a warning to Greece, he added, \"Everywhere in Europe, the sentiment is \ngrowing that enough is enough.\"\n\nAs before, Greece appeared unprepared to heed that warning and instead lashed out at its creditors --  presumably \nin an effort to redirect the blame for its own economic woes.  In fact, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras accused \ncreditors of issuing unreasonable demands as he said, \"One can only see a political purposefulness in the \ninsistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts.\"  He continued by \nsuggesting that Greece would wait until the rest of Europe zone acquiesced to his country's demands for funds.  To \nthis end, Tspiras said, \"We will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism.  We do not have the right to \nbury European democracy at the place where it was born.\"\n\nBy mid-June 2015, the European Commission had dismissed Greece's proposal  to address its debt and \nrepayment woes, saying sharply that the Greek government failed to produce any new  and serious plan that would \nsecure the funding needed to repay the International Monetary Fund by the June 30, 2015, deadline.  As talks with \nthe Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit this fresh impasse, speculation about either snap elections \nor painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. \nHowever, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis  foreclosed the possibility of a \"Grexit,\" asserting that  it would \nnot be a sensible solution to the Greek debt crisis. Instead, he was demanding an \"extension\" of the existing bailout \nterms as as a generous debt forgiveness package. Of note was the fact that Greece's creditors have long said \nthese options were not on the table.\n\nIn the third week of June 2015, Greek said it would default on the  1.6 billion euro debt repayment to the \nInternational Monetary Fund due  on June 30, 2015, unless it garnered fresh rescue funds  from its creditors.\n\nBut  if Greece thought its warning of a possible default would work to its benefit,  it was quickly reminded that the \npressure was actually on Greece and not its creditor institutions.  To that end, the head of the\n\nInternational Money Fund, Christine Lagarde, reminded Greece that there would be \"no period of grace\" related to \nthe  debt repayment deadline.\n\nWith the  possibility of default looming, a meeting was convened  between envoys from the Greek government  and \nEuropean finance ministers but ended in failure with no progress made on a plausible path forward.  German \nmedia sources indicated that Greece wanted to present its existing reform proposal, which creditors had already \nsaid was a \"non-starter.\"\n\nJeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Euro group, explained the situation, saying, \"Regrettably ... too little \nprogress has been made. No agreement is in sight.\"  Accordingly, he indicated that it would be incumbent on \nGreece to advance a new set of  proposals.\n\n\n\nThe urgency of the situation was laid bare in an address by German Chancellor Merkel to the German parliament in \nwhich she said her country would do its part to retain Greece as part of the Euro Zone, but that Greece would have \nto do its part and make good on its reform obligations.\n\nTo this end, she said, \"There was an agreement -- the Greek government pledged to carry out structural reforms, \nand that must be done.\"\n\nAnother emergency meeting was scheduled to be held on June 22, 2015, in an effort to reach an agreement and \navert a Greek default.  The scene was now at a new level of urgency due to a spate of bank withdrawals (generally \nreferred to as a \"run on the banks\") in conjunction with lowered government revenues.  If those withdrawals \ncontinued, Greece would be forced to implement  capital controls to prevent the flight of cash from the country.  Of \ncourse, those very conditions were  placing pressure on the Greek government to be more agreeable in these latest \nnegotiations.\n\nTo that end, as of June 22, 2015, the government of Greece had advanced a new proposal for reform, which \nincluded fresh taxes on businesses and the wealthy, and an increase in the value added tax (VAT) rate in some \narenas.  But as before, the Syriza-led government insisted that there would be no curbs on  pensions or public-\nsector wages, and maintained that there would be no VAT on electricity and medicine.  These issues continued to \nbe sticking points  in the negotiations.  Nevertheless, the new proposal for reform was being welcomed by Greece's \ncreditors as a step in the right direction.\n\nIndeed, European Council President Donald Tusk said the new Greek plan constituted  the \"first real proposals in \nmany weeks.\"\n\nIt was thus still possible that a reform deal with Greece's creditors could be forged at the last minute, thus averting \ndefault and preserving Greece's place in the Euro Zone.  Another option might be an interim agreement that would \nsmooth over the differences, delay default, and keep Greece within the Euro Zone for the immediate future, with a \nhazier longer term horizon ahead.  But the fact of the matter was that there was also a third possibility --  Greece \nwas at serious risk of default and a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone.  What had been unfathomable and unpalatable \nseveral years prior  was now becoming a real possibility  as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 30, 2015, \ndeadline.\n\nGreece rejects rescue proposal and ensures default;  Greeks go to polls to vote in referendum --\n\nOn June 26, 2015 -- just days ahead of the June 30 deadline, the European Commission advanced a rescue \nproposal to Greece,  with an eye on averting a default and preserving Greece's participation in the euro zone.  The \n10-point plan was released by the European Commission\n\nPresident Jean-Claude Juncker  in the interests of transparency,  and was endorsed by both the\n\nEuropean Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Included in the plan were reforms to the sales tax \nregime, such as adjustments to the value added tax (VAT) and an increased corporate tax rate,  significant labor \nreforms, and fundamental changes to the  pension system,  which was described as  \"unsustainable.\"\n\n\n\nTo this particular end, early retirement would become a thing of the past.  The proposal would require Greece to \ncommit to these measures in order to secure further releases of aid funding -- an amount totaling 15.5 billion euros, \n1.8 billion euros of which would be made immediately available.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Greece to accept the  \"extraordinarily generous offer,\" which would \nrescue that country from certain default.\n\nGreece's Prime Minister Tsipras, however, made a difference assessment, unilaterally rejecting the deal and \nwithdrawing from the negotiations process.  In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Tspiras  described the \nplan as  \"an insulting ultimatum,\" imbued by\n\n\"humiliation,\"  and one that  would bedevil Greece with \"unbearable\" austerity measures.  He said, \"I call on you to \ndecide -- with sovereignty and dignity as Greek history demands -- whether we should accept the extortionate \nultimatum that calls for strict and humiliating austerity without end, and without the prospect of ever standing on our \nown two feet, socially and financially.\"  He added,  \"The people must decide free of any blackmail.\"\n\nThe Greek leader  then announced  a referendum, arguing that  the public's ratification would be needed to accept \nthe proposal.  However, he made it clear that the exercise of ratification was just a performance of sorts since (1) he \nhad already rejected the deal, and  (2) he was actually urging  Greek citizens to deliver a resounding \"no\" vote.\n\nThe Greek parliament quickly supported Tspiras' stance by overwhelmingly voting to approve the referendum and a \ndate of July 5, 2015, was scheduled for the vote.\n\nAt the heart of Tspiras' maneuver was his expressed suggestion that a \"no\" vote would bolster Greece's negotiating \nposition, presumably forcing creditor institutions to acquiesce to some of his demands, such as debt forgiveness \nand leaving the pension system untouched.  It appeared that Tsipras believed that by displaying a defiant stance, \nGreece would gain further time,  power, and leverage to pressure creditor institutions to not only extend  rescue \nfunding, but also assent to a more favorable deal.\n\nThroughout, Greece has been convinced that its creditors in Europe would do whatever necessary to prevent a \ndefault, due to fears of  a contagion spreading across vulnerable southern European countries.\n\nHowever, such anxieties have decreased in recent times.  The landscape in 2015 was  not the same as 2011; now, \nwith the European Central Bank (ECB)  establishing stopgaps measures and emergency funds, the Euro zone was \nfar better positioned to confront a default and even a \"Grexit.\"  As well, for some European players, a default by \nGreece -- as difficult as it might be -- would function as a cautionary tale for other southern European countries \nalso confronting debt-to-GDP crises.  Furthermore, there were some voices suggesting that a Euro zone without its \nweak link -- Greece --  might mean a stronger currency value for the euro.\n\nGiven this background, Greece's creditors quickly made it clear that they would not  be manipulated by  Greece's \n\"pretend and extend\" scheme.  In fact, they  criticized Prime Minister Tspiras' referendum announcement,  and \nwarned that there would be no extension to the bailout program past the June 30, 2015, deadline when Greece was \ndue to repay the IMF.  Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, explained the scenario in an interview with BBC \nnews.  Lagarde said that because the prevailing bailout program would expire on June 30, 2015, a referendum five \ndays later would be an irrelevant exercise since any existing proposals and arrangements would  no longer be  \nvalid. Without settling that IMF obligation, Greece would face default,  and  an exit from the euro bloc and other \ncatastrophic economic consequences could be in the offing.\n\n\n\nThe head of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, essentially washed his hands of the situation, indicating that it \nwould be  up to the European Central Bank (ECB) to decide whether or not it would provide emergency liquidity \nfunding to Greece's banking and financial system.  But such a move -- should it come -- would be subject to \ncriticism from other European countries. Of note was the call by some German politicians for the ECB to stop \nbailing out Greece's economy with emergency support, which could be a violation of the body's own central banking \nregulations.\n\nFinally, on June 28, 2015, ECB President  Mario Draghi convened  an emergency meeting, which concluded with \nthe decision to freeze the level of emergency aid available to Greek banks.\n\nThe news that negotiations had ended in failure triggered some panic from among the Greek citizenry, with long \nlines reported at banks as people tried to withdraw as much money as possible ahead of anticipated restrictions.  \nLines were also long at petrol (gas) stations and at grocery stores as Greeks stocked up on fuel and food supplies.  \nIn response to the rising tide of anxiety and to prevent a continued \"run of the banks,\"  it was soon announced that \nGreece's  beleaguered financial institutions would be closed from June 29, 2015.  Meanwhile,  the Greek authorities \nmoved to implement capital controls making Greece the second European country since Cyprus to follow this \npath.  Aiming to minimize the sense of panic, Prime Minister Tsipras urged calm, saying in a national address: \"The \nmore calmly we deal with difficulties, the sooner we can overcome them and the milder their consequences will \nbe.\"  The prime minister's political cachet meanwhile did not seem to be hurt with Greeks placing the blame on the \nEuropean creditors and not Tspiras for Greece's plight.\n\nNevertheless, Tspiras found himself to be the subject of a scathing editorial by the Financial Times on June 28, \n2015. In that editorial, the Financial Times accused the Greek leader of misleading the Greek people about just \nwhat was at stake in the referendum set for July 5, 2015.  A key point made by the Financial Times was as follows:  \n\"His [Tspiras']  tactic has already come unstuck because the eurozone has refused to consider extending their \nbailout offer to the date of the poll.  By Sunday, when the referendum votes are due to be cast, there may be no \ndeal on the table to discuss.\"  The Financial Times also accused the Greek leader of being deceptive about the goal \nof the referendum; the newspaper argued that a \"resounding no vote\" called for by Tsipras would not be a rejection \nof the rescue proposal by the European Commission but, instead,  \"a vote for the euro or the drachma \u2014 no more, \nno less.\"  The Financial Times' conclusion was that while Prime Minister Tspiras had presented the July 5, 2015, as \na referendum on the rescue plan, with a fresh (and better) deal to come as a result, in actuality, the referendum \nwas  about the so-called \"Grexit.\"\n\nMeanwhile, European finance ministers declined to extend the existing bailout for Greece, with Dutch Finance \nMinster and  the president of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, saying that  \"it would be crazy to extend the \nprogram.\"  An extension would have permitted Greece to meet its obligation; without it, Greece would not have the \nrequisite funds at its disposal. As a result, Greece officially defaulted on its scheduled repayment to the \nInternational Monetary Fund on June 30, 2015.\n\nNow, attention was on the July 5, 2015, date when the Greek citizenry was  scheduled to vote in a referendum on \nthe very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected.\n\nAhead of the vote, Prime Minister Tsipras showed interest in restarting the negotiations process with creditor \ninstitutions by dispatching a letter to European leaders.  In  that missive,  he suggested that his government was \nprepared to accept most -- but not all -- of the terms of the now-expired rescue package.  This perplexing move was \nmet with disinterest in Europe where leaders were clearly wary of dealing with Tsipras and the radical Syriza \ngovernment.  Speaking to the German parliament in Berlin, Chancellor Merkel said, \"We will wait for the \nreferendum. There can be no negotiations on a new aid program before the referendum.\" Dijsselbloem, the head of \n\n\n\nthe Euro group,  issued a similar response, noting that new rescue package terms  could only be discussed \"after \nand on the basis of the outcome of\" the referendum.\n\nRather than tempering the Greek stance ahead of the vote and certainly ahead of a fresh slate of negotiations, \nGreek  Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis lashed out at his country's creditors, accusing them of blackmail.  In an \ninterview with the media,  Varoufakis: \"This is a very dark moment for Europe. They have closed our banks for the \nsole purpose of blackmailing what? Getting a \"yes\" vote on a non-sustainable solution that would be bad for \nEurope.\"\n\nThis tone held resonance among many Greeks who were now blaming creditor institutions for capital controls at \nbanks and other hardships, which were sure to get worse should the \"no\" vote prevail.\n\nLong lines of pensioners  at banks, limits on cash withdawals,  stalled commercial activity, and  a sense of \nconfusion began to permeate the Greek landscape, even as  ratings agencies downgraded Greek banks to almost \njunk status.  Still, the political power of resistance and rhetoric was strong as angry Greeks took to the streets in \nmass protests  to blame Europe for its financial woes and to call for a strong rejection of the rescue package.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, European leaders were wasting no opportunity to remind the Greek people that \ndespite Prime Minister Tspiras' claims that a strong \"no\" vote would bolster the country's bargaining power, it was \nactually a vote against participation in the Euro zone.  They were essentially redefining the referendum terms so it \nwas instead a ratification or a rejection of the Euro zone -- and a choice between keeping the Euro and returning to \nthe Drachma.  Not surprisingly, that message also held resonance, and counter-demonstrations sprouted in the \nstreets of Greece,  with people calling for ratification of the bailout terms, and thus a \"yes\" vote.\n\nIn truth, creditor institutions were likely making the calculation that either a \"no\" or a \"yes\" vote would lead to a \nbetter outcome.  Despite the gamble of the radical Syriza government, a \"no\" vote would augur an exit of Greece \nfrom the Euro zone, and while that end would be painful and difficult, it might also be therapeutic.  Much as the \nremoval of a malignant tumor could help in the body's recover from cancerous toxins, so too might excising \nproblematic Greece prove to be helpful; indeed, it might very well  heal the debt-to-GDP woes infecting the regional \nbody.\n\nOn the other hand, a \"yes\" vote could potentially be viewed as a vote of non-confidence in Prime Minister Tspiras' \ngovernment, and could lead to its downfall.  European leaders, then, would then have the opportunity to negotiate \nwith another slate of players -- most of whom were guaranteed to be less intransigent than Syriza.  As such, there \nwas no reason for creditor institutions to do anything at this point but wait for the referendum to play out.\n\nFor his part, the Greek leadership was in no mood to back down.  Prime Minister Tspiras instead delivered a \nvociferous rallying call for Greeks to vote on the side of democracy and reject the bailout proposal as he declared:\n\n\"Turn your backs on those who terrorize you daily.\"  He continued, \"On Sunday, we are not just deciding that we \nare staying in Europe, but that we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe.\"  Prime Minister Tspiras was not the \nonly member of the Syriza government willing to deploy heavily loaded rhetoric.  Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis \nalso accused his country's creditors of terrorism. In an interview with the media, he posedthe following question: \n\"Why did they force us to close the banks? To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism.\"\n\nIt should be noted that polling data on the eve of the referendum suggested a close vote.  While support for the pro-\nTsipras/Syriza  \"no\" vote was initially stronger, congnizance of the consequences of such a path was beginning to \ncirculate through the Greek citizenry.  As such,  the \"yes\" vote was gaining steam and by July 3, 2015, some polling \n\n\n\noutfits were showing a slight lead for the \"yes\" contingent.  While there remained a significant undecided faction, \nwith Greeks overwhelmingly favoring continued participation in the Euro zone, the advantage was certainly not with \nthe Syriza government of Prime Minister Tspiras.\n\nMeanwhile, in Germany, frustration over being Greece's financial scapegoat was reaching new heights.  Already, \nGermans were growing increasingly outraged over the prospect of working longer to fund a bailout package that \nmight preserve early retirement for Greek pensioners.  But that outrage reached new heights as Greeks demonized \nGermany for the harsh austerity terms attached to the proposed rescue package.  Now, Germans were starting to \nwarm to the notion of a Greek exit from the Euro zone, while the German newspaper, Bild, suggested that Germany \nshould hold a referendum of its own, in which continued financial funding of Greece would have to be ratified.  The \nhypothetical referendum would ask the question:  \"Should we support Greece with more billions -- yes or no?\"  For \nnow, however, the focus would remain on Greece's referendum on July 5, 2015, with its future in the Euro zone at \nstake.\n\nOn July 5, 2015, Greeks went to the polls to cast their votes  in a referendum intended to either ratify the rescue \npackage or to reject it.\n\nAs suggested here,  the vote was widely regarded as a vote on the future of Greece in the Euro zone. After the \nvotes were counted -- and despite pre-referendum polling data indicating a close result -- it was clear that the \npeople of Greece had decisively voted \"no\" vote and rejected the rescue package by European creditors.  With \nalmost all the ballots counted, 61 percent of Greeks voted \"no\" while 39 percent voted \"yes.\"\n\nGreeks, it seemed, had accepted the argument by Prime Minister Tsipras that a strong \"no\" vote would improve \nGreece's leverage and bargaining power, and thus position the Syriza government to negotiate a better deal.  Of \ncourse \"better\" by Greek standards was not necessarily better in the minds of Greece's creditor institutions.  For \nGreece's creditor institutions, and certainly for finance ministers across Europe, the \"no\" vote signaled an exit from \nthe Euro zone.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tspiras declared victory and declared in a national address that his fellow Greeks had \nvoted for a \"Europe of solidarity and democracy.\" He signaled  a return to negotiations with a strengthened hand as \nhe said, \"As of tomorrow, Greece will go back to the negotiating table and our primary priority is to reinstate the \nfinancial stability of the country.\"\n\nBut  Greece's creditors were not necessarily in the mood for that return to negotiations in short order.\n\nCertainly, it was hard to envision Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis sitting across the table from other European \nleaders  days after he labeled the Euro zone strategy as \"terrorism\"  for  productive talks.\n\nJeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group,  signaled disapproval -- and a tacit warning -- over the \nreferendum result, which he characterized as \"very regrettable for the future of Greece.\"\n\nGerman  Deputy Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel,  poured metaphoric cold water on the Greek government's plans for \nfresh deal-making, noting that negotiations with Greece were now  \"difficult to imagine.\"  The German deputy leader \nalso excoriated Greek Prime Minister Tsipras and the Syriza government for leading the Greek people along  \"a \npath of bitter abandonment and hopelessness.\"\n\n\n\nThe night of July 5, 2015, in Greece was marked by a mix of jubilation and defiance. But even as the Syriza \ngovernment of Greece and its supporters celebrated their referendum triumph, the reality was that there were \nserious and pressing financial challenges to be addressed.  Of significance was the fact that the Greek banking and \nfinancial system  was in dire need of an infusion of emergency funds -- and it was not clear that those funds would \nbe available from the European Central Bank.\n\nGreece's banks have for some time been insolvent and reliant on the European Central Bank's  emergency liquidity \nassistance program,  but it was to be seen if on July 6, 2015,  the European Central Bank would provide enough \nliquidity to rescue the Greek banking system from collapse, or, if it would simply hold  emergency funding  at the \nexisting  restricted level.  Should Greece seek funding from an external entity outside the domain of the European \nCentral Bank, Greece  would be  delivering the message that it was exiting the Euro zone.\n\nAnother option would be the creation of a parallel currency at an unknown conversation rate, which would be used \nto get the banking sector and economy moving again, and to pay salaries and pensions.\n\nBut that path would ultimately come with extraordinarily high cost of living perils  -- quite likely in the form of \nexpensive and even unaffordable imported food, medicine, oil products, and other such vital items.\n\nIn the hours following the overwhelming \"no\" vote, it was clear  that Greece was effectively wading  into uncharted \nterritory.  A meeting of the European Commision was scheduled to take place on July 6, 2015, to consider \nimmediate actions.\n\nPost-Referendum Developments --\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the referendum, Greece was eager to return to the negotiating table with a \nstrengthened hand.\n\nTo that end, the Greek government insisted that it was ready to talk to creditor institutions the day after the \nreferendum.\n\nBut Germany was in no mood to be responsive.  Indeed, Greece made it clear that there was no basis for moving \nforward with talks in the immediate future, and instead indicated that it would be up to Greece to advance a new \nproposal.  German Chancellor Angela Mekel said, \"It will be important tomorrow that the Greek prime minister tells \nus how things should proceed and what precise suggestions he can submit to us for a medium-term program that \nwill lead Greece to prosperity and growth again.\"\n\nJeroen Dijsselbloem, the  head of the Euro group of finance ministers, warned that any proposal from Greece would \nhave to include serious reforms as he said, \"For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are \ninevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities.\"  French President Fracois Hollande issued a \nsimilar message, as follows: \"It is now up to the government of Alexis Tsipras to make serious, credible proposals \nso that this willingness to stay in the eurozone can translate into a lasting program.\" That message even emanated \nfrom the Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy, whose own country was suffering from a debt crisis, as he said \nthat assistance for Greece \"has to be accompanied by responsibility.\"  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte issued the \nsharpest warning, as he declared that Greece would have to implement  \"deep reforms\" if it wanted to remain in the \nEuro zone.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile,  German Chancellor Merkel was set to meet with French President Hollande to discuss the Greek \nconundrum on July 6, 2015, with meetings between Euro zone finance leaders the day after,  and a full summit of \nall Euro zone leaders later in the same week.\n\nFor the German government, there was a political consideration to be made as Germans grew increasingly \nfrustrated by Greek leaders who had  demanded rescue funds while insulting Germany.  For the German citizenry, \nthe message was clear: Europe was not just about Greece.\n\nPerhaps congnizant of the previous poisonous negotiating climate,  Greece moved to make some changes in \ngovernment.  Significantly, the controversial Finance Minister Varoufakis resigned and was replaced by Euclid \nTsakalotos, a  British-educated\n\nprofessor of economics.  While this change would likely be welcomed by negotiators who found Varoufakis difficult \nand, at times, bombastic, it should yet be regarded as a change in style and not substance.  Tsakalotos was \nrestrained in manner and thus a contrast to the flamboyant motorcyclist, Varoufakis, on the issues; however,  there \nwas little daylight between the two men.  In fact, Tsakalotos has been regarded as the intellectual \"grandfather\" of \nSyriza's radical lefitst policies, which embrace inclusion in the European body while eshewing capitalism.\n\nMeanwhile, despite claims from the Greek Syriza government that banks would open after the referendum, in fact, \nbanks in Greece remained closed in the days after, and capital controls remained in place.  With Greek banks \nrunning out of money, the  European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would maintain emergency  support at \nexisting levels; however, with more collateral needed to secure that emergency lending, the actual amount of \nmoney available to the banks remained quite limited.\n\nFor its part, the government of Greece was yet to advance a formal  slate of proposals as the first week of July \n2015 came to a close, and just ahead of the European zone summit in Brussels (Belgium).  In the hours prior to \nthat summit, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras met German Chancellor  Merkel and French President  Hollande, but \nafter that meeting, there was no change in the negotiating landscape despite the urgency for Greece to strike a \ndeal.  As noted by Merkel,  \"We still do not have the basis for negotiations... it is not a question of weeks anymore, \nbut a question of a few days.\"\n\nNote:  On July 7, 2015, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present fresh proposals needed to secure a \nrescue deal with creditor institutions.  The Euro zone also announced that a full European Union summit including \nall 28 member states would be held on July 12, 2015.\n\n\"Grexit\" avoided with new deal; new agreement filled with harsh austerity measures and major compromises for \nGreece --\n\nAhead of the  July 11, 2015, meeting of Euro zone finance minister and the July 12, 2015, summit of the European \nUnion, Greece  put forth a new proposal aimed at garnering rescue funds and averting a \"Grexit.\"  That new  \nproposal essentially sought  53.5 billion euro (just over US$50 billion) in loans as part of a three-year bailout \npackage.  Additional rescue funds brought the total package to least 74 billion euros in value  (US$83 billion).  In \nreturn, Greece would move forward with reforms, including spending cuts, sales tax increases, unified VAT rates, \nprivatization measures,  and  controversial changes to Greece's ultra-generous pension program, which  has been \nconsidered \"off the table\" for the Greek government until this time.\n\n\n\nIn many senses, the Greek proposal was not particularly different from the package Greece's creditors offered in \nJune 2015, which Prime Minister Tspiras rejected and responded to by calling a referendum, as discussed above.  \nThe main difference was that this new blueprint called for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.\n\nAs such, Greece was insisting that its new proposal could not be understood as capitulation to creditor institutions.  \nFor his part, Greek Prime MInister -- for now -- was sounding the right tone.  He said, \"I am ready for an honest \ncompromise. We owe it to the people of Europe that want a united, not divided, Europe. We can reach an \nagreement tonight if the parties involved want it.\"\n\nIt was to be determined whether or not Greek Prime Minister Tspiras could garner parliamentary support at home to \nmove forward with negotiating the agreement.  It was also to be seen  if Greece's creditor institutions would be \namenable to this proposal, especially as regards debt forgiveness.\n\nThe answer to the first question came on July 10, 2015, when a majority of the members of the Greek parliament \nvoted in support of the deal. Prime Minister Tspiras actually lost the support of several members of his own Syriza \nparty, who refused to back the plan, denouncing it as further austerity.  Prime Minister Tspiras nonetheless gained a \nmajority parliamentary mandate in support of the proposal.\n\nThe answer to the second question was yet to be determined with many European governments at odds on the \nissue of how to deal with Greece.  France and Italy appeared committed to doing what was  necessary to keep \nGreece in the Euro zone.  Italian Prime Minister Matteo Rienzi said,  \"Now that Tsipras has made proposals \nsubstantially in line with the European requests, an agreement absolutely has to be reached.\"  He added,  \"You \ncan't humiliate a European partner.\"  But the hardline wing, led by Germany,  had a different view.  In fact, \nGermany was not keen to extend debt relief to Greece.  As plainly stated by German Finance Minister  Wolfgang \nSchaeuble:  \"Debt relief is impossible.\"\n\nDebt relief was not the only area of contention.  Some countries appeared  ready to accept a \"Grexit\" if only on a \ntemporary basis.  To this end, there were reports from Germany suggesting that the government of that country \nwanted to see Greece suspended from the Euro zone for a period of five years.\n\nWhile the five year \"time out\" was not expressly addressed by German Chancellor Merkel, she did make clear that \nher country was not prepared to accept \"any price\" to ensure  that an agreement was made.  Meanwhile,  still other \ncountries were hostile to the idea of negotiating with Greece.  One example was Finland, which was reported to be \ncompletely opposed to the notion of a bailout for Greece.  Another example was Slovakia, with Prime Minister \nRobert Fico advocating that Greece leave the Euro bloc.  He said, \"The Greeks would do best if they left the euro \nzone on their own, did their homework and then tried to come back. This is just torture for everybody.\"\n\nThe usual issues aside, there was an additional consideration -- the continuing deterioration of the Greek economy.  \nGreece's decision to walk away from an almost identical deal in June 2015 resulted in default, the closure of banks, \ncapital controls, and the stalling of commercial activity.  The result has been the exacerbation of an already-dire \neconomic crisis.  As noted by  Edward Scicluna, the finance minister of Malta, \"We were told that Greek debt was at \n125 percent but we are now being told that this debt has spiraled to 200 percent and that is alarming, raising even \nmore questions about its sustainability and a solution.\"\n\nThere was also widespread concern and skepticism over Greece's commitment to moving forward with  required \nreforms, with some finance ministers suggesting that the real problem was the \"trust deficit\" which had only \nwidened since Greece walked away from the negotiating table in late June 2015.  To this end, Finnish Finance \nMinister Alexander Stubb said, \"We need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality, and clear proof that those \n\n\n\nconditions will be implemented at the end of the day.\" He added, \"The conditionality presented by the Greeks is \nsimply not enough.\"\n\nRegardless, the discussions prevailed with all parties trying to find common ground.  As noted by\n\nJeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, \"It's still very difficult, but work is still in progress. The issue of \ncredibility and trust was discussed and also, of course, the financial issues.\"\n\nIn what could be regarded as a positive development, the full summit of all 28 European Union member states set \nfor July 12, 2015 was cancelled.  Since sanction by all 28 member states would be needed to force a \"Grexit,\" the \ndecision to continue negotiations among Euro zone leaders only was being seen as a reprieve of sorts for Greece.\n\nStill, all parties remained quite distant  in their positions and an actual deal remained elusive on July 12, 2015.  \nTime was running out and Greece  was increasingly desperate for an infusion of cash.\n\nIn addition to austerity measures, which were expected to be included in any new deal, there were other areas of \nconsideration.  Some of these demands were as follows:  the Greek parliament would also have to pass legislation \naimed at  ameliorating the bankruptcy code, protecting the autonomy of the statistics office, and automating \nspending cuts if the budget did not hit its intended targets.  It was to be seen if these elements would make it into  a \nfinal deal.\n\nMaking matters more difficult was the fact that hardliners had been  issuing additional demands.  Of note was the \ncall for veto power for creditor institutions over  relevant legislation,  the  transfer of approximately 50 billion euros \n(US$56 billion) of state assets to an independent company for sale, and the firing of  workers hired in violation of \nprevious bailout commitments.  For the hardliners, only with these provisions could  there by a foundation for a \nfresh bailout; however, it was unclear if these particular -- and controversial -- provisions would make it into a final \ndeal.\n\nFinally, on July 13, 2015,  following marathon talks in Belgium, Euro zone leaders agreed to provide Greece with a \nnew bailout  package to rescue that country from economic crisis.\n\nAs stated by  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker:  \"The agreement was laborious, but it has \nbeen concluded. There is no Grexit.\"\n\nThe new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively authorize and then institute a collection of \nstrict austerity measures by July 15, 2015.  These measures included - but were not limited to - increased taxation, \nameliorating the value added tax system, ameliorating the sustanability of the pension system, protecting the legal \nindependence of government fiscal data, and creating  a mechanism to automatically reduce spending if budget \ntargets are missed. In the long-term, Greece would have to substantially address pension reforms, enact market \nreforms and labor reforms including the modernization of collective bargaining rights, and  privatize the electrical \npower network.  A particularly controversial measure that made it into the deal was a demand that all draft \nlegislation related to Greece's economic health be reviewed by Greece's creditor institutions in what could only be \nunderstood as external oversight.\n\nOf significance was the fact that the Greek deal was contigent upon the activation of all these measures. A tranche \nof rescue funds would only be released if Greece passed the required legislation -- and the schedule for that \nrelease of funds would be aggressive since Greece was set to make a payment to the European Central Bank on \n\n\n\nJuly 20, 2015.  Without a  doubt, this long list of measures, and in particular, the hardline demands related to \nexternal oversight that made it into the final agreement,  were likely to be regarded as an affront to Greek \nsovereignty by nationalists.  It was abundantly clear that  creditor institutions were intent on delivering the message \nthat they now held the power.\n\nFor his part, Greek Prime MInister Tsipras suggested that the agreement foreclosed the possibility of an exit from \nthe Euro zone,  saying that \"the possibility of Grexit is in the past.\"  Tsipras admittted that  the deal was not optimal \nbut nonetheless excluded a controversial proposal to transfer of approximately 50 billion euros ($56 billion) of state \nassets to an independent fund.  However, that amount would be managed and used to recapitalized Greek banks.\n\nTo this end, Tsipras latched on to the fact that the fund would not be housed in Luxembourg as originally \nenvisioned, as he said,  \"The deal is difficult but we averted the pursuit to move state assets abroad.\"  He added,  \n\"We averted the plan for a financial strangulation and for the collapse of the banking system.\"  Tspiras also \nacknowledged  that the negotiations constituted a  \"tough battle,\" but his country had secured a \"growth package.\"\n\nIn fact, the European bloc would offer Greece 86 billion euros in financing over a period of three years -- an amount \nexceeding the total called for in the Greek proposal.  But the rescue funds would be contingent upon the long list of \ntough austerity measures, including pension program reforms and  increased taxation, discussed above.  As well, \nalthough Greece had sought debt relief, this agreement would consider -- but not guarantee -- the rescheduling of \ndebt payments, while stopping short of actual debt forgiveness or reduction.\n\nGreeks at home soon railed in outrage against these harsh  conditions, with some characterizing the proposed \nmeasures as \"punitive,\" and others casting them as the \"humiliation\" of Greece.  People took to the social media \noutlet, Twitter, to express their anger using the hashtag \"#thisisacoup.\"\n\nBut  Germany's leader reminded the world that Greece's standing was deeply tarnished not only by its poor \neconomic stewardship, but also its irresponsible negotiating stances ranging from insults to inconsistency.  As \nnoted by Chancellor Merkel, \"The situation is extremely difficult if you consider the economic situation in Greece \nand the worsening in the last few months, but what has been lost also in terms of trust and reliability.\"  Meanwhile, \nIrish Prime Minister Edna Kenny reminded Greece of the urgency of the situation as he declared, \"I'd like to see \nthem [the Greeks] demonstrating starting tomorrow in their parliament they're serious about implementing the \nchanges, legislative and structural, that need to be put in place. Every day that this goes on, the eventual solutions \nare more costly.\"\n\nGreek policymakers themselves were cognizant of those costs.  Daniel Munevar, an adviser to former Greek \nFinance Minister Varoufakis, said, \"The costs for Greece of staying in the euro are reaching a point where the \nbalance could favor Grexit.\" He added, \"The costs being demanded of Greece are so punitive that they are almost \nimpossible to meet.\"  Nevertheless, Greece signed onto the deal with an eye on averting economic crisis and a \nforced exit from the Euro zone.\n\nWhile Greece could be sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the \ncountry would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece \ncitizenry.\n\nPrime Minister Tspiras would have difficult task of selling the terms of the agreement to the rest of the Greek \ngovernment as well as the Greek citizenry as something other than surrender.\n\nNevertheless, by mid-July 2015, the Greek parliament had approved the austerity measures imposed by Greece's \ncreditor institutions despite the prime minister's own objections to the terms.  As stated by Prime Minister Tsipras \n\n\n\nahead of the vote in parliament, \"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek \neconomy, but I'm forced to accept them.\"  Apparently, the vast majority of Greek members of parlaiment agreed \nwith him.\n\nWhile this outcome could only be understood as a \"win\" for Prime Minister Tsipras, it should be noted that he lost \nthe support of dozens of members of parliament from his own Syriza party, and was instead supported by several \nopposition parties including the the center-right New Democracy party, the centrist To Potami party and the center-\nleft party, Pasok.\n\nAmong the Syriza defections were former Finance Minister  Varoufakis, who condemned the bailout package, \ncalling it as \"a new Versailles Treaty,\" and also Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labor Minister \nDimitris Stratoulis.\n\nIt should be noted that Prime Minister Tsipras soon enacted a cabinet shuffle, which included the sacking of all \nrecalictrant members of his party serving in cabinet and replacing them with more pragmatic individuals.  Among \nthose retaining a portfolio was  Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos.  There were also suggestions of early \nelections to be held later in 2015 -- presumably in response to the friction and divisions now emerging within Syriza.\n\nOutside parliament, violent clashes broke out between police and protesters who were angered by the notion that \nGreece would have to assent to the harsh reform agenda outlined by creditors.  As well, civil servants went on a 24-\nhour strike.  With some demonstrators using petrol bombs to attack police, security forces responded with arrests \nand tear gas in an attempt to quell the unrest.\n\nTo that end, the scene in Athens calmed down although the national mood remained sour.\n\nMeanwhile, people in other Euro zone countries were themselves skeptical of a continuing relationship with \nGreece.  To this end,\n\nthere were ratification votes in the offing  for the parliaments of several Euro zone member states.  But at the end of \nthe day, even the most hardline players such as Germany, Lithuania and Finland,  ratified the  move.  As such, the \nstage was set for Greece to commence talks aimed at securing  a new rescue package via the European Stability \nMechanism.\n\nAs well, Europe re-opened the door to funds for Greece.  While capital controls would have to be retained to \nprevent a so-called \"run on the banks,\" the scene in Greece improved as the European Central Bank increased \nemergency funding via its\n\nEmergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA)  program for the banks.  As well,  European Union finance ministers  \napproved  bridging loans aimed at keeping  Greece's finances  afloat and thus able to make pending payments to \nthe  ECB and the IMF.\n\nPolitical Ramifications of the Rescue Deal --\n\nIn August 2015, the domestic political landscape in Greece was fractious as Prime Minister Tspiras attempted to \nlimit the fallout within his  Syriza party rising from the unpopular debt deal with creditors.  Tspiras assured his party \nthat he would go no further than the reform measures expressly agreed to with the  Euro zone.  As noted by \n\n\n\nTsipras, \"I know well the framework of the deal we signed at the euro zone summit on July 12. We will implement \nthese commitments, irrespective of whether we agree with it or not. Nothing beyond that.\"\n\nOf course, for many Syriza members, those very measures were bad enough and a betrayal of the party's anti-\nausterity platform and core principles.\n\nFor the far-left flank, a bad deal was worse than no deal, and rather than surrender to the harsh terms dictated by \ncreditors for Greece to remain in the Euro zone, they preferred an exit from the bloc and a return to Greece's \ndrachma currency.  Of particular note was the vociferous denunciation of the bailout agreement by former Finance \nMinister Varoufakis, who has repeatedly accused Greece's creditors of violating  Greece's sovereignty.  In an  \ninterview with the German publication, Stern, Varoufakis said, \"It was a financial war.  Today you don't need tanks \nto beat someone. You've got your banks.\"\n\nFor his part, at a meeting of Syriza's central committee, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that the deal that was \nforged in mid-July 2015 was the best possible and was taken in order to avert a national catastrophe.  He said, \"We \nare telling the Greek people, loud and clear and with no remorse, that this is the deal we managed to bring to them \nand if there is someone who thinks that they could have achieved a better deal, let them come out and say that.\"\n\nWith the far-left hardliners continuing to make clear their objections to the rescue deal,  it was clear that a chasm \nwas growing within Syriza and one that could well grow into an ideological civil war of sorts.  With an eye on \ncontaining the dissention, the prime minister  called for an emergency Syriza summit to debate a strategy for the \nparty going forward. He also warned recalcitrant Syriza members of parliament that  if he could no longer hold a \nparliamentary majority, he would be forced to call snap elections.  That theoretical poll  could yield unpredictable \nresults.\n\nTechnical deal made as new deadline looms --\n\nBy mid- August 2015 a technical deal  was arranged with  the International Monetary Fund, the European Central \nBank, and the European Stability Mechanism, which would secure for  Greece  85 billion euro in funding, and thus \nenable that country to make its public payments now in arrears.  Most crucially, it would permit Greece to make a \npayment of three billion euros to the European Central Bank on Aug. 20, 2015. In exchange, Greece would have to \nimplement significant structural reforms to the Greek entitlement system, tax hikes,  and spending cuts.\n\nThe proposed agreement would have to be debated and approved by the Greece parliament.  With the Aug. 20, \n2015, deadline in the offing when the European Central Bank payment would have to be made, Prime Minister \nTsipras urged members of parliament to approve the technical agreement, stating in a letter:  \"The crucial nature of \nthe situation requires the immediate convening of parliament to proceed with the deal's approval and allow the \ndisbursement of the first installment.\"\n\nBut even with the  vote on the deal with creditor institutions hanging in the balance, Prime Minister Tsipras's Syriza \nparty  was ensconced in an acrimonious power struggle between the hardline anti-austerity advocates and the \npragmatists in the party not wanting to be responsible for taking the country into bankruptcy.\n\nThe dissonance  was yielding consequences as Parliamentary Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou -- a  Syriza member \nhostile to the deal -- ignored Prime Minister Tsipras' call for an accelerated schedule to vote on the bill ahead of a \nmeeting of euro zone finance ministers.  Instead, Konstantopoulou appeared intent on belaboring the legislative \nprocess by  advancing no shortage  of procedural objections.  Those objections, however, could not stop the vote \nfrom happening and ending favorable for the head of government.\n\n\n\nIndeed,  despite defections from within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras won a political victory  with \nsupport from the pro-Euro opposition parties.  As such,  the necessary legislation was passed to approve the deal.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tspiras has steadfastly defended his decisions, including his resolution to compromise \nwith creditor institutions. To this end, he said, \"I do not regret my decision to compromise. We undertook the \nresponsibility to stay alive over choosing suicide.\"\n\nPolitical dissonance gives way to fresh elections --\n\nWhile Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza \nhardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions.  As a result,  a breakaway contingent of Syriza \nmembers of parliament was growing with former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis urging that a new radical \nmovement be formed.\n\nA statement by Lafazanis and several other Syriza members read as follows: \"The fight against the new bailout \nstarts today, by mobilizing people in every corner of the country.\"\n\nWhile the statement did no expressly call for a party split, it nonetheless included the call for a  \"united movement \nthat will justify people's desire for democracy and social justice.\"\n\nThe Syriza government interpreted the statement  as a de facto declaration of independence and cast the move as \nthe final step in  Lafazanis' decision \"to choose a different path from that of the government and Syriza.\"\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tspiras defended the deal, arguing that he had no choice but to go down this road since \nthe Greek people  made it clear that they wished to remain in the Euro zone -- a goal that could not be achieved in \nany other way. Acknowledging the rebellion present within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras indicated \nthat he would seek a confidence vote later in August 2015 when the scheduled debt repayment to the European \nCentral Bank was made.  But the confidence vote could augur the end of Tsipras' tenure at the helm of this \nparticular government, as both the conservative opposition New Democracy party as well as the opposition \nSocialists (known by the acronym PASOK) respectively made clear that they would not back the head of \ngovernment.\n\nWhile opposition parties gave support to Tspiras to pass the bill needed to ratify the aforementioned deal for the \nsake of Greece, that goodwill did not extend to  the political fortune of a rival.\n\nBy Aug. 20, 2015, with a rebellion brewing within the Syriza party, Prime Minister Tspiras by-passed the confidence \nmotion and instead tendered his resignation, effectively paving the way for fresh elections.  In a nationally-\nbroadcast speech, he said, \"The political mandate of the January 25 elections has exhausted its limits and now the \nGreek people have to have their say.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the hard-left radical members of parliament from Syriza formed a breakaway group.  That group soon \nestablished its own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English)  and was composed of 25 \nmembers of parliament.\n\nIn this way, it was to be understood as the third  largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the \ncentrist To Potami and  the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led  by \nformer Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the \nrescue agreement and famously declared his desire to\n\n\n\n\"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"\n\nSince Tspiras' Syriza government  had been in power less than a year,  constitutional provisions required that the \nsecond-largest party in parliament be given the mandate to try to form a government.  With the conservative New \nDemocracy occupying the second most seats in parliament, they would likely be given that opportunity; however, it \nwas not clear they would be able to actually cobble together a coalition.  Ultimately, the mandate for forming a \ngovernment could be returned to the Greek president, who would then call for snap elections to be held.\n\nAssuming that an alternative government could not be forged,  then Sept. 20, 2015, was the likely date expected for \nfresh elections to be held in Greece.  That outcome loomed when both the conservative flank and the hard-left flank \nparties attempted to form new governments and failed.  As such, with  Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, \nVassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge, was named as the country's  caretaker \nprime minister.  Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until elections \ncould be held a month later in September 2015.\n\nRival parties were now refocusing their hopes, and looking at the elections as a  new opportunity that would end \nwith them taking the reins of power.  But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact \nthat Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership \nmandate.\n\nFor now, however, Greece had at least secured funding for the immediate future. This agreement, in truth, was just \na start to a difficult period of negotiations on how to deal with Greece's debt.  That debt agenda, realistically, could \nnot substantially be addressed without some degree of debt forgiveness -- but that was a bridge many of Greece's \ncreditors were not yet ready to cross.  Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when \nGreece's creditor institutions --  the European Commission, the European Central Bank,  and the International \nMonetary Fund -- would review the  implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.\n\nPrimer on second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece\n\nVoters go to polls in Greece in second parliamentary elections in 2015; will PM Tspiras and anti-austerity party \nSyriza be re-elected or will Greeks opt for another path forward?  Election results indicate decisive win for Tspiras \nand Syriza; coalition building to be the focus going forward: --\n\nSummary of Greek Landscape\n\nThe spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and \ndebt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue \nfunds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro \nzone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to \nbe submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to \nrein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have \nmade clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election \npromises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, \nthose demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.\n\nFaced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, \nwould give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European \n\n\n\nfinance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit \nthe Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; \nhowever, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus \nconcomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable \nseveral years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so \nclose to the June 2015 deadline.  That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its \nreform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.\n\nAs talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation \nabout either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek \nexit from the Euro zone.  Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a \nrescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default.  Instead, Greek Prime \nMinister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he \nurged fellow citizens to vote against it.  His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to \nGreece's leverage against its creditors.  Those creditors, however,  reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal \nwith them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur \ncatastrophic consequences for Greece.\n\nGreeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the \nGreek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as \nGreeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was \nnow effectively wading  into uncharted territory.\n\nWith a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new \nproposals for consideration.\n\nWith two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the  new slate of  proposals from Greece were \nessentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015.  A key distinction in  this new blueprint \nwas the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.\n\nFinally, on July 13, 2015,  a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached.  The new agreement \nmandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. \nThere were also harsh demands by hardliners  that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists.  It was apparent \nthat Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power.  The  good news for \nGreece was that the  full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" \nwould be held immediately.  But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of \nthe matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be \nunpopular with the Greece citizenry.\n\nTo that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government  of \ndisloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has \ntaken.  That attempt was not yielding desired results.  Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form \ntheir own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a \nparliamentary majority.  While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the \nmatter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary \nelections.  It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.\n\nPolitical dissonance gives way to fresh elections --\n\n\n\nWhile Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza \nhardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions.  As a result,  a breakaway contingent of Syriza \nmembers of parliament was growing with former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis urging that a new radical \nmovement be formed.\n\nA statement by Lafazanis and several other Syriza members read as follows: \"The fight against the new bailout \nstarts today, by mobilizing people in every corner of the country.\"\n\nWhile the statement did no expressly call for a party split, it nonetheless included the call for a  \"united movement \nthat will justify people's desire for democracy and social justice.\"\n\nThe Syriza government interpreted the statement  as a de facto declaration of independence and cast the move as \nthe final step in  Lafazanis' decision \"to choose a different path from that of the government and Syriza.\"\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tspiras defended the deal, arguing that he had no choice but to go down this road since \nthe Greek people  made it clear that they wished to remain in the Euro zone -- a goal that could not be achieved in \nany other way. Acknowledging the rebellion present within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras indicated he \nwould seek a confidence vote later in August 2015 when the scheduled debt repayment to the European Central \nBank was made.  But the confidence vote could augur the end of Tsipras' tenure at the helm of this particular \ngovernment, as both the conservative opposition New Democracy party as well as the opposition Socialists (known \nby the acronym PASOK) respectively made clear that they would not back the head of government.\n\nWhile opposition parties gave support to Tspiras to pass the bill needed to ratify the aforementioned deal for the \nsake of Greece, that goodwill did not extend to  the political fortune of a rival.\n\nBy Aug. 20, 2015, with a rebellion brewing within the Syriza party, Prime Minister Tspiras by-passed the confidence \nmotion and instead tendered his resignation, effectively paving the way for fresh elections.  In a nationally-\nbroadcast speech, he said, \"The political mandate of the January 25 elections has exhausted its limits and now the \nGreek people have to have their say.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the hard-left radical members of parliament from Syriza formed a breakaway group.  That group soon \nestablished its own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English)  and was composed of 25 \nmembers of parliament.\n\nIn this way, it was to be understood as the third  largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the \ncentrist To Potami and  the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seats respectively. Popular Unity was led  by \nformer Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the \nrescue agreement and famously declared his desire to\n\n\"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"\n\nSince Tspiras' Syriza government  had been in power less than a year,  constitutional provisions required that the \nsecond-largest party in parliament be given the mandate to try to form a government.  With the conservative New \nDemocracy occupying the second most seats in parliament, they would likely be given that opportunity; however, it \nwas not clear they would be able to actually cobble together a coalition.  Ultimately, the mandate for forming a \ngovernment could be returned to the Greek president, who would then call for snap elections to be held.\n\n\n\nAssuming that an alternative government could not be forged,  then Sept. 20, 2015, was the likely date expected for \nfresh elections to be held in Greece.  That outcome loomed when both the conservative flank and the hard-left flank \nparties attempted to form new governments and failed.  As such, with  Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, \nVassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge, was named as the country's  caretaker \nprime minister.  Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until elections \ncould be held a month later in September 2015.\n\nRival parties were now refocusing their hopes, and looking at the elections as a  new opportunity that would end \nwith them taking the reins of power.  But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact \nthat Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership \nmandate.\n\nFor now, however, Greece had at least secured funding for the immediate future. This agreement, in truth, was just \na start to a difficult period of negotiations on how to deal with Greece's debt.  That debt agenda, realistically, could \nnot substantially be addressed without some degree of debt forgiveness -- but that was a bridge many of Greece's \ncreditors were not yet ready to cross.  Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when \nGreece's creditor institutions --  the European Commission, the European Central Bank,  and the International \nMonetary Fund -- would review the  implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.\n\nGreek voters set to decide which party to reward with new mandate for government --\n\nParliamentary elections were  to be held in Greece on or around Sept. 20, 2015.  Of note was the fact that \nparliamentary elections had actually been held at the start of the year  on Jan. 25, 2015, and new elections were \nnot due until 2019.  As such, this early polling exercise should be understood  as a snap election.  Also of note was \nthe fact that this would  be the fourth Greek election to be held in less than three and a half years.\n\nAt stake would be the composition of the legislative branch of government.  In Greece, the unicameral \"Vouli ton \nEllinon\" (Parliament) was made up of 300 members who are elected by a system of reinforced proportional \nrepresentation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat constituencies; there is a three percent \nthreshold to obtain seats.  Members of parliament  are elected to serve maximum four-year terms although  \nelections may be called early.\n\nThe initial slate of parliamentary elections in January 2015 were dominated by the debt crisis rocking the country \nand were won by the anti-austerity and anti-bailout radical leftist party, Syriza, and led to Alexis Tsipras becoming \nthe new prime minister.  Despite the anti-austerity platform of Syriza, Prime Minister Tspiras was forced to \ncompromise with Greece's creditor institutions in order to secure rescue funding needed to keep the country \nfinancially afloat, while also maintaining Greece's membership in the Euro zone.\n\nThis second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections were expected to be dominated by the debt crisis solution -- \nspecifically, the rescue deal and all of its difficult provisions, which left anti-austerity absolutists in the Syriza \ngovernment in a state of revolt.\n\nIn fact, hardline rebels from Syriza soon  formed a breakaway group and established their  own political party \nnamed Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English).\n\nComposed of 25 members of parliament,\n\nPopular Unity held the distinction of being  the third  largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the \ncentrist To Potami and  the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led  by \n\n\n\nformer Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the \nrescue agreement and famously declared his desire to\n\n\"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with hardliners within Syriza splintering away from the party to form their own breakaway group, and \nwith a parliamentary majority now gone, Prime Minister Tspiras had resigned as the head of government and called \nfor fresh elections to be held.  Rival parties, including the conservative New Democracy and the newly-formed hard-\nleftist Popular Unity, tried to cobble together a replacement coalition government -- and respectively failed at that \ntask.  Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government was  returned to the Greek president, who  then dissolved \nparliament and called for snap elections to be held on Sept. 20, 2015.\n\nWith fresh elections ahead and Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate \nand a Supreme Court judge was named as the country's  caretaker prime minister.  Greece's first female prime \nminister would administer the country on an interim basis until the snap elections were held.\n\nNow, the rival parties were refocusing their goals and hoping that they would have a new opportunity at the polls to \ntake the reins of power.  But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras \nremained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate.\n\nIt was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity -- over 60 percent according to polls in mid-2015 -- would be enough to \nreturn him to power.\n\nPolling data at the end of August 2015 indicated that Syriza -- even with the defections from hardliners -- would \nlikely attract the most votes, although not quite enough to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tspiras made clear that if he had to form a future coalition government, he would not be \nlooking to either of the main etsablishment parties -- conservative New Democracy or the social-democratic \nPanhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) -- as likely partners.\n\nNew Democracy was on track to attract the second most votes, and would thus be in place to form a government if \nSyriza failed at that task.\n\nAs before, the far-right and neo-Nazi Golden Dawn as well as the centrist To Potami were attracting the middle tier \nof votes.  The newly-formed Popular Unity was in that middle tier.\n\nOn the other hand,  the Independent Greeks were at the bottom of the pack and were at risk of not meeting the \nthree percent threshold needed to enter parliament.  But a large segment of the Greek electorate remained \nundecided, meaning that the outcome of the elections promised to be a mystery to the end.\n\nBy the start of September 2015, the political landscape had changed and Syriza's advantage had eroded.\n\nMost polling data showed Syriza sporting only a neglible lead over the center-right New Democracy party.  A survey \nof several polls showed Syriza hovering around 26 percent with New Democracy close behing with 25 percent.  \nOther polls showed the two parties in a dead heat at 25 percent, while at least one poll gave New Democracy the \nlead.\n\nWith at least 10 percent of the Greek electorate undecided, the race could go either way.\n\n\n\nBy the second week of September, these types of polling numbers remained in place, showing Syriza  in a \nstatistical tie with New Democracy.\n\nIn mid-September 2015, with only days to go until election day,\n\nthere was a host of polling data -- none of it predictive of a conclusive election outcome.  Several polls showed \nSyriza with a small lead over New Democracy; a handful of polls reversed the dynamic with New Democracy  \nslightly leading Syriza.  The data collectively presented the picture of a close and competitive race with no one party \nlikely to win a majority.\n\nBut of significance was the addition of new survey data showing that New Democracy's leader , Vangelis \nMeimarakis, was gaining on Tspiras in terms of popularity.  Analysts were suggesting that his forthright persona \nwas resonating well with Greek voters eager for stability.\n\nNot one to squander this advantage, Meimarakis displayed his pragmatism when he declared that he was open to \nan alliance with Syriza in the interests of national unity.  By contrast, Tsipras has foreclosed such an alliance.\n\nSince the majority of Greeks -- now weary from divisive politics and socio-economic drama -- were actually looking \nfor cooperation, Meimarakis' stance was gaining him additional support.  It was to be seen if it would be enough on \nelection day.\n\nIt should be noted that the leaders of both  the center-right New Democracy and the radical leftist Syriza were \nindicating that they would both make good on the commitments by Greece to secure rescue funds, and move \nforward with the necessary structural reforms.\n\nNote: The main parties expected to contest the elections were as follows:  anti-austerity and radical leftist Syriza; \ncenter-right (sometime referred to as conservative) New Democracy; newly-formed, hard leftist, and anti-bailout\n\nLaiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English); ultra-right and neo-Nazi aligned Golden Dawn; centrist To Potami (or The \nRiver in English);  leftist Communist Party of Greece; right wing populist and nationalist  conservative Independent \nGreeks; leftist  and social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (known mostly by its acronym PASOK).\n\nElection results --\n\nVoters in Greece went to the polls for the second time in 2015 to vote in parliamentary elections.  As discussed \nabove, polling data predicted a close race; however, the outcome of this election would serve as a reminder that \npolls were not guaranteed forecasts.  When the ballots were counted, it was clear that Prime Minister Tsipras and \nhis radical leftist Syriza party were on track for victory.  Indeed, Syriza had outperformed the polling forecast and \nsecured close to 36 percent of the vote and around 144 seats.  The center-right New Democracy party was set to \ngarner 28 percent and about 75 seats. In third place was the xenophobic neo-Nazi entity, Golden Dawn, which took \nseven percent.\n\nThe rest of the votes went to other parties.\n\nAs expected, no one party won an outright majority.  That being said, the party with the plurality of the vote share -- \nSyriza in this case -- would be positioned to form a coalition government.  Having foreclosed the notion of a grand \ncoalition that would include the center-right New Democracy, Syriza would be looking to other smaller parties, such \n\n\n\nas the centrist To Potami, the socialist PASOK, or their former partners, the right-wing Independent Greeks,  to \ncontrol a majority of seats in parliament.\n\nWith the Independent Greeks on track to garner about 10 seats, Syriza could very well reconstitute the same \ncoalition it formed after the previous phase of parliamentary elections in 2015.  Such a coalition would now be more \nstable, given the defection of the most hardline and radical anti-austerity players from Syriza.\n\nVangelis Meimarakis, the leader of New Democracy,  conceded defeat gracefully and urged Tspiras to form a \ngovernment. He said, \"The electoral result appears to be concluding with Syriza and Mr. Tspiras in the lead. I \ncongratulate him and urge him to create the government which is needed and come to parliament.\"\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Tsipras' victory at the polls for a second time in less than a year stood as a vindication \nof his anti-austerity stance, and a national ratification of his pragmatic decision to accept the harsh terms of the \nbailout in order to keep Greece solvent and in the Euro bloc.  Moreover, Tspiras' victory at the helm of Syriza also \nsignaled a renewed mandate for his leadership.\n\nIn his victory speech before cheering crowds in Athens, Prime Minister Tspiras said, \"In Europe today, Greece and \nthe Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity, and this struggle will be continued together for \nanother four years. We have difficulties ahead, but we are also on firm ground.  We wont recover from the struggle \nby magic, but it can happen with hard work.\"  He added, \"Together we will continue the struggle we began seven \nmonths ago.\"\n\nGoing forward, Greece would not only have to fulfill its obligations to international creditors, it would also have to \ndeal with the unfolding refugee crisis affecting all of Europe.\n\nPrimer on 2019 parliamentary elections in Greece\n\n(July 7, 2019)\n\nSnap parliamentary elections in Greece were held in July 2019. Since the previous elections of 2015, Greece was \ngoverned by Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras and the left-wing populist Syriza party. It was to be seen if Tspiras and \nSyriza would be able to hold onto power after governing on an anti-austerity platform.\n\nOnce Greek citizens went to the polls and cast their ballots, it was clear that Greece was following a trend of \nEurope moving in a rightward direction. To this end, the conservative New Democracy party won Greece's snap \ngeneral election, handing a defeat to leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who conceded defeat.\n\nFactoring in the fact that Greece gives the winner 50 extra seats in parliament, projections on election night had \nNew Democracy winning an outright majority. New Democracy captured approximately 39.8 percent of the vote with \nTsipras's leftist party, Syriza, coming in second with 31.6 percent.\n\nNew Democracy's pro-business leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was set to be the next prime minister. The party ran on \nlowering taxes, generating economic growth, and privatizing services throughout the country.\n\nTsipras came to power in 2015 by campaigning on a platform to end austerity and Greece's international bailout \nagreement, although he was ultimately forced to accept a bailout worth $100 billion as a result of pressure from the \nEuropean Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the prospect of \"Grexit\" (i.e. leaving the Euro currency). \nEver since then, support for Syriza had gradually waned since. Combined with rising unemployment and the \neconomy being a fraction of its former size when the debt crisis began, the conditions were ripe for Syriza's ouster.\n\nThe international bailout program for Greece ended in August of 2018, which meant Greece could self-finance \nagain and use financial markets to fund its activities.\n\n\n\n-- July 2019\n\nWritten by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman, Editor in Chief, www.countrywatch.com .
