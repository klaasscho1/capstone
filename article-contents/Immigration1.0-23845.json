Do we really have to fully reimburse \neverything ? Aren't there some excesses ? Macron said on September 25.\n\nSpeaking during the debate in the National Assembly, Philippe said the government had \"not achieved all (its) \nobjectives\" on migration and that the French asylum system today is \"saturated.\"\n\nPhilippe said France had seen 123,000 asylum applications in 2018, an increase of 22% compared to 2017.\n\nThe focus on immigration ahead of French municipal elections in 2020 has prompted concern from the French left, \nwith Socialist politician Luc Carvournas arguing that the rhetoric was poached from the far right.\n\nCarvournas said that recent statements on immigration drew comparisons with Italy, where Matteo Salvini, the \nhead of the La Liga party and until recently Minister of the Interior, has been outspoken in his opposition to \nimmigration and asylum.\n\nMacron has also been criticised by the far right, with National Rally leader Marine Le Pen accusing the president of \nusing immigration to win votes in next year's election.\n\nSource: Euronews\n"}
