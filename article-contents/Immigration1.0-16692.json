Seventeen people were in the truck -- \ntwo women, 14 men and a boy, Preston said. \n\n Deputies had been chasing the truck, but broke off pursuit before the accident. \n\n Five people died at the scene of the 11-car crash Saturday, and one victim died later at a hospital. Of the 15 \ninjured, one person was on life support and six were in critical but stable condition, Preston said. \n\n James Lee, 74, and Emilia Lee, 71, of Huachuca City, were killed when the pickup hit their car and several others \nafter swerving to avoid tire-damaging spikes placed on the road by police. The other four people who died were in \nthe pickup; their names had not been released Sunday. \n"}
