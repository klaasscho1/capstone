{"title": "Political Conditions Israel", "body": "\nBackground\n\nIsraeli politics and political conditions at large have been strongly influenced by two seemingly contradictory forces: \nthe Jewish people's long history of persecution and repression, culminating with the systematic killing of about six \nmillion Jews during World War II. In contrast to -- but paradoxically also as a consequence of -- the Holocaust \nstands the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and its continued controversial relationship with the Palestinian \npeople. The haunting memories of the Holocaust and the conflicts between Israel, its neighbors and the \nPalestinians, have profoundly shaped Israeli society, psyche and politics.\n\nIn addition to a rough and markedly unfriendly neighborhood, Israeli society is also formed by strong and divisive \ndomestic fault lines. Domestic Israeli politics runs along at least two major lines. The first cleavage runs between \nreligious and secular Jews, and focuses on the role of religion in Israeli society. Several Israeli governments have \nbeen marred by conflict over religious schools and ultra-orthodox Jews' demands for the exemption from taxes and \nmilitary service. This line also incorporates the conflict between the settlers and the more secular Jews. Also, an \nethnic-economic divide is present between the better off American and European Jews (Ashkenazim), and the \npoorer North African and Middle Eastern Jews (Sephardim). Internal friction and differences in Israeli society has \nstrongly influenced the Middle East peace process.\n\nThe Peace Process\n\nOver the last several years, the peace process has gone through faces of progress and recess. Efforts to reach a \nMiddle East peace settlement have customarily been are based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n242 and 338. In October of 1991, a historic meeting was held in Madrid, Spain, between Israeli, Lebanese, \nJordanian, Syrian and Palestinian leaders, to discuss the notion of \"land for peace.\" In addition to the Madrid \nSummit, another track of negotiations were held in Oslo, Norway, which led to significant breakthroughs on the \nmatter of peace. This set of negotiations and agreements came to be known as the Oslo Accords.\n\nThen, on Sept. 13, 1993, Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization signed a Declaration of Principles \n(DOP) establishing an ambitious set of objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim \nPalestinian authority, which would augment self-government. The Interim Agreement, which included the details of \nthe previous agreements, was signed on Sept. 28, 1995, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nBy 1997, a crisis of confidence occured as Israelis complained of the Palestinian failure to crack down on Islamic \nfundamentalists, while Palestinians pointed to the expansion of current, and an increasing number of new, Israeli \nsettlements in the Occupied Territories. At a meeting at the Wye River in Maryland in 1998, efforts were made to \nresolve some of these issues raised by both parties, and also to move toward permanent status negotiations.\n\nThe Palestinians quickly ratified the 1998 Wye River Agreement, but the process was delayed by debate in the \nIsraeli cabinet. Due to Israel's preoccupation with security concerns, the Israeli cabinet finally ratified the agreement \non Nov. 12, but attached several conditions, condemned by both the Palestinians and the Americans. While \nagreeing to release Palestinian activists, Israel required that the Palestinian cabinet guarantee reforms of its charter \nbefore they would move ahead with implementing the agreement. The Israelis also made it clear that they would \nconcede no more than an additional one percent of the territory in future agreements, far less than the Palestinians \nhad demanded. On the Palestinian side, significant efforts were made to arrest Islamic militants, but the conditions \nplaced on the agreement by the Israeli cabinet generated much concern among Palestinians and the United States \nregarding the future of the peace process.\n\nBy early December 1998, the peace process was again at a stalemate. Although the Palestinians had removed the \nanti-Israel statements from their charter, Israeli troop withdrawals were not proceeding according to the Wye River \nAgreement, primarily because Prime Minister Netanyahu had demanded that the Palestinians meet several \nadditional conditions before withdrawing Israeli forces. In addition to security measures such as locating and \nincarcerating more alleged terrorists and confiscating weapons in Palestinian-administered areas, Netanyahu also \ndemanded that the Palestinians agree to not declare their own state.\n\nThe Palestinians viewed these additional \"security measures\" as a stalling tactic, and accused Prime Minister \nNetanyahu of bowing to the wishes of hard-line elements in his governing coalition. The Netanyahu government \nmaintained that the Palestinians were not fulfilling the agreed-upon security measures and suspended \nimplementation of the Wye River Agreement. In late December, the Israeli cabinet voted to uphold Netanyahu's \ndecision to suspend the agreement.\n\nThe Knesset, for its part, voted against Prime Minister Netanyahu's policy toward the Palestinians and the 'peace \nprocess,' and in favor of dissolving parliament and holding early elections. The peace process was put on hold \nduring the campaigns leading up to the May 17, 1999, parliamentary and prime ministerial elections. In the race for \nprime minister, Ehud Barak of the Labor Party soundly defeated Netanyahu, garnering 56.2 percent of the vote to \nNetanyahu's 43.9 percent. Netanyahu resigned his leadership of the Likud Party and retired from politics, and was \nreplaced by hard-liner Ariel Sharon.\n\nBarak pieced together a coalition comprised of smaller parties; in particular the third largest party in the Knesset, \nthe ultra-orthodox Shas. After more than six weeks of wrangling, in late June 1999, Barak formed a coalition \ngovernment providing him with a 69-member majority government. Prime Minister Barak faced the daunting task of \nreviving the Middle East peace process (or, more accurately, peace processes), stagnant since December 1998, \nand balancing the often contradictory demands and ideologies of his parliamentary and governmental coalition \nmembers. On the domestic scene, Barak suffered severe setbacks for his coalition. Several ministers resigned, and \nBarak's presidential candidate, Shimon Peres, was defeated by Likud hard-liner, Mosche Katsav. Barak also faced \na no-confidence vote in the last day of the Knesset's summer session.\n\nIn the region, Arab leaders, including Palestinian Executive Yasser Arafat, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, \nSyrian President Hafez al-Assad, and Jordanian King Abdullah, reacted with cautious optimism to Barak's election. \nBarak met personally with all of these leaders except Assad, and also traveled to the United States to meet with \nPresident Clinton. Barak stated that he was ready to resume discussions with Syria and wished to pursue peace in \nthe Middle East on multiple fronts. In the initial period of Barak's government, hopes were high for the unfolding of a \ntrue peace process in the Middle East.\n\nThe Syrian track of the Middle East peace process was shortly revived in January 2000, with Syrian-Israeli \nnegotiations held in the United States. Despite the efforts put in on both sides, the negotiations did not bring the \nparties to a final agreement. Not even a meeting between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and American \n\n\n\nPresident Clinton in Geneva in March 2000 saved the process. The coming to power of Bashar al-Assad in June \n2000, after his father's death, has so far seen little new developments on the Israeli-Syrian track. The young Assad \ncontinues his father's policy of insisting that all territory occupied in the 1967 war should be returned.\n\nBarak campaigned on a promise to withdraw Israeli forces from south Lebanon within a year of his election. The \nwithdrawal was widely expected to take place in the end of June/ beginning of July. Due to heavy Israeli losses in \nthe 'security zone' in the beginning of 2000, and following low morale within the Israeli supported South Lebanon \nArmy, the occupation ended hastily on May 25. In July, U.N. troops deployed in the area, but no final agreement on \nthe border between the two countries, and hence no comprehensive peace agreement, has been signed. The \nborder continued to be an area of minor clashes and tensions.\n\nThe Palestinian track under Barak saw two major negotiation efforts and agreements. In September 1999, an \nagreement was signed in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm al-Sheik. Israel promised more transfer of land, and the \nrelease of Palestinian prisoners in return for further security guarantees. The agreement set a Feb. 13 deadline for \nthe negotiation of a framework agreement on Jerusalem. However, the stalemate continued, the hand-over of land \nwas delayed, and another deadline passed. In March, Arafat stated that he would declare a Palestinian state by \nSept. 13, 2000 regardless of the status of the negotiations.\n\nIn July 2000, Camp David was again the place for crucial Middle East negotiations. Then, nearing the end of \nPresident Clinton's term, the Americans sponsored marathon negotiations and hoped to see a final agreement \nbefore President Clinton left office in January 2001. Despite the enormous efforts and energy all parties put into the \nnegotiations, the meetings did not produce an agreement. Progress was made in three of four core issues: water, \nrefugees and borders, but Jerusalem proved an issue of such symbolic and religious value to both parties, that no \nagreement could be reached. However, for the first time, the Israeli side opened up for possible suggestions on the \nfuture of Jerusalem.\n\nInternational pressure led the Palestinians to postpone their self-imposed deadline for the proclamation of a \nPalestinian state, but Arafat stated that he would unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian state by the end of \nthe year. On Sept. 26, 2000, Barak and Arafat met for the first time since Camp David, and their chief negotiators \nwere on their way back to Washington to continue negotiations.\n\nThe al-Aqsa Intifada and its Effects\n\nIn clear contrast to the optimism generated after Camp David, events unfolding since have taken the future of the \npeace process into the bleak unknown. On Sept. 28, Likud leader Ariel Sharon visited the sacred site Temple \nMount/ Haram al-Sharif (Holy Sanctuary) in Jerusalem. The visit sparked angry protests by Palestinians-disgruntled \nwith the lack of improvement in their daily lives since the Oslo Agreement and the progress of the peace process as \na whole-viewing the hawkish Sharon surrounded by police and bodyguards at the Muslim holy site as a clear \nprovocation. The day after Sharon's visit, Israeli soldiers opened fired on angry demonstrators after the Friday \nprayer at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Five Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded. This event \nsparked the worst violence the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen in years.\n\nAlmost daily since, clashes between stone-throwing Palestinian crowds and Israeli soldiers firing rubber-coated \nbullets and live ammunition have wounded and killed protesters and soldiers, as well as onlookers and innocent \ncivilians-including children. Continuous clashes and images of 12-year old Palestinian Mohammad al-Durrah being \nshot dead in his father's arms and the lynching of two Israeli soldiers by an angry Palestinian mob, set peace and \nreconciliation efforts many years back.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly issued several resolutions condemning Israel's excessive use of force, while \nan Arab League meeting in Cairo issued a clear condemnation of the Israeli acts, but failed to satisfy radical Arab \nstates' call for war and sanctions. A United States-led meeting between Arafat and Barak in Sharm al-Sheikh in \nOctober only produced a statement calling for the end of the violence, but failed to stop the violence on the ground. \nThe Palestinian representatives demanded an international investigation into the violence and international \n\n\n\npeacekeepers disposed to the region. Failing that, Israeli and Palestinian authorities agreed on establishing a \"fact-\nfinding mission\" whose mandate was to study the causes of the violence. Former United States Senator George \nMitchell was chosen to head the international commission.\n\nThe failure to end the violence and the continuation of the \"al-Aqsa Intifada\" provided the background for the calling \nof early prime ministerial elections in Israel in February 2001. Likud leader Ariel Sharon campaigned on a promise \nto bring Israel security within 100 days, and profoundly beat his opponent Ehud Barak by winning 62.4 percent of \nthe votes. The election garnered the lowest voter turnout in Israeli history, less than 60 percent, partly a result of the \nmajority of Arab-Israelis boycotting the election. Also, the more than 70,000 blank ballots cast indicated genuine \nfrustration with the situation as well as both candidates in the entire Israeli society.\n\nAriel Sharon pieced together his new government based on a shaky coalition with former Labor Party Prime \nMinister Shimon Peres as foreign minister. However, other members of the Labor Party refused to take part in the \nSharon-government. Ehud Barak stepped down as leader of the Labor Party, and withdrew from political life in \ngeneral.\n\nInternational response to the election was lukewarm, and Arab governments viewed the election of Sharon with \ndisgust and fear. The Arab world holds Sharon responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacres in Beirut, and \nSharon's military and political career (in the Israel Defense Forces and his position as Minister of National \nInfrastructure responsible for the expansion of Israeli settlements in the mid-1990s) has done little to improve his \nreputation as a ruthless fighter and politician in the Arab world.\n\nSharon struggled to deliver on his election promise of security. The \"al-Aqsa Intifada\" put Israel and the occupied \nterritories a warlike situation, and the situation has only worsened under Sharon's leadership. On April 16, Israeli \nfighter-jets bombed a Syrian radar installation on the Beirut-Damascus highway in Lebanon, in retaliation for the \nkilling of an Israeli soldier in the disputed Shebaa farms area. On April 17, Israeli forces for the first time sent \ntroops into Palestinian-controlled areas, and tanks, missile boats and helicopter gun-ships pounded Palestinian \nAuthority buildings on the Gaza strip. The day after, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell marked the re-\nentry of the new American administration to the conflict, by calling the Israeli incursion excessive and \ndisproportionate.\n\nOn May 19, a suicide bomber killed five Israelis in a shopping-mall in Netanya. Israel responded by using \nAmerican-made F-16 fighter-bombers to bomb Palestinian towns. At the end of May, the international commission \nexamining the causes of the conflict released its report. The Mitchell Report concluded that both parties should \ncease fire immediately. It called on the Palestinian Authorities to take all measures possible to prevent terrorist \nattacks, and arrest Islamic fundamentalists, while Israel was asked to freeze the building of settlements \nimmediately.\n\nOn June 1, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 21 Israeli teenagers queuing in front of a Tel Aviv disco. The calls for \nrevenge and counterattacks were only subdued by international pressure for restraint, and to follow the suggestions \nlaid out in the Mitchell report. However, Israeli and Palestinian authorities were under pressure of extremists in both \ncamps, and the situation became increasingly serious and tense. CIA director George Tenet was sent to the region \nto negotiate a truce. Under immense international and Israeli pressure, Arafat accepted an unconditional ceasefire. \nIn contrast to the Mitchell report, the Tenet-brokered agreement asked for a conditional ceasefire from both parties, \nbut did not require a simultaneous freeze on settlement building.\n\nIsrael's government showed cracks in its unity over the response to the Mitchell report. Hard-liners such as Avigdor \nLieberman, the Minister of Infrastructure, warned that the government would fall apart if the Mitchell report was \naccepted by Prime Minister Sharon. Both Israeli and Palestinian authorities faced fierce domestic opposition, and \nthe suspicion that both parties accepted the Tenet ceasefire for tactical reasons loomed in the background. To no \none's surprise, the Tenet brokered ceasefire did not hold.\n\n\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians have since been involved in a seemingly never-ending and game of fatal reciprocity. On \nthe Palestinian side, gunmen have targeted what they claim are legitimate targets-Israeli soldiers and settlers \noccupying Palestinian land. Suicide bombers have regularly killed Israeli civilians, in response to Israeli \nassassinations of Palestinian military leaders, and incursions into Palestinian areas. Israel has continuously \nstressed that it would not negotiate under terror, and has demanded a period of 'complete calm' before it will return \nto the negotiating table. This has not happened, and another twist in the vicious cycle of violence turned in the latter \nmonths of 2001.\n\nOn August 9, a suicide bomber killed 15 Israelis in Jerusalem, and another bomber wounded 15 people in an attack \nin Haifa three days later. At the same time, Israel took over nine Palestinian institutions in occupied East Jerusalem \nincluding Orient House, the de facto political Palestinian headquarter in the city.\n\nThe terrorist attack on the United States on September 11 was condemned by both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict. However, the new international climate did not seem to impact the conflict. In the week after September 11, \nthe Israeli army killed 28 Palestinians and mounted 16 incursions into Palestinian Authority areas. Arafat declared a \nceasefire on all fronts, and expressed readiness to join the American coalition against terror. On September 24, \nIsrael established a 32 kilometer long \"closed military zone\" along the northern border of the West Bank in order to \nprevent suicide bombers to cross into Israel proper.\n\nOn October 17, the Israeli Minister of Tourism, the outspoken ultra-nationalist and right-winger Rechavam Zeevi, \nwas assassinated by Palestinian gunmen in a Jerusalem hotel. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \n(PFLP) claimed responsibility. As a response, Israeli troops reoccupied six Palestinian-controlled towns, killing \nsome 50 people in the process. In the end of October, Western pressure brought about the withdrawal of the \nsymbolically important city of Bethlehem, the birth place of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn November, both the United States president and the secretary of state held speeches outlining United States \nMiddle East policy, signaling a change from the hands-off policy that the Bush administration had hoped it could \nadopt to the region. On Nov. 10, President George Bush for the first time endorsed the idea of a Palestinian state in \nhis speech to the United Nations General Assembly. On November 19, Secretary of State Colin Powell outlined the \nadministration's Middle East visions in a speech to college students in Kentucky. Powell promised active \nengagement in the peace process, and announced the dispatchment of a former marine general, Anthony Zinni, \nand a veteran Middle East diplomat, William Burns, to the region with instructions of not returning until a ceasefire \nhad been established. Nevertheless, no concrete suggestions on how to get the negotiations restarted were \nprovided.\n\nThe Palestinians were pleased to hear the United States call for an end to occupation -- consistent with United \nNations resolutions 242 and 338 -- but did not like the fact that they were being required to act immediately, while \ndemands on Israel were more vague and without deadlines. In Israel, Sharon's cabinet called the American \nspeeches constructive, but continued to insist on seven days of complete quiet before a formal ceasefire can begin. \nIsraeli leftists and Palestinians see this claim as a way to defer negotiations indefinitely.\n\nDespite the arrival of Zinni and Burns, the violence continued with almost daily confrontations and killings. On \nNovomber 23, Hamas' military leader, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, was assassinated by Israeli forces. He was wanted \nfor planning several suicide actions inside Israel.\n\nDecember, the month celebrating the season of hope and peace for the region's three main religions Islam \n(Ramadan), Judaism (Hanukkah) and Christianity (Christmas), heralded all but hope and peace to the holy land. \nInstead a new round of suicide-bombers and Israeli retaliation effectively ended the peace process.\n\n\n\nIn a dramatic development, events in December 2001 brought the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to an all-time low, \nbordering on the verge of war. In retaliation for the killing of Abu Hanoud, three Hamas-members blew themselves \nup in two separate actions in Jerusalem and Haifa on December 1 and 2, killing 26 Israeli civilians and wounding \nmore than 250.\n\nIn response, Israeli bulldozers plowed the runway on Gaza airport and Israeli fighter-jets bombed Palestinian \nauthority buildings. International condemnation of the suicide-bombers and Arafat's lack of action, came without the \nusual balancing calls for Israeli restraint, and paved the way for the heaviest Israeli bombardment and actions in \nGaza and the West Bank in the 14-month-long Intifada.\n\nTight closures were imposed on several Palestinian towns, and Israeli troops, on several occasions, incurred into \nPalestinian areas and arrested suspects. Symbols of the Palestinian Authority (PA), including the control tower at \nGaza Air Port and PA offices and police stations, were destroyed. Arafat himself was held in virtual house arrest \nwith Israeli tanks surrounding his offices in Ramallah.\n\nOn December 12, Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli bus near the Emmanuel settlement in the West Bank, \nkilling 10 people. The al-Aqsa brigades, the armed faction linked to Arafat's Fatah Party, claimed responsibility and \nsaid the attack was revenge for the killing of four Fatah fighters in Gaza the day before. A worrying development, \nthe attack resembled the tactics used by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and showed greater organization, tactical \nskills and determination than before. Israel answered with new attacks on Palestinian Authority symbols, including \nthe Palestinian Authority's radio transmission tower.\n\nIn addition, a new uncompromising line was announced with an Israeli cabinet resolution stating that Arafat was no \nlonger relevant for the state of Israel and effectively breaking off all ties between the Israeli government and the \nPalestinian Authority. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and his Labor Party ministers left the Israeli cabinet in protest, \naccusing Sharon of trying to bring about the downfall of the Palestinian Authority, and questioning their place in the \nfrail coalition government.\n\nInternational observers found it difficult to identify the logic behind Sharon's aggressive policy. By weakening Arafat, \nit was speculated that Sharon would like to see the Gaza and West Bank divided into small cantons, leaving the \nIsraelis to deal with local Palestinian leaders, and hence retain full control. Critics argued that this was not likely to \nhappen, and that if Arafat went, what might come after him was bound to be more radical and nationalistic.\n\nIn his first television speech in a month, Yasser Arafat on December 16 pledged to rein in militants, stop the suicide \nactions, and called for a return to peace negotiations. Arafat claimed to have arrested 180 Islamist militants, and \ncriticized the Israeli military actions for undermining Palestinian attempts to impose order and arrests suspected \nmilitants. Israeli reactions to the speech was that only action, not words, counted as meaningful. The speech was \nwelcomed by leaders of Jordan, Egypt and France. The United Nations envoy to the Middle East, Terje Rod-\nLarsen, said the speech was one of the most important Arafat had ever given, and marked a potential turning point.\n\nA serious Palestinian political toll of the ongoing Intifada was the reduction of Arafat's personal and institutional \nauthority. The activities of fundamentalist, opposition groups such as Islamic Jihad, Hamas, al-Aqsa Brigades and \nPopular Resistance Committees have gained support among a large majority of the Palestinian people. The poverty \nand confinement has bred a generation of radicals, and the occupied territories have become cradles for martyrs. \nOn the Israeli side, the \"peace camp\" has been increasingly frustrated and disillusioned, while the most extremist \nhawks have been calling for an all-out war.\n\nIn addition to the appalling human toll, the Intifada extracted a heavy economic one. In 2001, a report released by \nthe United Nations reported unemployment in the Palestinian territories at 38 percent, the rise of absolute poverty \nhad risen by 50 percent, and the reduction of Palestinian GDP by a stunning 50 percent. The cost of caring for the \n\n\n\n20,000 Palestinians injured in the course of the Intifada was estimated at over $2 billion. In addition comes the cost \nof damage to property. Over the course of the conflict, Israel has withheld the payment of more than $50 million in \ntaxes to the Palestinian Authority. An international aid-package was put together in order to prevent total collapse of \nthe Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe Israeli economy  suffered losses as well. Many Israeli businesses employ Palestinians who had not made it to \nwork for long periods, and in the volatile situation foreign investment and tourism had been reduced.\n\nDevelopments in 2002\n\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2002, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon held discussions with various leading Palestinian \nofficials. Since the start of the Palestinian Intifada against the Israelis, no such discussions ocurred due to ever-\ncontinuing violence between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Also surprising was the fact that Sharon suggested that \nthere would be follow-up meetings in the weeks to come, after he returned from a visit to the United States.\n\nThese developments were hailed as highly unexpected since Sharon frequently asserted that he would not \nnegotiate with the Palestinian leadership until there was a sustained cease-fire. Indeed, since September 2000 \nwhen the Intifada began, there have been over 1,000 deaths and no sign of sustainable peace. The developments \nwere particularly ironic given the fact that Sharon made very polemical remarks earlier in the week regarding his \nregret that he had not killed Arafat in 1982 during the invasion of Lebanon when he had the opportunity to do so. \nMany observers suggested that Sharon may have been ensconced in discussions with leaders he viewed as the \nsuccessors to the post-Arafat Palestinian Liberation Authority.\n\nIn the next months, Palestinian suicide bombers attacked Israelis in various urban centers. Meanwhile, Israeli \nforces surrounded Palestinian territories and villages, even destroying the homes of some Palestinians believed to \nhave ties to terrorist organizations such as Hamas. They also attacked Palestinian Liberation Authority property, \nincluding the destruction of Yasser Arafat's helicopters and launch pad, and the Palestinian media building, \nreportedly because it regularly broadcasted stories that allegedly incited violence. These efforts were launched \nagainst Palestinian interests, according to Sharon's government, because Arafat was unable to stop the ever-\nincreasing violence by the likes of suicide bombers.\n\nThe discovery of a ship in the waters off Israel, supposedly with arms and munitions, originating from Iran and \nbound for Arafat's store of weaponry only served to bloster the conviction of the Sharon government that Arafat was \nin league with terrorists. Still, to date, Arafat has denied any involvment in such activities. Meanwhile, Arafat was \nliterally confined to his quarters in Ramallah, some say in a form of \"house arrest\" by the Israeli government, \nbecause of the increasing doubt about Arafat's credibility and effectiveness in negotiating the peace process. \nArafat, for his part, did, indeed, attempt to crack down on Islamic militants, arresting more than 100 people, \nincluding the spiritual leader of Hamas. Public outcry by the Palestinian populace, however, destroyed any \nsustained effort on the part of Arafat to continue these measures.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 2002, Israeli forces launched an offensive against suspected Palestinian militants by raiding two \nrefugee camps in Balata and Jenin, reportedly because the camps had become safe havens for militants indulging \nin alleged terrorist activities. The raids, which began overnight, involved house to house searches and the breaking \nof walls between adjoining buildings, in order to minimize contact with Palestinian militants in the area. As a \nconsequence of the were the first of this sort of operation since the Intifada began.\n\nThe operation came on the heels of another episode of violence the day before when a female Palestinian suicide \nbomber blew herself up at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. The suicide bombing wounded three Israeli \npolicemen as well as the two Palestinians who apparently accompanied the bomber.\n\n\n\nPalestinian militants threatened to retaliate against Israelis in the occupied territories; they also demanded that the \nIsraeli forces pull back their forces from the camps. Marwan Barghouti, the head of Yassar Arafat's Fatah \nmovement, described the on-going operations by Israeli forces in Balata and Jenin as a massacre. Both Barghouti \nof Fatah, as well as representatives of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade (the group that claimed responsibility for the \nsuicide bombing at a checkpoint the day before), called for retaliation. Later, in April 2002, Barghouti was himself \narrested by an elite Israeli army unit in Ramallah on charges of being responsible for numerous terror attacks in the \nregion. Previously, in 1996, Barghouti was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council with overwhelming support \nand at one point, launched a campaign against human rights abuses by Arafat's own security services and \ncorruption among his officials.\n\nAs Israeli-Palestinian tensions escalated, and as Israeli and Palestinian representatives discussed security issues \naimed at decreasing the level of tension, an international effort was launched to end the violence. The effort was led \nby Javier Solana, the European Union's (EU) foreign policy chief, and the peace plan itself was proposed by Saudi \nArabia's Crown Prince Abdullah. Central to Crown Prince Abdullah's peace proposal was the idea that Israel should \nwithdraw from the occupied territories to the pre-1967 borders and sigh a peace deal with the Palestinians. In \nreturn, Israel would be granted full diplomatic relations with all Arab states, as well as trade relations and security \nguarantees. The proposal would also offer Arab recognition of the state of Israel. The Israelis, including Israeli \nForeign Minister Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, were cautiously optimistic in their assessment of \nthe Saudi plan, which Crown Prince Abdullah presented at the Arab summit in the next month.\n\nThe issue of the occupied territories -- a central component of the Saudi peace proposal -- has become increasingly \ncontentious. Although Israeli harliners do not consider the return of lands acquired during wartime to be negotiable, \nIsraeli peace activists have long expressed the need to withdraw from the occupied territories. They have \nspecifically suggested that the high death toll among Israeli army personnel has occurred because these officers \nhave been charged with protecting Israelis who chose to live in so-called \"occupied\" areas.\n\nIn a related matter, hundreds of Israeli army officers signed a petition expressing their refusal to fight \"beyond \nIsrael's Green Line (Israel's pre-1967 border) for the purpose of dominating, expelling, starving and humiliating an \nentire people.\" Other soldiers and activists said that they were thinking of taking a similar position on the West \nBank and Gaza. The signatories of the original petition stated that many of their new duties, such as guarding \nroadblocks, and protecting Jewish settlements in occupied territories (land occupied by Israel in 1967), had very \nlittle to do with the security of the state of Israel, and instead, were for the sole purpose of dominating the \nPalestinian people.\n\nAlthough their refusal (as stated in the original petition) was expressed in patriotic terms, some critics suggested \nthat the only reason the petition was created was because many of the soldiers reaching their second round of \nservice saw no end in sight to the Intifada. Certainly, it is true that many of the officers served on the front lines of \nthe conflict. Regardless of their motivation, however, the petition and its sentiments are illustrative of an increasingly \nvocal segment of the Israeli population, who are tired of endless violence and conflict. A poll conducted for Israeli \nradio suggested that 31 percent of Isrealis supported the officers' petition and their perspectives therein. Indeed, its \ncirculation appeared to have revitalized the efforts of Israeli peace activists who have been less apparent on the \ncountry's landscape since the start of the Intifada.\n\nNevertheless, attacks by Palestinians against Israeli targets intensified in February and March 2002, spurring \nretaliation by Israeli forces. Indeed, attacks at roadblocks and checkpoints became regularized fare. For example, \nan Israeli police officer and two Palestinians were wounded in a battle on the Maccabim-Modi'in roadblock close to \nthe border with the West Bank.  Also, on February 19, 2002, six Israeli soldiers were killed in a checkpoint shooting \nnear the West Bank city of Ramallah.\n\n\n\nOn March 2, 2002, in the orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Beit Israel in Jerusalem. In this attack, a Palestinian \nsuicide bomber killed nine people, including several children and an 18-month old baby. The suicide bomber \nappeared to have targeted people as they filtered onto the streets at the end of the Jewish Sabbath. More than 57 \npeople were wounded in the attack.\n\nOn March 3, 2002, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a checkpoint killing seven Israeli soldiers and two civilians \n(some reports suggest that 10 people in total were killed), and wounding some 14 other people. The shooting took \nplace at an Israeli army roadblock near the Palestinian village of Silwad and the Jewish settlement of Ofra, near \nRamallah, according to reports. Another Israeli soldier died in hospital on that same day, after coming under fire \nnear a checkpoint at Kissoufim, between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Another three soldiers were injured as well.\n\nIsrael responded to the Jerusalem suicide bombing with missile attacks on targets in Bethlehem. There, a \nPalestinian government building and a weapons factory were hit. Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority had \ncondemned the suicide bombing, however, many Palestinians celebrated the news of more Israeli deaths, in some \nways, numbing the effects of Arafat's condemnation. Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, the al-Aqsa Brigade, \nclaimed responsibility for the bombing. The group said it was a response to Israel's unprecedented assault on two \nWest Bank refugee camps the previous week, which left more than 20 Palestinians dead.\n\nOnly days after, on March 6, 2002, following Israeli cabinet meetings concerning the upsurge in violence, Israeli F-\n16 warplanes attacked Palestinian targets in the West Bank city of Ramallah. In these assaults, Israeli air power \nattacked the headquarters of Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in retaliation for several attacks by Palestinian in the \nprevious week. In this way, the most intense Israeli army assaults on the West Bank and Gaza Strip were launched, \nsince the start of the Intifada.\n\nAs a new cycle of violence rapidly accelerated, the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was said to be \nappalled by the rising death toll due to Israeli-Palestinian assaults, as well as what Annan called their \"increasingly \naggressive rhetoric.\" These sorts of expressions have come on an almost daily basis as the bloodshed from attacks \nand reprisals have increased to the point at which one cannot be distinguished from the other.\n\nThroughout March 2002, Israel continued to pound Palestinian targets in a concerted air campaign, in conjunction \nwith extensive ground operations, aimed at fighting against terrorist attacks. Indeed, there was a spate of bombings \nand shootings in various cities across Israel. Meanwhile, United States envoy, Anthony Zinni, was expected in \nIsrael to facilitate a truce mission. Two such previous missions by Zinni ended unsuccessfully.\n\nIn late March 2002, another terrorist suicide attack ensued, which left 20 people dead in a seaside town of Natanya \nat Passover. The militant group, Hamas, claimed responsibility. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called for an \nimmediate and unconditional cease-fire. His efforts, however, were not well-received by the Israelis, who dismissed \nhis offer. An Israeli spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon noted that this initiative on the part of Arafat \nwas the 10th cease-fire declared, and as such, Israel did not intend to take Arafat at his word.\n\nFor his part, Arafat stated that he was willing to immediately implement the Tenet Plan, which was the blueprint for \na truce, drafted by United States CIA director George Tenet. The Tenet plan was intended to be the foundation for \nthe implementation of the Mitchell Report , a peace plan which was itself drawn up by former United States Senator \nGeorge Mitchell. (Tenet's entry into the Midde East peace process, as well as Mitchell's key role in this regard, are \nmentioned above.) Only days earlier, the Israelis appeared to have had some cautious interest in the Middle East \n\"land for peace\" proposal offered by Saudi Arabia (also discussed above), which was approved and sanctioned at \nthe Arab Summit in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n\n\nThe latest attack, called the \"Passover massacre,\" however, put an effective end to any such truce. Indeed, even as \nArafat put forth his offer of a cease-fire, yet another terrorist attack ensued as a Palestinian militant shot and killed \nthree people in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of the West Bank. Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, \nnoted that the resolution on the Saudi peace proposal remained a promising prospect, however, no such proposals \ncould be entertained unless there was an enduring cease-fire.\n\nThe Israeli army thus began a massive military operation against Palestinian targets in the last few days of March \n2002. By April 1, 2002, Israeli efforts were intensifed in the West Bank, in an apparent effort to deal with the threat \nof terrorism. In Ramallah, intense gunfire occurred in the downtown area of the city between Israelis and \nPalestinians, while an anti-aircraft gun fired at various office buildings. Other structures, including a hospital, were \nsearched by Israeli forces. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that his country was at war with terror. In the \nface of international criticism about the military offensive against the Palestinians, the Sharon government insisted \nthat it was not pursuing the Palestinian people, but rather, it had targeted terrorists and the terrorist infrastructure. \nPrime Minister Sharon, however, was categorical in his assertion that the terrorist attacks were directed by \nPalestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon contended that Arafat was -- and is -- the head of a coalition of terrorism, \nwhich operates an infrastructure of terrorism.\n\nYasser Arafat's Ramallah compound, which the Israelis said was part of the terrorist infrastructure, had been under \nattack from March 29, 2002, and for several weeks after, with Arafat himself confined within the compound. It was \nalleged that large numbers of weapons were found at the compound. The Sharon government stated that the \nassault in Ramallah would be followed by action against various terrorist enclaves, such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, \nand the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nEven amidst these aggressive actions against organizations deemed to be involved in terrorist activities, Sharon \nmaintained the view that he was open to peace talks, and he even entertained the possibility of discussing the \nnewly-proposed Saudi peace plan. Sharon also expressed the idea that new or already-existing peace plans and \nproposals could ensue without the involvement of Arafat, whom he considered to be an irrelevant element of the \nMiddle East quagmire. Sharon, like many other officials in the Israeli government, noted that they were not \ninterested in killing Arafat, but rather, in confining him. The ultimate result of such confinement, however, was not \nknown.\n\nDespite the presence of Israeli tanks, the firing of gunshots, and Palestinian gunmen in Arafat's compound, a \ncollection of international journalists and peace activists were able to march into the headquarters and conduct an \ninformal and unscripted interview with Arafat. In the interview, Arafat asserted that he would remain in his \nheadquarters, even though his life was at risk. Indeed, he stated that he would die a martyr if the Israelis decided to \nkill him. The group of impromptu visitors observed that Arafat was surrounded by approximately 10 of his advisors, \nand that he seemed to be of the opinion that as the person under seige, the end result of the assault and \nconfinement were not up to him. When asked about why he had not uttered a declarative statement regarding the \nspate of attacks and bombings against Israelis in recent days, Arafat said that he already made several statements \ncondemning the attacks, and that he had done everything posssible to stop them.\n\nAs the violence in the Israel increasing due to a combination of attacks and military assaults, the Israeli government \nclosed down the West Bank and ordered all international journalists to evacuate the area. Regardless, many reports \nof injuries to civilians and journalists occurred. Journalists, cameraman and peace activists from Western countries \nwere shot and injured close to a refugee camp in Beit Jala on the West Bank, with other incidences ocurring in \nRamallah.\n\nWith all international news focused on the events in Israel, on March 30, 2002, the United Nations Security Council \nheld an emergency session. At the session, the Council adopted Resolution 1402 calling on Israel to withdraw \ntroops and tanks from Palestinian areas and urging both parties to work toward an immediate and lasting cease-\n\n\n\nfire. The Council's actions were aimed at resuming negotiations, implementing the Tenet truce, and thusly, moving \ntoward the Mitchell Peace Plan. The Council also restated its previous Resolution 1397, which called for an \nimmediate stop to all acts of violence, terror, provocation, incitement and destruction.\n\nThe United States, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, was part of the unanimous vote adopting \nResolution 1402. As terrorist attacks by Palestinians occurred with frequency in Israel, United States President \nGeorge Bush condemned them as acts of terrorism. Bush also noted that Arafat was required to stop these attacks, \nand that Israel should do whatever was needed to protect its homeland from terrorism. Palestinian leaders argued \nthat the Palestinian people were merely acting in self-defense against 35 years of illegal occupation by another \ncountry and since they lacked the sophisticated army and weaponry that Israel has (which some say is largely \nfunded by the United States), suicide bombings are a desparate attempt to \"fight back.\" The Bush administration \nlater expressed the view that although suicide bombers were to be viewed as terrorists, it did not apply the \n\"terrorist\" label to Arafat because of his past efforts to negotiate on behalf of peace.\n\nIn this way, the Bush administration sidestepped the perception of inconsistency on its much-repeated stance that \nthose who harbor terrorists are terrorists themselves. Subsequent comments from the Bush administration \nsuggesting that Israel's situation was not the equivalent of the United States position on terrorism also appeared \ninconsistent with previous statements (noted just above) that seemed to provide tacit approval to Israel's offensive \ninto Palestinian areas. White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer however, denied that any such tacit approval was \nprovided. The Bush administration also attempted to move further away from its apparent approval of Israel's \nincursions into Palestinian areas by urging Sharon to keep the possibility of peace alive. President Bush also \nexpressed the view that Sharon remained committed to following through with the Tenet and Mitchell plans.\n\nUnited States Senator Joseph Lieberman stated that much bolder and more intensive measures were required from \nthe Bush administration in dealing with the Middle East conflict. He observed that the gravity of the situation \ndemanded the attention of United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, rather than envoy Anthony Zinni. Other \nUnited States senators, such as Arlen Specter and the Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, Joseph Biden, \nalso urged the Bush administration to be more deeply involved in resolving the conflict.\n\nIn the background of these political machinations lay the routine incidences of violence. On Sunday, March 31, \n2002, a suicide bombing in the diverse port city of Haifa killed approximately 14 people and injured over 33 \nindividuals. A group associated with Hamas, called Izzedine al Qassam, claimed responsibility for the attack. Only \nhours after this incident, four more people were wounded in a suicide bombing near the Jewish West Bank \nsettlement of Efrat. In this way, in only a matter of days since the Passover massacre, more than 40 Israelis were \nkilled and more than 100 were wounded.\n\nThe number of Palestinians killed or wounded in those days were sketchy, however, reports suggest that about 350 \nPalestinians were killed. There have also been several reports of gunfire against Palestinian demonstrators. In late \nMarch 2002, troops fired tear gas and stun grenades against a few hundred Palestinian women protesting against \nthe closure of the West Bank. Several people were injured including the well-known Palestinian politician Hanan \nAshrawi. On April 1, 2002, in Tulkarem, masked Palestinian militants shot and killed at least 11 Palestinians \nsuspected of collaborating with Israel. The militants burst into the building where Palestinian intelligence officers \nwere holding these suspected collaborators and shot at them.\n\nWith the international community demanding more intensive engagement from the United States in resolving the \ncrisis in Israel, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell was finally dispatched to the region for talks with \nvarious leaders. No resolution was projected as a result of the meeting.\n\n\n\nMore armed conflict continued in the area of Palestinian refugee camps, around Nablus and Jenin. Inhabitants of \nthe camps were told to leave their homes as Israeli forces intended to use force to move through the camps, \nhowever, some reports indicate that people were too scared to leave their homes for fear of being shot. \nAmbulances were unable to take injured people to hospitals due to movement restrictions and gunfire.\n\nMeanwhile, since the start of Israeli incursions into Palestinian areas, a group of Palestinians took refuge in \nBethlehem's Church of the Nativity. Included in the group were Palestinian civilians as well as militants; Catholic \nand Orthodox priests in the church refused to leave the compound, for fear that the sacred church would be \ndestroyed. A stand-off between the Palestinians inside and the Israeli military outside went ensued for weeks. On \nApril 30, 2002, a number of people, including 26 Palestinians, exited the church. Each Palestinian who left the \nchurch was escorted by a monk and upon exit was taken into Israeli custody. The Israeli army speculates that about \nhalf of these 26 Palestinians were members of Palestinian security forces, however, none are thought to be \nmembers of an armed militant group, which originally entered the church at the beginning of April. Remaining in the \nchurch were a number of police, civilians, monks and nuns, as well as the militant cadre, who were still ensconced \nin the standoff.\n\nOn May 10, 2002, the stand-off at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity ended when the 13 militant Palestinian \nfighters left the church and were taken into custody, and bound for exile. The other individuals in the church, \nincluding several monks and civilians were also able to finally leave the church. The 13 militant fighters, who were \non Israel's \"most wanted\" list, were sent to first to Cyprus, under the conditions of a European-brokered agreement \nwith Israeli authorities. From Cyprus, they will be taken to various third country destinations. Meanwhile, Israeli \ntroops retreated from Manger Square. These events brought the 38-day standoff to a close.\n\nMeanwhile, in late April 2002, following allegations of massacres during the Israeli offensive in the Palestinian \nrefugee camp at Jenin, the United Nations Security Council authorized a fact-finding mission via its Resolution \n1405. The mission was aimed at acquiring as much accurate information as possible on the humanitarian situation \nin the Jenin camp, where an extensive death toll had been reported. Any progress on the mission was at first halted \nwhen Israeli officials declared that the exercise was not intended to find facts, but, instead, to \"set up\" the Israelis \ninstead in the eyes of the international community. Their resistance to the inquiry only served to fuel suspicion \nabout the situation in Jenin. To the dismay of much of the world, the fact-finding mission was ultimately disbanded \nlargely because of Israel's refusal to co-operate. This angered not only Palestinians but many other nations, who \nbelieve Israel had violated international law by blocking huminatarian aid from reaching people in need.\n\nFollowing the hiatus, when independent journalists, international observers and researchers were finally allowed \ninto Jenin, they determined that the actual death toll was around 50 people, and not in the thousands as had been \noriginally alleged. The human rights group, Human Rights Watch, notes that although they documented only 52 \ndeaths, these deaths included 22 civilians, and appeared to have been committed willfully in some cases. Other \ninternational observers noted evidence of war crimes committed by the Israelis and alleged Israel had ample time \nto \"clean up\" its actions by the time such groups were allowed in the region. Israeli officials vociferously denied such \nallegations. No final judgement on the situation in Jenin can be offered due to competing reports.\n\nOn May 1, 2002, Israeli officials stated that their forces would withdraw from Arafat's compund in Ramallah, the \nsiege would end, and Arafat would be given some degree of freedom to move within the Palestinian territories. \nArafat, however, would not be promised passage back into Palestine, should he choose to travel elsewhere.\n\nOn Tuesday May 7, 2002, a suicide bomber blew himself up on the third floor of a building in the suburb of Rishon \nLetzion, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, killing 15 people and seriously wounding 50. The explosion also resulted in the \ncollapse of the ceiling. The suicide bomber carried a suitcase up the three floors of the building, which had no \nsecurity because most patrons were generally known to one another. An individual from the militant group Hamas \n\n\n\nclaimed responsibility for the attack via telephone. Several hours later, a second suicide bomber attempted to \ndetonate himself at Megiddo Junction near the city of Haifa. Reports suggest that his target was actually a group of \nsoldiers standing at a bus stop in close proximity to the junction.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, on a trip to the United States, blamed Palestinian Authority leader Yasser \nArafat for the attack and promised retaliation. For his part, Arafat offered an almost-immediate condemnation for the \nattack. His comments did not assuage doubts about tacit Palestinian approval for such attacks against Israeli \ncivilian targets.\n\nIn mid-May 2002, a controversial development over the issue of Palestinian independence and autonomy ensued \nwhen Israel's Likud party voted against the establishment of a Palestinian state. The issue was brought to a vote by \nBenjamin Netanyahu, the formidable rival of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n\nAt the end of May 2002, the Israeli army arrested a number of Palestinian militants - including a local commander of \nthe militant group Hamas - in a fast and sudden incursion into the West Bank town of Jenin. The incursion occurred \nin the aftermath of an earlier suicide attack in which a Palestinian suicide bomber killed two Israelis (including one \nbaby), and injured more than 30 others in the town of Petah Tikva just outside Tel Aviv. Israeli tanks and \nhelicopters, soon re-entered Jenin. Clashes with Palestinian gunmen ensued and one Palestinian was reportedly \nkilled in the exchange of gunfire. This incursion into Jenin by Israel follows one that was enacted a month prior.\n\nIn a controversial ruling, the Palestinian Authority's High Court ordered the immediate release of a prominent \nsuspect in the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi last October (noted above). The court in \nGaza declared that there was no evidence linking Ahmed Saadat, the leader of militant group Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine (PFLP), to the murder. While Israel criticized the ruling and promised its own justice for the \nPFLP leader, the militant group celebrated the verdict and asked for the release of another four PLFP members \nbeing held. The court verdict case posed a dilemma for Arafat. If he abided by the verdict he faced the ire of Israel, \nbut if he ignored it, his credibility among Palestinians might be damaged.\n\nIn early June 2002, Israeli armed forces raided a refugee camp near Nablus and arrested approximately 500 men \nbetween the ages of 15 and 50. Israeli tanks also rolled into the Palestinian town of Qalqilya, in order to conduct \nhouse-to-house searches.\n\nOn June 10, 2002, Israeli tanks again surrounded the Ramallah headquarters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, \nand Israeli officials arrested 27 Palestinians, most of whom were policemen. The raid came before Arafat's \nscheduled cabinet meeting. The day before, Arafat announced the reduction of his cabinet, appointed a general to \noverhaul the security forces, and promised new elections in the Palestinian Authority. The changes were made \npresumably in response to calls for reform of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nDespite these changes, United States President George W. Bush stated that he was not willing to set a timetable \nfor the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite pressure from Arab leaders in this regard, and indeed, he has \nexpressed skepticism that Arafat is the right person to lead the Palestinian cause. Although he subsequently put \nforth a peace proposal that included the establishment of a Palestinian state three years down the road, he \nmaintained his view that Palestinian leadership must be reviewed.\n\nIn mid-June 2002, Israel began the construction of a controversial new security fence to try to stop Palestinian \nmilitants crossing into its territory. Reports say the fence will be electrified and will have devices to detect any \nmovement on it. Sharon claimed construction of the fence was necessary to halt the wave of suicide attacks in \nIsraeli cities and towns. Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat accused Israel of seeking to divide Palestinian \nterritories into small cantons and establishing a divisive system, similar to apartheid in South Africa.\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of calm, there were two bloody suicide bombings in Israel in mid-September. Another siege of \nYasser Arafat's Ramallah complex then ensued, leaving Arafat and about 200 of his aides and security detail \nimprisoned in a wing of his offices. The Israeli government stated that it wanted to question 50 men, who were \napparently among the 200 people confined in the office wing. The Israelis were hoping that Arafat would produce a \nlist of all the 200 persons trapped in the building. Arafat, however, refused to comply with that request. Saab Erekat, \nArafat's chief negotiations officer, met with Israeli military officials, in hope that they would offer a list of the 50 \nwanted men. He was also hoping to arrange political and security discussions with the Israeli authorities, which \nwould ideally include the participation of the United States. Both of these goals are not likely to be realized.\n\nDespite international calls for the Israeli military to withdraw from the area of Arafat's complex, the Israelis remained \nin place. Some reports suggested that an Israeli flag was planted in the area of the complex. Nevertheless, the \ndestruction of Arafat's compound stopped following an international outcry. The Israelis seem prepared to wait out \nthe process and allowed Palestinian representatives and leaders to meet and discuss proposals aimed at ending \nthe siege and meeting Israeli demands. They also insisted that their intention was not, at all, to hurt Arafat. \nMeanwhile, thousands of Palestinians protested the siege in the streets of major Palestinian areas. Analysts \nsuggest that although the Sharon government repeatedly describes Arafat as \"irrelevant,\" their actions against \nArafat suggest a different perspective on the Palestinian leader.\n\nThe Palestinian-Israeli situation turned grim when the Israelis killed nine Palestinians in a siege in the Gaza Strip \nseveral days later. Tanks, armored vehicles and helicopter gunships arrived in Gaza City only hours after Israeli \nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon determined that military attention should shift from Arafat's complex in Ramallah to the \nGaza area, which is the power center of the militant Islamic group, Hamas. Much speculation emerged noting that \nthe raids in Gaza came after the Israeli media criticized Sharon for focusing attention on Arafat instead of Hamas, \nwhich has been the source of many suicide bombings over the last two years of the Intifada (uprising). Indeed, \nHamas was responsible for one of the two most recent suicide bombings in Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli government suffered quite a blow at the United Nations when the Security Council adopted a \nresolution demanding an end to the siege. Notably, the United States abstained from voting on the resolution. The \nBush adminsitration observed that Sharon's current siege was \"unhelpful\" to the cause of Palestinian institutional \nreform and long-term peace possibilities. Also included in the text of the resolution was a call for the Palestinian \nAuthority to bring those responsible for the suicide attacks to justice.\n\nFinally, after 10 days of being under siege, Arafat was finally allowed to exit the complex. Despite the Israeli pull-\nback from the complex, however, Israeli forces remained in place in nearby areas, and a curfew was issued for the \ncity of Ramallah. Nevertheless, it has been widely reported that international pressure, in conjunction with the threat \nof resignation from the Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, contributed to the Israeli decision to end the siege.\n\nA week later, in the wake of Israeli incursions in the Gaza Strip, approximately 14 civilians were killed. The \nincursions were launched by the Israeli army in order to destroy the terrorist infrastructure in the area where \nexplosives and bomb-making equipment had been discovered. The militant group, Hamas, promised revenge for \nthe deaths of the 14 individuals, noting that such deaths must be punished with equivalent deaths. As such, the \ncycle of violence is almost certain to continue.\n\nBy the fall of 2002, in an Intifada lasting two years, close to 2,000 people had been killed, and more than 20,000 \npeople wounded, the large majority of them Palestinians. The plurality of Palestinians killed, however, should not \nobfuscate the devastating toll on Israelis as well. In terms of sheer numbers, less Israelis have been killed than \nPalestinians, but when one considers the diminutive size of the Israeli population, it is clear that terrorist attacks on \nthe Israeli civilian population has been terribly devastating.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations strongly criticized both Israeli and Palestinian authorities for their human \nright standards in general, and their actions in the latest round of violence in particular. Back in March 2001, the \nAmerican State Department accused Israel of committing \"serious human-rights abuses.\" Israeli human rights \norganizations express concern about judicial inaction and public apathy toward breaches of human rights during the \ncurrent violence. Likewise, Palestinian security services receive harsh criticism for continued cases of torture, \narbitrary arrests, and prolonged detention without charge or trial. Death sentences have been issued by military and \nstate security courts after short and grossly unfair trials.\n\nPolitical climate in late 2002 through early 2003\n\nIn mid-October 2002, violence erupted between civilians and the military when a group of Jewish settlers defied the \nIsraeli government and illegally re-occupied an area in the West Bank. Although Israel's Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon was typically known to support settlement construction, in this particular case, he decried the attacks on the \nIsraeli military as well as the unnecessary violence. The situation was creating further cleavages in his already \nfragile coalition government, some of whom warn of resulting civil instability. Certain cabinet ministers also \nthreatened to resign from cabinet, most notably, Defense Minister Ben-Eliezer, who ordered the settlements to be \ndismantled, in the long term best interests of Israel.\n\nThen, in late October 2002, six of the Labor Party's members who were part of Sharon's coalition government \nresigned, including Defense Minister Ben-Eliezer and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The Labor Party members' \nexit was prompted by Sharon's failure to secure approximately $145 million from the budget for jobs and social \nservices. Sharon and other members of his cabinet wanted the funds to go toward Jewish settlements -- a measure \nwhich the Labor Party members strenuously opposed. For Labor Party members, there was the belief that \neverything had been done militarily to deal with terrorism and security concerns, while at the same time, nothing \nhad been offered to help Israel's poor, or to revive the peace process. Moreover, many Labor Party members \nbelieved that further Jewish settlements have only served to exacerbate the conflict and violence between Israelis \nand Palestinians.\n\nThe Labor Party resignations effectively dissolved Sharon's majority and as such, he was compelled to court other \nparties' support in order to restore his majority in government. In this regard, reports suggested that Sharon was in \ndiscussions with the ultra-nationalist National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu Party, which tends to align itself with the \ninterests of Sharon's rival within the Likud party, Benjamin Netanyahu. Sharon was also in discussions with other \nright-wing and religious parties for coalition building purposes. It is difficult to discern whether or not any of these \nparties have any interest in joining Sharon's coalition. Sharon may have to tried to govern with a minority \nadministration, however, he was faced with a non-confidence vote, which was called by the left-wing Meretz party. \nWith such a prospect looming ahead, new elections were called within 90 days.\n\nAlso notable was the feeling that the prospects for peace were further diminished when Sharon chose to appoint \nthe hawkish Shaul Mofaz as Israel's new Defense Minister. Leading Palestinian voices stated that the appointment \nof Mofaz signified a strident move to the right, further away from peace, and with very little hope of resolution \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn early January 2003, two Palestinian suicide bombers set off consecutive explosions in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 \npeople and wounding more than 100 others. The area was populated mostly by immigrants and foreign workers. \nThe Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a military branch of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, said the suicide bombers \nbelonged to their group. Earlier, the militant Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the back-to-back blasts but later \nrecanted. The attacks, which were the first suicide bombings since a November 2002 attack in Jerusalem, came \njust three weeks before Israel's general election. As such, there was speculation that they might inspire support for \nmore hardline parties, such as Prime Minister Sharon's Likud Party.\n\n\n\nSharon held an an emergency meeting of key Cabinet ministers to discuss how to respond. In this regard, it was \ndecided that targeted attacks against Palestinian militants would be intensified, Palestinian officials would be \nprevented from attending scheduled talks, travel restrictions would be increased, and Palestinian universities (a \nhotbed of militant inspiration) would be closed. Previous attacks of this sort resulted on the reoccupation of many \nWest Bank towns -- however, as Israeli forces remain in control of many Palestinian areas, further options were \nlimited. Also, with the United States poised to strike against Iraq, there was a shared desire to avoid raising the ire \nof the Arab world over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For its part, the Palestinian Authority condemned the \nbombings. Meanwhile, Israel carried out a test launch of its Arrow missile interceptors. The anti-ballistic missile test \n-- the biggest launch of Israel's new air defense system -- was carried out in anticipation of a war on Iraq.\n\nElections of 2003\n\nBy mid-January 2003, pre-election polls suggested that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's right-wing Likud Party was \nheaded for re-election. Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party, which withdrew from Sharon's national unity \ngovernment and prompted new elections, appeared headed for a substantial loss. Another possible winner in the \nelections would likely be the secular centrist Shinui Party, with polls indicating it may end up being the country's \nthird largest party.\n\nPolling data indicated that Likud may increase its seats in the 120-member Knesset to approximately 32 (up from \n19), while Labor would decrease its seats to approximately 19 (down from 25). Shinui, which at the time of writing \nheld only six seats, were predicted to more than double that number; some polls showed the party holding as many \nas 15 or 16 seats after the election.\n\nAs was the case in the last election, security was the main campaign issue. Despite being ravaged by scandals, \nSharon campaigned successfully by reminding voters that he could only fulfill his prime ministerial duties with a \nwider base of power in the Knesset. In addition, his hawkish stance with Palestinians has been popular since the \nstart of the second Intifada. Labor leader Amram Mitzner appealed to disillusioned Labor supporters, asking that \nthey return to the party's fold in the interests of hope. Mitzner pledged to withdraw Israeli forces from most \nPalestinian area. Although Sharon tried to attract Shinui supporters, the number of cross-over voters from Shinui to \nLikud was likely mitigated by the large number of Labor supporters who decided to vote for Shinui instead.\n\nIsrael's daily newspaper Ha'aretz forecasted a right-wing coalition of seats approximating 67 in number; a left-wing \nconstellation of 37 seats; and a centrist bloc of about 16 seats. Whatever the outcome of the election in terms of \nseat allocation, the fact remained that a coalition government would have to be formed. With Labor refusing to join \nanother national unity government with Likud, and with a Likud - Shinui alliance unlikely due to ideological and \npersonality differences between Sharon and Lapid (Shinui's leader), it was expected that Sharon would likely form a \ngovernment with other hard-line and religious parties in a right-wing coalition. Sharon's main challenge would be to \nhave a strong enough Likud presence in the Knesset, so that he would not be unduly pressured by other parties' \ninterests.\n\nThe Israeli government warned there might be an increase in suicide bombings and other such attacks by \nPalestinian militants during the time of the election. As the election loomed on the horizon, Palestinians were \nprevented from entering Israel. The curfews and entry prohibitions were expected to continue until after the election \nwas over. Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out incursions in the Gaza Strip over the last weekend; 12 \nPalestinians were killed and 50 were wounded.\n\nWhen the official election results were declared, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud party garnered 37 seats, Labor \n19 seats, and Shinui 15 seats. Although Likud won a plurality of seats, it did not have an absolute majority and had \nto form a coalition government. Likud launched coalition talks with various parties. In this regard, a national unity \n\n\n\ngovernment would have been preferable, and would preferably included Labor. The Labor party, however, \nmaintained its position that its differences with Likud were substantial and could not easily be dismissed. For \nexample, Labor wants the withdrawal of Jewish settlements from Palestinian areas, as well as significant changes \nin the national budget. These matters are unlikely to be resolved. A coalition between Likud and Shinui seemed \nunlikely because Shinui is secular and expressed reticence about joining a coalition that includes religious parties. \nWith both Labor and Shinui refusing to enter a Likud coalition, analysts from both sides of the political divide \npredicted a right wing coalition with a totality of 62 or 63 seats. Sharon challenge, as such, was to create -- and hold \ntogether -- a coalition that did not sit on the far right of the political divide.\n\nPolitical developments in early 2003\n\nIn early 2003, in the face of the increasing violence in the West Bank and Gaza, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon issued \nPalestinians a challenge to find new leadership without terrorist inclinations. Interestingly, however, these \ndevelopments took place even as Sharon was meeting with members of the Palestinian leadership for the first time \nin about a year. Reportedly, Sharon offered to withdraw from certain Palestinian areas currently under siege, \npresumably in an effort to win some support from the Labor Party, which he desperately needed to form a \ngovernment of national unity.\n\nSharon's efforts to create a national unity government were not realized as the divisions between his own Likud \nParty and Labor were too great on two major issues: (1) dealing with the Palestinian uprising (or Intifada); and (2) \nthe matter of Jewish settlements. Sharon did manage to create a coalition with the secular centrist party, Shinui, \nand the far-right wing National Religious Party (NRP). The coalition will give Sharon 61 seats and a two-seat \nmajority in the Israeli Knesset and he will be able to form the next government of Israel. Shinui and NRP will have \nfive and two cabinet portfolios respectively. The coalition, however, is characterized as tenuous, with Labor \nexcluded, as well as the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party. As such, most political experts do not expect the coalition to \nlast more than a year.\n\nMeanwhile, in a surprise announcement, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat declared that he would share power \nwith a yet-to-be-determined Prime Minister. The new governmental structure would divide political power in such a \nway as to make Arafat's presidency a more ceremonial function, while leaving the fundamentals of governmental \npolicy-making to a Prime Minister. The historic announcement was overshadowed by ongoing Israeli-Palestinian \nviolence.\n\nIn April 2003, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the new Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (also \nknown as Abu Mazen), agreed on the composition of a new cabinet, which was later approved by the Legislative \nCouncil. The changes in Palestine's government structure had been a pre-condition for the United States' \ninvolvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and was intended to pave the way for the Israeli-Palestinian peace \nprocess.\n\nIn addition to the new structure and formation of the Palestinian government, the issue of security was also \nconsidered to be a major issue. Israel and the United States both favored a crackdown on militant factions, such as \nHamas and al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and both countries warned that the peace process would not be considered \nwithout the implementation of such measures. Yet at the same time, the United States urged Israel to ease \nrestrictions against Palestinians and to pull back from Palestinian areas. The Israeli government, however, said that \noperations against Palestinian militants would continue if the Palestinian Authority failed to deal with attacks and \nterrorism by militants.\n\nWithin the new government of Palestine, one of the key issues of contention was Abbas' choice of Interior Minister - \nMohammed Dahlan, former security chief from Gaza. Dahlan's promise to deal with militant groups produced some \nreticence by Arafat and the Fatah movement. Arafat and many members of Fatah believe that unless Israeli \noccupation of Palestinian areas is reduced, and unless military incursions by Israeli forces are ended, a proposed \n\n\n\ncrackdown on militants would be politically untenable. (Dahlan was eventually included in the government but not in \nthe role chosen by Abbas.)\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that many Palestinians have viewed Prime Minister Abbas' cabinet as an \nAmerican creation. As such, the conditions being set forth as precursors to the peace process have been regarded \nwith suspicion. Moreover, some analysts claim that Abbas is a threat to Arafat's power. Yet, the final decision-\nmaking regarding the cabinet ultimately illustrated Arafat's prevailing authority in Palestinian affairs, in spite of \nefforts by Israel and the United States to sideline him.\n\nThe \"Roadmap for Peace\"\n\nFollowing the approval of the new cabinet, international mediators presented a \"roadmap for peace\" as a starting \npoint for efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The United States Assistant Secretary of State, \nWilliam Burns, met with Abbas in Ramallah to discuss this \"roadmap for peace,\" which Abbas said had been \naccepted by the Palestinian government. The United States also intended to invite Abbas to the White House for \ntalks related to the peace process. Notably, Arafat has never been included in any such high level talks. Abbas, \nhowever, has expressed uneasiness with the idea of excluding Arafat from any such discussions. Regardless, the \ngesture by the United States was the first of its kind since the collapse of the peace process under United States \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n\nThere were reports that Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, might also meet with Abbas. As well, Israel released \napproximately 100 Palestinian prisoners as part of confidence-building measures for the implementation of the \npeace plan. Still, Sharon's government had not yet actually endorsed support for the \"roadmap for peace\" and \nduring talks in the Middle East, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell was forced to downplay this reality. \nThe \"roadmap\" includes a plan for a provisional Palestinian state by year's end, however, the Israeli government's \nimmediate priority did not lie with the creation of such a state, but rather with the cessation of terrorism and \nviolence.\n\nThe \"roadmap\" encompasses three phases as follows:\n\nPhase 1 (to May 2003):\nEnd of terrorism, normalization of life for Palestinians; Israeli withdrawal and an end to settlement; Palestinian \npolitical reform and elections\n\nPhase 2: (June-Dec 2003):\nCreation of a provisional but independent Palestinian state; international conference and international monitoring of \ncompliance with roadmap\n\nPhase 3 (2004-2005):\n\nSecond international conference; permanent status agreement and end of conflict; agreement on final borders, \nJerusalem, refugees and settlements; Arab states to agree to peace deals with Israel\n\nA new spate of violence threatened to upset the roadmap for peace. Apart from violent confrontations between \nIsraeli defense forces and Palestinians, several diplomatic vehicles from Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and the \nEuropean Union were shot at by Israeli forces as they progressed through the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun. \nGovernments of these countries have asked for an inquiry into the incidences, however, the Israeli army has said \nthat the shots were merely fired into the air as the vehicles attempted to circumvent roadblocks. The Swedish \nConsulate observed that bullets hit the windshield of its armored vehicle and insisted that the diplomatic cars had \nbeen fired upon.\n\n\n\nThe confrontations came on the heels of a declaration by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to conditionally accept \nthe \"roadmap for peace.\" Sharon had for a long time maintained the view that there would be no action on the \npeace process without a cessation to violence and terror (as noted above). Sharon's acceptance, even in this \nconditional form, garnered intense criticism from members of his Likud Party. Most of their ire was directed at \nSharon's statements about Israeli \"occupation\" of the West Bank and Gaza because the right-wing of Israel \nbelieves that these territories are legitimately under Israeli control. By articulating the term \"occupation,\" Sharon \nsymbolically distanced himself from the hard-line position of other members of his party. In a measure aimed at \nbuilding confidence for the peace process, certain outposts in \"occupied\" areas were dismantled.\n\nThe issue of occupation aside, Likud members also expressed their discomfort with the \"roadmap for peace\" \nbecause they believe that it favors Palestinian interests. Sharon's critics on the left of Israel's political divide \ncriticized him for being insufficiently clear about his support for the establishment of a Palestinian state. They \naccused him of being purposefully ambiguous so that he could present the illusion of support for the peace process \nto the United States, while at the same time, having no genuine intention of following through.\n\nRegardless, Sharon met with the new Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen). In \nJune 2003, following a meeting in Egypt with Arab leaders, United States President George W. Bush was \nscehduled to travel to Jordan for trilateral talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime \nMinister Mahmoud Abbas. The trilateral talks were one of the initial steps in the \"roadmap for peace\" aimed at \nultimately establishing the peaceful coexistence of Israeli and Palestinian states.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian \"roadmap for peace,\" which was marred by escalating violence, garnered a diplomatic \nvictory when the militant Islamic groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both agreed to truce (referred to as \"hudna\" by \nPalestinians). The truce was achieved after intensive diplomatic efforts by the United States' Bush administration, \nwhich had been working toward the adoption of the peace plan by Israeli and Palestinian interest groups. While the \nBush administration in the United States welcomed the development of the truce, United States Secretary of State, \nColin Powell, noted that it would not ensure enduring peace. Instead, he offered the view that Palestinian areas had \nto be demilitarized and all weaponry had to be under the control of the government. Earlier, United States President \nGeorge W. Bush had said that the armed infrastructure of groups, such as Hamas, would have to be dismantled.\n\nThe al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigade, a militant offshoot of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement did not \nsign on to the truce. In fact, the al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigade claimed responsibility for an attack against a worker at an \nIsraeli company in the northern West Bank on the first full day of the truce. Interestingly, Arafat's Fatah movement \njoined Hamas and Islamic Jihad in agreeing to the truce.\n\nMeanwhile, in accordance with the provisions of the \"roadmap for peace,\" there was an Israeli pull-back from the \nGaza Strip. Palestinian police replaced Israeli troops in the northern and central parts of the Gaza Strip, and the \nIsraeli army withdrew from the main checkpoints along the Gaza's main highway, which runs north to south and \nback. The withdrawal along the highway effectively allowed Palestinians free movement for the first time in \napproximately two years. Discussions about a similar pull-back in the West Bank were on-going.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, as an incentive for political cooperation, the United States also advocated a free trade \nprogram with countries in the region. The United States government expressed the belief that free trade commerce \nmight advance greater networks of cooperation and political reforms. At present, only Israel and Jordan have free \ntrade agreements with the United States, although several other such agreements have been planned. Not all \ncountries in the region are enthused about the free trade incentive as they believe that the focus should be on the \npeace process and the security situation, rather than economic and commercial interests.\n\nPolitical machinations in late 2003\n\n\n\nWithin the political landscape of Israel, a significant development ensued when the leader of Israel's opposition \nLabor Party, Amram Mitzner, resigned. Mitzner explained that the reason for his resignation was sourced in \nconflicts within the Labor Party. Apparently, some Labor members were not in agreement with Mitzer's decision to \nstay out of Sharon's coalition government following the last elections.\n\nIn September 2003, following an almost continuous power struggle, Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas \n(also known as Abu Mazen) resigned. Abbas complained that his efforts had been stymied by a lack of support from \nthe Palestinian legislature and sabotage by Arafat. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat nominated one of his allies, \nAhmed Qurei, to replace Abbas.\n\nAhmed Qurei (also known as Abu Ala) had been the parliamentary speaker and a key member of Arafat's Fatah \nmovement. He was also instrumental in the negotiation of the Oslo peace accords signed with Israel 10 years prior, \nwhich led to Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Regarded as a moderate and a pragmatist, he \nis a banker by trade.\n\nAhmed Qurei's appointment was to be confirmed by parliament, however, the nominee accepted the position, \nnoting that the United States and the European Union would have to show commitment to the peace process.\n\nThe appointment of a new prime minister was barely off the ground when a spate of deadly attacks by Palestinians \non Israelis began. In retaliation, the Israeli authorities halted the military's withdrawal from Palestinian areas, cut off \ntalks with Palestinian negotiators, and targetted key members of militant groups, such as Hamas. The cycle of \nviolence did nothing to build confidence between the two sides.\n\nThen, in mid-September 2003, the Israeli cabinet announced its decision to remove Palestinian leader Yasser \nArafat, whom they declared to be a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation. At the time, it was unclear \ninitially if Israel meant death or expulsion when it spoke of removing Arafat. Either way, the international community \nreacted with dismay. The decision to send the Palestinian leader into exile was followed by a shocking declaration \nby Israel's Vice President Ehud Olmert, which noted that the government had not ruled out killing Arafat. He also \noffered another option, which would include keeping the Palestinian leader in prison-like conditions. As such, the \nsituation in the Middle East deteriorated futher and the so-called \"roadmap for peace\" appeared to be in dire \njeopardy.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council quickly drafted a resolution condemning such an act, however, the United \nStates was the only country out of 15 in the Security Council to oppose the resolution. Britain, Germany and \nBulgaria all abstained from voting. The United States argued that the resolution was flawed because it did not \ncondemn Palestinian terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. The draft resolution, sponsored by \nSyria, had demanded that Israel \"desist from any act of deportation and cease any threat to the safety of the \nelected president of the Palestinian Authority.\" Meanwhile, Arab nations criticized the United States' opposition to \nthe resolution.\n\nSoon thereafter, on Sept. 19, 2003, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of a \nresolution calling on Israel to lift its threat to exile Arafat. The vote -- 133 in favor, four against and 15 abstentions -- \nfollowed the Security Council debate discussed above. The resolution got huge support due to last-minute changes \nintroduced by the European Union to condemn Palestinian suicide bombings as well as Israeli extrajudicial killings. \nHowever, even those concessions were not enough to enlist the support of the United States, which reportedly \nopposed the text. Unlike the Security Council, a General Assembly resolution has no binding powers - it simply \ncarries the weight of global opinion.\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 5, 2003, Arafat declared a state of emergency in the Palestinian territories and signed a presidential decree \napproving the formation of an emergency cabinet for the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) that consisted of nine \nmembers. The emergency government consists of the following: Ahmed Qurei, prime minister; Nasser Yousef, \nminister of interior; Sallam Fayad, minister of finance; Nabil Shaath, minister of foreign affairs; Na'eem Abu Al-\nHomos, minister of education; Saeb Erekat; Jawad Al Tibi; Jamal Al Shoubaki.\n\nQurei confirmed to reporters the forming of the emergency cabinet, saying that its mission would be to keep \nnational unity among the Palestinians and act to end disorder and implement discipline and the rule of law.\n\nArafat signed the decree a day after a deadly suicide bombing in Israel's northern coastal city of Haifa, which killed \n19 people and wounded over 50 others. Soon after, rumors emerged suggesting that Arafat had a heart attack and \nwas in poor health. The revelation led to speculation about new presidential elections and fears of a possible power \nvacuum.\n\nBy the close of 2003, truce talks in the Egyptian capital city of Cairo between Palestinian factions failed to obtain a \nfull ceasefire on Israeli targets. The factions were unable to agree on the issue of ceasing suicide attacks against \nIsraeli civilians. The presence of the Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei during the talks did not help to resolve \nthe ideological dissonance. Observers have said that the fact that Palestinian factions were not able to agree even \non a limited ceasefire did not bode well for the prospects of peace. Moreover, the militant group Hamas promised \nthe resumption of suicide attacks. Further discussions among Palestinian factions are expected to ensue \nregardless.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli government expressed pessimism regarding the lack of progress coming out of the Cairo \ntalks.  In particular, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said there had been no sign \"on the ground\" of a \nPalestinian commitment to end attacks. He went on to assert that there was no room for negotiation until \"terrorist \nactions\" were stopped.\n\nAlso at the end of 2003, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon delivered a policy speech announcing that Israel would \ntake the initiative if the Palestinians failed to begin disbanding militant groups, as required under the so-called \n\"roadmap for peace.\" The core of Sharon's speech dealt with the idea of \"disengagement\" from the Palestinians.  In \nthis regard, Sharon's government said it might dismantle settler outposts and accelerate the construction of a \nbarrier to separate Israel from the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe fallout of Sharon's speech has been far-reaching.  At home in Israel, most of the 220,000 settlers expressed \nanger over the government plan. A senior minister within Sharon's cabinet warned that the dismantling of settlers' \nhomes would result in a mixture of heartbreak and confrontation.  Meanwhile, both Palestinian and United States \nofficials have criticized Israel's possible unilateral action.  For both, they believe that a lasting solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict can only be accomplished via a negotiated agreement.\n\nDevelopments in 2004:\n\nIn February 2004, the issue of Israel's proposed wall separating Israelis from Palestinians faced the International \nCourt of Justice. Palestinians argued against Israel's West Bank barrier, claiming it could prevent the eventual \ncreation of a Palestinian state by annexing and entrenching portions of land. For its part, Israel said that the wall is \nneeded to prevent suicide bombers from killing civilians. In fact, the Israelis have suggested that the hearing at the \nInternational Court of Justice might even undermine the peace process. The case was brought before the \nInternational Court of Justice by the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\nAny possible ruling was unlikely to be made for some time and ultimately would not be legally binding. Still, should a \nruling be made on the matter, it would hold symbolic -- if not de jure -- authority and influence. Meanwhile, Israeli \ngovernment officials said that ongoing attacks by militants demonstrate quite clearly why the construction of the \nsecurity barrier has been necessary to save lives. \n\nIn late March 2004, the leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was killed in an Israeli air strike.  According to \nwitnesses in the Gaza Strip,  Israeli helicopter gun ships hit Sheikh Yassin, a quadriplegic, as he was being \nwheeled to his car to be transported -- either from or to -- a mosque.  Yassin founded Hamas in 1987. In addition to \nthe social and welfare functions of Hamas, the organization also had a terrorist militant faction, which was \nresponsible for the killing of hundreds of Israelis and other such attacks.\n\nSince the time of a double suicide bombing in Israel in mid-March, Israel's military had been engaging in an \noffensive in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, while Yassin had been specifically identified as a target of the Israeli \nmilitary action.  In fact,  Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Zeev Boim said that Yassin had been \"marked for death\" \nand media reports suggested that the targeting Yassin had been directed by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  \nAnalysts suggest that the assassination was an attempt to emphasize Israeli strength as Israeli forces prepare to \nwithdraw from Gaza.\n\nPalestinians responded with anger as thousands demonstrated in the streets in protest of Yassin's killing.  The \nPalestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, though not aligned with Hamas, denounced Yassin's killing as \"a \ndangerous, cowardly act.\" For their part, Hamas militants in Gaza City pledged to avenge Yassin's death, as \nloudspeakers broadcast the message \"We will send death to every house, every city, every street in Israel.\"  In \naddition to acts of revenge, it would seem that the killing of Hamas' leader will also affect efforts to return to the \npeace process.\n\nOn March 23, 2004, hard-liner Abdel Aziz Rantisi, was chosen as the new leader of Hamas.  The next day, Rantisi \npulled back from threats against the United States, saying his group's militant activities were aimed solely at Israel.\n\nAlso in March 2004, even as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon focused public attention on his government's \ndecision to target the leadership of terrorist organizations like Hamas and the building of the dividing wall between \nIsrael and Palestinian territories, he is facing challenges on other political issues.  In particular Prime Minister \nSharon was facing a series of bribery allegations that may threaten his hold on political power.  Israel's chief \nprosecutor recommended that Sharon be indicted on corruption charges. The decision of whether or not this step \nshould be taken was to be made by Israel's attorney general, Menachem Mazuz.  Although in 1993, the Israeli \nSupreme Court ruled that a person under indictment could not serve in a major national capacity, the ruling applied \nto a cabinet minister rather than the head of government.\n\nA month later, Israel's Likud political party decided to  vote on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw Israeli \nforces out of the Gaza Strip.  In the aftermath of the vote, Sharon suffered a political setback when his Likud Party \nrejected his plan to withdraw Israeli troops and 7,500 Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip.  For many Israelis, \ndisengaging from Gaza was regarded as a form of retreat and thus may have contributed to the outcome. With final \nresults of the poll showing that 59.5 percent of the ruling Likud party voted against Ariel Sharon's proposals, \nquestions arose in the Israeli media as to whether of not Sharon would be able to survive politically as prime \nminister. For his part, Sharon dismissed suggestions of his resignation and refused to admit that his plan was \nentirely off the table.  In this regard, Sharon noted that although he respected the outcome of the vote, he did not \nintend to \"do nothing\" for the remainder of his elected term in office.\n\n\n\nSoon thereafter, a siege in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli army left more than 40 Palestinians dead and dozens of \nhouses demolished.  Israeli officials said that the siege was necessary to prepare for a complete withdrawal from \nthe area, despite the vote to reject Sharon's plan within his Likud party.\n\nIndeed, a revised plan was to be presented to the cabinet which stipulated a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and \nfour West Bank settlements in phases rather than all at once.\nFaced with continued opposition to his withdrawal plan from within his own government, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon planned to dismiss two cabinet ministers. Without the two hardliners to deal with, Sharon was able to \nsecure support -- in principle -- for his revised plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. \n\nIn mid-2004, the Israeli leader was faced with a political crisis as one of his coalition partners threatened to pull out \nof government.  Once that threat became a reality and he was left without a majority, Sharon commenced coalition \ntalks with Shimon Peres of the Labour Party.  Within his own Likud party, Sharon could count on little support for \neither the settlement withdrawal or an alliance with the Labour Party.  Indeed, bringing the Labour party into the \ngovernment would likely alienate members of Likud.  The other coalition possibility would involve bringing in \nreligious parties; such a prospect would be likely  to upset the secular Shinui party.  Consequently, Sharon \nwarned Likud members that if they failed to support his coalition negotiations with the Labour Party,  they would \nhave to face new elections. \n\nFor its part, the Labour Party said that in exchange for its parliamentary support, it would call for a more rapid \nwithdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as dialogue with the Palestinians.  Some members of the Labour \nParty, however, were not pleased about the prospect of propping up Sharon's government and said that they \nshould be moving toward fresh elections instead. \n\nMeanwhile, within Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet, there was another episode of dissonance following remarks \nfrom a cabinet minister.  Yosef Lapid, the justice minister and head of Sharon's main coalition partner, angered \nseveral fellow cabinet members by stating that the Israeli army's offensive in Gaza reminded him of his family's \nexperience during World War II. Lapid said that the television depictions of an elderly Palestinian woman in the \nrubble recalled memories of his own grandmother. In response, he was reprimanded by Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon.  \n\nIn July 2004, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei  resigned in protest of the security situation in Palestinian \nterritories.  Technically, control over, and reform of, Palestinian security should have been administered by the \nprime minister; however, no such turnover had ensued.  Having been placed in an impossible situation, \nQurei believed he had no choice but to resign.  While the younger Palestinian militants clamor for more influence, \nthe old guard of Arafat loyalists have not been eager to relinquish their authority.  Gaza, therefore, has become the \nterrain of a Palestinian power struggle in anticipation of Israel's possible withdrawal.\n\nAlso in July 2004, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel's separation barrier in the West Bank violates \nfreedom of movement and should be demolished because it threatens a \"de facto annexation\" of Palestinian lands \nfor Jewish settlements. The court's nonbinding, 14-1 decision was set at the time of writing to go to the United \nNations General Assembly. Palestinians applauded the decision while the United States Department of State called \nthe referral to the court \"inappropriate.\"  Israeli Prime Minister Sharon maintained that \"the fence works.\"\n\nIn October 2004, violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued even as an Israeli withdrawal from northern \nGaza took place.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that following a disengagement vote in the Knesset, he intended to establish \na unity government that would include  its traditional rival Labor Party.\n\n\n\nThe vote to disengage from Palestinian areas was expected to result in the withdrawal of the hardline National \nReligious Party from the ruling coalition.  As such, Sharon had to seek other allies to continue to govern.  If the vote \nfor disengagement failed, Sharon would be forced to call for new elections. Talks with Labour were not particularly \nfruitful in late 2004.\n\nBy early 2005, the Labour Party of Israel  had tabled a non-confidence motion prompting Prime Minister Sharon to \ntry to bring Labour and two other parties into a new coalition government.  In this regard, Sharon's ruling Likud party \nsubsequently authorized the formation of a new government that included the opposition Labour Party as well as \ntwo religious parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ).\n\nIsrael and the Palestinian Territories: Relations from late 2004 through 2005\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died in late 2004.  Palestinians and Israelis prepared for would-be \nsuccessors most notably exemplified by the call for new elections to the Palestinian National Authority. \n\nIn early December 2004, in anticipation of elections in January 2005, positioning for the Palestinian leadership role \nwas in full swing.  Mahmoud Abbas appeared to be leading the polls and from this position of advantage, \nhe signaled a potential shift in strategy by calling for an end to armed resistance. \n\nIn January 2005, Abbas won the election for the leadership of the Palestinian people with over 66 percent of the \nvotes cast.  Abbas' stance calling for a halt to suicide bombings and the revitalization of the peace process was not \nwell-received by extremist factions, such as Hamas.  Still, such factions said they would support Abbas. \n\nThe implications for Israel and the peace process were not yet known as violence continued with an attack by \nPalestinian militants on Israelis at the Karni commercial center, and also the continuation of hand made rocket \nattacks against Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.  The incidents resulted in the decision by Israel to cut ties \nwith the newly-elected Palestinian leadership.  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon also ordered a crackdown against \nmilitants.  Amidst these developments, Abbas and the Palestinian authorities continued to call for a halt on attacks \nagainst Israelis and for a return to the peace process.\n\nAlong this path, Abbas engaged in serious talks aimed at establishing a cease-fire between the Israeli authorities \nand Palestinian militants within weeks of coming to power and despite the earlier decision by Israel to cut ties with \nhim. His efforts appeared to have been productive because by the last week of January 2005, Israeli government \nsources said that it would suspend operations in Palestinian areas if Palestinian militants would halt rocket attacks \non Jewish settlements. Israel's Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz even went to so far as to predict that there might no \nlonger be the presence of Israeli soldiers in Gaza and the West Bank later in the year. Although, a spokesman \nfrom Hamas denied that a cease-fire had been finalized, he acknowledged that talks were ongoing.  He also \nexpressed interest in serious dialogue and did not foreclose the possibility of an eventual  truce, if Israel halted its \n\"aggression\" in Palestinian areas. \n\nBy mid-February,  Palestinian and Israeli leaders announced a cease-fire.  But the news was followed by comments \nfrom leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad who said that they were not bound by the ceasefire \nagreement. Nevertheless, Israel said that it would release up to 500 Palestinian prisoners as part of a ceasefire \ndeal with the Palestinian Authority. \n\nBy late February, Israel's cabinet backed Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw both troops and settlers  from \nthe Gaza Strip and portions of the West Bank.  Members of the cabinet voted 17-5 in favor of Sharon's plan, which \n\n\n\nwould go into effect in July 2005. The plan had been previously approved by the Israeli parliament.  Cabinet also \napproved the new route of the barrier wall in the West Bank.  As noted previously, even as the Israeli government \nasserted that the wall had a positive effect on security, Palestinians argued that the wall might  potentially shape the \nfuture border between separate Israeli and Palestinian states.  As such, Palestinians feared that even as Israel \nloosened its grasp on Gaza, it was attempting to tighten its grip on the West Bank.  \n\nIn April 2005, the decision by Israel to go forward with settlement expansion in the West Bank was met with  \nopposition.  While Palestinians expectedly decried the plans for further expansion, Israel's closest ally, the United \nStates, said that such a move would be at odds with the so-called \"roadmap for peace,\" which calls for a halt on \nfurther Jewish settlement.  The issue was to be part of the discussions between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \nand United States President George W. Bush during a meeting at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.\n\nIn another development, ultra-nationalist Jewish Israelis planned a rally at the Temple Mount -- a site regarded as \nsacred to both Jews and Muslims. Ariel Sharon's visit to this site in 2000 is believed to have been the catalyst for \nthe start of the recent Palestinian Intifada (uprising).  Consequently, security forces were deployed to prevent such \na rally.\n\nIn the first week of May 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon decided to halt the scheduled release of \nPalestinian prisoners.  His decision came days after the Israeli defense ministry had frozen the handover of West \nBank towns to Palestinian control. Instead, Sharon demanded a stronger hand in dealing with militant activities and \nwarned that militant groups had to be disarmed.  His change of heart was presumably due to frustration over the \nincreased incidences of rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip onto Israeli targets.  Palestinians responded by noting \nthat Israel had not kept its promises on the issue of settlement or the release of prisoners. \n\nBy the close of May 2005, Israel's cabinet backed the release of 400 Palestinian prisoners.  The announcement by \nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to resume the prisoner release program was regarded as strategic.  On the heels \nof positive talks between Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and United States President George W. Bush, Sharon \nmay have wished to circumvent criticism that he was not doing enough to promote the peace process. \n\nMay 2005 also marked the municipal elections in the Palestinian territories.  The Fatah movement, founded by \nYasser Arafat, won over the Islamic militant  movement Hamas in these local elections.\n\nBy July 2005, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed four Israelis in the town of Netanya.  The attack ended months of \ncalm in Israel. While suicide bombings had waned in Israel, rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinians were \nongoing. Indeed, in the first half of July, there were over hundreds of rocket attacks on Israeli targets around the \nGaza Strip.  In response, Israel warned that it would launch a ground offensive to stop further attacks on Jewish \ncommunities. For his part, Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, said that he was committed to doing everything \npossible to end the violence.  His efforts, however, were not likely to be helped by Hamas, which said that it \nsupported a conditional calm and the ongoing truce, but would not cease its activities in cases of \"resistance\" and \n\"defense.\" \n\nWithdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was  the path toward the planned withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza \nStrip in August 2005.  In mid-July 2005, a rally in support of Jewish settlers  was met with resistance from Israeli \nauthorities. Then, in the first week of August 2005, Israeli Finance Minister and former Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu resigned in protest of the planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. His resignation announcement was \ntendered just as the Israeli cabinet voted by 17 to five in favor of the removal of the first group of Jewish settlers \n\n\n\nfrom the Gaza area. Throughout, Netanyahu had been a strong critic of the pullout plan put forth by Prime Minister \nAriel Sharon. About a year prior, Netanyahu threatened to resign over the same issue but later withdrew his \nultimatum. With the pullout now imminent, he renewed his criticism. On Israeli radio, Netanyahu warned that \nwithdrawing from Gaza would only serve to make it a base for terror. On the matter of his resignation, he said, \"I \ncannot be part of this irresponsible move that divides the people and harms Israel's security and will in the future \npose a danger for the wholeness of Jerusalem.\"\n\nWhile his resignation was expected to  bolster Israel's political opposition parties, it was not expected to have any \nmeasurable effect on the pullout itself. Instead, the significance of Netanyahu's resignation resided in its symbolism \nof the ongoing tensions within the ruling Likud party. The withdrawal from Gaza has been a source of acrimony for \nPrime Minister Sharon and his hard-liner rivals, including Netanyahu. Both sides have held opposing stances on the \nquestion of how to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian divide. Netanyahu's resignation may well serve as a harbinger \nfor a power struggle set to take center stage within the ruling Likud party. Many analysts expect Netanyahu to \nchallenge Sharon for the leadership of the party, in anticipation of the next election. Meanwhile, with Netanyahu \nleaving the cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was appointed to succeed him.\n\nIsrael's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip officially began at midnight on August 14, 2005.  Once the midnight \ndeadline passed, it became illegal for Israeli citizens to live in Gaza, effectively closing off Jewish settlement in the \narea. At dawn on Aug. 15, 2005, Israeli soldiers informed the remaining residents of Jewish settlements in Gaza \nthat they would have two days to leave, or they would be at risk for being forcibly removed. Several Jewish settlers \nhad already left; however, there were still several thousands of settlers and protestors remaining in Gaza at the time \nof the passage of the deadline for withdrawal. The remaining settlers refused to leave. \n\nMeanwhile, at the Kissufim crossing between Israel and Gaza, Israeli troops constructed a red road barrier to \nprevent the passage of traffic into Gaza. The sign on the barrier, written in both Hebrew and English, read,  \"Stop, \nentry into the Gaza Strip and presence there is forbidden by law.\"  To ensure that the controversial withdrawal \nensued as peacefully as possible, Palestinian security forces were also deployed to make certain that there were no \nattacks by Palestinians on Jewish settlers.\n\nThe last Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip were expected to leave on Aug. 22, 2005, effectively bringing Jewish \nsettlements in the area to a close.  As people left the settlement of Netzarim, security forces said that they did not \nexpect significant resistance.  Nevertheless, there were many reports of soldiers weeping and praying with settlers \nas they carried out their orders to permanently evacuate them from Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who devised the withdrawal plan, visited some of the troops responsible for \nenforcing the controversial and emotionally wrenching exodus from Gaza. At the Ein Hashlosha base, Prime \nMinister Sharon addressed the troops saying, \"You have carried out this operation, which has been very difficult for \nyou and\n\nthe residents, in a way that demands respect and I thank you.\"  He went on to say, \"No state in the world can be as \nproud of having mobilised such a force in such difficult conditions.\"\n\nThe Israeli leader also expressed his appreciation for the settlers' handling of the difficult situation\n\n.\n\nWith the withdrawal from Gaza almost complete, the task of  demolishing homes began and was expected  to take \nseveral weeks to complete. Once the Israeli military departs from Gaza and the military installations were \ndismantled (set for September 2005), the Palestinian Authority  would assume responsibility for the land in Gaza.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, attention was shifting to the West Bank where clearances in a few settlements was expected to begin \non Aug. 23, 2005.  Several people were leaving the area ahead of time in anticipation of violent altercations \nbetween angry settlers and Israeli troops. Indeed, the remaining settlers and about 2,000 activists were gathering at \ntwo west Bank settlements -- Sanur and Homesh -- in order to strongly resist their forced evacuation from the area.  \nIn fact, a number of confrontations had already been reported.  Whereas the soldiers enforcing the withdrawal in \nGaza were unarmed, the soldiers being deployed to the West Bank were reported to be armed. The former head of \nIsraeli intelligence, Ami Ayalon, said on Israeli television that about 10 percent of the settlers in the West Bank \nshould be regarded as a threat because they did not recognize the state's authority. Nevertheless, the withdrawal \nfrom the West Bank commenced without incident.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2005, Israel  formally ended its military rule in the Gaza Strip.  Troops began to withdraw from the \narea after a 38-year occupation, which began after conflict ended in Israeli capture of the narrow coastal area. The \nfull military withdrawal was expected to be completely as quickly as possible and followed the removal of Israeli \nsettlers from Gaza, the bulldozing of their homes and the demolition of military bases.  Untouched by the outgoing \nauthorities, however, were the Jewish synagogues of Gaza.  Originally, the Israeli government had intended to \nbulldoze the synagogues along with the homes to preclude desecration by Palestinians.  Jewish rabbis, however, \nargued against such action saying that destruction of Jewish synagogues would be in violation of religious law.  \nAlthough the synagogues were thusly abandoned rather than razed, they were not expected to be left standing for \nlong. As Israeli troops left Gaza, incoming Palestinians entered the area that had been emptied of settlements.  \nSome of the abandoned synagogues were set on fire.\n\nIn another development, the Israel's cabinet also voted to officially hand over control of the conflict-ridden Gaza-\nEgyptian border to Egypt.\n\nIn November 2005, the Israeli government and the Palestinian authorities forged an agreement on border crossing, \nallowing for freer movement of Palestinians into Israel and Egypt.\n\nIsrael would be able to view the borders through close circuit television and would have the ability to raise \nobjections of certain travelers. \n\nIsraeli-Palestinian relations in late 2005\n\nOn Aug. 28, 2005, a suicide bombing at a central bus station left at least 10 people injured  in the southern Israeli \ncity of Beersheba. Among those critically injured were two security guards who suffered grave shrapnel wounds and \nburns.  The attack took place during the morning rush hour.\n\nOn Israel Radio, a bus driver said  that the suicide bomber had been carrying a large bag.  The size of the bag \ncaused suspicion and security guards stopped the suicide bomber before he could board the bus.  Police said that \nthe suicide bomber -- identified as a West Bank resident named Ayman Za'aqiq --  blew himself up at the station. \nHis remains were scattered at the scene.  Later, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \nclaimed joint responsibility for the attack bombing. This was the first suicide bombing to take place in Israel since \nthe withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip.\n\nFollowing this latest Beersheba suicide bombing, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas expressed his \ncondemnations, and characterized the attack by the two Palestinian extremist groups as a  \"terrorist operation.\"\n\nAbbas called for the ongoing truce between Israelis and Palestinians to be maintained.  Nevertheless, he also \npointed to a  recent Israeli raid in the West Bank in which five Palestinians were killed, suggesting that it had been a \n\"provocation\" of sorts.  Indeed, one of the two terrorist organizations claiming responsibility for this latest attack, \n\n\n\nIslamic Jihad, had earlier promised to avenge the deaths of the five Palestinians in the West Bank town of \nTulkarem.\n\nFor its part, Israel said that the five people killed in the West Bank raid were militant extremists wanted in \nconnection with several suicide bombings carried out against Israelis.  A spokesperson for the Israeli government \nsaid that the latest bombing in Beersheba reinforced the imperative for the Palestinian Authority to crack down on \nterrorism, or risk no movement in the peace process.  Meanwhile, in a direct reference to Israel's withdrawal from \nGaza, Israeli Prime Minister  Ariel Sharon said \"Israel has taken the necessary steps to further the prospects of \npeace with the Palestinians.\" He then went on to warn that if attacks by Palestinian extremists continued, there \nwould be dire consequences.  \"To an outstretched hand we shall respond with an olive branch,\" Sharon said, \"but \nwe shall fight fire with the harshest fire ever.\"\n\nApproximately 40 rocket attacks were fired at Israel in the second part of September 2005.  Faced with such action \nby Palestinian militants, Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders via air strikes.  Indeed,  Israeli Prime \nMinister Ariel Sharon authorized unrestricted strikes of this type. As a result, one woman was hit by shrapnel from \nthe missile, which had been aimed at a road used by Palestinians for launching rocket attacks. As well, two Islamic \nJihad militants were killed in retaliatory air strikes by the Israeli military.\n\nPresumably in response to this turn of events, the militant Palestinian group, Hamas,  announced an end to rocket \nattacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. In his address, Mahmoud Zahar, the Hamas leader, said that his group was \nfully committed to adhering to the ceasefire, which had been agreed upon earlier. This announcement came after \npressure was placed on Hamas by both Palestinian mediators leaders and Egyptian mediators to stop its attacks on \nIsrael from  Gaza.\n\nIn an address to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon expressed \nrecognition of the Palestinians' right to sovereign statehood.  He also called for compromise in order to effect an \nend to the violent conflict that has marred Israeli-Palestinian relations for decades.  At the same time, he called on \nPalestinians to prove that they want peace by cracking down on militants in the aftermath of Israel's pullout from \nGaza after close to 40  years of occupation. His words were sufficiently conciliatory as to seem shocking to many in \nthe international community who  viewed him as a hard-liner.\n\nAt home in Israel, Sharon's remarks evoked criticisms from the political right and praise from the political left. \nBenjamin Netanyahu, Sharon's rival for leadership of the Likud party, said that the prime minister had turned his \nback on the right.  Conversely,  Interior Minister Ophir Pines who belongs to the left-leaning Labour Party \ncommended him for joining the side of peace. For their part, Palestinians were skeptical and said that Sharon's \nultimate strategy was to give way on Gaza in order to permanently hold on to Jerusalem and the remaining West \nBank.\n\nIn December 2005, a Palestinian suicide bomber's actions left five people dead and dozens injured dozens in the \nIsraeli town of Netanya on the coast.  The attack occurred at a shopping center after the Palestinian attacker,  Lutfi \nAmin Abu Salem, was prevented from entering the shopping center by security officials and decided to detonate the \nexplosives outside the gate instead. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the attack while \nIsraeli security officials said they would meet to discuss possible responses, such as air strikes targeting militant \nleaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli  Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz was also supposedly going to \nrequest permission to resume the practice of  demolishing the homes suicide bombers.  For his part, Palestinian \nleader, Mahmoud Abbas, characterized the suicide bombing in Netanya as an act of \"terrorism\" and promised \njustice.  Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned that such attacks hurt Palestinian interests and \nrenewed the call to abide by the declared ceasefire. Nevertheless, a spokesperson for the Israeli government said \nthe Palestinian Authority had failed to act against militants.\n\n\n\nPolitical realignment\n\nMeanwhile, in late September 2005, both the Palestinian and the Israeli leaders were confronted with  challenges to \ntheir leadership. Within the Palestinian parliament, there were plans to hold a vote of non-confidence in Prime \nMinister Mahmoud Abbas and his government. As well, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was faced with \nopposition from within his own Likud Party.  This was largely as a result of his decision to withdraw from Gaza -- a \nmove highly unpopular among the right wing factions of Israeli government.\n\nAt an acrimonious meeting of the Likud  Party, where members were set to debate the future course of its \nleadership, Sharon was prevented from giving his speech.  When he attempted to begin his address to the group \ngathered, it was discovered that the microphone cord had been deliberately cut. He left the stage without speaking.\n\nSharon's staunchest opponent for the leadership of Likud, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was strenuously against the \npullout from Gaza, charged that such a move would only embolden Palestinian militants in their attacks against \nIsrael.  But Sharon said that Israel would continue in its efforts to unrelentingly hunt down the terrorists that attack \nthe Jewish state.\n\nOn Sept. 26, 2005, Likud members were scheduled to vote on whether or not to hold early elections for the party \nleadership. The vote was being regarded as a referendum on Sharon's leadership.  Indeed, some factions were \ndeciding whether or not to back Netanyahu for leadership of the party.  Despite whom is chosen to lead Likud, polls \nsuggest that the party would perform more favorably under Sharon rather than Netanyahu in a general election. \nMoreover, if the time comes for building a ruling coalition, Sharon, more than Netanyahu, would likely enjoy broader \nparliamentary support, particularly from the centrist Shinui Party and from the Labour Party.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon offered his resignation to the Chairman of the Likud party \nstating that he was withdrawing from the ruling Likud party to run for re-election in 2006.  Prime Minister Sharon had \nhelped to found the Likud party in 1973, however, in recent years, his policies regarding the West Bank and Gaza \nhave not been popular among the right-wing faithful of Likud. As a result, Sharon was increasingly in a conflicted \nrelationship with many members and factions of his own party. \n\nIn order to run for re-election outside the realm of Likud, Sharon was set to form a new political party, named \nKadima, apparently in the centrist mode politically, economically and socially. He was also ensconced in \ndiscussions with political allies in regard to the new party's formation. Sharon apparently had the support of 14 of \nLikud's 40 members of parliament, including a number of cabinet ministers.\n\nPrime Minister Sharon's decision to withdraw from Likud was apparently made  following discussions with his \npolitical aides.  The decision also came on the heels of the decision by the new leadership of the Labour party to \nleave Sharon's governing coalition. A week earlier, the Labour Party underwent a significant shift in leadership \nwhen Simon Peres was ousted in favor of Amir Peretz -- a virtual unknown who was born in Morocco and whose \nsupport for socio-economic amelioration suggested a move within the party to more socialist roots.  His victory over \nVice-Prime Minister Peres came as a surprise since polls had shown the incumbent sporting a strong lead.  \nComplicating matters was the fact that by late November 2005, Peres said that he would back Sharon's bid for re-\nelection under the aegis of the new Kadima party, effectively abandoning Labour, which he had led for years.\n\nAnother national election was not scheduled until  late 2006, however, as a result of Labour's withdrawal from \nSharon's ruling coalition, it was expected that new elections would have to be held ahead of schedule.  A \ndiscussion between Sharon and Peretz apparently ended in agreement about the election date being changed to \nMarch 2006.  Speculation ended after Prime Minister Sharon met with President Moshe Katsav to request that \nparliament be  dissolved in anticipation of early elections.  The president was said to be in consultations regarding \nthe matter following the request by Sharon.\n\n\n\nFresh elections with Sharon at the helm of a new party would function as a referendum on his leadership.  Because \nvoters will have very little knowledge of whatever new party Sharon forms, they will essentially be voting on the \nbasis of their relationship with Sharon, and in tandem with their approval of his leadership and his policy stances. \nAlthough starting a new party months before an election is something of a risky proposition, it  may actually work to \nhis advantage. Despite Sharon's differences with the hard right within Likud, most mainstream Israelis have given \nhim high marks for navigating the difficult times of the Palestinian Intifada.  Moreover, many Israelis have also \nsupported his controversial withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank, as measures intended to bring about peace \nwith the Palestinians and stability for Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, fresh elections would simultaneously function as a test of Peretz' leadership as the head of Labour and \nin the spotlight of national politics.\n\nAs well, Sharon's withdrawal from Likud would leave a vacuum in the party, which, undoubtedly, hardliner politician \nand former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be happy to fill.  Thirdly, the decision by Peres to back Sharon \neffectively indicates the consolidation of their political alliance, and the fact that there political fates were now tied to \none another.  \n\nIn these ways, the Israeli political landscape was set to undergo a significant realignment, which will reverberate \nwell into the future. This realignment was in the offing for some time as a result of intra-party conflict, and  in \nconjunction with the emergence of unexpected alliances. In 2006, the elections would offer Israelis a choice \nbetween Likud on the right, Labour on the left, and Kadima  in the middle.  For Sharon specifically, this would \nbe terrain rather ironic for the man who was a founder of Likud and who was believed to have sparked the second \nIntifada.\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon had a small stroke on December 18, 2005 but was expected to leave hospital on \nDecember 20, 2005. As speculation arose about whether or not he would be replaced as the head of the newly-\nestablished Kadima Party ahead of elections, he said in a conversation with journalists, \"There are people who are \nalready interested in a replacement? Well, maybe it's too soon. I'm still here, no?\"\n\nMeanwhile, on December 19, 2005, exit polls showed that Sharon's main opponent on the right, Benjamin \nNetanyahu, was positioned to become the leader of the Likud Party, which Sharon had left. Netnayahu apparently \nbeat out Foreign Minister Sylvan Shalom for the job. Although Sharon's centrist Kadima Party was in the lead in \npolls taken before his stroke, it was difficult to determine if conservative voters would switch their vote back to \nLikud, given  Sharon's health situation.  Kadima, after all, has been built around Sharon's personality and political \nphilosophy.  An article in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily newspaper noted, \"Kadima's existence depends on one man. It \nis reasonable to assume that the stroke... damaged his party in electoral terms.\"\n\nThe political realm without Sharon\n\nIn the first week of 2006, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was hospitalized following a second stroke.  He \nunderwent surgery at the Hadassah Hospital and then fell into an induced coma.  Doctors attempted to bring \nSharon out of the coma a few days later -- a process that was expected to be gradual.  As well, the amount of \nanesthesia was slowly reduced.\n\nDoctors noted that Sharon was able to breathe independently although he remained connected to a ventilator. \nHadassah Hospital Director Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef said that Sharon's ability to breathe independently indicated a \nsign of activity in the brain. Doctors also noted that Sharon had moved his right arm and leg. While these \ndevelopments were collectively characterized as positive, doctors noted that the Israeli leader was not yet out of \ndanger.\n\nDr. Jose Cohen, the neurosurgeon who operated on Sharon, warned that although Sharon's chances of survival \nwere good, his ability to continue functioning as prime minister of Israel would likely be severely compromised.  A \ncomplete medical assessment of both Sharon's cognitive responses and potential brain damage was expected to \n\n\n\ntake place after he was completely weaned off sedation. The details of this assessment would then be passed on to \nAttorney General Meni Mazuz.  If the assessment concluded that Sharon was  permanently incapacitated and, as \nsuch, he would be unable to function as head of government, a cabinet meeting would be convened to choose a \ncaretaker prime minister until the time of the general election.  Members of Sharon's Kadima Party within cabinet \nwould be the eligible candidates, including Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, and \nDefense Minister Shaul Mofaz.  Ehud Olmert, who as Sharon's deputy assumed the duties of prime minister when \nSharon went into surgery, was viewed as the most likely person to be the caretaker leader. Among Olmert's \nimmediate decisions has been the question of whether or not to permit Palestinian candidates to campaign in East \nJerusalem for legislative elections scheduled for Jan. 25, 2006. \n\nBy mid-January 2006, Prime Minister Sharon underwent a tracheotomy intended to help to move him off a \nrespirator.  Doctors were in the process of trying to wake Sharon from a medically induced coma several days after \nhe suffered a massive stroke. They also attempted to determine the extent of the damage caused by the stroke. \nWhile initial tests showed activity on both sides of Sharon's brain, there were few signs of his awakening from the \ncoma. \n\nMeanwhile,  Israelis were faced with the reality that the political landscape in the future would be one without \nSharon.  On Jan. 15, 2006, Israel's Attorney General Meni Mazuz released a statement saying that under Israeli \nlaw, Sharon could not  be declared permanently incapacitated until three months had passed. As such, he ordered \nSharon's deputy and the current Acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, to continue functioning in that capacity until \nelections in March 2006. His government, however, for the interim period would not include the original \nmembership.  On Jan. 12, 2006, three of the four Likud party ministers in Israel's government  resigned from the \ncabinet.  Their resignations came after Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu ordered them to step down saying, \n\"The Likud cannot present itself as an alternative if it remains in the government and continues to implement its \npolicies.\" The fourth Likud cabinet member, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, was also expected to follow suit. \n\nIn other developments,  the Israeli government approved voting by Palestinian residents in occupied East \nJerusalem in the elections scheduled for Jan. 25, 2006. There had been some speculation that the voting there \nwould be stopped in order to protest the participation of the militant group, Hamas.\n\nIsrael's own election day was  scheduled for March 28, 2006.  With Sharon's chances of returning to political life in \nIsrael looking quite slim in early 2006, there have been many questions about the performance of his newly-formed \nKadima political party in the upcoming election.  Moreover, there have been doubts about the prospects of the party \nitself.  For many Israelis, Sharon's charisma and political domination has been inextricably linked with Kadima.  \nIndeed, Kadima has essentially been a product of Sharon's political vision, particularly with regard to the Palestinian \nquestion.\n\nUntil the deterioration of Sharon's health, Kadima was leading the polls ahead of the election.  But without Sharon \nat the helm, it has been difficult to discern whether or not Kadima will continue to be viable.  Indeed, the political \nbalance has now been shifted so that the traditional parties -- Likud on the right, and Labour on the left --  may well \nhave the opportunity to be more competitive in the 2006 election.  Some analysts have postulated that Benjamin \nNetanyahu, the newly-elected head of Likud, may well benefit from the situation by capitalizing on the conservative \nand hardliner votes. However, other analysts have argued that the center-right vote share will continue to be split \nbetween Kadima and Likud.  Will this trend continue so that the corresponding center-left vote share will be split \nbetween Kadima and Labour?  Will the polls taken prior to Sharon's stroke continue to show Kadima's ascendancy -\n- even without the party leader playing a political role?  These are questions that remain yet unanswered and which \nwill likely depend on the performance of Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the immediate future.  Effective \nleadership by Olmert may well demonstrate the viability of Kadima as a political party independent of one person, \nand it may be illustrative of the resonance of Kadima's centrist political philosophy among the Israeli public. \n\n\n\nIn one of his first policy addresses on January 24, 2006, Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Israel would \nhave to withdraw even further from parts of the West Bank. He said that it would not be possible for Israel to \ncontinue to control parts of areas where the majority of Palestinians live. He also noted that the key objective should \nbe to formalize Israel's permanent borders.  Explaining this pragmatic position, he said, \"The choice between \nallowing Jews to live in all parts of the land of Israel and living in a state with a Jewish majority mandates giving up \nparts of the land of Israel.\"  He nonetheless acknowledged that Israel would have to maintain security zones, as \nwell as places vital to Jewish interests, such as main settlement areas as well as the city of Jerusalem. On this \nissue, he staked out clear ground asserting, \"There can be no Jewish state without Jerusalem under Israeli \nsovereignty.\"  As regards the Palestinian election, which was ongoing at the time, he characterized it as a step for \nPalestinians  along the path to statehood. \n\nRadical shift in Palestinian politics\n\nIn the January 2006 Palestinian election, results showed a strong victory for Hamas.  After the election results were \npublicized, President Mahmoud Abbas  suggested that those working toward peace might wish to bypass Hamas in \nparliament entirely and continue to work with the Palestinian Authority through him. He also warned that he would \nresign if he could not effectively pursue his peace agenda with the incoming Hamas majority in parliament. \nMeanwhile, many Israeli politicians expressed outrage over the election of a group responsible for manifold acts of \nterrorism.  Indeed, Hamas has carried out several suicide bombings against the Jewish state and it has refused to \naccept the right of Israel to exist. For its part, Hamas co-founder Mahmoud Zahhar promised the possibility of \ncontinuing violence when he said, \"The Israelis are continuing their aggression against our people, killing, \ndetention, demolition and in order to stop these processes, we run effective self defence by all means, including \nusing guns.\"  As well, Hamas' political leader, Khaled Meshaal, called for the establishment of a militant force for \ndefense against aggression but he also said that Hamas would be willing to observe the ongoing truce with Israel if \nit met the interests of the Palestinian people.\n\nAs such, the victory by Hamas has presented significant challenges in the global efforts to re-energize peace talks \nbetween Palestinians and Israel.  The most notable of these challenges was the fact that Israel simply would not \ndeal with Hamas.  Prime Minister Olmert said on January 26, 2006 that Israel would not negotiate with a \nPalestinian government that included Hamas.  Olmert's offered an official statement noting that \"Israel will not \nconduct any negotiation with a Palestinian government, if it includes any (members of) an armed terror organization \nthat calls for Israel's destruction.\"\n\nFurther, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz warned that no Hamas leader would be safe from targeted killings if \nthe group continued to carry out terrorist attacks and maintained its refusal to respect Israel's sovereignty.  He said, \n\"Whoever stands at the head of a terror organization and continues to carry out terror attacks against Israel is not \nimmune.\"\n\nAt the international level, world leaders expressed shock at the election of Hamas, noting that working with the \nnewly-elected Palestinian parliament would be extraordinarily difficult. The Middle East \"Quartet,\" composed of the \nUnited States, the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, issued a joint statement calling for Hamas to \nrenounce violence and respect Israel's right to exist.  United States President George W. Bush said that \nWashington would not engage with Hamas unless it met these two requirements and warned that $400 million in \naid could be cut.  Likewise, the  European Union warned that it would not fund the Palestinian Authority under \nHamas unless the two requirements -- renouncing violence and respecting Israel's sovereign state -- were met.  \nThe situation created a massive conundrum for the West, which was compelled to take a principled stand against \nterrorism while simultaneously confronting the possible ramifications of cutting off funding.  Indeed, without external \nfunding, the Palestinian Authority would likely disintegrate and conditions on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank \nmight well devolve into further instability. Secondly, without the help of external funding, the dire socio-economic \nconditions in Gaza and the West Bank would invariably worsen.  Both of these two possible outcomes would likely \nfuel further resentment, insecurity, poverty and despair -- the very conditions that foment terrorism in the first place. \n\n\n\nIn February 2006, Israel decided to implement a number of punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority, \nincluding the withholding of monthly tax payments, increased security checks at crossings between Israel and \nGaza, a ban on the transfer of equipment to Palestinian security forces, and stricter restrictions on the movement of \nHamas officials. Israeli Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also said he would request that foreign donors cease all \npayments to the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. Even \nwithout such a request from the Israeli government, both the European Union and the United States have said they \nwould likely stop funding from going to the Palestinian Authority unless Hamas renounced violent action and \nannounced its adherence to the truce with Israel forged in 2005. \n\nThe newly-elected speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Hamas legislator Aziz Duaik, reacted by noting that the \nnew measures were counter-productive and would only result in further acrimony and hatred.\n\nMoscow convened talks with Hamas in March 2006. During those key talks,  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said \nthat Russia respected the democratic choice of the Palestinian people when they elected Hamas to power.  On \nbehalf of Russia, Lavrov nevertheless said that Hamas must transform itself from a militant entity to a political \norganization if it wanted to have a serious political future.  Lavrov  also expressed Russia's commitment to  \nachieving a lasting peace in the Middle East, however, he called on Hamas to recognize the Jewish State of Israel.\n\nFor his part, the Hamas representative insisted that peace would only be possible if Israel withdrew from territory \noccupied in 1967.\n\nThe decision by Russia to meet with Hamas constituted a gap in otherwise coordinated efforts by the Quartet  to \nachieve peace in the Middle East. Until the Russian meeting, the members of Quartet had refused to deal with \nHamas, on the basis of the militant group's dubious legacy of carrying out numerous terrorist attacks in Israel. For \nits part, Israel expressed outrage about the meeting.\n\nIn early 2006, Hamas' political ascendancy, in conjunction with Sharon's incapacitation,  further shifted the Israeli \npolitical landscape in a significant manner.  Together, these two considerations were expected to highly influence \nthe voting choices Israelis were yet to make on election day.\n\nElections of 2006\n\nIsraelheld parliamentary elections on March 28, 2006. Thirty one parties reportedly contested the elections as they \nvied for representation in Israel's 120-seat parliament or Knesset. Turnout was less than in previous elections with \nonly 62.3 percent of the electorate going to the polls. The lower than usual turnout was blamed on election fatigue \nin a country where coalition governments have fallen, and where snap elections have been called with teeming \nregularity in recent years.\n\nPolling data ahead of election day showed Israel's newly-formed centrist Kadima party was going to be the likely \nwinner, albeit with a smaller plurality than was originally hoped. Even with Kadima founder Ariel Sharon \nincapacitated, polls on the eve of the election forecast 34 seats  for Kadima, 19 seats for Labour, 13-14 seats for \nLikud and the far-right party, Yisrael Beitenu, just behind. Polling data regarding the election excluded the large \nnumber of undecided voters who could swing the outcome in a number of directions.\n\nAlthough interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he would need at least 40 seats for a stable government, taking a \nplurality of seats would constitute a victory nonetheless. Indeed, a plurality of seats  for the newly-formed Kadima \nParty would provide a remarkable legitimization of  the political vision of Ariel Sharon for a secure Israel with \n\n\n\npermanent borders. Moreover, it could well mean a step forward in the path toward disengagement from some \nPalestinian areas -- by dismantling Jewish settlements in the West Bank, while simultaneously annexing portions of \nthat territory.  Following Sharon's lead, Olmert has suggested that peace negotiations with Palestinians might also \nbe possible down the line, if compromise was sought.\n\nMany Palestinians opposed the plan by Kadima, charging that  it would make the formation of the borders of a \nfuture Palestinian state difficult. Still, Kadima's moderate approach stood in sharp contrast to the tough stance of \nYisrael Beitnenu, which has advocated the forcible transfer of Palestinian towns within Israeli terrain to Palestinian \nterritory.\n\nExit polls on election day, including one by Israeli Public Television, showed Kadima poised to take about 29 seats \nin parliament -- less than was expected, however, still in position to form a coalition government. The likely coalition \npartner was thought to be the Labour Party, which, if the exit polls were correct, performed better than was \nexpected and was projected  to secure betweeb 20 and 22 seats. The far-right party, Yisrael Beitenu, also accrued \nbetter support than was anticipated and was projected to garner between 10 and 14 seats in parliament. The real \nloser of the election, if exit polls were on target, was shaping up to be Likud, with only 11 or 12 seats. There was \nsome speculation that many center-right voters who might normally have voted for Likud, transferred their vote to \nthe moderate centrist Kadima, while more right-wing voters split their votes between Likud and Yisrael Beitenu, thus \naccounting for Likud's less that stellar election performance.\n\nAt the time, analysts warned that exit polls in Israel had not always been reliable. Still, if  the polling data proved \nto correctly reflect the actual election results and if Kadima, indeed, won a plurality of seats, the early \nspeculation was that Olmert would  forge a ruling coalition with Amir Peretz's Labour Party.  Such an end would \ndeliver quite a blow to Likud, now led by hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu. Acknowledging his party's resounding \ndefeat, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu conceded that the party had \"suffered a tough blow.\"  He went on to say \nthat the process of revitalizing Likud and moving its agenda forward had only just begun.\n\nLate on election day, Ehud Olmert declared victory.  Official results several days later showed the following \noutcome: Kadima (centrist): 29 seats; Labour (center-left): 20 seats;  Shas (ulta-Orthodox): 12 seats; Likud (right-\nwing): 12 seats; Israel Beitenu (far-right): 11 seats; Arab parties: 9 seats; National Union/Religious (far-right, \nsettlers): 9 seats; Pensioners (single-issue): 7 seats, Torah Judaism (ultra-Orthodox): 6 seats; Meretz (left-wing): 5 \nseats. The ascendancy of the newly-formed Kadima augured an historic shift in Israel's political landscape since \nthe country had been governed by either Labour or Likud parties since the time of the creation of the modern state \nof Israel in 1948.\n\nIn the first week of April 2006, Israeli President Moshe Katsav asked acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to form a \nnew government. Olmert's centrist Kadima party won a plurality of seats in recently-held general election but \nneeded a coalition partner to govern.  Olmert said that he would open coalition talks with the center-left Labour \nParty.  A new government has to be formed within 42 days, and must be backed by at least 61 members of the 120 \nseat parliament.  \n\nIsrael's Kadima party signed an agreement with the Labour party to form a coalition government at the close of \nApril 2006. Negotiations between the center-left Labour party and Kadima ensued for several weeks and dealt with \na number of ideological differences ranging from economics to the division of cabinet positions. On the issue of \neconomics, Labour and Kadima have stood to the  left and right of one another respectively.  However, the election \nof Peretz as the new Labour chief has moved that party further left, as exemplified by a stated policy of poverty \nalleviation. On the issue of Palestinian relations, both parties have shared a commitment to giving up some land in \norder to secure Israel's permanent borders.  Still, in order to achieve this end, Labour has favored dialogue with \nPalestinians President Mahmoud Abbas, while Kadima has favored a unilateral approach.  The intimations by \nKadima leader Ehud Olmert  that Labour leader Amir Peretz will serve as defense minister suggested a major \n\n\n\nbreakthrough on, at least, the contentious issue of withdrawal from occupied territories.  In total, Labour, who came \nsecond in the general election in March, was  expected to hold seven cabinet posts.\n\nThe close of April also marked agreement between Kadima and Israel's ultra-religious Jewish party, Shas.  That \nparty voted affirmatively to join the coalition government of Kadima head, Olmert. The deal was forged only after \nOlmert agreed there would be no absolute obligation to back the evacuation of West Bank settlements.  But this \nagreement appeared to contradict Olmert's previously-expressed position to dismantle isolated Jewish settlements \nin the West Bank in order to establish final territorial boundaries for Israel by the end of the decade.\n\nThis ideological disconnection notwithstanding,  it is only with a majority in parliament that Olmert would be \npositioned to withdraw Israel from parts of the occupied West Bank, while also strengthening Jewish settlements in \nother sections of the territory.  Indeed, it is a solution that many Israelis have supported, especially given the \napparent  absence of a peace process with the Palestinians.\n\nEarlier, Kadima concluded a deal with the Pensioners Party. With the Labour and Shas on board as well, Olmert \nnow controlled 67 of parliament's 120 seats  and therefore,  enough constituencies to form a workable coalition. \nThat is to say, a coalition with Kadima, Labour, Shas, and the recently-formed Pensioners Party, gave Olmert  a  \nmajority in the 120-seat parliament and the necessary backing to form a government.  \n\nSide-stepping Hamas\n\nThe Hamas-led government of the Palestinian territories (discussed above) was the primary challenge for the new \nIsraeli government. With many countries and blocs of the West refusing to contribute funds to the Hamas-led \nPalestinian Authority (noted  earlier), there was growing concern about the livelihoods of Palestinians who depend \non external aid.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Foreign Minister  Tzipi Livni in \nEgypt, it was agreed that Israel would release approximately  $11million of frozen tax revenue, on the condition that \nit not be paid to the Hamas-led government.  To this end, Livni said that the released tax funds would be paid \ndirectly to Palestinian health services, rather than to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority, which she described as \n\"a terrorist government.\"\n\nLivni went on to state that her government wanted to help the Palestinian people.\n\nThe method being employed by Israel to convey the tax funds -- effectively bypassing Hamas  -- was one \nsupported by President Abbas.  For his part, he had been encouraging Israel to bypass Hamas and negotiate \ndirectly with him about the peace process.  \n\nAmidst these tensions, Hamas agreed to back an initiative regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. There \nwere conflicting reports about whether or not the initiative included provisions for a two-state solution in which the \nJewish state of Israel would be recognized.  Currently, the Hamas charter expressly calls for the destruction of \nIsrael by force and eschews peace negotiations.\n\nA return to violence\n\n\n\nOn April 17, 2006, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed approximately 10 people and injured around 50 just outside a \nrestaurant in Tel Aviv. The attack occurred during the Jewish festival of Passover and shortly before Israel's new \nparliament was set to be sworn into office.\n\nThe militant group, Islamic Jihad, claimed responsibility for the blast.  The group issued a videotape in which it \nnamed the bomber as Sami Salim. Another known extremist group, al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, appeared to align \nitself with the attack when it declared that the bombing was carried out to avenge \"Israeli massacres\" in the Gaza \nStrip. Presumably, the group was referring to the spate of strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza earlier in April 2006, \nwhich were intended to mitigate against rocket attacks by Palestinians. Echoing a similar sentiment, the newly-\nelected Hamas government said the attack was a measure of self-defense. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for \nHamas, characterized the attack as \"a natural result of the continued Israeli crimes\" against Palestinians. He went \non to say, \"Our people are in a state of self-defense and they have every right to use all means to defend \nthemselves.\" Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was the only leading Palestinian to condemn the bombing. He \nwarned that such acts of terrorism worked against Palestinian interests.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli government said it held the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority responsible. Prime Minister \nEhud Olmert said Israel would \"act with all means at [its] disposal\" to prevent further acts of terrorism. Indeed, \nIsrael's security leadership was scheduled to meet to consider what action should be taken in response to the most \nrecent terrorist attack.\n\nOn May 20, 2006, Israel carried out a targeted assassination of Mohammed al-Dahdouh in Gaza.  The missiles \nfired at the car he was traveling also two women and a four-year-old boy in the car behind.  As such, Israel \nannounced that it would launch an inquiry into the incident.  In that regard, the Defense Ministry of Israel released a \nstatement that read, \"The minister has ordered an inquiry in order to determine the circumstances behind the death \nof the civilians in this incident.\"\n\nOn June 9, 2006, eight Palestinians died on the beach in Gaza. Included in the civilian deaths were three young \nchildren.  The incident, as well as the television footage of the aftermath, resulted in an international outcry.\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch suggested that their deaths were likely due to the firing of artillery shells by the \nIsraeli military.  Hamas then said that the deaths of the Palestinians on the beach had been caused by shelling from \nan Israeli warship.  Israel expressed regret over the matter, however, Israeli General  General Meir Klifi later said \nthat the deaths were not the fault of  Israeli troops and that the likelihood that artillery shells hit the area were \"nil.\"  \nNevertheless, Defense Minister Amir Peretz announced that an offical internal inquiry was to be launched into the \nincident. Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan called for a full and independent investigation. \n\nOn June 25, 2006, an attack by Palestinian militants left two Israeli soldiers dead and one young soldier missing. \nLieutenant Hanan Barak and Sargeant Pavel Slutsker were named as the two soldiers who had been killed in the \nattack.  The missing soldier, 19-year old Corporal Gilad Shalit, was believed to have been captured.  The incident \nmarked the first capture of an Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants since 1994.\n\nPalestinian militants apparently dug a 300-meter tunnel under the Gaza border fence and burrowed their way out of \nGaza so that they could attack the army post at Kerem Shalom.  The attack ensued when several armed \nPalestinians threw grenades at a tank on which Corporal Shalit was the gunner.  An armored personnel carrier was \nalso targeted.\n\nIsrael's government said it held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the capture and care of the soldier.  As \nwell, Israel's Defense Minister Amir Peretz warned that there would be a \"painful\" response to the attack at Kerem \nShalom.\n\n\n\nIn a media interview,  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said, \"This was a very serious Hamas terrorist attack.\"  \nThe Israeli leader also noted that the Palestinian Authority -- headed by President Mahmoud Abbas as well as the \nHamas-led government -- was would be held to account for the incident.\n\nFor his part, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on Hamas to release  Shalit, and warned that his capture \nwould work against Palestinian interests.  He also convened talks with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya to \ndiscuss the incident.  \n\nHamas' political leaders said that they knew nothing about the capture of the Israeli and urged that he be well-\ntreated. The denial of culpability by the political wing of Hamas laid bare a chasm within the group since the armed \nwing of Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack and capture.  The political wing of Hamas, which had \nbeen serving as the ruling Palestinian party since the 2006 election, ended a de fact ceasefire in June 2006 \nfollowing the aforementioned deaths of eight Palestinians on a beach in Gaza. \n\nOn June 26, 2006, a day after the attack at Kerem Shalom, Palestinian militants demanded the release of \nPalestinian women and children from Israeli jails as a precursor to the disclosure of information regarding Shalit.  \nThe demands were laid out in a faxed statement, which was signed by Hamas' armed wing -- Izzedine al-Qassam \nBrigades, as well as the Popular Resistance Committees umbrella group,  and a hitherto unknown group called the \nArmy of Islam.\n\nA day later,  the Palestinian militants who had abducted  Shalit admitted that he was actually alive.  Mohammed \nAbdel Al, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, said, \"The soldier is in a secure place that the \nZionists cannot reach.\"  \n\nIn response to the demands of the Palestinian militants in Gaza, the government of Israel rejected the militants' \ndemands and characterized it as \"blackmail.\"  Instead, Israeli authorities promised to secure the release of Shalit \nand threatened to use extensive military action in this regard.  To this end, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert placed the \nIsraeli military on standby for extensive military action and instructed that Israeli tanks and armored vehicles be \nassembled on the Gaza border.  As well, the Israeli prime minister warned that a large-scale military operation in \nGaza was in the offing.\n\nIn the early hours of June 28, 2006, Israeli forces commenced air strikes against targets in Gaza.  Three bridges \nand a power station were among the first set of targets that were hit.\n\nThe helicopter attack on Gaza's power plant cut off electricity to most of the area.  Soon thereafter, Israeli troops \nmoved into southern Gaza with air strikes. \n\nA day later on  June 29, 2006, Israeli troops were reportedly amassing at the northern border of Gaza.  Amidst the \nclimate of increased hostilities, Israel said that it would postpone sending troops into northern Gaza in the hopes \nthat a diplomatic efforts might prevail.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was trying to broker a resolution whereby \nShalit would be released.  \n\nWhile ground troops did not enter Gaza by the close of June 2006, Israel was nevertheless carrying out air strikes \nin the area.  In fact, Israeli warplanes fired missiles into the Palestinian interior ministry building, which was empty at \nthe time.  Other targets hit by Israeli warplanes included an office of Fatah, several militant training camps, sites \nused by militants to fire rockets at Israel, and a weapons storage facility in Gaza City.  As well, a missile strike in \nsouthern Gaza killed a member of the militant group, Islamic Jihad.\n\n\n\nAs the air strikes intensified, Israel simultaneously carried out political measures. Israeli authorities detained \nscores of cabinet ministers and legislators from the Hamas-led government. Additionally, the Israeli Interior Ministry \nmade the decision to revoke the East Jerusalem residency rights of a cabinet minister and three parliamentarians \nbelonging to Hamas.  The legal counsel for the four men said that the decision would be reviewed by Israel's \nSupreme Court.  However, if the appeal failed, the four men would be barred from freely traveling  within Israel. \nThese moves were presumably intended to increase the pressure on the Hamas government, ultimately aimed at \nsecuring Shalit's release.\n\nThe intensifying conflict was not limited to the Gaza Strip but, in fact, extended to the West Bank. In one case, a \nfaction of the Palestinian group, the Popular Resistance Committees, said that they had captured a Jewish settler in \nthe West Bank.  While Israeli authorities were focused on  Shalit in Gaza, reports emerged that the settler had been \nkilled by Palestinian militants in the West Bank. Palestinian security sources said that the body of 18-year old \nJewish settler, Eliahu Asheri, had been found in the city of Ramallah.  Meanwhile, reports from the West Bank town \nof Nablus suggested that a second Israeli soldier had been abducted by the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade [the militant \nwing of Fatah].  The Israeli authorities said at the time that they were looking into this claim.  Also in Nablus, Israeli \ntroops apparently killed a militant. \n\nIn early July 2006, the crisis regarding the abduction of the Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants was ongoing.  \nPalestinian militants said that they would release Shalit in return for the release of Palestinian women and youth \nprisoners. The situation took a negative turn when Palestinian militants issued a deadline of July 4, 2006 to release \nthe approximately 1,500 prisoners or face \"consequences.\"  The statement by Palestinian militants, which referred \nto \"the Zionist enemy,\" said that if Israel did not meet its demands, it would \"consider the soldier's case to be \nclosed.\" The statement concluded with the warning, \"The enemy must bear all the consequences of the future \nresults.\"\n\nFor its part, Israel outright rejected the ultimatum and called for the  release of its soldier.  To this end, Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert said his government would not be blackmailed and would not conduct negotiations on a \nprisoner release.  The Israeli leader said, \"The government of Israel will not yield to the extortion of the Palestinian \nAuthority [PA] and the Hamas government, which are led by murderous terrorist organizations.\"  Israel also \npromised intensified action in Gaza.  Already, Israeli forces sent artillery fire into northern Gaza and also deployed \nthe first of its ground forces into the region.  Elsewhere in Gaza, Israeli air strikes continued along with targeted \nstrikes against militants.\n\nShortly thereafter, a rocket attack by Palestinians on the Israeli city of Ashkelon evoked a sharp warning from Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert that  \"far-reaching consequences\" would follow.  Meanwhile, Israeli strikes on \nPalestinian targets were ongoing. By July 6, 2006,  Israeli forces had advanced into Gaza and the ensuing violence \nleft an Israeli soldier and about a score of Palestinians dead -- most of whom were identified as militants. Overall, \nthe situation did not augur well for improved Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\nAs the Israeli-Palestinian hostilities in the Gaza Strip continued in the second week of July 2006, Israel rejected \ncalls by Ismail Haniya, leader of the Hamas-led Palestinian government, for a ceasefire.  One Israeli official said \ncategorically that his government did not negotiate with terrorists. As well, spokespersons from the office of Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert warned that there could be no truce unless the captured Israeli soldier, Shalit, was \nreleased.\n\nNevertheless, even having taken this hard-line stance, Israeli troops withdrew from their positions in the northern \npart of Gaza (they remained in southern Gaza). It was unknown as to the motive for the withdrawal, however, it was \nbelieved that the move would stabilize the situation on the ground. That area had been particularly hard hit by \nfighting.\n\n\n\nAir strikes by Israeli forces, in addition to clashes on the ground, were said to have been responsible for the deaths \nof several people.  \n\nEven as Israel was embroiled in a conflict with Lebanon-based Hezbollah in mid-July 2006 (discussed below), \nIsraeli forces were launching strikes into Palestinian territories in response to the earlier capture of Shalit. By mid-\nJuly 2006, the latest major strikes involved two bombings of the Palestinian Foreign Ministry in Gaza.  No one was \napparently hurt in the attacks, which Israel said had been carried out because that particular compound was \nadministered by senior Hamas leader, Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahhar.  The Palestinian Foreign Minister \nresponded by calling the strike a crime by Israel.\n\nOn July 16, 2006, Israeli forces returned to northern Gaza, having withdrawn several days prior. The Israeli military \nwas moving in the direction of the town, Beit Hanoun, presumably because it was an area known to be a site for \nlaunching rocket attacks into Israeli terrain.  A few days later, a fresh offensive into Palestinian territories was \nongoing that lasted the duration of the month and beyond.\n\nIn early August 2006, Israeli forces detained Aziz Dweik, the the Speaker of the Palestinian parliament and a \nleading member of Hamas.  The Israeli aithorities said that as a member of the terrorist group, Hamas, Dweik was a \nlegitimate target.  Israel also noted that it was taking such action in the aftermath of the capture of one of its \nsoldiers, Galid Shalit, in June 2006. In response, Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya expressed \ncondemnation of Israel's action, and demanded the release of Dweik as well as the other parliamentarians who had \nbeen earlier arrested. \n\nOn August 5, 2006, Hamas officially rejected a request by the Red Cross  to visit the captured Israeli soldier, \nsaying that more than 10,000 Palestinian familes have been denied the right to visit prisoners.  However, Israel \nresponded by asserting that it has always allowed international organizations to access its prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, as intimated above, Israel was carrying out an offensive operation into Palestinian territory.  In the first \ndays of August 2006, the Israeli military resumed positions in southern Gaza and conducted searches for Gilad \nShalit.  Operations in the area were ongoing a month later and led to many deaths.\n\nSharon's Fate\n\nOn August 14, 2006, reports emerged regarding the deteriorating health of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon.  The Sheba Medical Center  where Sharon has been treated since slipping into a coma in early 2006 said \nthat a new brain scan indicated deteriorated brain function.  As well, decreased urine output as well as a chest scan \nindicated the presence of a new infection. \n\nSpecial Extended Coverage Report:  Israeli-Hezbollah Conflict in Lebanon \n\nPrelude\n\nOn  May 28, 2006,  the United Nations (U.N.) announced that it brokered a truce following incidences involving \nmutual missile attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. In one of the most significant attacks since December \n2005, Katyusha rockets from Lebanon were fired across the border toward northern Israeli bases around Mount \nMiron. While no specific militant group claimed responsibility, it the past, such attacks have been carried out by the \nlikes of Hezbollah as well as Lebanon-based Palestinian militants.  In retaliation, Israeli jets fired on guerilla bases \nin Lebanon.  Clashes between guerillas and Israeli troops then ensued along the boundary between Israel and \n\n\n\nLebanon and residents in the area were instructed to take cover. The area has been a particularly volatile zone \ndespite the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000, following an occupation that lasted close to \ntwo decades.  Still, there has remained a contested territory in the border region called the Shebaa Farms, which \nremains the site of periodic confrontations.\n\nBackground and Primer\n\nIn mid-July 2006, the leader of Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced that his militant Islamic group had captured \ntwo Israeli soldiers.  The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, asserted that the soldiers would only be returned \nthrough a combination of dialogue and prisoner exchange.  He added that the operation had been planned in \nadvance of the capture of another Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Underscoring his militant stance, \nthe head of Hezbollah also said that if Israel wanted to escalate the crisis, his group would be ready to deal with a \npossible confrontation.\n\nThe Israeli government held urgent cabinet meetings regarding the situation and approved a strong military \noffensive in Lebanon -- in response to Hezbollah's actions and also for the purpose of finding the two captured \nsoldiers.  Israel warned that it would hold Lebanon responsible for the fates of the two captured soldiers, pointing \nto the fact that Hezbollah had been allowed to attack Israel from within Lebanese borders with impunity and \nirrespective of the parameters of international law.  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert characterized the actions of \nLebanon-based Hezbollah as an \"act of war.\" The Israeli leader's promise of \"painful\" and \"far-reaching\" \nconsequences was issued just as its forces launched a military assault on southern Lebanon.\n\nThe military assault left several Israeli troops and civilians dead, even as roads as well as Hezbollah interests were \nattacked within Lebanon.  Indeed, as the conflict raged on, parts of the Lebanese capital of Beirut were decimated -\n- particularly southern suburban areas known to be Hezbollah strongholds.  The country's main infrastructure, \nincluding major highways, were bombed in order to prevent Hezbollah from receiving arms and support - allegedly \nfrom Iran via Syria.  The human dimension was not to be ignored as hundreds of civilians were killed in Lebanon as \na result of Israel's military actions.  On the other side of the border in Israel, the death toll and injury list, albeit in \nnotably lower numbers, continued to rise  as a consequence of a relentless barrage of rocket attacks by Hezbollah.  \nIndeed, rocket attacks became systematically more pronounced over time -- traveling further distances and more \ndeeply into Israeli territory and with greater frequency.\n\nThe two main players in the drama unfolding in the Middle East had their own perspectives as well.  With no sign \nthat the conflict was easing, the government of Lebanon called for a ceasefire with Israel and also requested \nassistance from the United Nations. Lebanon was desperate for an end to the violence as its terrain bore the brunt \nof the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  As a result, the Lebanese people, a first outraged at Hezbollah for \nplacing them in an untenable position, had now turned their anger toward Israel.  Meanwhile, Israel maintained the \nview that its two soldiers had to be returned and Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israel had to be stopped.  To \nthese ends, Israel was willing to take radical actions to achieve a long-term solution.\n\nOn the international scene, leaders laid primary blame for the situation at the feet of Hezbollah. They echoed \nIsrael's demand for the release of the two abducted soldiers and a cessation of rocket attacks on Israel, which had \nleft scores of people dead and hundreds injured. Nevertheless, they also demanded that Israel cease its military \noperation, which had destroyed several Hezbollah interests at a terrible cost.  They pointed to the devastation of  \nthe city of Beirut, as well as hundreds of civilian Lebanese lives and thousands of injuries, which were taken as \ncollateral damage.  The deaths of the United Nations peacekeepers as well as the deaths at Qana were particularly \nbleak examples of the high cost of Israel's operation.  Israeli Prime Minister Olmert asserted that his country was \ncognizant of the humanitarian aspect of the situation regarding Lebanon's civilians.  In fact, his Lebanese \ncounterpart, Fuad Siniora, said on United States television that it was something the two of them had discussed.  \nThat said, Olmert maintained the position that Israel was compelled to defend itself against terrorism.\n\nDiplomatic efforts were underway to try to bring an end to the violence.  Attempts to draft a United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution on the matter were marred somewhat by different policy imperatives of various countries. \nLebanon's failure to enforce a previous United Nations Security Council Resolution (1559), which was intended to \n\n\n\ndisarm militias from attacking Israel from within its borders, was a key concern. Indeed, it led to discussions about \nthe creation of a new international force, which would be tasked with ensuring that security was maintained in the \nborder region.  Israel's heavy-handed military operation was also a source of great concern with many critics \nwondering whether it would not result in increased animosity in the Middle East, rather than regional peace and \nstability. Iran and Syria became increasingly implicated in the conflict as backers of Hezbollah, while the United \nStates' support for Israel and its refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire became the source of global debate.\n\nOn August 11, 2006, United Nations Security Resolution 1701 called for an end to the hostilities and provided for \nthe stablishment of more robust United Nations enforcement in the border region.  By August 14, 2006, the \nceasefire was officially in effect.  A few days later, Lebanese troops crossed the Litani River to take up positions on \nthe southern border with Israel.  Their presence, however, was viewed as more of a symbolic development than a \nstrategic one since it remained unknown how they would control the region that had become a Hezbollah \nstronghold over a period of decades.  The fragile ceasefire was holding despite occasional flare-ups of violence. \nStill, the United Nation was warning that the ceasefire was at risk of collapsing in the aftermath of a raid by Israelis \nin the Bekaa Valley due to apparent attempts by Hezbollah to rearm itself. In the last days of August 2006, there \nwere also rising accusations about the violations of humanitarian law during the conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, displaced Lebanese people were returning home.  As well, the United Nations said that it was hoping to \nestablish 3,500 troops in southern Lebanon within two weeks and up to 15,000 in a month.  There was also a call \nfor European countries to contribute troops since Israel objected to the presence of peacekeepers from countries \nthat do not recognize its right of existence.  In addition to the orchestration and deployment of the United Nations \npeacekeeping mission on the Lebanese-Israeli border, there were also efforts underway to raise funds to be used to \nreconstruct Lebanon's destroyed infrastructure.\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments both Israel and Hezbollah made competing claims of victory.  However, by \nthe close of August 2006, Hezbollah's leader expressed regret that his orders to capture two Israeli soldiers had \nsparked a war that had left more than 1,000 people dead and which had decimated southern Lebanon.\n\nEditor's Notes: \n\nHezbollah (Hizbollah) --\n\nHezbollah (also known as Hizbollah) is a militant movement founded with the assistance of Iran's late revolutionary \nleader, Ayatollah Khomeini.  Although it is accused of being a terrorist organization by the West, it is regarded as a \nlegitimate resistance movement by many Arabs and Muslims. The group endeavors to restructure Lebanon as an \nIslamic state and has called for the destruction of the state of Israel.  Functionally, it has had control of the border \nregion between Israel and Lebanon since the withdrawal of Israeli forces in 2000.  Like the militant group, Hamas, \nin the Palestinian territories, Hezbollah also has a political wing, which has won representation in government.  \nIndeed, there is a Hezbollah representative serving as a government minister in Lebanon.\n\nThe following countries made pledges toward the peacekeeping mission along the Lebanese-Israeli border --\n\nFrance: Leadership and 2,000 troops\n\nItaly: 2,500-3,000 troops; also offered to take on leadership of the mission\n\nBangladesh: Two battalions (up to 2,000 troops)\n\nMalaysia: One battalion\n\nSpain: One  battalion\n\nIndonesia: One battalion, an engineering company\n\nNepal: One battalion\n\n\n\nDenmark: At least two ships\n\nPoland: 500 troops\n\nFinland: 250 troops\n\nBelgium: 302 troops to be increased to 392\n\nGermany: Maritime and border patrols but no combat troops\n\nNorway: 100 soldiers\n\nIntroduction to Day-to-Day Coverage: Positions in the Conflict\n\nThe initial assault left several Israeli troops and civilians dead, even as roads as well as Hezbollah interests were \nattacked within Lebanon. Israel was now dealing with crises on two fronts.  First, it was carrying out an operation in \nthe Gaza Strip to rescue Corporal Galid Shalit, who had been captured by Palestinian militants.  As a result, there \nwas an ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants taking place in Gaza.  A second operation \ninto Lebanon was now being launched to rescue Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev -- the two soldiers captured \nby Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  Nevertheless, despite the overwhelming task of fighting on two fronts, Prime \nMinister Olmert ruled out any negotiations with Hezbollah, just as it had foreclosed the discussions with Hamas.  \nAdditionally, his government filed a complaint with the United Nations, calling on the Security Council to enforce an \nexisting resolution [1559] that required the Lebanese government to disarm militias.\n\nFor its part, Lebanon said it had no knowledge of Hezbollah's activities and would not take responsibility for the \nabduction  of the two Israeli soldiers.  To this end, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said, \"The government \nwas not aware of and does not take responsibility for, nor endorses what happened on the international border.\"  \nExperts on the ground in Lebanon also pointed to the fact that despite the existence of United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1559, the country simply was not in the position -- politically or militarily -- to disarm Hezbollah \non its own.\n\nJuly 13, 2006\n\nOn July 13, 2006, the situation intensified after Israeli forces bombed the Beirut international airport and later a \nmain Lebanese army base in the Bekaa Valley. As well, Israeli warships blocked Lebanese ports. An assault on \ntargets across southern Lebanon at that time left approximately 50 people -- most of whom were civilians -- dead.  \nThere were also reports of several Israeli casualties as a result of attacks by Hezbollah in the northern part of \nIsrael.\n\nWith a war-like scenario unfolding, both Israelis and Lebanese on their respective sides of the border were fleeing \nto safety. Tourists in the region also joined the exodus, with many trying to cross the northern border into Syria.  \nSpecial emergency flights were being planned to pick up stranded tourists trying to escape the escalating violence.\n\nLebanon's Social Affairs Minister, Naila Mouawad, called for the two Israeli soldiers to be returned home.  She also \nreiterated Lebanon's previously-noted position that her government was neither aware of Hezbollah's plan, nor \nsupported it.  That said, Mouawad criticized Israel's response for being too heavy-handed, particularly with regard \nto the lives of Lebanese civilians.  She warned that Lebanon was experiencing a catastrophe and explained that her \ngovernment could not disarm Hezbollah by force.\n\nIn the late hours of July 13, 2006, at least two rockets hit Haifa.  Hezbollah quickly denied firing them.  \nNevertheless, the timing of the attacks -- only hours after the group had threatened to carry out this very act -- did \nlittle to assuage suspicions that Hezbollah was responsible.\n\nThat said, it should be noted that although Hezbollah fired several rockets into Israel over the course of the \nprevious days, none had traveled more than 12 miles  (approximately 20 kilometers).  As such, there was some \nskepticism that Haifa could be hit at all.  Regardless, the distance traversed by the rockets suggested that since \nIsrael's withdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah had been busy accumulating more sophisticated weaponry.  Left \n\n\n\nunsaid at the time was the matter of who would have furnished more technologically-advanced rockets to \nHezbollah. For its part, Israel reacted to the rocket attacks on Haifa by characterizing it as a major escalation.\n\nGlobal Reaction\n\nWith no sign that the conflict was easing, the government of Lebanon called for a cease-fire with Israel and also \nrequested assistance from the United Nations.  To this end, the United  Nations Security Council was set to meet \non July 14, 2006 to discuss the crisis unfolding in the Middle East. The European Union said that it would deploy its \nhead of foreign policy, Javier Solana, to the region to try to assist in bringing an end to the violence. The Arab \nLeague was also reported to have scheduled an emergency session.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a growing state of anxiety across the globe, with many countries calling for restraint from all \nparties involved. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned both the abduction of the Israeli \nsoldiers as well as the resulting offensive by Israeli forces into Lebanon. Russian, France and the European Union \nexpressed the view that Israel's response to the capture of two soldiers was disproportionate. But Israeli \nspokesman, Mark Regev, said that Israel was simply responding to an \"unprovoked act of aggression.\"  United \nStates President George W. Bush characterized Hezbollah as terrorists and supported Israel's right to defend  \nitself.  However, he also warned that whatever action Israel took, it should be mindful of the stability of the \nLebanese government. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, took a similar position \nsaying that while Israel had to ensure its own security, it should do so in a way that avoided civilian deaths.  The \nVatican later added its condemnation of the situation - calling for the release of the soldiers by Hezbollah and \ndecrying  Israel's strikes against the sovereignty of Lebanon.\n\nConditions on the Ground\n\nAmidst these varied calls for restraint, the crisis intensified further. Along the Israeli-Lebanese border, heavy fighting \ntook a toll.  Reports suggested that Israel had endured its worst losses in the area in several  years.  Hezbollah \nfired rockets in the direction of northern Israel and threatened to attack Israel's port city of Haifa if any attacks on \nBeirut took place.\n\nAs noted above, Israel did, indeed, bomb the airport in Beirut earlier in the day and further strikes on the city \nfollowed.\n\nJuly 14, 2006\n\nBy the early hours of July 14, 2006, reports emerged that Israeli forces were carrying out a new round of attacks on \nHezbollah targets inside Lebanon.  Among the targets were various Hezbollah interests in the southern part of \nBeirut --buildings believed to house Hezbollah weapons caches and offices of Hezbollah's leader (Sheik Hassan \nNasrallah).\n\nOther strategic targets, such as a power plant and the main highway between Beirut and Damascus (Syria), were \nalso hit by Israeli strikes.  Several spokespersons said that in addition to trying to free their two captured soldiers \n(as noted above), Israeli forces were also endeavoring to stop Hezbollah's flow of weaponry between Lebanon and \nSyria, which have been used to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel.  Earlier, Israel had warned Lebanon that  \nthe suburbs of the country's capital city should be evacuated -- presumably a foreshadowing of what was to follow.\n\nLater on July 14, 2006, Israeli forces struck bridges, Hezbollah's media and security headquarters, and the Beirut \noffices of Hassan Nasrallah.  The Hezbollah leader was not hurt in the attack.  In an address broadcast after the \nstriking of his offices, Nasrallah declared \"open war\" on Israel.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued to systematically \nlaunch rocket attacks into northern Israel.  The violence left several people dead on both sides of the Israel-\nLebanon border.\n\n\n\nOn that day, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the crisis, which was taking on the characteristics \nof warfare.  Lebanon's ambassador to the United Nations, Nouhad Mahmoud, called for an end to Israel's operation \nin Lebanon saying, \"The Security Council meets today in the shadow of a widespread, barbaric aggression waged \nby Israel to this very moment against my nation, Lebanon.\" But Israeli Ambassador Dan Gillerman responded by \nsaying that his country had no choice but to respond to Hezbollah's actions.  He also noted that the Lebanese \npeople were the ones suffering because of their government's ineffectiveness in disarming Hezbollah, as set forth in \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1559.  United States Ambassador John Bolton called for disarmament \nsaying, \"All militias in Lebanon, including Hezbollah, must disarm and disband immediately, and the Lebanese \ngovernment must extend and exercise its sole and exclusive control over all Lebanese territory.\"\n\nJuly 15, 2006\n\nBy July 15, 2006, the level of violence was escalating.  In one attack by Hezbollah, an Israeli warship off the \nLebanese coast was hit by an Iranian-made missile. Three Israeli sailors were reported missing while Israeli media \nsaid that the body of a fourth sailor had been found. The leader of Hezbollah had earlier alluded to such an attack in \nhis aforementioned address threatening \"open war\" on Israel. Then, Israeli air strikes on southern Lebanon resulted \nin the deaths of several Lebanese civilians who were attempting to flee the region.\n\nIsraeli strikes on targets across Lebanon, stretching as far north toward the border with Syria, were ongoing. Beirut \ncontinued to bear the brunt of the Israeli offensive with the city's port, gas stations, key roads and Hezbollah \ninterests being struck.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued its systematic pounding of northern Israel with rocket \nattacks.  The town of Tiberius was among those hit in Israel. There were reports of casualties on the ground.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora repeatedly emphasized his country's call  for a cease-fire, calling on the \nUnited Nations to administer such a move.  In response, the United Nations said it would send a peace delegation \nto the region to assess the situation.  For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he would concur with a \ncease-fire so long as certain conditions were met.  He said that Hezbollah had to release the two abducted soldier \nand cease rocket attacks at northern Israel, while Lebanon had to comply with  the existing United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution [1559].  Israel also accused  Syria  and Iran of conspiring with Hezbollah and the Palestinian \ngroup, Hamas, against the Jewish state. In this regard, Israel particularly drew attention to the Iranian-made \nmissiles, which allegedly hit its warship, as noted above.  Iran, however, denied supplying Hezbollah with the \nmissiles. Earlier, in a telephone conversation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad reportedly warned of a strong response to any Israeli military offensive against Syria.\n\nJuly 16, 2006\n\nOn July 16, 2006, an attack by Hezbollah on Haifa killed several Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned \nthat the attack on Haifa -- the country's third largest city --  would yield grave consequences. Indeed, the resulting \nretaliation came in the form of  intensified Israeli  air raids across Lebanon, including the northern part of that \ncountry.  About seven Lebanese soldiers at a military post at Abdeh were killed  in the strikes.  The city of Tripoli \nwas also among the areas struck by Israeli forces. Israeli air strikes ongoing in southern Lebanon also left a number \nof  people dead.  An attack on Tyre and a border village left several more people dead, including some holding \nCanadian citizenship. Strikes against strategic interests, such as fuel tanks at the Beirut airport, also continued. \nMeanwhile, Hezbollah's rockets were traveling more deeply into northern Israel, as exemplified by attacks on the \ntown Afula, located close to Nazareth.  In this way, the death toll was also mounting on the Israeli side of the \nLebanese-Israeli border.  Nazrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, promised that the battle against Israel had only just \nbegun.\n\nJuly 17, 2006\n\nA day later on July 17, 2006, Israeli strikes resulted in the deaths of about 10 Lebanese as they crossed a bridge; \nseveral others died in strikes elsewhere in Lebanon as the death toll in that country rose. There were some reports \nthat Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon, however, this activity was not regarded as a large-\nscale operation. In Israel, the continuous series of rocket attacks by Hezbollah resulted in Israeli casualties.  Also, \n\n\n\nHezbollah said that it had brought down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet over Beirut, however, that claim was dismissed by \nIsraeli authorities who said all their jets were accounted for.\n\nWithin the Israeli parliament, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made it clear that strikes on Lebanon would continue \nunless the two abducted soldiers were released, Hezbollah was disarmed and Lebanon showed that it was taking \ncontrol over its own southern border with Israel.  Olmert said, \"When missiles are launched at our residents and our \ntowns, our answer will be war waged at full strength, with all determination, courage and sacrifice.\"\n\nHe also noted that Israel was not looking for war or direct conflict, but it would deal with that reality if necessary. \nThe Israeli government continued to assert that militant groups, such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Hamas in \nGaza and the West Bank, were functioning in tandem with accused state sponsors of terrorism, Iran and Syria.  \nThose two countries were referred to as \"an axis of terror.\"\n\nAlso on July 17, 2006, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin traveled to Beirut as a measure of French \nsolidarity with the people of Lebanon and to try to advance a ceasefire agreement. As the French head of \ngovernment was arriving in Lebanon, the foreign policy head of the European Union, Javier Solana, was returning  \nfrom his trip to that country and warned that a ceasefire might not be quickly reached.  Likewise, United Nations \nSpecial Envoy Vijay Nambiar said that although he had made some initial progress during ceasefire talks in Beirut, \nmuch was yet to be done.  Nambiar also noted that it was imperative that Lebanon be more involved in the \nceasefire process.  Clearly, Hezbollah's unilateral actions against Israel served to essentially marginalize the \nLebanese government.  The government was also faced with the reality that conflicting ideas about where to place \nblame served only to create dissonance within the military -- a condition that could spark factionalism or another \ncivil war.\n\nJuly 18, 2006\n\nThe following day, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora again blamed Hezbollah for sparking the conflict and \nrepeated his call for the release of the Israeli soldiers.  At the same time, he condemned Israel for its harsh military \nresponse.  Indeed, he reportedly said in an interview with British media that Israel had opened \"the gates of hell \nand madness\" on Lebanon.\n\nLebanon's  pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud took a somewhat different view as he promised to stand by \nHezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.  The different stances of Siniora and Lahoud laid bare the brewing  \npolitical discord within Lebanon.\n\nJuly 18, 2006 was also the day a delegation from the United Nations, led by Vijay Nambiar,  was set to meet with \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to discuss the terms of a possible ceasefire.  At that meeting, Livni asserted that \nthere could be no ceasefire until its conditions (delineated above) were met.  Israel also hinted that its offensive in \nLebanon could last for another week in order to ensure that it had destroyed as much of Hezbollah's arsenal of \nweaponry as possible.  A day later on Arabic television, Hassan Nasrallah made it clear that the Israeli soldiers \ncaptured by Hezbollah would only be released if there was a prisoner exchange with Israel.  The respective \npositions of Israel and Hezbollah made the notion of a resolution appear rather elusive.\n\nThe casualty list on July 18, 2006 included the deaths of 11 Lebanese soldiers as a result of Israeli strikes.  One \nIsraeli was killed in Nahariya as a consequence of Hezbollah rocket attacks.  Across northern Israel, a barrage of \nHezbollah rockets hit  cities and towns such as Haifa, Safed, Acre, Kiryat Shemona, and the Gush Halav region.\n\nJuly 18, 2006 also marked the day in which the United States Senate passed a non-binding resolution of support for \nIsrael.\n\nJuly 19, 2006\n\nThe next day saw little change from the previous ones.  Indeed,  July 19, 2006 appeared to have been a day of \neven greater bloodshed and violence in Lebanon and Israel respectively. Israeli air strikes targeted eastern and \n\n\n\nsouthern Lebanon and left over 50 people dead.  In one case, around a dozen people died in one village.  \nMeanwhile, Israel lost some of its soldiers in heavy clashes with militants from Hezbollah on the ground, just inside \nthe border of Lebanon.  The Israeli forces were attempting to locate and destroy weapons and facilities used for \nterrorist attacks.  A spokesperson for the Israeli government, Miri Eisin, told both British and American media that \nher country would not allow a terrorist organization to deploy along its  border. In the city of Nazareth in northern \nIsrael, three people died as a result of rocket attacks by Hezbollah.\n\nJuly 20, 2006\n\nOn July 20, 2006, United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, called for an immediate ceasefire, blaming \nHezbollah for sparking the conflict and Israel for using excessive retaliatory force.  The United Nations chief also \nindicated that because of the destruction of Lebanon's infrastructure, a humanitarian crisis was evolving.  Indeed, \nseveral sources noted that there were now hundreds of thousands of displaced people across the country. Annan \nnoted that the crisis could only be dealt with via urgent funding and the European  Union - which had also called for \nan end to the violence - pledged to contribute financially  to the cause.  Recognizing that a ceasefire would be \ndifficult to achieve but that the humanitarian crisis had to be addressed nonetheless, the French government put \nforth a proposal for the establishment of safe corridors in Lebanon by which aid could be transported. In response, \nthe Israeli government agreed to the proposal of a humanitarian corridor between Lebanon and Cyprus.\n\nIt was also announced that the Secretary General would hold a private meeting with  the European Union's Foreign \nPolicy Chief, Javier Solana, as well as United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.  For her part, Rice later \ncharacterized the notion of an immediate  ceasefire as \"a false promise.\"\n\nThe casualty list on July 20, 2006 included the deaths of two Arab Israeli children in Nazareth as a result of \nHezbollah rockets.  The Hezbollah leader expressed regret for their deaths.  As well, four  Israeli soldiers died in \nclashes with Hezbollah fighters on the border.  Israeli forces also lost two of its Apache helicopters when they \ncollided near the Lebanese border.  One officer died and three others were injured in that incident.\n\nJuly 20, 2006 also marked the day in which the United States House of Representatives passed a non-binding \nresolution expressing solidarity with Israel.\n\nJuly 21, 2006\n\nOn July 21, 2006, the situation took a turn for the worse when thousands of Israeli reservists were called up for duty \nin anticipation of a possible land incursion. Although it appeared that Israeli troops were already  in Lebanon fighting \nagainst Hezbollah, they had been  operating on a small-scale level.  The call for reservists augured the possibility of \na larger-scale operation.  Another ominous warning came in the form of a directive from the Israeli government that \ncivilians exit southern Lebanon as quickly as possible, presumably in order to escape imminent peril.\n\nIsrael's Defense Minister, Amir Peretz, said that although Israel had no intention of conquering Lebanon, his \ncountry was prepared to do whatever was necessary.  The president of Lebanon, Emile Lahoud, warned that the \nLebanese army would battle Israel if it invaded Lebanon.  Syria, through its Information Ministry, warned that it \nwould enter the conflict if Israel carried out a ground invasion of Lebanon that threatened its own security.\n\nThe fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continued across the border.  Israeli strikes further degraded \nthoroughfares and infrastructure in Lebanon while Hezbollah rockets rained on northern Israel, hitting the city of \nHaifa once again.\n\nThere were at least 15 casualties. A Hezbollah rocket attack hit Masarik and left three people injured. Other \nincidences were reported, including the striking of a United Nations observation post, however, no injuries occurred \nin that case. Israel also announced that it had bombed a Hezbollah bunker and destroyed much of that group's \nstock of missiles.  It was a claim that Hezbollah disputed.\n\nJuly 22, 2006\n\n\n\nOn July 22, 2006, fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah resulted in serious injury to an unarmed United \nNations observer.  The incident happened in the town of Maroun al-Ras, which according to some reports, had \nbeen the site of a major clash between the two sides.  Some reports concluded that the fight at Maroun al-Ras \nresulted with Israel taking control of the town.\n\nThe Evacuation Process and Humanitarian Relief\n\nMeanwhile, with the conflict ongoing, roads across Lebanon were filled with people attempting to flee the aerial \nbombardment but unsure of where exactly to go.  Foreign nationals were being evacuated as governments of \nWestern countries sent ships and aircrafts to rescue people stranded on the conflict-ridden terrain of Lebanon.  \nSome governments began considering the need for special operations to rescue foreign nationals trapped in cut-off \nparts of Lebanon.  In particular, the French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said that France would launch a \nspecial mission to rescue some of its citizens trapped in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe evacuation process was winding down by the close of July 2006, although a Canadian ferry was set to \nevacuate foreign nationals trapped in the southern part of Lebanon from the city of Tyre. At the same time, \nhumanitarian efforts were underway with lorries of food and medical supplies arriving at key points in the conflict, \nsuch as Beirut and Tyre.\n\nAs the last week of July 2006 began, the evacuation of foreign nationals began to be the source of great \nconsternation among local Lebanese who accused the international community of caring only about people carrying \ncertain passports, while failing to act on behalf of local civilians who were bearing the brunt of the violence.\n\nJuly 23, 2006\n\nBy July 23, 2006, the head of the emergency relief agency for the United Nations, Jan Egeland, characterized the \ndamage caused by Israeli strikes on Beirut as \"horrific.\" He decried the devastation caused by Israel's retaliatory \naction against Hezbollah, calling it  excessive, while at the same time condemning Hezbollah for cloaking itself \namong the civilian population, thus worsening their casualties. He called on both sides to cease their attacks and \nnoted that humanitarian aid would begin arriving shortly in Lebanon. In that latter regard, he appealed for safe \naccess.  As noted above, Israel had earlier said that it would lift its blockade on the port of Beirut and respect a \nhumanitarian corridor.  He also said that the United Nations would be launching an appeal for humanitarian aid \namounting to $150 million dollars (USD).\n\nEgeland arrived in Beirut on the heels of an Israeli strike against the Hezbollah-dominated portion of Lebanon's \ncapital city. In Beirut, there were four injuries when one strike hit a mosque. While Hezbollah said the facility was \nused only for prayer, Israel contended that it was one of several legitimate targets used not only for conventional \npurposes, but also by Hezbollah for its activities.\n\nOn that same day [July 23, 2006], Israel's aerial bombing of southern and eastern Lebanon continued in the early \nhours of Sunday. In the east, Israeli strikes caused engineers, who had been attempting  to repair impassable \nroads, to retreat for safety reasons. The southern town of Sidon, where several people had fled seeking safety, was \nhit by Israeli strikes.  As well, the city of Tyre was the site of action from both sides.  It was one of several places \nfrom which some Hezbollah militants were firing missiles and, as such, Israel made it a target of retaliatory strikes. \nThere were eight deaths reported across  Lebanon.  They included a young boy, a photographer, three people \nfleeing in a minibus, as well as three Hezbollah fighters.  On the other side of the border, two Israelis died in Haifa \nand over twenty  people were injured as a result of repeated Hezbollah rocket attacks.\n\nIn other developments, Kim Howells, a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United \nKingdom,  was scheduled to meet with the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Tzipi Livni.  Howells issued a rebuke of \nIsrael for essentially attacking the Lebanese nation in its effort to fight Hezbollah. However, he also expressed \nunderstanding of Israel's imperative to defend itself and condemned Hezbollah for exacerbating the conflict by \nhiding weapons in civilian-dominated areas.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the United States appeared reticent about getting actively involved since the start of the crisis. \nNevertheless, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was expected to depart for the Middle East on \nJuly 23, 2006. As well, foreign ministers from France and Germany were expected to travel to Israel for peace \ntalks.  Iran, which had been notably silent for some time, entered the mix with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nsuggesting that Israel's current conundrum had been self-inflicted.\n\nDiplomacy and Ceasefire Demands\n\nOn July 24, 2006, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in the Middle East for talks regarding \nthe crisis. Before arriving in the Middle East, Rice mentioned to reporters that the United States still had an \nembassy in Syria.  Her statement was interpreted by some as a reminder that the United States and Syria still \nshared diplomatic relations that could be leveraged, if necessary.  Her first stop was Lebanon where she met with \nPrime Minister Fuad Siniora. In that meeting, she expressed concern for the Lebanese people, while also making \nclear that Hezbollah's attacks on Israel from within Lebanese territory could not be permitted to continue.  She then \nleft for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.\n\nThere was no call issued for an immediate ceasefire.  In the backdrop of these developments, the White House \nannounced that it had authorized humanitarian aid to be sent to Lebanon.\n\nSecretary Rice, and later President Bush, both conveyed the view that the only possible solution to the conflict was \na sustainable ceasefire and enduring peace. The United States' stance has been that a ceasefire might result in \nonly Israeli compliance, thus subjecting Israel to future attacks.  Clearly, this view has not been shared by many \nworld leaders and foreign policy chiefs who have called for an immediate ceasefire, arguing that continued \nhostilities were untenable, regardless of optimal long-term objectives. Many Middle Eastern experts have further \nsaid that no long-term objectives can be achieved, at all, without addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIntensive talks between Western and Middle Eastern ministers were scheduled to take place on July 26, 2006 in \nRome.  Prior to the meeting, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said it was crucially important to achieve \nconcrete results aimed at resolving the conflict.\n\nJuly 24, 2006\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone in the last week of July 2006, Israeli forces moved northward from Maroun al-\nRas, the southern Lebanese town it had earlier taken control of, and were engaging Hezbollah fighters around the \ntown of Bint Jbeil.  In that fighting, ten Israeli soldiers were injured while two Hezbollah fighters were captured.  \nThe level of operations suggested that Israel was still carrying out only small-scale incursions across the border in \nLebanon. In one case, an Israeli helicopter crashed in northern Israel.  While Hezbollah said it had shot down the \naircraft, Israeli authorities said it crashed as a result of technical difficulties.\n\nThere was a lull in the Israeli strikes on Beirut on July 24, 2006, presumably due to the presence of Rice in the city \non that day.\n\nClashes and blasts elsewhere in Lebanon ensued nonetheless.  In one case,  there were allegations that clearly-\nmarked Red Cross vehicles had been hit by Israeli strikes.  Israeli efforts in Bint Jbeil appeared to have been \nsuccessful because it was later reported that they had taken control of the town and were advancing toward \nYaroun.  As well, Israel subsequently said during its incursions in southern Lebanon, that it had managed to kill Abu \nJaafar, a key Hezbollah commander.  Both Israel and Hezbollah confirmed that several of their troops had been \nkilled in the fighting.\n\nJuly 25, 2006\n\nOn July 25, 2006, the conflict was ongoing with blasts heard on both sides of the border -- from Beirut to Haifa. \nClearly, Israeli strikes on Lebanon's capital had resumed with explosions heard in Hezbollah-controlled areas of the \ncity. Hezbollah's efforts against Israel continued with a constant volley of rockets raining down on northern Israeli.  \n\n\n\nIn one case, a young Arab-Israeli girl was killed in the village of Maghar.  At the same time, Haifa continued to \nendure Hezbollah's ceaseless rocket offensive.  Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, appeared on Lebanese \ntelevision on this day warning that his forces were ready to attack more deeply into Israeli terrain.\n\nThe Deaths of the United Nations Peacekeepers\n\nMeanwhile, several days earlier on July 25, 2006, there were reports  that a United Nations observation post in \nsouthern Lebanon had been hit by Israeli military aircraft.  There were unconfirmed reports that four peacekeepers \nmight have killed. This was later confirmed when it was reported that four unarmed peacekeepers from Austria, \nCanada, China and Finland died when the United Nations post was struck.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary Kofi Annan expressed shock at the \"apparently deliberate targeting of the post,\" \nespecially since he claimed that Israel had assured him of the safety of United Nations personnel.  Israel \nresponded by conveying its regret over the matter. Some Israeli spokespersons criticized Annan for \"irresponsibly\" \naccusing their country of deliberate action before an investigation could be carried out.\n\nA day later, an initial report into the deaths of the United Nations peacekeepers was released.  The report indicated \nthat despite repeated contacts by the United Nations -- 10 in total -- with Israeli troops regarding the closeness of \nIsraeli strikes in the area, and regardless of promises from the Israelis that the shelling would stop, the United \nNations post was hit by a precision-guided missile following a period of about six hours of constant shelling. \n\nOne diplomat familiar with the report argued that if Israel had actually acted on the basis of the contacts, \"rather \nthan deliberately ignoring them,\"  the peacekeepers would still be alive.  As well, the Irish Foreign Ministry said that \none of its soldiers working for the United Nations warned Israel that its military activities were placing the lives of \nthe peacekeepers at risk.\n\nUnited Nations humanitarian aid chief, Jan Egeland, said on United States television that (1) the post had been a \nknown and clearly-marked structure for decades; (2) the Israeli prime minister had given personal assurances of \nsafety to head of the United Nations; (3) repeated contacts by the United Nations had been made regarding the \ndangerously close range of the shelling; (4) although Hezbollah operated  generally in southern Lebanon, \nHezbollah was not in close proximity of that particular post; and (5) the post had, in the end, been hit by a  missile \nknown for its precision.\n\nFor its part, Israel expressed deep regret regarding the deaths of the four United Nations peacekeepers and Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert personally telephoned United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to express his \ncondolences over what had happened.\n\nBoth Israel and the United Nations agreed to pursue a joint investigation into what transpired. At the same time, the \nUnited Nations said that it would meet to deliberate what course of action it should take. After lengthy talks on July \n27, 2006 in which no real consensus could be reached on the wording of a position statement, the United Nations \nSecurity Council released a declaration expressing deep shock and distress over the Israeli air strikes that killed \nfour peacekeepers.  China criticized the statement for being needlessly weak.\n\nA few days after the deaths of the four United Nations peacekeepers, another two peacekeepers were injured as a \nresult of the ongoing violence.  There was rising concern that many countries might be reluctant to contribute to \nfuture peacekeeping efforts, as a result of these incidences.\n\nJuly 26, 2006\n\nOn July 26, 2006 -- crisis talks in Rome ensued and ended with no agreement on the call for an immediate \nceasefire, despite an impassioned plea from Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora.  United States Secretary of \nState Rice was apparently one of few voices arguing against the ceasefire, which gave rise to difficult discussions \n\n\n\namong the parties present.  The Rome summit ended with the release of a declaration expressing \"determination to \nwork immediately to reach with utmost urgency a ceasefire to put an end to the current hostilities.\" The declaration \nalso included a description of a ceasefire as \"lasting, permanent and sustainable.\" The Rome summit did manage \nto advance calls for the creation of an international force that would enforce peace and stability along the Israel-\nLebanon border.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Israeli troops experienced one of their bloodiest and most challenging days. \nEight soldiers died and around 22 were injured in clashes with Hezbollah; it was the most significant loss of troops \nto Israel since the start of the conflict.  The clashes ensued at  Bint Jbeil -- the very town that Israel said it had \ntaken control of a day earlier.  In a separate incident of fighting, a ninth Israeli, this time an officer, was killed.  In the \ncity center of Tyre in Lebanon, a huge explosion destroyed a multi-storey complex, supposedly regarded as the \noffices of another Hezbollah commander.  On the other side of the border, Hezbollah continued its rocket assault on \nIsrael, leaving about 31 people injured.  It was estimated that Hezbollah was firing rockets at a rate of over 100 per \nday into Israel.\n\nThe Imperative for Stability\n\nThe escalation of hostilities between Israeli forces and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, in conjunction with Israel's \nongoing conflict in Gaza, spurred fears that the entire Middle Eastern region was at risk of being acutely \ndestabilized.\n\nKeeping these anxieties in mind, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and United Kingdom Prime Minister \nTony Blair called for an international force to be deployed to Lebanon.  The force would be tasked with stopping \nHezbollah's attacks on Israel, and in so doing, it would remove Israel's rationale for bombarding Lebanon. Although \na United Nations mission, UNIFIL, has been monitoring the Israeli-Lebanese border since 1978, it numbers less \nthan 2,000 in strength and has few means to enforce peace.  As such, a new stabilization force would have to be \nenshrined with far more power and capabilities.\n\nAmir Peretz, the Defense Minister of Israel, expressed support for the idea of an international peacekeeping force \nin southern Lebanon on July 23, 2006.  He particularly conveyed his backing for such a force to be led by NATO.  A \nday later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed his country's support for this plan, so long as the forces \ndeployed were both robust and enshrined with sufficient power as to be able to carry out their mandate.  The \nEuropean Union's chief of foreign policy, Javier Solana, further affirmed the plan when he stated that several \nEuropean countries would contribute to such a force, which might function under the aegis of the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n\nIsrael announced that it would maintain control over southern Lebanon until the proposed international force was \nactivated.  In this regards, Amir Peretz, Israel's Defense Minister, explained on July 25, 2006 that his country had \nno alternative saying, \"We have no other option. We have to build a new security strip that will be a cover for our \nforces.\"  It was not clear if Israel intended to hold control over a security zone even after the deployment of the \nproposed international force.\n\nFollowing the Rome summit on July 26, 2006, there had been a call for the creation of an international force, \nworking under a United Nations mandate, and with the mission of fully implementing existing United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions.  The statement also called  for the disarmament of militias and the deployment of \nLebanese troops on the border.\n\nJuly 27, 2006\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Hezbollah rockets continued to rain on northern Israel.  Targets hit the town of Kiryat Shmona \nand ignited fires.  Rockets also fell on fields close to Safed, Carmiel, Maalot and Shlomi. As well, the terrorist group \nal-Qaida, which has traditionally not worked in sync with Hezbollah, issued a statement suggesting that it would not \nsit on the sidelines as the conflict in southern Lebanon raged on. That same day, Israeli authorities said that while \n\n\n\nthey did not intend to expand their military offensive in Lebanon, they would call up additional troops from their \nreserve divisions to fortify their operations against Hezbollah. Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz said that Israel's \nmilitary operation would go on  until a secure border strip could be established, preventing Hezbollah's  return to \ncurrent positions.\n\nHis statement came a day after failed peace talks in Rome in which no agreement could be reached on a ceasefire.\n\nJuly 28, 2006\n\nOn July 28, 2006, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George W. Bush held \ntalks in Washington D.C.  The crisis in the Middle East factored highly during those discussions, which were \nfollowed by a call by the two leaders for \"lasting peace\" in the region. Bush also said that he and his British \ncounterpart both supported the establishment of an international force, which would work with the Lebanese military \nto maintain stability along the Israeli-Lebanese border zone. Despite increasing international pressure for the \ncessation of hostilities, however, there was no call for an immediate ceasefire from the respective British and \nAmerican leaders.  Meanwhile, the United Nations made its own call for a 72-hour truce aimed at facilitating the \ntransportation of aid and supplies.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Hezbollah reportedly fired a long-range rocket, the Khaibar-1, in the direction of \nIsrael; it landed just south of Haifa.  It was an apparent attempt to make good on an earlier threat to fire longer \nrange rockets more deeply into Israeli territory.  Another Hezbollah rocket -- this one of unknown origin and packed \nwith explosives -- hit an area around the town of Afula.\n\nSeveral Israelis were injured as a result of these and other rocket attacks on that day.  At the same time, the Israeli \nmilitary was carrying out strikes against targets in Lebanon, leaving at least a dozen people dead.  Israel also \nreported that it had killed a number of Hezbollah fighters in the town of Bint Jbei, which had been the site of serious \nclashes in recent days.  Civilians were again the unfortunate casualties of the hostilities when mortar rounds struck \na convoy of civilian vehicles as they tried to flee  southern Lebanon.  There was no conclusive knowledge about \nwho might be responsible for those injuries. Two members of the German media were also injured during the chaos \nof the day.  Elsewhere in Lebanon,  Israeli strikes left a Jordanian man dead and three people wounded in Kfar \nJoz.  Strikes were also being carried out on the Bekaa Valley in the east and southern villages around Tyre.\n\nJuly 29, 2006\n\nA day later on July 29, 2006, Israeli air strikes in the north of Lebanon resulted in the closure of the border crossing \nbetween Lebanon and Syria.  It was reported that missiles hit the area between the two countries' respective \nimmigration stations.\n\nIsraeli raids on southern Lebanon left several people dead.  There were reports that a mother and her five children \nwere among those killed. Israeli troops were still engaging Hezbollah fighters in Bint Jbeil, however, on  July 29, \n2006, Israeli troops withdrew from  the Hezbollah stronghold.  On the other side of the conflict, Israel continued to \nbe hit by volleys of rockets from Hezbollah. Safed was among the towns affected on July 29, 2006.  Israeli anxiety \nalso increased on this day as Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, promised that towns in the center of Israel could \nwell be targeted.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in the region for further talks -- this \ntime with a focus on the creation of an international force that would ensure security and stability in the conflict \nzone.  Rice warned that, at this point, negotiations were expected to be very difficult.  Meanwhile, Rice and other \nforeign policy leaders were also trying to craft a United Nations resolution, which would set forth key conditions \nassociated with the  long-term resolution of the crisis.\n\n\n\nAlso on July 29, 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed similar views to those previously-articulated by \nhis American counterpart, saying that there could not be a ceasefire until certain conditions [presumably those that \nwould ensure a long-term solution] were in place.  Jack Straw,  the leader of the British House of Commons and the \nformer Foreign Minister, endeavored to carve out quite a different stance.  Following on the heels of Minister of \nState Kim Howells, who had issued strong sentiments on the matter, Jack Straw criticized Israeli's military operation \nin Lebanon as \"disproportionate.\"  International Development Secretary Hilary Benn also raised concerns about the \nconflict.\n\nCivilian Deaths at Qana\n\nJuly 30, 2006 was likely to be remembered as one of the darkest days in the conflict taking place between Israeli \nforces and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  An Israeli air raid at Qana left more than 50 civilians dead -- the vast \nmajority of whom were women, children and senior citizens.  They had been seeking shelter from the violence in \nthe basement of a three-story house.  Survivors, as well as relatives of those killed, were reported to have been \nanguished about the bloodshed and confused about why they had been targeted.\n\nIsraeli authorities responded  by saying that they had warned civilians to leave the area.  They also furnished aerial \nfootage, apparently filmed two days earlier, which showed  missiles being fired from the area around Qana, as well \nas what seemed to be a missile launcher surreptitiously hidden in a house there.\n\nDespite this explanation, Lebanon's Prime Minister Fouad Siniora characterized the Israeli strikes in Qana as  \n\"heinous crimes against civilians.\"  For Siniora, along with many Lebanese, it was possible that this incident at \nQana evoked memories of a similar strike that took place a decade ago.  In 1996, Israel launched its \"Grapes of \nWrath\" operation, which was similarly aimed at destroying Hezbollah's base in Lebanon.  A United Nations post was \nhit by Israeli strikes and approximately 100 people, who had come to the post seeking refuge from the violence,  \ndied as a result.  Now, ten years later, a similar scenario had transpired.\n\nFor its part, Hezbollah promised retaliatory attacks.  Hezbollah soon acted upon that ominous promise and fired \nsuccessive waves of rockets into Israel later in the day, some of which hit the Israeli border town of Kiryat \nShemona.  Israelis said that they were experiencing the worst barrage of rocket attacks ever.\n\nRegardless, the deaths at Qana evoked recriminations and condemnations from the international community.  \nUnited Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan called for a vociferous rebuke by the international community and \nreiterated his demand for an immediate ceasefire. After several hours of discussions during an emergency session, \nthe United Nations Security Council issued a statement in which it unanimously expressed \"extreme shock and \ndistress\" over what had happened at Qana and  deplored the loss of life there. The Security Council, however, did \nnot call for an immediate ceasefire, despite Kofi Annan's earlier's appeal for one.\n\nNevertheless, the deaths at Qana appeared to have shifted the position of United Kingdom's leader, Tony Blair, \nsignificantly.  Only a day after he said that certain conditions had to be met before a ceasefire could ensue, Blair on \nJuly 30, 2006 said that some sort of resolution had to be forged \"as soon as possible,\" in order to resolve the \n\"catastrophe\" that befallen Lebanon.  Blair said, \"What has happened at Qana shows that this is a situation that \nsimply cannot continue.\" It was apparent that the events at Qana had spurred a notable change in perspective on \nhis part.  Indeed, Blair issued a joint statement with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, asserting that the tragedy of \nQana emphasized the \"urgency of the need for a ceasefire as soon as possible.\"\n\nOverall, perhaps the most important outcome of the Qana deaths appeared to have been  a renewed sense of \nurgency from among the international community to end the crisis, if only to stop further tragedies of this sort from \noccurring.\n\nJuly 31, 2006\n\nBy July 31, 2006, Israel had agreed to an immediate suspension of air strikes over southern Lebanon for a 48-hour \nperiod, in order to facilitate an investigation into what had transpired. Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador to the \n\n\n\nUnited States, said in an interview with British media that the suspension would allow the inquiry to take place, \nwhile also providing remaining civilians with time to evacuate the area.\n\nThe agreement to cease air strikes temporarily was reached following urgent talks between Israeli officials and the \nUnited States  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  For its part, however, the United States had not shifted its \nposition and did not join the increasing chorus of calls for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nThat was not to say that the views of all American politicians were unified on the matter.  Despite expressed \nsupport by the two houses of Congress for Israel on July 18, 2006  and July 20, 2006  respectively, United States \nSenator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, broke ranks with his party and the Bush administration to call for an \nimmediate ceasefire.  On July 31, 2006, Hagel declared, \"The sickening slaughter on both sides must end and it \nmust end now. President Bush must call for an immediate ceasefire. This madness must stop.\"\n\nAugust 1, 2006\n\nBy August 1, 2006, the Blair government was experiencing some internal dissonance as a result of differing \napproaches to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  Whereas the British Foreign \nOffice indicated its support for an immediate ceasefire, the stance from Downing Street was one that stopped short \nof that particular call.  The Foreign Office was not the only source of dissonance regarding Blair's stance.  As noted \nabove, comments from the Minister of State, the former Foreign Minister and leader of the House of Commons, as \nwell as the International Development Minister, indicated that several members of the Blair's Labour Party was \ndeparting company with the prime minister.  Now, days later,  a number of cabinet ministers were reported to have \ndispatched notes to the British prime minister during a cabinet meeting suggesting that their silence was not to be \ninterpreted as actual consent for Blair's position.\n\nWhile the internal struggle was going on within government of the United Kingdom, British Foreign Minister Beckett \njoined her counterparts within the European Union in the Belgian capital of Brussels to draft a proposal calling for \nan \"immediate cessation of hostilities,\" which would be followed by a sustainable ceasefire. That two-step process \nwould eventually facilitate both a political accord and the deployment of a multinational force to enforce stability in \nthe conflict zone.  The elements of the proposal were somewhat adapted to accommodate the varying perspectives \nof European governments on the conditions of a ceasefire.\n\nIn other diplomatic efforts, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy was in Beirut and met with his Iranian \ncounterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki.  Taking a different approach than that of the United States, the French diplomat \ncomplimented the Iranian nation and its heritage, presumably paving the way for harmonious discussions aimed at \nresolving the conflict.  The Foreign Minister's objectives were somewhat frustrated by the call from a senior Iranian \ncleric for Muslims to lend support to Hezbollah's fight against Israel.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Israeli tanks moved into southern Lebanon.  Following a security cabinet \nmeeting,  Israel had indicated that it was going to expand its ground offensive.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported in the southern part of Lebanon in several locations between Israeli troops and \nHezbollah fighters.\n\nIsraeli warplanes struck at targets on the ground, even as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert claimed that his \ncountry was succeeding in its efforts to nullify Hezbollah.  But at the same time,  Hezbollah was responding with \nfierce resistance. Casualties were reported on both sides as a result of the clashes. In the Lebanese town of \nLweizeh, an Israeli strike was said to have left a mother and her two children dead.  In Ait al-Shaab, where the \nstrongest exchange of fire was reported, an anti-tank missile  killed three Israeli soldiers and injured 25 others.  \nIsrael said that it had killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters there.\n\nHezbollah fighters were also reported to have been killed at Kfar Kila, Adiasse and Taibe, while Bint Jbeil continued \nto be the site of clashes.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the border, Hezbollah fired mortal shells into northern Israel, however, there were no rocket \nattacks.  The last day rockets were fired at Israel was July 31, 2006.\n\nDespite his claim that Israeli forces were winning the military battle against Hezbollah (noted just above), Ehud \nOlmert acknowledged that Israel would not be able to completely destroy Hezbollah's arsenal of weapons.  That \nsaid, he asserted that Israel's objective was to lessen the threat posed by Hezbollah.  Israel's Infrastructure \nMinister said that his country's troops would likely require another two weeks to finish this task.  In this regard,  \nBinyamin Ben-Eliezer said on Israeli Army Radio that this timeline would be needed  \"to complete the job, and by \nthat I mean that the area in which we want [an] international force to deploy is cleansed of Hezbollah.\"\n\nReports suggested that Israel's operations in Lebanon also involved forcing Hezbollah fighters to retreat as far as \nthe Litani River, located 18 miles (or 30 kilometers) north of the border.\n\nAlso on August 1, 2006, irrespective of previous announcements about a temporary halt on air strikes (made in late \nJuly 2006) and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor (made in the third week of July 2006), two Belgian \naircraft carrying humanitarian aid were prevented from landing in Beirut when Israel warned that it could not \nguarantee safe passage. Nevertheless, a day later, humanitarian efforts were underway with the  World Food \nProgramme saying that they had been given safe passage into Lebanon.\n\nAugust 2, 2006\n\nAfter a lull, Hezbollah resumed its attacks on Israel on August 2, 2006 with intensity.  Indeed, Hezbollah launched \nmore than 220 rockets into Israel from Lebanon.  It was the heaviest barrage of rockets in a single day since the \nstart of the conflict.  Intensity aside, this spate of attacks was also distinguished for the distance traveled.  Indeed, \nthere were reports that the rockets were hitting the targets deeply into Israeli territory.  One person was reported to \nhave been killed in Nahariya while several others were injured.  One rocket hit  Beit Shean on the edge of the West \nBank, while another hit the West Bank itself.\n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Israel was successfully destroying Hezbollah's \ninfrastructure.  He also foreclosed any hope of an immediate ceasefire by asserting that no such action would be \ntaken until an international force was deployed in southern Lebanon.\n\nHis comments suggested confidence in the operations being carried out by the Israeli military.  Indeed, earlier in the \nday, Israeli troops assaulted a Hezbollah stronghold, Baalbek, located in the north eastern part of Lebanon.  There, \nIsraeli troops raided a hospital that was said to be used by Hezbollah fighters and seized five people.  Israeli \nauthorities claimed that the five individuals were Hezbollah fighters, but Hezbollah disputed the claim and said they \nwere civilians.  Regardless, the fact that Israeli commandos had managed to infiltrate Lebanese territory, even \nreaching a part of the country located close to the border with Syria, served to bolster Israeli claims of mission \nsuccess.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters were ongoing.\n\nOn the diplomatic front the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations expressed the view that an initial \nSecurity Council resolution aimed at end the violence was close at hand.\n\nAmidst these developments, Iran's supreme leader echoed the earlier words of  a senior cleric and called on the \nMuslim world to stand with Hezbollah against Israel.\n\nAugust 3, 2006\n\nIsrael continued to carry out its offensive operation into southern Lebanon, destroying  several interests in the \nregion along the way, but taking a toll in the form of the lives of four Israeli soldiers.  Nevertheless, Israeli \n\n\n\nauthorities appeared to be planning intensified attacks, as evidenced by the dropping of  leaflets in Beirut  warning \nresidents of a new military operation against Hezbollah. As well, Defense Minister Amir Peretz was reported to have \ninformed top military commanders that they should prepare to advance northward of the border with Lebanon \ntoward the River Litani.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict, Hezbollah's rocket attacks on August 3, 2006 resulted in the deaths of at least \neight civilians in northern Israel.  As well, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned that further attacks by \nIsrael would result in the bombing of Tel Aviv.\n\nMeanwhile, diplomats at the United Nations were attempting to craft a resolution that would bring an end to the \nfighting.  Such a result was to be welcomed by humanitarian agencies, which warned that their relief operations \nwere being hampered by the destruction of infrastructure as well as fuel shortages.\n\nAugust 4, 2006\n\nOn August 4, 2006, an Israeli strike left 26 people dead and at least 20 people injured.  Most of the victims were \nSyrian Kurdish farm workers in the village of Qaa, located in the Bekaa Valley along Lebanon's north-eastern \nborder with Syria.  Israeli strikes also hit bridges in Christian areas in northern Beirut, as well as bridges along \nLebanon's coastal highway.  Five people were reported to have been killed when the coastal bridges were \ndecimated.  As well, an Israeli air raid on Taibeh in the southern part of Lebanon resulted in the deaths of seven \npeople and injuries to 10 others.  Meanwhile, Israeli fighters continued to engage Hezbollah fighters in southern \nLebanon, in an attempt to push Hezbollah's forces northward from the border toward the Litani River.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict, Hezbollah fired 190 rockets into Israel, leaving three civilians dead.  The attacks \nevoked fears about Hezbollah's capacities since some rockets landed as many as 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the \nborder.  Indeed, the town of Hadera, just 30 miles (45 kilometers) north of Tel Aviv, was among the areas hit.\n\nIn addition to concerns about the increased range of the rockets being fired by Hezbollah, there was anxiety about \nthe amplified volume of rockets.  In recent days, the number of rocket attacks by Hezbollah had increased \nsubstantially to close to 200 per day -- double the number of attacks that had become the norm in the first few \nweeks of the conflict.  In anticipation of a possible missile attack against Tek Aviv, Israeli authorities urged the city's \nresidents to ensure that they were able to access bomb shelters.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested that a United Nations \nresolution regarding the conflict could be pass within days.  At issue was the phraseology of a possible ceasefire \nresolution. However, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert signaled that with or without a resolution, Israel's offensive \nwould continue  until an international force was actually deployed in southern Lebanon.\n\nAugust 5, 2006\n\nClashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon continued on August 5, 2006.  Several \ncasualties were reported as a result of a raid by Israeli troops on an apartment in Tyre, which was said to house \nHezbollah fighters.  The Israeli military claimed that Hezbollah militants made up the casualty list; the Israeli military \nalso acknowledged that eight of its own soldiers had been wounded in the raid. Israel additionally warned people \nin Sidon to avoid areas where rockets might be launched, presumably auguring strikes against such targets.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Israel continued to be pounded by a barrage of rocket attacks from Hezbollah.  \nAgain, the number of rocket attacks far exceeded the previous volume and numbered in excess of 170 on August 5, \n2006, leaving three women dead.  Haifa was among the places hit by the rocket attacks on this day, and five people \nwere reported to have been injured as a result.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, differences regarding the wording of a possible ceasefire agreement were being worked out \nas the United States and France came to agreement on the matter.  The draft of the proposed United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution apparently called for a \"full cessation of hostilities,\" demanded that Hezbollah \nimmediately cease all attacks, and declared that Israel immediately halt its offensive military operations.\n\n\n\nThe wording was deliberately crafted to allow Israel some room to defend itself in the face of attack. It was hoped \nthat the resolution, which still had to be passed in the 15-member Security Council of the United Nations, would \nbring a quick end to the violence.  United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George \nW. Bush lauded the diplomatic progress being made.\n\nIn other developments, humanitarian aid agencies warned that the destruction to infrastructure in Lebanon, and \nparticularly to bridges, was making it very difficult to transport supplies to people in need of help.  Meanwhile, the \nsituation in the Middle East was spurring people from across the world to take to the streets to protest the violence \nand to call for a ceasefire.  Such demonstrations were taking place from Baghdad to London.\n\nAugust 6, 2006\n\nAugust 6, 2006 was the bloodiest day experienced on the Israeli side of the conflict. At least 15 people were killed \nin northern Israel as a result of relentless rocket attacks by Hezbollah. The port city of Haifa was especially hard hit \non this day, with three deaths, dozens of injuries and the collapse of a building.  Israelis were also dying on \nLebanese soil as evidenced by the deaths of 12 soldiers during an attack on the town of Kfar Giladi.  It was the \nhighest number of Israeli deaths in a single incident since the start of the conflict.\n\nIn Lebanon, Israeli strikes killed approximately 14 people.  In the coastal town of Naquora, three people were killed \nin strikes while five civilians died as a result of an air raid in the village of Ansar. The Israeli military reported that its \nforces had launched strikes on a site in Qana where it said rocket launchers were being housed. The military also \nsaid that it had destroyed rocket launchers to the north of Tyre.  Fresh strikes were carried out on the southern \nsuburbs of Beirut, the area of Tyre, as well as the eastern Bekaa Valley.  Clashes between Israeli soldiers and \nHezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were also ongoing.\n\nIn the diplomatic sphere, Lebanon formally issued a request of the United Nations Security Council. In that request, \nLebanon asked that a provision be added calling on Israel to withdraw from Lebanese terrain. Syria also weighed \ninto the diplomatic process by characterizing the current draft of the proposed resolution as a \"recipe for the \ncontinuation of the war.\" For its part, the Israeli government was generally happy with the draft resolution.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israeli government noted that Israeli forces were prepared to withdraw from Lebanon once \nthe resolution was passed, and so long as Israel had satisfactorily incapacitated Hezbollah's strongholds.\n\nAugust 7, 2006\n\nIsraeli air raids on Lebanon on August 7, 2006, resulted in the deaths of almost 50 people.  Among those killed \nwere up to 30 people in southern Beirut who died in air strikes.  Lebanon's Prime Minister Fuad Siniora corrected a \nclaim that an earlier Israeli air strike had left 40 civilians dead.  Instead, five people were reported to have been \nkilled in the earlier strike.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were ongoing \nwith three Israeli soldiers and five Hezbollah militants killed at Bint Jbeil.  On the other side of the conflict, \nHezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel, resulting in civilian casualties.\n\nThe issue of civilian casualties was the topic of a report issued by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, in \nwhich the targeting of civilians was strongly criticized.  Annan said that military operations by both sides, in which \ncivilians suffered the consquences of indiscriminate attacks, constituted a violation of international law. The \nbombing at Qana was specifically noted in this regard.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States President George W. Bush conveyed strong support for the United Nations \ndraft resolution, stating that he wanted to see the document passed in the Security Council as soon as possible.  \nThat said, the draft resolution remained in doubt,  as Arab ministers echoed Lebanese demands for changes to the \nproposed resolution.\n\n\n\nAugust 8, 2006\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Israeli fighter jets struck at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.  In the village of Ghaziyeh, at least six \npeople were killed and two dozen injured.  Another strike left 13 villagers dead as they attended a funeral for those \npreviously killed in air raids. One person died when Israeli strikes hit Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp at \nEin el-Hilweh. Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were ongoing, with at \nleast three Israeli soldiers dying in addition.  There was not word about casualties among Hezbollah factions. On \nthe other side of the border, Hezbollah continued its barrage of rocket attacks against southern Israel.\n\nWith rocket attacks increasing, Israel said that it would temporarily relocate remaining residents from the city of \nKiryat Shmona to a safer area.  Compared to the rest of northern Israel, Kiryat Shmona had suffered  the most \nattacks by Hezbollah.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel was stepping up its operations to move toward the Litani River. Israel had earlier dropped \nleaflets in Tyre, the largest Lebanese city south of the Litani River, warning of military strikes to come.  But with \nmany roadways in the area bombed and destroyed, those still in the villages around Tyre were expected to have \ndifficulties trying to get out. Israel also warned that as its forces advanced toward the river, any moving vehicles \nspotted in the area south of the Litani would be destroyed.  Given the clear risk outlined by Israel, the United \nNations decided to stop its aid convoy from traveling in that zone.\n\nIn the realm of diplomacy, the United Nations Security Council debated the draft resolution aimed at ending the \nviolence and bloodshed.  At the same time, a delegation from the Arab League traveled to the headquarters of the \ninternational body to officially express backing for Lebanon's demands.  Lebanon had argued that the draft \nresolution should be altered so that it expressly called for Israel's immediate withdrawal from Lebanese terrain.  As \nwell, there were differences over the phrasing in some parts of the draft, which called on Israel to end its \"offensive\" \nmilitary operations, while madating that Hezbollah end \"all\" its attacks.  It was not clear how these demands for \nchanges to the document would be received by the Security Council, especially since many key members appeared \nsupportive of the current version of the draft.  Moreover, France and the United States, who made great headway in \nagreeing to the current terms of the draft, were not apt to make any changes. On the other side of the equation, \nhowever, Russia said that it could not vote for a resolution that did not have the backing of Lebanon.  A vote on the \nresolution was not expected until later in the week.\n\nAugust 9, 2006\n\nOn August 9, 2006, heavy fighting in Lebanese villages close to the Lebanese-Israeli border resulted in the deaths \nof 15 Israeli soldiers and 40 Hezbollah fighters.  Israeli soldiers later commenced an operation against Hezbollah \nin Khiam. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes continued to bombard targets in Lebanon.  As a result of air strikes in the Bekaa \nValley, a building believed to have housed a Hezbollah fighter collapsed, killing six people.  Beirut continued to be \nhit by Israeli strikes, resulting in deaths of several people.  On the other side of the border, Israel was still dealing \nwith Hezbollah's rocket attacks.\n\nOn the same day, the Israeli cabinet approved sending troops further north toward the Litani River.  However, the \ncabinet also agreed to delay the advancement of the troops in the hopes that a diplomatic resolution could be \nfound.  The plan to deploy Israeli troops northward was not new; it had been discussed for several days in advance \nof the official approval by cabinet.\n\nIn the realm of diplomacy, France and the United States worked on redrafting the original text of the proposed \nUnited Nations resolution.  The redrafting exercise occurred after the two countries disagreed on the proper course \nof action.  Given Lebanon's opposition to the original text on the basis that it did not expressly call for Israel's \nwithdrawal from its own terrain, France said that it would work toward adjustments in the text.  By contrast, \nhowever, the United States was reluctant to make any changes.  The situation set the stage for a possible impasse, \nand by extension, the continuation of hostilities.  Consequently,  French President Jacques Chirac argued that it \nwould be \"immoral\" to relinquish diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire.\n\n\n\nAugust 10, 2006\n\nOn August 10, 2006, Israel  dropped another wave of warning leaflets over south Beirut auguring further air strikes \nto come, and urging residents to flee.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters were reported in \nMarjayoun.  At the same time,  Hezbollah rocket attacks were pounding targets in Israel, leaving two people dead \nin the Arab village of Deir al-Assad. Meanwhile, Jan Egeland, the head of the United Nations' humanitarian agency, \ndecried both Israel and Hezbollah for creating a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon by preventing the transportation of \nmuch-needed aid and relief supplies.  On the diplomatic front, further efforts were being extended to forge a \ndipomatic resolution that would bring an end to the violence and bloodshed, while setting the terms for sustainable \npeace in the region.\n\nAugust 11, 2006\n\nAs diplomatic efforts were going on in New York on August 11, 2006, to try to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, \nviolence was unabated.  Israeli troops were moving toward the Litani River, with the objective of pushing back \nHezbollah fighters and thusly establishing a de facto security zone.  In Beirut, Israeli strikes were ongoing. \nElsewhere in Lebanon, an attack by an Israeli drone left about four people dead in the town of Marjayoun, located in \nthe south of the country.  Hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and police stranded at barracks  in that very town of \nMarjayoun were being evacuated by United Nations troops. To the north,  Israeli air strikes at a  bridge near the \nLebanon-Syria border left approximately 12 civilians dead.  One Israeli  soldier died in fighting in western Lebanon, \nwhile close to 20 were reported to have been injured in southern Lebanon. On the other side of the border, several \ncasualties were reported in northern Israel as a result of a barrage of missile attacks by Hezbollah.\n\nOn the diplomatic agenda, media reports on August 11, 2006 suggested that the United Nations Security Council \nwas set to debate and vote on a new draft resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The text \nof the draft, which had been changed to reflect concerns articulated by Lebanon about a withdrawal of Israeli \ntroops, called for a \"full cessation of hostilities,\" and made provisions for Israeli troops to pull back from Lebanese \nterrain as local and United Nations forces were deployed along the border.  The draft also authorized an expansion \nof the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known by the acroym UNIFIL, along with increased \nenforcement powers. Left out of the text was a reference to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which would \nfacilitate the use of force if certain conditions were not met.\n\nIllustrating Israel's dual-pronged approach toward a mix of military tactics along with a diplomatic strategy, Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert was reported to have said that he accepted the new ceasefire plan.  This revelation \ncame after Olmert had already directed Israeli troops to expand its offensive operations in Lebanon, presumably \nbecause of the bleak prospect of an acceptable resolution  being passed by the United Nations Security Council \nearlier in the day.  Now, with a shift in the proverbial winds, Olmert was expected to call on his cabinet to sanction \nthe resolution within the next few days.  It was expected that Israeli's military operations would continue until that \ntime.\n\nMeanwhile, an affirmative vote within the United Nations Security Council was expected shortly.  While not perfectly \nin line with the desires of either Israel or Lebanon, the new draft appeared to be acceptable to both parties as well. \nIn a passionate speech at the convening of the Security Council session, United Nations Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan decried the international body's failure to act in a more timely manner, saying that it had \"badly shaken\" the \ninternational community's confidence in the United Nations.  Still, later on August 11, 2006, the United Nations \nSecurity Council unanimously approved Resolution 1701.\n\nA policy adviser in the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora cautiously welcomed the passage of \nthe new resolution. United States Secretary of State, Condoleezzza Rice, declared that agreement would \"open a \npath to lasting peace between Lebanon and Israel.\"  Her French counterpart, Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-\nBlazy, characterized  called the passage of the resolution as \"a historic turning point.\" United Kingdom  Prime \nMinister Tony Blair lauded the resolution and called for an  immediate end to hostilities.  He also said that he \nintended to travel to the Middle East to personally revitalize the stalled peace process between Israelis and \n\n\n\nPalestinians.  But on the other side of the equation, Qatar, which at the time held a seat on the Security Council as \na non-permanent member, criticized the resolution for containing provisions that favored Israel.\n\nAugust 12, 2006\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced on August 12, 2006 that that the ceasefire called for in \nSecurity Council Resolution 1701 would go into effect at 05:00GMT on August 14, 2006.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that his group intended to abide by the United Nations ceasefire, \nhowever, he warned that fighting would prevail while Israeli troops were still inside Lebanon. Such a position \npromised that there would be no immediate end to the hostilities.  This was because Israel had said that it would \ntake some time to draw down its troops while  UNIFIL forces were deployed -- a process that could well take close \nto a month. For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert issued praise for Resolution 1701, characterizing it as \nboth positive and acceptable.  He also said that he would seek approval from his cabinet on August 13, 2006 to \nabide by the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's ground assault in Lebanon continued, with particular effort expended by forces moving north to \nthe Litani River.  In southern and northern Lebanon, air strikes by Israeli fighter jets carried on with some deaths \nreported in the southern city of Tyre.\n\nAugust 13, 2006\n\nOn August 13, 2006, the Israeli cabinet endorsed United Nations Security Resolution 1701, but warned that its \ntroops would not exit Lebanon until UNIFIL forces were deployed.  That position, in conjunction with the stance \narticulated earlier by Hezbollah that it would abide by the ceasefire only when Israeli troops were out of Lebanon, \nsuggested that fighting was destined to continue until the deployment of the newly-madated United Nations forces \n(UNIFIL).  Indeed, United Nations Deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown said that it could take up to a \nmonth to install UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. For its part, Lebanon's cabinet postponed an important meeting to \ndiscuss the disarmament of Hezbollah -- a key directive set forth in Security Resolution 1701.\n\nMeanwhile,  the conflict raged on in Israel and Lebanon. Israeli strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including \nthe cities of Tyre and Beirut, left close to 20 people dead.  Aid personnel and rescue workers said that Israeli air \nstrikes had resulted in the collapse of several buildings in southern Beirut.  There were also reports of strikes in \neastern Lebanon.  In fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters, five Israeli soldiers were reported to \nhave been killed.  Among those who died was Uri Grossman, the son of renowned Israeli writer and peace activist, \nDavid Grossman.  The younger Grossman died as a result of an anti-tank missile only days after the older \nGrossman joined a call by Israeli intelligentsia for an end to the violence.  On the other side of the conflict, \nHezbollah fired a relentless barrage of rockets into Israel, this time numbering around 250 in total.\n\nAugust 14, 2006\n\nOn the first day of the ceasefire, relative calm reigned both in northern Israel and across Lebanon, with only \nsporadic fighting reported in disparate areas.  The easing of hostilities ensued despite earlier assertions by \nHezbollah that it would continue its fighting until Israel left Lebanon, and regardless of the fact that Israel said it \nwould remain in Lebanon until UNIFIL forces were installed.\n\nIsrael also issued a statement noting that it intended to pursue Hezbollah leaders.\n\nDisplaced Lebanese attempted to traverse bombed-out roads to return to their homes despite the fact that travel \nrestrictions were still in place.  On the other side of the border, few people in northern Israel left their bomb shelters, \nevidently not quite willing to trust yet that the ceasefire would hold. \n\n\n\nLater in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed satisfaction in his country's elimination of \nHezbollah's dominance in southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a televised address in \nwhich he claimed \"historic victory.\"\n\nIn the backdrop of these competing claims of victory, President George W. Bush of the United States and President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed one another for spurring the conflict.\n\nAugust 15, 2006\n\nThe second day of the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was marked by occasional spurts of \nfighting.  In one case, five Hezbollah gunmen were reported to have been shot by Israeli soldiers.  In another case, \nHezbollah militants fired several mortars in the direction of Israel, however, none landed across the border.  Amidst \nthese intermittent bursts of violence, efforts were underway to try to find bodies of the dead.\n\nMeanwhile,  the United Nations said that it was hoping to establish 3,500 troops in southern Lebanon within two \nweeks and up to 15,000 within a month.  Most of the soldiers were expected to come from France.  In the \nbackdrop of this announcement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hailed Hezbollah's victory and said that it \naugured a new Middle East.  At the same time, he assailed the United States' perspective of the region.\n\nAugust 16, 2006\n\nThe third day of the fragile ceasefire ensued much like the previous day -- with the truce holding in spite of sporadic \nviolence.\n\nIsrael warned that southern Lebanon was vulnerable to the resumption of violence until United Nations troops were \ndeployed and the Lebanese military was operating in the border region.\n\nNegotiations were ongoing to formulate a United Nations peacekeeping force as called for in United Nations \nSecurity Resolution 1701 to enforce the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. France was contributing the lion's \nshare of troops, also the force would also include the Lebanese army.  France said that it might be prepared to \ncommand the peacekeeping mission but only if certain conditions were in effect.  Other than France, other countries \nsaid that they might be joining the effort, but no formal pledge of troops was made.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations said that approximately 250,000 Lebanese people had returned to their homes with \nhalf a million Lebanese en route.\n\nAugust 17, 2006\n\nAugust 17, 2006 was marked by the crossing of the Litani River by Lebanese military, which then took up positions \nin the area of the strategically-located waterway as Israeli troops withdrew.  The Israeli military also said that it had \ntransferred control of up to half of its positions in southern Lebanon to the current (not-yet fortified) United Nations \npeacekeeping mission there.  In order to stave off the chance of bloodshed should a wave of attacks resume, Israel \ndropped new leaflets urging people not to travel in and around southern Lebanon.  Despite this warning, displaced \nLebanese people worked their way home.\n\nAugust 18, 2006\n\nIn the Lebanese capital of Beirut on August 18, 2006, Hezbollah representatives handed out disbursements of \n$12,000 to residents whose homes and businesses had been decimated in the conflict between its group and \nIsrael.  By this day, up to 400,000 Lebanese had returned home to southern Lebanon.  In the town of Qana where \na number of people were killed in an Israeli air strike that garnered international condemnation, relatives of the dead \nhosted a mass funeral.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations called on European countries to come forward and contribute troops to the \npeacekeeping force in Lebanon, which had been provided for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701.  \nThus far, only France had expressed the possibility of contributing troops, however, Italy added its bid to the list of \ncountries willing to participate in the peacekeeping mission.  Italy also said that it was prepared to take the \nleadership role in the operation.\n\nThe call from the United Nations came on the heels of a complaint by Israel that it would be \"inconceivable\" that \npeacekeepers be accepted from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, which deny the right of Israel to exist.\n\nAugust 19, 2006\n\nOn August 19, 2006, Israel carried out an air raid in the Bekaa Valley deep within Lebanese territory.  One Israeli \nand three Hezbollah fighters were reported to have been killed.  The Lebanese government described the air raid \nas a blatant violation of the existing ceasefire, however, the Israeli government said it was responding to an attempt \nby Hezbollah to rearm itself.  It thus claimed that Hezbollah and not Israel was in violation of the ceasefire \nagreement.  The scenario unfolded only hours after United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan characterized the \nsituation in the conflict zone as \"fragile.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the first of the new deployments of United Nations  peacekeepers arrived on the ground; these included \n50 engineers from France.\n\nAugust 20, 2006\n\nA day after Israel said that it had carried out an air raid in the Bekaa Valley to prevent Hezbollah from rearming \nitself, Lebanon's Defense Minister Elias Murr warned that anyone firing rockets into Israel from the south would be \nregarded as a traitor.  His warning came along with an expression of confidence regarding Hezbollah's commitment \nto the existing ceasefire set forth un United Nations Security Resolution 1701.  In the backdrop of these \ndevelopments. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan rejected Israel's explanation for the air raid, noting \nthat it was indeed a violation of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, France called on the European Union to convene a meeting to discuss involvement in the United \nNations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon.  At issue were Israel's concerns about the composition of the \nforce, as well as overall concerns about deployment.  Emphasizing what had already been noted, Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Olmert said that peacekeepers from countries that did not have diplomatic relations  with Israel were \nnot acceptable. \n\nAugust 21, 2006\n\nAttention turned on August 21, 2006 to reconstruction of the conflict-ravaged region when United States President \nGeorge W. Bush said that there would be an aid package earmarked for Lebanon's reconstruction worth \napproximately $230 million in United States currency (USD).  Bush also called for the deployment of a United \nNations (U.N.) peacekeeping force in Lebanon as quickly as possible.\n\nOn that particular issue,  Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi was reported to have told U.N.  Secretary General \nKofi Annan that Italy was willing to lead the peacekeeping mission. As regards Israel's opposition to the \nparticipation of certain countries as peacekeepers -- notably from countries that did not recognize the state of Israel \n-- U.N. Deputy General Mark Malloch Brown noted that Israel did not have the power to foreclose participation by \nany specific country, regardless of whether or not there were diplomatic ties.\n\nAt home in Israel, hundreds of Israeli army reservists signed an open letter calling for a massive investigation into \nthe handling of the war against Hezbollah. At issue was the lack of decisive leadership by the military and \npoliticians, exemplified by ever-shifting objectives of the war.\n\n\n\nAcross the border in southern Lebanon, the discovery of British-made night-vision equipment in Hezbollah bunkers \nwas believed to be British,  led to the launching of an investigation by the British authorities.  At issue in this case \nwas the question of how that equipment came to be in Hezbollah's possession.\n\nMeanwhile, sporadic hostilities ensued, exemplified by the killing of two Hezbollah fighters by Israel.  The Israeli \nmilitary explained that the Hezbollah fighters were among a group of men who approached their troops in a \n\"threatening manner\" in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah did not concur with this version of events.  For its part, \nHezbollah's deputy leader Sheikh Naeem Kassem rejected requirements for the militant group's disarmament \nsaying on al-Jazeera Arabic television that the resistance would continue. Nevertheless, Terje Roed-Larsen, a \nsenior U.N. envoy, expressed optimism regarding the prevailing ceasefire.\n\nAugust 22, 2006\n\nOn the heels of the news that Italy was willing to both contribute troops  and act lead the peacekeeping mission in \nthe conflict zone,  Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema tempered the announcement by noting that his \ncountry's involvement was contingent upon a commitment to respect for the prevailing ceasefire.  The Italian \nForeign Minister also called on the European Union to convene an urgent meeting of foreign ministers to discuss \nthe contribution of European forces to Middle East peacekeeping efforts.\n\nOn the issue of the peacekeeping mission, senior United Nations envoy Terje Roed-Larsen warned that Lebanon \nwould likely experience a security vacuum while organization was being established. In other developments, the \nhuman rights group, Amnesty International, accuse Israel of committing war crimes by deliberately targeting civilian \ninfrastructure in Lebanon.  It was a claim vociferously denied by Israel.  Amnesty International also demanded a \nUnited Nations investigation into war tactics of both Israel and Hezbollah aimed at determining of any humanitarian \nlaws had been breached.\n\nAugust 23, 2006\n\nA meeting between European Union ambassadors and military official convened in Belgium at which the issue of \nEurope's contribution to a United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping force on the Israeli-Lebanese border was discussed.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after a senior U.N. envoy warned of a security vacuum in Lebanon as the  proposed \npeacekeeping mission was being established, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called for quick action on the \nmatter.  She particularly noted that time was running short for the application of the U.N. ceasefire resolution along \nthe Lebanese-Irsaeli border.\n\nIn a related development, Israel also suggested that U.N. peacekeeping troops also patrol the Lebanese-Syrian \nborder in order to prevent the movement of arms by Hezbollah.  But Syrian President Bashar al-Assad soundly \nrejected Israel's suggestion, stating that such a measure would be viewed as a \"hostile act.\"  Syria later said that it \nwould close its border with Lebanon if such a move was implemented.\n\nIn a separate development, one Israeli soldier was killed and three others were injured when their military tank hit a \nlandmine in southern Lebanon.\n\nAugust 24, 2006\n\nFinland, which held the presidency of the European Union in late August 2006, said that United Nations (U.N.) \ntroops should be deployed to the conflict zone within a week.  The announcement by Finland came at a time of \nincreasing urgency regarding the establishment of peacekeeping forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border.  Also on \nthe subject of the peacekeeping mission, France pledged an additional 1,600 troops to the effort and registered its \nwillingness to continue to lead the force.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese were returning home.  In southern Lebanon, returning residents \nfaced the problems of a lack of proper sanitation and no potable water.  To this end, the U.N.  launched a 60-day \nplan to deal with the humanitarian situation in Lebanon.\n\n\n\nAugust 27, 2006\n\nOn August 27, 2005, Hezbollah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, expressed his regret regarding the war between \nhis group and Israel on Lebanese terrain.  In an interview on Lebanese television, Nasrallah acknowledged that he \nhad ordered the capture of the two Israeli soldiers -- the incident that resulted in Israel's military response and \neffectively sparked the war.  He said that had he known the extent of the repercussions of his actions -- a conflict \nlasting approximately one month and resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people -- he would have acted \ndifferently. In the interview, Nasrallah also said that he did not expect fighting to resume, effectively suggesting that \nhis group was likely to hold to the ongoing truce.\n\nAugust 30, 2006\n\nThe issue of Israel's blockade of Lebanon came to the fore at the close of August 2006.  Despite the presence of \nan ongoing truce, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert rejected calls for an end to his country's seven-week blockade \nof Lebanon.  Following discussions with United Nations (U.N.) Secretary General Kofi Annan, Olmert said the \nblockade would be lifted when all the ceasefire requirements were implemented. Olmert particularly specified one of \nthe central conditions for an end to Israel's blockade of Israel as being the release of two Israeli soldiers captured \nby Hezbollah.  He said that unless the two Israeli soldiers were freed, the U.N. Security Council Resolution could \nnot \"be considered as fully implemented.\"\n\nAnnan echoed Olmert's call for this condition to be met and appealed for the \"unambiguous and unconditional \nrelease\" of the soldiers.\n\nIt was unclear if such a measure would actually materialize.  Indeed, Lebanese Energy Minister Mohammed Fneish \nwho was also a member of the political wing of Hezbollah said that the unconditional release of the Israeli soldiers \nwas \"not possible.\"  He said that the Israeli soldiers would only be freed within the constraints of a prisoner \nexchange with Israel.\n\nThe close of August 2006 was also marked by the denunciation of Israel's use of cluster bombs during its conflict \nwith Hezbollah on Lebanese terrain. The U.N said that the cluster bombs had caused death and injuries, and the \nU.N. Mine Action Coordination Center said that up to 100,000 unexploded cluster \"bomblets\" had been found at \nhundreds of sites in Lebanon. The U.N.'s humanitarian head, Jan Egeland, characterized the use of cluster bombs \nin the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as \"immoral.\"  He argued that the majority of the cluster bomb strikes \nhad taken place in the last days of the conflict, when a resolution appeared likely.  He thusly said that the strikes \nmade at that sensitive time were \"shocking.\"\n\nFor its part, Israel said that its use of such munitions was compliant with international law.  That said, there were \nsome media reports that the bombs had been purchased from the United States on the basis of conditional use, the \nrequirements of which may not have been met.  The United States said that it was investigating whether or not \nIsrael had used the cluster bombs on non-military targets, which was prohibited under the terms of the sale \nagreement.  Even so, a conditional use agreement between Israel and the United States would not constitute an \nactual violation of international law.\n\nIn other developments, the European Commission pledged 42 million euros toward the reconstruction of Lebanon.  \nAt home in Lebanon, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said that his government would allot $33,000 in compensation to \ntens of thousands of families whose homes were destroyed in the conflict.\n\nAugust 31, 2006\n\nA donor conference in Sweden on August 31, 2006 focused on raising funds to be used toward Lebanon's post-war \nreconstruction.  The Swedish Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson said that $940 million in new funds had been pledged -- \nbringing the total reconstruction funds to $1.2 billion.  The event was an apparent success given the fact that the \nconference's organizers had aimed to collect $500 million.\n\n\n\nSeptember 4, 2006\n\nBy the start of September 2006, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said that Israel and Hezbollah had accepted \nhis offer to mediate the dispute over two captured Israeli soldiers.  Despite this announcement by the U.N. head, \nIsrael publicly reiterated its stance that the soldiers had to be released unconditionally and noted that this was a \ncondition of the U.N. Security Council resolution, which  brought an end to the war between Israel and Hezbollah.  \nWithin this context, Israel said that Annan would assist in the release of its soldiers, rather than mediate an \nagreement.  Many analysts surmised that despite its public pronouncements, Israel may have privately \nacknowledged that a deal would have  to be brokered in order to garner the release of the two soldiers.\n\nSeptember 6, 2006\n\nOn September 6, 2006, Israel said that it intended to lift its air, land and sea blockade of  Lebanon.  The \nannouncement came days after Israel firmly stated that it would not lift its blockade until all conditions of the \nprevailing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 were met.  Israel said that it was holding its position in \norder to prevent Hezbollah for accessing weaponry.  Israel said that it did not intend to to lift the embargo until \ninternational forces were fully deployed in the conflict zone and could ensure that the transport of weaponry did not \ntake place.  News that French, Greek and Italian troops would patrol the conflict zone, followed later by German \nforces, appeared to have assuaged Israel in some measure. \n\nAs well, the shift in stance may have been attributed partially to mounting international pressure, in conjunction with \nefforts to release the two Israeli soldiers, whose capture sparked the war between Israel and Lebanon.  For its \npart, Israel has publicly said that it will not negotiate with terrorists -- a reference to Hezbollah.  That said, some \nsources suggest that  efforts are underway to try to secure the release of the soldiers -- a process that may well \ninvolve engagement by Israel at some point, as well as the possibility of deal-making.\n\nLater in September, 2006\n\nLater in September 2006, with the truce in full force, the human rights group, Amnesty International, accused \nHezbollah of war crimes. It had previously made a similar charge against Israel.  Amnesty said that \nHezbollah's conduct of aggression from civilian terrain was classified as a war crime.  Also in September 2006, \nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, led a victory rally in southern Beirut to proclaim the success of his \ngroup's efforts, and also to assert that Hezbollah was still in possession of a number of rockets.  Nasrallah was also \nchampioning the idea of a new government in Lebanon with greater Hezbollah representation, presumably with \ngreater ties to Syria  and Iran.  the natural corollary of such a government would entail the resignation of Fuad \nSiniora's moderate government. On the other side of the border, Israelis were carrying out periodic demonstrations \nagainst the Israel government, and particularly Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  Many Israelis called for the Israeli \nprime minister's resignation and protested his leadership during the war with Hezbollah.  In this way, the aftermath \nof the war yielded clear political ramifications, not the least of which was the precariousness of the positions of the \nleaders of both Israel and Lebanon.\n\nOctober 2006\n\nBy the start of October 2006, the United Nations said that Israel had fulfilled a core conditions of the ceasefire \nagreement by withdrawing the vast majority of its troops from Lebanon.  Only in a border village of Ghajar were \nthere some Israeli troops left.  Monitoring and enforcing the ceasefire were both Lebanese troops and international \npeacekeepers. On the other side of the equation, however, Hezbollah was yet to comply with the requirement that it \n\n\n\ndisarm.  Instead, the group refused to comply, saying  that it intended to keep its fighters equipped to resume \noperations.\n\nOn October 22, 2006, Israel acknowledged its use of  phosphorus during its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in mid-\n2006. The admission that it had dropped phosphorus munitions on military targets contravened against earlier \nstatements that phosphorus weapons were used only to mark targets.  Because of the severe chemical burns \ncaused by phosphorus weapons, its use has been regarded as strongly controversial. In fact,  the Red Cross and \nother humanitarian agencies have said that phosphorus  munitions should be regarded as chemical weapons.  At \nthe same time,  the  Geneva Conventions expressly prohibits the use of white phosphorus against civilian \npopulations and in air attacks against military forces in civilian areas. For its part, Israel said that its use of these \nweapons did not contravene against international law.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah was also facing criticism for its \nwarfare tactics.  The group Human Rights Watch accused both Hezbollah and Israel of using cluster bombs during \nits war in mid-2006.  For its part, Hezbollah denied that it had used cluster munitions.\n\nRelations with Palestinians:  A possible return to peace?\n\nOn September 10, 2006,  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that he welcomed talks with his Israeli \ncounterpart, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.\n\nAbbas said that he was seeking an \"agreement of peace\" that would result in \"two countries side by side.\" Abbas' \nannouncement came one day after Olmert also said he was prepared for talks.\n\nOn September 11, 2006, it was announced that two rival Palestinian factions -- Abbas' Fatah movement and \nHamas -- would  form a coalition government.  The formation of a coalition government was intended to end the \nisolation of the Hamas-led Palestinian government.  Since Hamas' election to power, the West cut ties with the \nPalestinian government, on the basis of Hamas' history of terrorism in conjunction with its refusal to recognize the \nstate of Israel.  Without aid from the West, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza had been in \nfinancial dire straits.  The inclusion of the more moderate Fatah movement into government was intended to \nassuage the international community.\n\nThese two sets of developments came after talks with United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair.  The British \nleader emphasized the importance of the Palestinians forming a government of national unity, and, recognizing the \nstate of Israel.  He also noted that there was an opportunity for Palestinians and Israelis to engage with one \nanother to improve the current state of poor bilateral relations.  He additionally expressed his support for the peace \nprocess, saying,  \"So far as I am concerned, this issue, which I believe passionately in, will be as important as any \nother priority for me in the time that remains for me in office.\"\n\nIsrael responded to the developments saying that it would welcome the return to the peace process, so long as \nthree conditions were met: (1) the formations of a Palestinian coaliton government that rejected violence; (2) the \nrelease of the captured Israeli soldiers; and (3) the recognition of Israel.  For its part, however, Hamas  showed \nlittle interest in changing its strongly anti-Israel stance.\n\nLater in September 2006, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the United Nations General \nAssembly.  In his address, he recapitulated the statements of mutual recognition made by then-Palestinian leader \nYasser Arafat and the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993.  Abbas said, \"These two letters contain a \nreciprocal recognition between the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation] and Israel, reject violence and call for \nnegotiations to reach a permanent settlement with the creation of an independent Palestinian state next to Israel.\"  \nHis statement -- centrally featuring the recognition of Israel in the context of a two-state solution --  came on the \nheels of a previous announcement about a coalition government between Hamas and Fatah.  It appeared to be \ngeared toward the resumption of international aid, which was largely withheld since Hamas' election victory. \n\n\n\nWhile Abbas' position was regarded as highly significant and hinted at a possible breakthrough in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, it was not likely to yield immediate results without concurrence from Hamas.  For its \npart,  Hamas did not appear ready to offer such agreement.  Instead,  Prime Minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas \ndismissed recognition of Israel on September 22, 2006 saying,\n\n\"I personally will not head any government that recognizes Israel.\"\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was the ongoing fighting in Palestinian territories due to an Israeli military \noffensive there.  The Israeli offensive ensued following the capture of Israeli soldiers by Palestinian militants \ndiscussed above.\n\nIn November 2006,  the Arab League  decided to end its financial blockade of Palestine.  Earlier, the Arab League \nhad blocked financial assistance to the Palestinian territories in order to avoid a conflict with Western countries, \nwhich had, as noted above, established a financial aid ban on the Hamas-led Palestinian government to protest its \nlegacy of terrorist activities.  But amidst the military offensive in Gaza, which left scores of people dead, including \nwomen and children in Beit Hanoun, the United States vetoed an United Nations Security Council condemnation on \nthe matter.  Presumably angered by this course of action, Arab countries responded by ending their financial \nblockade of Palestine to protest the United States' veto.\n\nThis move by the Arab League, however, was not without conditions.  Of significance was the call by Arab foreign \nminister for Hamas to endorse the 2002 Arab \"land for peace\" plan that would give West Bank, Gaza and East \nJerusalem to the Palestinians in return for peace.  As well, Arab foreign ministers called for the convening of a \npeace conference to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIndeed, Hamas' previous opposition to Arab League's peace initiatives had resulted in its being banned from joining \nthe regional body.\n\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar of Hamas said that his government would agree to participate in the \npeace conference. On the other side of the equation, however, Israel responded by saying that it would not engage \nwith talks with Hamas until it agreed to prevailing requirements regarding recognition of the state of Israel and \nrenunciation of violence.\n\nAs well, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Mark Regev, noted that a conference would not legitimate Hamas.  He \nwent on to state that Hamas had to meet international benchmarks before engagement could be considered.\n\nIn January 2007, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveled to the Middle East partially for the \npurpose of reviving the defunct \"Roadmap for Peace.\"  Chief among her priorities was to orchestrate talks between \nthe Israeli and Palestinian governments.  While Olmert and Abbas both appeared willing to approach the discussion \ntable, this positive development was largely overshadowed by the de facto civil war that was being played out in the \nPalestinian territories between Hamas and Fatah. \n\nProspects for peace were not helped by a suicide bombing  on January 29, 2007.  It was the first terror attack in \nnine months.  A suicide bomber entered a bakery in the southern resort town of Eilat and detonated the explosives \nstrapped to his body.  The bakery owner and two employees were killed as a result.  Three Palestinian groups \nclaimed responsibility for the attack.  They also explained that the suicide bomber was from Gaza  but had entered \nthe area through Jordan.\n\nFebruary 2007 saw tensions Israelis  and Palestinians  in Jerusalem.  At issue was the renovation of a holy site \nrevered by both Jews and Muslims.  Israeli authorities wanted to renovate a walkway and deployed security \npersonnel to the area in this regard. However, Palestinians argued that such work could endanger the foundation of \n\n\n\nthe site.  Palestinians worshipping at the site threw rocks at the Israelis beginning work on the site, spurring violent \nclashes.\n\nAlso in February 2007, following discussions brokered by the Saudis between the two parties, agreement was \nforged on a governing coalition for the Palestinian territories, which was undergoing violent intra-Palestinian conflict \nbetween Hamas and Fatah.  Also included in the deal was an agreement by Hamas to respect peace deals with \nIsrael. \n\nOn April 1, 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for the convening of a regional peace conference, aimed \nat reviving the peace process.  His proposal came during a news conference with visiting German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel and following discussions with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in which the Palestinian \nleader urged Israel to carry out serious peace talks. Olmert noted that he would attend a regional meeting of \nmoderate Arab countries, along with Abbas.\n\nAt issue was the possible consideration of an earlier Saudi peace proposal, known as the \"land for peace\" deal.  In \nthat agreement, Israel would withdraw from Arab territories to area consistent with 1967 borders and accept a \nPalestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.  Meanwhile, Israel would be granted recognition by Arab states, \nrelations would then be normalized.  Israel had rejected the Saudi plan when it was first put forth.\n\nIsrael's current willingness to revisit the \"land for peace\" plan indicated a significant breakthrough in the peace \nprocess, which has been imbued with little optimism since the Israeli-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006.\n\nIndeed, days prior to this announcement, Olmert had said that Israel was willing to make \"big and painful \nconcessions\" in order to move the peace process along.\n\nProgress on the peace front was not easily realized as Palestinian factions soon dissolved into conflict once again. \nMay 2007 saw successive days of violence between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of \nmore than 40 people and injuries to close to 114, according to the United Nations.  Mustafa Barghouti, the \nPalestinian Information Minister characterized the violence as shameful. \n\nViolence was not limited to the Palestinian territory either.  Rocket attacks were aimed at Israeli areas, with at least \nfour Israelis suffering injuries in mid-May 2007.  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned of a response, which was soon \nfollowed by an Israeli strike against a Hamas camp in the southern part of Gaza.  That strike left four people dead, \nhowever, Palestinian extremists retaliated with further rocket attacks into southern Israeli towns.\n\nRocket attacks by Palestinian militants continued into the third week of May 2007, with Israeli air strikes also being \ncarried out.  About 30 people died in the Palestinian areas as a result of the air strikes. Meanwhile, Israeli towns in \ntargeted areas, such as Sderot, remained deserted as people refused to leave their homes and risk injuries or \ndeath on the streets from rocket attacks.\n\nBy May 20, 2007, Israeli forces struck the Gaza home of a Hamas politician, Khalil al-Hayya, killing eight of his \nrelatives. The Hamas lawmaker was not home at the time and, therefore, not among the dead.  The Israeli military \nsaid that the air strike was aimed at Palestinian militants on the street.  That particular strike came after Israel's \ngovernment expressed support for proposals to intensify strikes in Gaza.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said, \"If the measured steps we are taking, in the political \nand military sphere, do not bring about the desired calm, we will be forced to intensify our response.\"  On the other \nside of the equation,  Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, said in an interview with the Associated Press that the \nescalation was \"very serious.\"\n\n\n\nAt the international level, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had earlier called for an immediate end to \nthe violence going on between Hamas and Fatah in the Palestinian territories.  He also called for an end to the \nrocket attacks on Israel, and said that attacks on installations of the Palestinian Authority were unacceptable.\n\nIn late May 2007, after weeks of enduring successive rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, Israel was carrying out \nair strikes in Gaza.  The latest strikes came following the death of an Israeli man in Sderot when shrapnel from a \nrocket hit him on May 27, 2007.  Hamas claimed responsibility for that rocket attack.  Another Israeli civilian death \nand several injuries had also been reported in the same period as a result of rocket attacks by Palestinian \nextremists.\n\nWith Israel now carrying out an offensive in Gaza that had left around 40 people dead within the last two weeks of \nMay 2007, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his cabinet that no one involved in terror attacks against Israel would \nenjoy immunity.  He also eschewed the notion of a deadline for his country's military offensive, making clear that his \ngovernment would decide \" where, how and to what extent\" it would act.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Hamas signaled its own indefinite timetable for aggression.  A Hamas \nspokesman, Ayman Taha, said, \"We will not surrender, we will not raise the white flag.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the political realm, the Israeli and Palestinian sides were indulging in a battle of wills. On May 24, \n2007, Education Minister Nasser al-Shaer and approximately 30 officials were arrested in the West Bank. Then, on \nMay 26, 2007, Israel arrested Wasfi Kabaha, a Hamas member of the Palestinian cabinet.\n\nIn the background of these developments, Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who was a member of Hamas' rival \nPalestinian faction, Fatah, was becoming increasingly irrelevant.  His attempts to stop the rocket attacks by Hamas \nand to restart a truce with Israel saw no progress whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of the Hamas-led government, and supporters of President Abbas' Fatah movement, were \ninvolved in an ongoing conflict in Gaza.  The conflict was so intense that analysts were referring to it as a \nPalestinian civil war.  By mid-June 2007, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas characterized the factional fighting \nas \"madness\" and warned that the ongoing conflict placed Gaza on the verge of collapse.\n\nHe then dismissed the Hamas-led government and declared a state of emergency.\n\nThe decision by President Abbas came a day after the bloody and violent factional fighting between Hamas and \nFatah took a decisive turn. Late on June 13, 2007, Hamas  managed to subdue Fatah at key security points, \neven storming the headquarters of Fatah's Preventative Security Force.\n\nUltimately, Hamas was in de facto control of Gaza, with Abbas ruling by presidential decree from the West Bank, \nand with Hamas declaring Gaza to be an Islamic entity.\n\nThe power schism -- Abbas backed by Fatah in the West Bank, and Hamas in the Gaza Strip  -- thusly contributed \nto an untenable situation in which the Palestinian territories were now effectively split into two blocs.  Such a \nscenario did not bode well for the prospects of an independent Palestinian state in the near future.\n\nOn June 15, 2007, a day after dissolving the Hamas-led government in the Palestinian territories, President \nMahmoud Abbas named a technocratic and political independent, Finance Minister Salam Fayyad, to be the new \nprime minister. Then, on June 17, 2007, a new Palestinian government was sworn into office.  The new \nadministration was composed mostly of political independents.  Only one member of Fatah was included in the \ncabinet, and Hamas representatives were completely shut out from participation.\n\n\n\nHamas reacted to the news by deeming the new government as illegal.  However, countries, such as the United \nStates indicated that they would have no trouble engaging with the new government, thus advancing its legitimacy.  \nAs well, in the wider international community, many countries of the West were quick to express support for \nPresident Abbas.  To this end, the United States, the European Union, and Israel all expressed their intent to re-\nopen financial aid to Palestinians, with Abbas and Fayyad at the helm.  Such aide had been halted when Hamas, \nwhich has been regarded as a terrorist group by many within the international community, came to power.\n\nOf particular importance was Israel's quick expression of support for the new Palestinian regime, and its statement \nthat a government without Hamas would pave the way for a return to the peace process.  At the same time, Israel \nmade clear that its support would not extend to Hamas in Gaza.  In fact, Israel commenced actions intended to \nisolate Gaza, such as the curtailing of fuel supplies and the deployment of troops to the border near Gaza.  While \ncritics warned of possible shortages to critical supplies as a result of these measures, Israel noted that it would not \nrestrict the movement of humanitarian aid.\n\nJune 2007 also saw the release of  an audio message by Galid Shalit, the Israeli soldier who was abducted in 2006 \n(as discussed above) close to the Gaza border.  The incident set into a motion a massive offensive by Israeli forces \nin Gaza aimed at releasing Shalit. Clearly, that operation did not yield the desired result.\n\nNow, a year later, Shalit was heard on the audiotape saying that his health was deteriorating and that he needed \nmedical attention.  The audio recording was aired on a website run by Hamas, which has demanded the release of \nprisoners from Israeli jails, presumably in exchange for Shalit's release.  However, Israel has consistently said that \nit would not negotiate with terrorists organizations, such as Hamas.\n\nMeanwhile, human rights groups have said that hostage-taking, and then making demands under threat to kill a \nperson, is regarded as a war crime. Noam Shalit, the father of the capture soldier, accused the government of \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert of not doing enough to secure his son's release.  To this end, the elder Shalit said, \"It's \nthe test of a leader.  If you do not know what to do, give your portfolio to someone who can bring about results \nimmediately.\"\n\nOn July 1, 2007, Israel was launching air strikes into the Gaza Strip, which was now under the control of Hamas \nand absent of significant Fatah influence.  However, the target of one air raid was reported to be a senior member \nof the group, Islamic Jihad. Several Palestinians were killed as a result, including the leader of Islamic Jihad's \nsouthern Gaza operation.  Meanwhile, Israel announced plans to release funds to Palestinian leader Mahmoud \nAbbas in the West Bank.\n\nA week later, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni held talks with newly-installed Palestinian Prime Minister Salam \nFayyad in Jerusalem.  The meeting was regarded as a gesture of goodwill between the Israeli government and the \nnew leadership of the Palestinian cabinet -- especially in the wake of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, the dissolution of \nthe Hamas-led government, the establishment of a  new emergency cabinet, and and the virtual  establishment of \ntwo separate Palestinian zones in the West Bank and Gaza.  The meeting was also regarded as tacit support for \nthe moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nFollowing the talks between Livni and Fayyad, the Israeli cabinet approved a proposal to release 250 Palestinians \nprisoners.  That move augured an improved climate of diplomatic relations between the two sides, and suggested a \nmore cooperative relationship between the Israeli government and the new Palestinian cabinet.\n\nThese developments also heralded a forthcoming meeting between Israeli officials and a delegation from the Arab \nLeague, which promised to be something of a historic occasion,  since it would be the first time the Arab League \nflag would fly on Israeli terrain.  The meeting was expected to focus on reviving peace prospects.\n\n\n\nTalks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were set for August \n6, 2007 in the West Bank city of Jericho. It was the first visit by an Israeli head of government to a Palestinian city in \nsix years.  The talks came after several months of reticence on the part of Olmert regarding a proposed meeting \nwith Abbas.  Olmert finally agreed to meet with Abbas to discuss general principles and key issues related to the \nend of Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the formation of a Palestinian state.  While spokespersons for Prime Minister \nOlmert would not specify the actual principles and issues at stake, Saeb Erekat, a close associate of Abbas said \nthat the three \"final status\" considerations -- common borders, the status of Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees -- \nwould be discussed.  Israeli officials said that the meeting did not, however, signify the resumption of \"final status\" \nnegotiations.\n\nOn September 19, 2007, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert classified the Palestinian territory of \nGaza as a \"hostile entity.\"  The classification was made in response to ceaseless rocket attacks into Israeli territory \nby Palestinian extremists in Gaza.  One such attack hit an army base and close to 70 troops were injured.\n\nThe classification meant that additional restrictions could be placed on the Hamas regime that had control over \nGaza.  Such restrictions included limiting  the transfer of goods into Gaza, curtailing fuel and electricity, and curbing \nthe movement of people.  The Israeli government said that these restrictions would be implemented after a legal \nreview was undertaken.  The Israeli government was hoping that the new measures would compel Hamas to stop \nits attacks on southern Israel.  On the other side of the equation, Hamas condemned Israel's decision \ncharacterizing it as \"a declaration of war\" and \"criminal, terrorist Zionist actions\" against the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nDays later, on September 23, 2007, the Israeli government approved the release of 90 Palestinian prisoners.  The \nmove was oriented toward bolstering moderate President Mahmoud Abbas' position in power, given the power \nbalance in the Palestinian territories between extremists and moderates.  To this end, a spokesperson for Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert said, \"The idea of releasing prisoners is specifically to bolster the moderates.\"\n\nIn the third week of October 2007, Israel acknowledged that there was a plot by Palestinian militants to assassinate \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert when he travelled through the West Bank months earlier.  The plot was apparently \nfoiled when Israeli and Palestinian authorities arrested two and three plotters respectively.  As such, Olmert safely \nmet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on August 6, 2007, as discussed above.\n\nSince that time, the three individuals arrested by Palestinian authorities were released on the grounds that their \ndiscussions never moved to the realm of action.  Despite this decision, Israel said that it would continue \nnegotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nAlso in October 2007, United States (U.S.) Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveled to Israel and the West \nBank for talks aimed at trying to organize a peace summit between the two sides.  Speaking from the West Bank at \na news conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Rice noted that the Bush administration wanted to \nsee a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To that end, she said, \"Frankly, it is time for the \nestablishment of a Palestinian state.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that he would consider relinquishing \nsome Palestinian neighborhoods within Jerusalem in order to forge a peace deal.  The status of Jerusalem has \nbeen a sticking point in all peace negotiations, indeed, partially leading to the collapse of a peace brokered by the \nClinton administration at the close of its eight years in office. Palestinians have been adamant that East Jerusalem \nbe the capital of a future Palestinian state, whereas Jerusalem has been the official, albeit not the functioning \ncapital, of the state of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, other enduring differences remained between Israel and the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank, \nincluding borders, settlements, the right of refugees to return, security, and water resources.  Also left unresolved \nwas the divided Palestinian leadership, which would ultimately affect the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.\n\n\n\nIn late 2007, talks between Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \nin the United States appeared to have passed off successfully.  The talks held in Maryland were brokered by the \nBush administration and ended with tentative agreement to restart the peace process.  Both sides  issued a \nstatement calling for negotiations aimed at resolving long-standing issues ensconced within a two-state solution, \nsuch as the status of Jerusalem.  While international observers hailed the development, protests ensued  in the \nPalestinians territories and Israel among those opposed to compromise.\n\nNote:  Hamas ousted its rivals in Fatah and took control of Gaza in June 2007, however, it was itself removed from \nleading the Palestinian government.  As such, while Hamas was now in control of Gaza, a new Palestinian \ngovernment was established and  had control over the West Bank.  The situation meant that the Palestinian \nterritories were now effectively  split into two, with rival factions governing the Gaza Strip and the West Bank \nrespectively.  While Israel and the West appeared willing to work with President Abbas, who was also the leading \nfigure of Fatah, they have officially branded Hamas as a terrorist organization and refused any engagement with \nthat entity.\n\nSee \"Appendix: West Bank and Gaza\" for more details.  \n\nOther Recent Developments\n\nIn the third week of September 2007,  Israeli opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,  appeared to acknowledge \nSyrian claims that Israel carried out an air strike on its terrain two weeks prior.  On Israel television, Netanyahu \nsaid that he had conveyed kudos to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for taking that action.  He said, \"When a prime \nminister does something that is important in my view and necessary to Israel's security... I give my backing.\"\n\nNetanyahu's claim was met with criticism since the Israeli government had been exercising a policy of silence on \nthe issue, which clearly the opposition leader violated.  The Labour Party's Secretary General, Eitan Cabel, \nexcoriated Netanyahu for his remarks saying, \"This is simply very dangerous conduct and the man is not worthy of \nleading.\"  Cabel also said,  \"I have no idea if this was stupidity, folly or a desire to steal credit.\"  Netanyahu was also \ncriticized from within his own Likud party with parliamentarian Yuval Steinitz noting that his comments \"were not \nwise.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Syria said that on September 6, 2007, Israeli jets violated its airspace to the north of the \ncountry in what they described as \"a hostile act.\"  Witnesses observed that Israeli jets were engaged with Syrian air \ndefense and were eventually forced out of the area, albeit after they fired weapons.  Syria reported the incident to \nthe international community and issued a complaint with the United Nations.  The United States acknowledged that \nat least one Syrian target was hit.  By 2008, the United Nations watchdog agency was investigating the matter since \nthere were accusations that the site hit by Israel was one in which Syria intended to develop a nuclear facility.\n\nAlso, as noted above, late 2007 was marked by talks between Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian \nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas in the United States.  The talks were brokered by the Bush administration and \nended with tentative agreement to restart the peace process, and aimed at resolving long-standing issues \nensconced within a two-state solution, such as the status of Jerusalem. \n\nBut the peace process was not helped by events in early 2008.  In late February and early March, 2008,  \nPalestinian  extremists launched relentless rocket attacks -- about 50 per day -- into Israel.  In response, the Israeli  \nauthorities launched a military operation against Gaza.  The Israeli military's\n\n\n\nassault in Gaza left approximately 100 people dead and resulted in the decision by Palestinian leader Mahmoud \nAbbas to suspend talks with Israel.  Nevertheless, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised that the military \noffensive on Gaza would continue since the rocket attacks by Palestinians were ceaseless.\n\nBy  June 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was calling for the creation of Palestinian state, saying that such \nan end would help Israel achieve peace and security. Upon arrival in Israel, President Sarkozy said, \"I am more \nconvinced than ever that the security of Israel will only be truly guaranteed with the birth of a second state, a \nPalestinian state.\" He also affirmed his own support for the Jewish state saying,\n\n\"I have always been and will always be a friend of Israel.\"  The French president made these remarks during his \nfirst state visit to Israel in 12 years.  President Sarkozy was expected to convene separate meetings with both \nIsraeli and Palestinians leaders during his visit to the Middle East. The call for a Palestinian state by the French \npresident came on the heels of a truce forged between Israel and the militant Palestinian group, Hamas.  That truce \npaved the way for the easing Israel's blockade of Gaza, and the movement of food and goods into that Palestinian \nterritory.\n\nJune 2008 also saw Israel and Syria engage in indirect peace talks.\n\nRepresentatives of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert were meeting with a Syrian delegation in the Turkish capital \ncity of Ankara.\n\nIsraeli President Shimon Peres signaled  that the indirect talks could grow into more intense negotiations.  He \nrecounted the visit of Egypt's former leader Anwar Sadat to Israel in 1977, which heralded the peace treaty \nnegotiations between the two countries.  He also said, \"If the Syrians really want peace, they must agree to a \nsummit meeting between the Syrian president and the Israeli prime minister.\"\n\nPrevious peace talks between the two sides have devolved, largely as a result of the  thorny matter of the Golan \nHeights, which has been under Israeli military control at the end of the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.  Israeli settlement \ninto this previously-Syrian area then followed.  Syria made an unsuccessful attempt to retake the Golan Heights \nduring the 1973 Middle East war. A year later in  1974, an armistice was signed and a United Nations observer \nforce was established at the ceasefire line. In this way, the 1967 borders have been an enduring issue as regards \nMiddle Eastern peace.  The Syrian government has said that no peace talks  can be resumed in full without a \ndiscussion of the Golan Heights.  Syria has demanded that the Golan Heights be returned to its fold.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, however, Israel has insisted that Syria halt its support for militants in Lebanon \nand in the Palestinian territories.  To that end, Syria has been linked with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the \nPalestian Territories.  Both groups have posed a grave threat to Israel's security, and have been blamed for terror \nattacks against Israelis.\n\nIn late June 2008, Israel's cabinet has approved a prisoner exchange  with the Lebanese militant group, \nHezbollah.  Central to the exchange agreement was the  return of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers -- Ehud \nGoldwasser and Eldad Regev -- who had been captured by Hezbollah two years ago. That situation sparked a \nmilitary conflict between Israel and Lebanese-based Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 that lasted more than a \nmonth. The agreement, which had been brokered by Germany,  made clear that the two Israeli soldiers were \ndead.  Prior to the vote, Prime Minister Olmert acknowledged, \"We know what happened to them\" but called on \nmembers of his cabinet to vote affirmatively nonetheless. On the other side of the equation, Samir Qantar, a \nLebanese national who had been jailed  for murder since 1979, was expected to be released.\n\n\n\nPeace seemed more elusive between Israel and Iran.  On June 20, 2008, Israel carried out a military exercise \npresumed to be a rehearsal for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.  United States officials said in an interview with \nthe New York Times said that more than  100 Israeli fighter jets participated in manoeuvres over the eastern \nMediterranean earlier in the month.  The military exercise appeared oriented toward sending a message to Iran that \nIsrael would carry out an attack on Iranian nuclear targets, if Israel believed that Iran was approaching \ndevelopment of nuclear weaponry.  Iran responded to the development by again insisting that its nuclear program \nwas peaceful and dismissing the threat of an Israeli attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the nuclear watchdog agency, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohammed \nElBaradei, has discouraged the notion of a military strike by Israel on Iran stating in an interview with Al-Arabiya \ntelevision, \"A military strike, in my opinion, would be worse than anything possible - it would turn the region into a \nfireball.\"\n\nNevertheless, earlier in the month, an Iranian-born Israeli politician, Shaul Mofaz, a former defense minister, \nwarned that  military action would be \"unavoidable\" if Tehran was able to acquire the technology to manufacture \natomic bombs.  This assertion, along with the military exercises, certainly suggested that a confrontation between \nIsrael and Iran might be possible, especially if the diplomatic efforts failed, and if Iran was shown to carrying out \nparticular nuclear ambitions, such as the processing of weapons-grade plutonium and installation of additional \ncentrifuges.  While other leading figures in Israel have distanced themselves from Mofaz's remarks, Ehud Barak, \nthe current defense minister, has said that his country would ensure that Iran did not achieve its nuclear ambitions.\n\nNote: It should be noted that the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in late 2007 asserted that Iran \nhad not progressed in its nuclear ambitions.  Nevertheless, the United States has been at the forefront of Western \nefforts to end Iran's nuclear program and ensure that it does not develop nuclear weaponry.\n\nOn July 2, 2008, a Palestinian man drove a bulldozer into a bus and other vehicles in Jerusalem, killing three \npeople and severely injuring several others.  The attack took place on Jaffa Road in  Jerusalem's city center  and \nwas carried out by the lone Palestinian who was identified as not having any known affiliation with extremist \nPalestinian groups.  Following a struggle, the man was shot to death by a policeman.  The Israeli authorities \ncharacterized the attack as an act of terrorism.  Some analysts noted that the attack may not have been \ncoordinated or planned and may have been carried out in an impromtu manner.  There was, however, no \nconfirmation of this theory.\n\nDomestic Landscape from 2006-2008\n\nIn October 2006, Israel saw a brewing domestic scandal when police said that there was enough evidence to \ncharge President Moshe Katsav on charges of rape, wire-tapping and malfeasance while in office.  The police \nstatement read as follows: \"There is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases... the president carried out \nacts of rape, forced sexual acts, sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment. There is sufficient evidence \nindicating violation of the law banning wire-tapping by the president.\"  The police statement also stated that there \nwere grounds for charges of fraud and malfeasance in office involving presidential pardons.\n\nIt was not known if the president would, in fact, be charged.  That was to be decided by Attorney General \nMenachem Mazuz.\n\nNevertheless, prosecutors were said to be drafting an indictment against the president.\n\nBy early 2007, Israel's Ministry of Justice said that it would charge President Katsav with rape and abuse of power.  \nFormal charges by the Attorney General would ensure following a hearing in which the case would be presented. \nUpon hearing the news from the Justice Ministry, Katsav's attorneys maintained that their client was innocent and \npredicted that the charges would be dismissed after the  Attorney General heard the full story.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Katsav denied the allegations against him and said that he was the victim of a \"public lynching without \ntrial or investigation.\"  He also rejected increasing calls that he resign from his post at head of state  -- a largely \nlimited role in comparison to that of prime minister -- that he had held for six years.  A member of the right-wing \nLikud party,  he had served in government throughout the years in the roles of transport minister, minister of tourism \nand deputy prime minister.\n\nWhile the president has the privilege of immunity while in office, Kaisav could potentially be impeached.  As well, he \ncould be prosecuted after leaving office at the end of his term.\n\nAt the same time, Israel's political realm was being wracked by other political scandals.  Notably, two politicians \nwere facing separate trials.  While the country's former Justice Minister Haim Ramon was facing charges of sexual \nmisconduct, former Environment Minister Tzahi Hanegbi was charged with making illegal appointments.  Both \npoliticians denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn other developments involving the Israeli government in early 2007, Raleb Majadele of the Labour Party became \nthe first Arab to join the Israeli cabinet.  The appointment of Majadele was sanctioned by a vote within the Israeli \ngovernment in which all but one cabinet minister -- ultra-nationalist Minister of Strategic Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman -\n- voted in his favor.\n\nAlthough Rajadele would be a minister without a portfolio, the move was designed to show more inclusiveness \ntowards Israeli Arabs who make up 20 percent of the population.  To that end, the new cabinet minister said,  \"The \nfirst step has been taken and this has given Israeli Arabs a feeling of belonging.\"\n\nIn May 2007, a long-awaited report on the government's handling of Israel's war with Lebanon-based Hezbollah \ncriticized Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for his  \"serious failure in exercising judgement, responsibility and prudence\" \non the matter. Defense Minister Amir Peretz and former military Chief of Staff Dan Halutz were also strongly \ncriticized by the report, which noted that the war was ill-conceived and poorly-coordinated.\n\nA special parliamentary session of the Knesset was held to debate the report's findings. In that session, right-wing \nopposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded the resignation of Olmert.  However, parliamentarians \nbelonging to Olmert's ruling Kadima party did not relinquish their support of the prime minister.  As well, Prime \nMinister Olmert expressed his intent to remain in office and to institute the proposals outlined in the report.\n\nMeanwhile, however, tens of thousands of Israelis appeared to disagree with Olmert's stance as they took to the \nstreets in Tel Aviv to protest the government's handling of the war, and to call for the prime minister's resignation.  \nProtestors were a diverse group -- including members of the political right and left, as well as the religious and \nsecular segments of the population.  However, despite the clearly political orientation of the rally, organizers made \nclear that while politicians were invited to participate, they would not be allowed to take the stage.  With protestors \nfilling Rabin Square and surrounding areas, organizers said that 100,000 people were in attendance.\n\nAttention turned to the Labour Party a month later.  On June 12, 2007, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak \nwon the leadership position in the country's Labour Party.  Barak won 51.3 percent of the vote share in the Labour \nParty primary election, while parliamentarian Ami Ayalon won 47.7 percent.  His victory was not without \ncontroversy.  Opponents said that the voting was fraudulent. Nevertheless,  Ayalon  soon expressed both \ncongratulations to the new Labour leader, and a commitment of support.  For his part, Barak called for prudent \ngovernance in his victory speech saying, \"Today begins the long journey toward bringing back level-headed, \nresponsible and experienced leadership to the State of Israel.\"  He also called for strengthening Israeli defense \nnoting,  \"I am talking about investing all our knowledge in strengthening the defense establishment and the IDF \n(Israel Defense Forces) and restoring Israel's power of deterrence.\"\n\n\n\nSoon after his selection as the new Labour Party leader in Israel, Ehud Barak was offered a position within Prime \nMinister Olmert's cabinet.  In fact, Barak was appointed as the country's new minister of defense, replacing Amir \nPeretz.\n\nBarak was to be sworn into office by the Knesset on June 18, 2007. Meanwhile, Peretz was expected to remain in \nthe cabinet, albeit as a minister without a portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 13, 2007, Shimon Peres, a veteran of Israeli politics, was elected as the country's new \npresident and head of state.\n\nIn the first round, Peres won 58 ballots -- just shy of the 61 needed for a majority in the 120-seat Knesset.  In that \nround, Reuven Rivlin of Likud received 37 votes while Colette Avital of the Labour Party garnered 21 votes.  They  \nboth expressed support for Peres after the first round results were announced. Peres then won the support of 86 \nout of 120 parliamentarians to take victory in a second round voting.  The president-elect was set to be inaugurated \non July 15, 2007.\n\nPeres, who has been a member of the Israel parliament since 1959, held several ministerial posts in a number of \ncabinets over the years, and served twice as prime minister -- once in 1984, and again from 1995 to 1996.  He was \nbelieved to have been the mastermind behind the development of Israel's assumed nuclear weapons program.  In \nrecent years, he joined Ariel Sharon's ruling party, Kadima, for the purpose of establishing a practical peace \nprocess with the Palestinians.  Throughout his political career, Peres has been regarded as a global statesman.  To \nthis end, he was the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in establishing the Oslo Peace Accords.\n\nThe election of Peres as president came  after Moshe Katsav took a leave of absence from his presidential role, in \nthe wake of the aforementioned accusations of rape.  That matter had contributed to rising calls for his resignation, \nand created something of a domestic political crisis in Israel.\n\nJuly 1, 2007 saw the resignation of Moshe Katsav as president of Israel.  Katsav issued his formal resignation a \nday after agreeing to the terms of a plea bargain.  In that arrangement, Katsav agreed to plead guilty on several \nsexual offences, in exchange for two rape charges against him being removed.  A day earlier, thousands of Israelis \ndemonstrated in the streets of Tel Aviv to protest the deal struck between Katsav and Attorney General Menachem \nMazuz. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister and well-known statesman, Shimon Peres, was set to be inaugurated as \nthe new president.\n\nNovember 2007 saw more than 100 Israeli police raid up to 20 sites in connection with a corruption investigations \ninvolving Prime Ehud Olmert.  Two of the sites raided included the national post office and the Ministry of Trade and \nIndustry.  At issue were three criminal investigations centering on a property purchase, a bank privatization deal, \nand  accusations of political favors respectively. A spokesperson for the Israeli police, Mickey Rosenfeld, said: \n\"Police investigators are searching a number of government and private offices in connection with three ongoing \ninvestigations.\" For his part, Prime Minister Olmert denied doing anything wrong and said that the probe against \nhim was motivated by his political opponents.\n\nMay 2008 saw Prime Minister Ehud Olmert faced with a corruption scandal.  At issue were alleged bribery claims, \ndue to an investigation that linked him with payments from a New York businessman, Morris Talansky.  Olmert \nacknowledged receiving the payments but said that they were legal contributions to his campaign, and as such, he \nhad done nothing wrong.  In the meanwhile, though, the issue fueled questions of whether the emerging situation \nwould result in the fall of Olmert's government, thus triggering fresh elections.  But on May 10, 2008, Israeli \nparliamentarians signaled that such an end was unlikely, due to insufficient votes in the Knesset to force such an \nend.  Nevertheless, there were increasing and intensifying calls for Olmert to resign from office.  For his part, Olmert \nsaid that he would  resign if he was, in fact, indicted as a result of the matter.\n\n\n\nBy the close of the month, early elections appeared in the offing in Israel due to the Olmert investigation. To this \nend, Labor Party Chairman and Defense Minister Ehud Barak said on May 29, 2008,\n\n\"For the sake of political stability, an alternate government must be established and headed by one of the members \nof Kadima, but it is very likely that there will be elections sometime during the coming year.\"  Barak went on to note \nthat in the interests of the country, Olmert should  distance himself from the day-to-day administration of Israel.  For \nhis part, Olmert reiterated his position that he would stay in the role of prime minister.\n\nBy July 2008, the corruption probe widened so that it could also investigate whether or not Olmert committed fraud. \nA joint statement by police and the justice ministry noted that the Israeli prime minister was suspected of seeking \n\"duplicate funding for his trips abroad from public bodies.\" \n\nOlmert indicated that his job as head of government had been derailed by attacks and investigations.  Olmert said, \n\"As a citizen in a democracy I have always believed that when a person is elected prime minister in Israel, even \nthose who opposed him in the ballot want him to succeed.\"  He continued,  \"But instead I found myself subjected to \nconstant investigations and criticism. Almost from day one, I had to repel personal attacks and postpone decisions \nthat are pertinent to the security of the state.\" Olmert claimed success for increased security in the country's north \nand in Israel's ability to deter attacks from enemies.  He also claimed success in the  social-economic realm, saying \nthat he had administered a stable economy.\n\nAt the start of September 2008, Israeli police officially recommend that Prime Minister Olmert  be indicted in the \naforementioned  corruption investigation. This recommendation meant that the final decision about whether to indict \nOlmert would be made by Attorney General Meni Mazuz. The police offered this recommendation based on \nevidence pointing to Olmert's alleged acceptance of the bribes from Talansky.  The police have also accused \nOlmert of filing duplicate claims to various government agencies for travel expenses. \n\nFor his part, Olmert has maintained his innocence and his lawyers issued a statement noting that only the attorney \ngeneral and not the police had the authority to indict him.  The statement included the following assertion: \"The only \nperson authorized by the law to decide whether to indict a prime minister is the attorney general. He has the \nauthority and he bears the responsibility over the issue.\"\n\nEarlier, Olmert had said that he would not contest his Kadima party's leadership  primary election and that he would \nresign as soon as  his successor was determined.  Olmert's successor -- the winner of the Kadima primary election \non Sept. 17, 2008 -- was expected to submit a new proposed government to President Shimon Peres for approval \nby the close of October 2008.\n\nNew Leadership\n\nFacing the aforementioned corruption scandal and with Israeli police officially recommending indictment, Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert said that he would resign as soon as  his successor at the helm of the ruling Kadima \nparty was determined.  To that end, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni won the party's primary election on September 17, \n2008 and became its new leader.  Official  results showed that Livni won a narrow 1.1 percent victory over Shaul \nMofaz.\n\nIn the weeks to follow, if Livni could form a new government, she would become the second female head of \ngovernment in Israel since Prime Minister Golda Meir in the 1970s.  If her efforts in forging a ruling coalition were \nunsuccessful, Israel could be headed to the polls in snap elections.\n\nThe main obstacle in her path has been party unity.  Bitter after his razor thin defeat, Shal Mofaz said that he was \nexiting the  political scene.  This declaration by Mofaz laid bare the prevailing intra-party rifts that could present \n\n\n\nserious challenges in the government formation process.  As such, Livni would have to work hard to ensure that \nKadima party members closed ranks.  Livni expressed regret that Mofaz has decided to withdraw from politics and \nexpressed a willingness to work with him.  But Mofaz was said to be so upset about the outcome of the leadership \nrace that there were rumors that he might defect to the rival right-wing Likud.\n\nMeanwhile, building a ruling coalition would not be easy for two reasons.  First,  the centrist Kadima's main coalition \npartner, the left-leaning Labour Party, indicated that it might seek a snap election.\n\nHowever, Ehud Barak, the Labour leader, subsequently expressed interest in remaining allied with Kadima in \ngovernment.  Second, Kadima's second largest partner, the orthodox Jewish party, Shas, was foregrounding tough \nconditions for joining the government, such as  no negotiations with the Palestinians on the fate of Jerusalem.  \nSince Livni has said that she was committed to  resolving such final status issues, it was clear that there would be \nserious differences on the policy agenda between the parties.\n\nNevertheless, soon after Livni's election as Kadima leader, as promised, Ehud Olmert  formally resigned as prime \nminister along with his cabinet,  however, he was expected to function as the caretaker prime minister in the interim. \nNext, President Shimon Peres  was expected to consult with the parties before selecting a Knesset member to form \na new cabinet.  Given the current Knesset makeup, that person was expected to be  Livni -- the new Kadima \nleader.  Then, Livni would  have to submit a new proposed government to the president for approval by the close of \nOctober 2008. If Livni did not succeed in forming a new coalition government, the president could call on another \nmember of the Knesset to form a government, or, he could call a general election.  Livni was reported to have said \nat a Kadima party meeting that she would try to forge a coalition, but, if those efforts were not successful then, she \nwould contest elections. She said, \"If I don't succeed, I will go to general elections and win.\"\n\nIn October 2008,  Livni was making progress in resolving these challenges.  Specifically, she was moving toward \nsecuring a partnership with the  the second largest party in party in parliament -- the Labour Party.\n\nOn the table was a preliminary coalition agreement  in which the leader of the Labour Party, Ehud Barak,  would \nassume a newly-established position of Senior Deputy Prime Minister.  The new role, which would be imbued with \ngreater influence on cabinet affairs, was intended to reflect Livni's statement that Barak would be a \"real partner\" in \nher administration.\n\nBy the close of the month, similar success had not been forged with the other likely coalition partner, Shas.  Livni \nintimated that Shas' demands on economic and diplomatic issues were unworkable.\n\nAccordingly,  Kadima party leader, Tzipi Livni, recommended that general elections be held.  She informed Israeli \nPresident Shimon Peres that she was unable to  form a coalition majority and that elections should go forth \"without \ndelay.\"  For his part,\n\nPeres had a few days to consult with the various parties to see if another coalition could be built.  If those efforts \nlikewise failed within a period of three weeks, then elections would be called within 90 days. Since no other \nworkable coalition is likely to be formed, early elections appeared to be inevitable in Israel. Opinion polls suggest \nthat the election promised to be a tough fight between the centrist Kadima and the right-wing Likud.\n\nAhead of Israeli elections in early 2009, the two main political leaders in Israel vowed to crush the militant Islamic \nPalestinian movement, Hamas, which controls the Palestinian Territory of Gaza.  Tzipi Livni of Kadima and \nBenjamin Netanyahu of Likud, both of whom were hoping to become prime minister, made the same claim at a time \nwhen an increase in regional violence was anticipated, as a result of Hamas' announcement that it would not renew \nits truce with Israel.  Indeed, Hamas militants were already renewing their attacks by  firing regular volleys of  \nrockets and mortar bombs into Israeli territory.\n\n\n\nAs well, Hamas warned that any Israeli offensive would motivate its ranks to carry out suicide attacks on Israeli \ntargets.  On the other side of the equation, Israel carried out an air strike that killed one militant.\n\nAbout Tzipi Livni\n\nTzipi Livni was born in 1958 in Tel Aviv.  Her family gained notoriety for its membership in Irgun, a radical Jewish \nunderground movement during the British mandate period. After  two-years of military service in the Israel Defense \nForces (IDF), Livni worked for the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, for two years in Paris before returning to \nIsrael.  At home in Israel,  as a graduate of Bar Ilan University's Faculty of Law, she commenced  practicing law \nwith focus areas involving public and commercial law.\n\nHer political career began in 1999 when she  was first elected to the Israeli parliament or Knesset as  a member of \nthe right-wing Likud party. She later functioned as  minister of regional cooperation in then-Premier Ariel Sharon's \ncabinet, and went on to hold various positions in government.  She left Likud with Sharon when he formed the \ncentrist  Kadima party.  Then, following Kadima's victory in the 2006 general elections, Livni took on the position of \nforeign minister and vice premier.  Since late 2007, Livni has led  Israel's negotiating teams in peace  talks with \nPalestinians.  Livni has maintained her commitment to forging  a final-status agreement with the Palestinian \nNational Authority (PNA).\n\nA mother of two, Livni could become the second woman  in Israel to become prime minister, following in the \nfootsteps of Golda Meir.  Unlike her predecessor, Ehud Olmert, Livni has crafted a reputation of integrity and has \nbeen viewed as free from scandal.  While her critics have criticized  her military and security credentials (or lack \nthereof), other observers have said that she is one of few politicians capable of pulling together various factions in a \nstable ruling government.  That reputation was about to be put to the test with the outcome yet to be determined.\n\nFor her part, Livni was reported to have said at a Kadima party meeting that she would try to forge a coalition, but, if \nthose efforts were not successful then, she would contest elections. She said, \"If I don't succeed, I will go to general \nelections and win.\"\n\nNote:  Elections were scheduled for February 2009.\n\nSpecial Update:\n\nIsrael vows to crush Hamas as Gaza becomes the current flashpoint in the Middle East\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 2008, Hamas militants fired approximately 60 rockets into Israeli territory.  The act \ncame a week after Hamas said it would not renew its truce with Israel. In response, Israel launched a massive \nmilitary offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip days later.  Israel made clear that it intended to take decisive \naction against the  Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, otherwise known as Hamas.  Indeed, Israeli officials \nsaid they intended to \"crush Hamas.\"\n\nIsrael had warned that such a response was imminent if rocket attacks did not end.  Foreign Minister and Kadima \nleader Tzipi Livni had warned that Israel would not tolerate Hamas targeting its people.  She said, \"Hamas needs to \nunderstand that our aspiration to live in peace doesn't mean that Israel is going to take this kind of situation any \nlonger. Enough is enough.\"\n\nIsrael air raids pound the Gaza Strip; Israeli authorities say they seek to crush Hamas and not the people of Gaza\n\nIsrael's military response  began with aerial bombardment on Gaza.  The main targets included security \ncompounds and government offices that make up Hamas infrastructure, as well as tunnels into Egypt.  While the \nvast majority of the casualties on these early targets were Hamas personnel, such as policemen, there were \nnonetheless civilian casualties.  Indeed, as the aerial bombardment raged on, reports emerged that it was the \n\n\n\nharshest military action against Gaza since the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war that led to Israel assuming control over \nthe Gaza Strip, which was then under Egyptian administration.\n\nNevertheless, Israel appeared set on assuring the Palestinian people that its efforts were against Hamas and not \nthem more broadly. In an address to the Palestinian people of Gaza,  Israel's caretaker Prime Minister Ehud Olmert \nsaid that  Israel had no desire for ordinary Gazans to suffer, but that Hamas -- as Israel's enemy -- was Israel's \nintended target.\n\nAs anticipated, Olmert's address was received with great skepticism by Palestinians while Khaled Meshaal, the \nleader of Hamas' armed wing, called for the Palestinians to rebel in an uprising or \"the third intifada.\" More \nmoderate Palestinian voices from the West Bank, such as Chief Palestinian Negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned  \nIsrael's actions, characterizing it as \"a savage Israeli assault.\"\n\nOn the third day of aerial bombardment, Gaza's Interior Ministry and Islamic University were the main targets.  \nDefense Minister Ehud Barak echoed Prime Minister Olmert by noting that Israel was not in a  fight with the people \nof Gaza but, rather, Israel was in \"a war to the bitter end\" with Hamas, which has held sway over Gaza since 2007.  \nIn a special parliamentary session, the defense minister said Israel was \"taking all precautions\" to avoid hurting \nPalestinian civilians, but warned that the militants were using the civilian population as human shield.\n\nIn this way, Defense Minister Barak's struck a hard line against Hamas, which he separated from the greater \nPalestinian population of Gaza.  Deputy Prime Minister Haim Ramon made no mention of the Palestinian people, \nstating succinctly:  \"The goal of the operation is to topple Hamas.\"\n\nHamas continues to launch rocket attacks at Israel\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas was not cowed by Israel's air assault and was stepping up its own attacks on Israelis.  Several  \ninjuries and two deaths were reported at Nahal Oz close to  the border with Gaza and in the southern city of Ashdod \nin a short period of time as a result of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants.  But Hamas was not content to limit its \nrocket attacks to the boundary region.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2008, Palestinians militants  from Gaza fired long-range rockets that landed in the southern Israeli city \nof Beersheba -- as far as 30 miles away.  As well, two rocket attacks by Palestinian militants  left one person injured \nin the city of Ashkelon. While there were no deaths from those attacks, it was clear that Israel had not fully reduced \nthe threat posed by Hamas, and that Palestinian militants had long-range weapons at their disposal.\n\nWith Hamas continuing its barrage of rocket attacks into Israeli territory, public support in Israel remained high for \ncontinued military action against Hamas in Gaza. On the other side of the equation, Hamas's military wing, the \nIzzedine al-Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas -- made clear that it would continue to  fire at Israeli \ntargets, and warned that they had the capacity to reach further into Israeli territory.  In this way, both sides made it \napparent that a ceasefire would not easily be achieved.\n\nIsrael rejects international calls for a truce\n\nWith no end to the violence in sight and the prospects of a humanitarian crisis looming ahead, the international \ncommunity called for a 48-hour truce to allow for the passage of humanitarian aid.  However, Israeli Prime Minister \nEhud Olmert rejected the notion of the 48-hour truce.\n\nFollowing a meeting with his cabinet, Prime Minister Olmert said the necessary conditions could not be met for a \nceasefire. Olmert made clear that any ceasefire with Hamas would have to be permanent.\n\n\n\nHe did not, however, foreclose the possibility of such a prospect in the near future.  He reportedly said, \"If \nconditions will ripen, and we think there can be a diplomatic solution that will ensure a better security reality in the \nsouth, we will consider it. But at the moment, it's not there.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas  registered his outrage over \nIsrael's actions in Gaza by characterizing Israel's aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip \"barbaric and criminal \naggression.\"  Abbas also warned that he could potentially bring a halt to  peace talks with Israel if he believed \nPalestinian interests were at stake.\n\nIsrael moves to ground assault\n\nAlmost a week after the air raids on Gaza began, Israel intensified its assault on Gaza as Palestinian militants fired \nmore rockets into Israeli territory.\n\nIn one air strike, a senior Hamas military leader, Nizar Rayyan, was killed.  Further Israeli air strikes yielded other \nhigh value Hamas targets, including two commanders of Hamas's military wing -- Abu Zakaria al-Jamal and \nMohammed Maaruf. Israel was also carrying out air raids on other targets, including a missile attack on mosque in \nBeit Lahiya.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel amassed its military forces along the border and declared the area around the Gaza Strip to be a \n\"closed military zone.\"  Since Israel was also calling up thousands of reservists, anticipation was growing that \nground operations were in the offing.\n\nIndeed, by the start of January 2009, Israel and Hamas were ignoring  international calls for a ceasefire even as the \nconflict between them in Gaza raged on.  Israel had now deployed convoys of  troops and tanks to the northern \npart of the Gaza Strip and, supported by helicopters in the air,  was launching a strong artillery attack.  As before,  \nPalestinian militants continued to fire rockets into southern Israel.\n\nBy Jan. 4, 2009, there  was direct confrontation  between Israeli ground forces and Palestinian fighters deep into \nthe Gaza Strip.  In fact, Israeli troops, tanks and helicopters had surrounded Gaza City and were engaging in \nclashes with Palestinian militants at close range. Both sides were engaged in a concomitant battle of words.  Israel \nclaimed it had struck a massive blow against Hamas while the militant Palestinian body promised to turn Gaza into \n\"an Israeli graveyard.\"\n\nBut Israeli forces had now reached the heart of Gaza City  including areas used by Palestinian militants to launch \nrocket attacks into Israel.  Moreover, Israeli forces had managed to thrust further south of Gaza City -- even past an \nIsraeli settlement that had been abandoned years before.  In this way, Israeli forces had now penetrated large \nswaths of Gaza, and in so doing, Gaza City was now cut off from the rest of the Gaza Strip to the south.\n\nIsrael prepared for \"long campaign\"\n\nAs the ground operation continued, Israeli forces would have to deal with the threat of house-to-house fighting, \nsniper fire, booby traps,  and other elements of urban combat, not to mention approximately 20,000 militants \nentrenched in this high-risk landscape. Still, Israel appeared to be committed to its mission  regardless of the \ndifficulty of the endeavor, the international outcry, and the rising death toll.\n\nFor his part, Israeli President Shimon Peres said his country's mission was not to either occupy Gaza or to \"crush \nHamas\" as had been suggested by other Israeli authorities. Instead, the Israeli head of state said the objective was \nto end the threat of terror.\n\n\n\nPresident Peres noted there was no point to discussing a ceasefire without an end to rocket attacks by Hamas.  To \nthat end, in an interview with the United States media, President Peres said,  \"We shall not accept the idea that \nHamas will continue to fire and we shall declare a ceasefire.  It does not make any sense.\"\n\nAs such, President Peres believed Israel had to press forward with its mission to end terror, the viability of such an \nambitious goal notwithstanding. He went on to note, \"If there is somebody (who) can stop terror with a different \nstrategy, we shall accept it.\"\n\nIn the West Bank and elsewhere in the Arab world, protests against Israel were gaining steam.  Aware of the \ninternational condemnation and the public relations challenge, the Israeli military was interrupting broadcasts on \nthe  Hamas television channel, Al Aqsa, asking Palestinians not to serve as human shields for the militants, and \npublicizing the following message:  \"Israel is acting only against Hamas and has no interest in harming you.\"\n\n\"Phase Three\"\n\nThe Israeli operation against Hamas in Gaza was ongoing in the second week of January 2009.  Indeed, it \nappeared that Israel's efforts would intensify, as evidenced by leaflets dropped into Gaza and phone messages \nwarning the people of Gaza to avoid Hamas-dominated areas.  The leaflets and messages from the Israeli military \nindicated that \"phase three\" of the military operation was in the offing.\n\nBy Jan. 11, 2009,  Israeli ground forces were penetrating Gaza's most populated area.  There were reports of tanks \nrolling through residential neighborhoods and urban warfare in streets and buildings between Israeli troops and \nHamas militants.  A spokesperson for the Israeli military, Major Avital Leibovich, confirmed the advance of the \nIsraeli army into urban areas of Gaza saying, \"Since the majority of the Hamas militants are pretty much in hiding in \nthose places, mainly urban places, then we operate in those areas.\"\n\nBut the Israeli efforts were not limited to the ground. Israel continued to launch pre-dawn air strikes on Gaza and \nnavy gunboat shelled Gaza City.  Several buildings, including the Gaza bureau of the Associated Press, were \ndamaged as a result.  Israel maintained that its targets were Hamas interests.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said after a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem that his country's military had made \n\"impressive gains\" in Gaza and that the time was drawing near to \"translate our achievements into the goals we \nhave set.\"\n\nThat said, he indicated that the operation would continue saying, \"Israel is nearing the goals which it set itself, but \nmore patience, determination and effort is still demanded.\"\n\nMeanwhile, for its part, Hamas militants continued to launch rocket attacks into southern Israel.\n\nDeath toll and looming humanitarian crisis\n\nSince the start of Israel's assault on Gaza, as of the second week of January 2009,  the death toll in the Gaza Strip \nwas more than 900, according to calculations from Palestinian health officials, the United Nations and various \nmedia outlets, including the Associated Press.  Approximately 2,500 Palestinians were said to have been injured.  \nWhile Israel has claimed that the vast majority of the deaths (80 percent) were Hamas militants, the United Nations \nhas offered a slightly different estimate of  75 percent.  On the other side of the equation, 13 Israelis were reported \nto have been killed  and scored more were wounded.\n\nThe Red Cross described the situation in Gaza's hospitals as dire and warned that its medical facilities were utterly  \n\"stretched to the limit\"  and running out of resources.\n\n\n\nAs well, the United Nations warned that a humanitarian crisis was at hand.  The United Nations relief agency in \nGaza said that about 1,200 people could be homeless due to damage to their houses, or, because they were forced \nto flee the violence.  As well, some food and aid rations were running short.\n\nThe United Nations inadvertently became the subject of discussion on Jan. 8, 2009, when one of its aid mission \ntrucks came under Israeli fire at the Erez crossing in Gaza.  One person was killed and two others were injured in \nthe incident, resulting in the United Nation's relief agency's decision to halt aid operation in Gaza.  A day later, the \nUnited Nations  relief agency announced that it had made the difficult decision to stop its humanitarian aid \ndeliveries  \"with great regret.\"  A spokesperson for the United Nations relief agency,  Chris Guinness, said quite \npointedly, \"Our installations have been hit, our workers have been killed in spite of the fact that the Israeli \nauthorities have the coordinates of our facilities and that all our movements are coordinated with the Israeli army.\"  \nOn Jan. 10, 2009, after safety assurances were given by the Israeli authorities, the United Nations announced that \nit would resume operations in Gaza.\n\nInternational Outcry and Mediation Efforts\n\nDuring  the first week of  Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza,  United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon \ncalled for an immediate ceasefire.  The United Nations head said he was \"deeply alarmed\" by the  violence in \nGaza.  He urged  both Israel and Hamas to \"halt their acts of violence and take all necessary measures to avoid \ncivilian casualties.\"\n\nBy the close of the first week of  Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza, there was a rising chorus of calls for an \nimmediate ceasefire among world leaders.  European Union External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-\nWaldner declared, \"The violence has to stop.\"  The European Union also issued a statement calling for an \n\"unconditional halt\" to rocket attacks by Hamas.  United States President George W. Bush also said it was \nincumbent on Hamas to take the first step to ending the conflict by halting its rocket attacks on Israel.\n\nBut as Israel's efforts progressed toward ground operations,  and amidst spiraling civilian casualties, officials from \nthe Middle East and Europe issued condemnations for what they viewed as Israel's disproportionate response to \nHamas in Gaza.  This view was echoed by United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon, who acknowledged  Israel's right to \ndefend itself from rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, while also decrying Israel's \"excessive use of force.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown struck a diplomatic tone by concentrating on the humanitarian crisis \nlooming in Gaza and thusly, urging an \"immediate and urgent ceasefire.\"\n\nFor its part, the United States issued a tacit approval of Israel's response to the threat posed by Hamas by urging \nIsrael to try to avoid civilian casualties while also  placing blame for the situation solely on Hamas.  The United \nStates also went further and blocked approval of a United Nations Security Council statement that demanded  an \nimmediate ceasefire.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union was expected to send a delegation to the region, while Russia said it would send \nan envoy, both for the purpose of trying to forge some sort of resolution.  The European Union foreign policy chief, \nJavier Solana, said the Israel-Hamas crisis was emblematic of  the failure of diplomacy and that every effort should \nbe made to  advance the peace process.\n\nBy the start of the second week of January 2009, the United Nations Security Council was finally able to  pass a \nresolution urging an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.  Fourteen of the 15 Security Council \nmembers supported the resolution while the United States abstained from the vote.  United States  Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice explained her country's rare abstention saying that while the resolution was a step forward, \nthe Bush administration was still considering the effect of the ongoing mediation efforts.\n\nThe United Nations motion had been drafted by the United Kingdom and called for an \"immediate, durable and fully \nrespected ceasefire\" leading to the \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli forces from Gaza,  humanitarian access, the \nprevention of arms smuggling to Palestinian militants, and strenuous diplomatic efforts aimed at a peaceful \nresolution.\n\n\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas rejected the United Nations resolution.  United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon \nexpressed his disappointment  during a telephone call to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  Earlier, Olmert had \nsaid that Hamas' continued rocket attacks on Israel showed that the United Nations resolution was \"unworkable.\"  \nOn the other side of the equation, Hamas said that it had dismissed the United Nations resolution demanding a \nceasefire because it was not  in the interests of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe diplomatic efforts at the United Nations aside, there was concomitant wrangling on the ground in the Middle \nEast.  A ceasefire plan brokered by Egypt and France was on the table for discussion.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy's comments suggested that Israel would agree, in principle, to the Franco-\nEgyptian truce proposal, while the Palestinian Authority also appeared to view the plan positively.  Absent from his \nstatements, however, were any mention of Hamas. Clearly, peace would not be at hand without concurrence from \nHamas as well.\n\nNevertheless, Tony Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet of the United Nations, the United States, the \nEuropean Union and Russia, expressed  optimism that the ceasefire proposal would succeed during an interview \nwith the British media.  He noted that foundation for success was in place, but acknowledged that there were details \nyet to be worked out.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nWhy has Israel decided that it should take such drastic action not simply to \"crush Hamas\" as some officials have \npurported, but to \"crush terrorism\" as suggested by the Israeli head of state?  Why such a lofty goal at this particular \ntime?\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Israel seeks to quiet the ghosts of 2006 when Israel was ensconced in a \nbloody war with Hezbollah in Lebanese territory.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, as in late 2008, Israel said it was launching an operation intended to stop missile and \nrocket attacks into Israeli territory.  But at the end of that conflict, Hezbollah was still able to launch missiles and, as \nsuch, it was that militant group who claimed victory, the civilian casualties notwithstanding.  In late 2008 and early \n2009, Israel may be seeking to vindicate itself after what some saw as its failure in 2006.  Indeed, as Prime Minister \nOlmert leaves office, he may well wish to exit on a high note as opposed to the disgrace of the corruption charges \nthat caused his resignation from power.\n\nFor its part, Hamas may be buoyed by Hezbollah's quasi-victory and may be seeking to achieve a similar outcome \nfor itself, especially after being driven from power by Palestinian rivals in the West Bank.  Indeed, Gaza is Hamas' \nlast stand and it is unwilling that these Palestinian militants will go quietly away, regardless of Israel's expressed \nmission.\n\nDespite President Peres' lofty claims of \"crushing terror,\" it is also possible that Israel has a more tactical objective.  \nSenior members of the Israeli military have acknowledged that it is hardly likely that they can end all rocket attacks \nby Hamas.  Accordingly, they hope to diminish Hamas' ability to launch as many attacks and, certainly, to diminish \nthe accuracy of the attacks that do take place.  As well, a successful operation would favorably position Israel  to be \nable to  control the terms of a forthcoming ceasefire. Furthermore, a successful military operation would  deliver a \nwarning to enemies  (such as Hezbollah in Lebanon) elsewhere in the region by acting as a deterrent.\n\nThere are other possible explanations for Israel's decision to respond forcefully to Hamas at this time.  Among them \nis the political rationale.  With parliamentary elections on the horizon, and with Israelis' dismal public opinion of the \ngovernment's handling of Hamas in Gaza, augmented by the fact that hard-line Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu \nwas leading in the polls,  the Kadima-led administration likely believed that it needed to prove its security \n\n\n\ncredentials.  Indeed, as the new Kadima leader, Tzipi Livni, began to use stronger language against Hamas, her \npoll numbers against Netanyahu began to appear more competitive.\n\nThus, while it is clear that Israel has a concrete and real desire to deal with its security challenges and the threat \nposed by Hamas, the particular timing of the assault into Gaza does appear to possess a political element worth \nconsidering.\n\nIf national politics are not influencing the timing of Israel's efforts against what Israelis call \"Hamastan,\" then \ninternational politics may well be at play.  With the Republican Bush administration about to leave office in the \nUnited States, and with the Democratic President Barack Obama about to be inaugurated into office, it is possible \nthat Israel wants to take strong action now, while it has unquestioned support from its most important ally.  While \nthe Obama administration promises to be a stalwart of Israel, there are prevailing suspicions that President Obama \nmay be more amenable to diplomatic solutions to geopolitical challenges.\n\nIsrael declares unilateral ceasefire and says it is poised for rapid withdrawal from Gaza\n\nThree weeks after Israel launched an offensive operation in the Gaza Strip, aimed at crushing Hamas, Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Olmert said that Israeli troops were poised for a rapid withdrawal from Gaza.  Olmert said, \"We didn't \nset out to control Gaza, we don't want to remain in Gaza and we intend on leaving Gaza as quickly as possible.\" \nThis decision came on the heels of Israel's statement that its objectives  had been achieved and, accordingly, it \nwas declaring a unilateral ceasefire.\n\nHamas likewise claimed success, suggesting it had persevered in the face of Israel's assault.\n\nIsmail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said Israel had \"failed to achieve its goals.\" That said, Hamas declared \nits own truce and said that it would halt its attacks for a week in order to let Israeli forces pull out of Gaza.\n\nEven with both sides asserting that an end to the violence, attacks continued with Palestinian militants firing  \napproximately 20 rockets into Israeli territory after Israel announced its ceasefire.  For its part, Israel retaliated with \nair strikes in Gaza.\n\nThat said, some changes appeared to be afoot.  For example at the Erez crossing in northern Gaza, journalists \nwere able to enter into the Palestinian territory from Israel.  For some time, journalists were unable to reach Gaza \ndue to the closure of crossings.  The opening of this crossing seemed to augur a shift, even if the state of calm in \nGaza was of the uneasy variety.\n\nWith much destruction wrought in Gaza, attention was shifting to the needs of the people in Gaza.  To that end, \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deploying  a team to Gaza to  assess the gravity of the \nhumanitarian situation.  He said, \"Within 10 days, I think we'll be able to make an assessment report and we will \nissue a humanitarian urgent, a humanitarian flash appeal.\"\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nWithout full media access, it has been impossible to verify Palestinian claims that more than 1,300 people died \nduring the three weeks of violence.  \n\nUpdate:\n\nIn late January 2009, a bomb attack in the border between Israel and Gaza resulted in the death f one Israeli \nsoldier. Israel responded with air strikes and a short  military incursion into Gaza.  Days later, rocket attacks and \nmortar fire by Palestinian militants in Gaza targeted Israeli territory .  In response,  Israel carried out air strikes on \n\n\n\nHamas targets in Gaza.  This action came after  a warning from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that a \n\"disproportionate\" response was in the offing.  Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni as well as Defense Minister Ehud Barak \nboth repeated Olmert's warning.\n\nThese developments occurred two weeks after Israel and Hamas declared respective truces, which brought an end \nto a bloody conflict between the two sides that lasted several weeks from late December 2008 through early \nJanuary 2009.  It was not known how the flare-up would affect the prevailing talks aimed at achieving a permanent \nand sustainable ceasefire.\n\nThose talks were also likely to be affected by an ongoing internal Palestinian battle for supremacy between Hamas, \nwhich has had control over Gaza, and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO),  headed by President \nMahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.  To that end,  Abbas made it clear that no progress could be made without \nHamas's acknowledging the PLO as the leading Palestinian authority.  Abbas also railed against Hamas' recent \nactions, accusing the militant group of  taking \"risks with the blood of Palestinians, with their fate, and dreams and \naspirations for an independent Palestinian state.\"\n\nDomestic Scene\n\nElections were held in February 2009.  See section titled \"Israeli General Election of 2009: Kadima versus Likud\" \nbelow for a full report on the elections.\n\nIn March 2009, former Israeli President Moshe Katsav was formally charged with two counts of rape and other \nsexual offenses. The charges outlined in the indictment involved accusations by female employees who worked for \nKatsav during his tenure as president and tourism minister. There was no date scheduled for the trial.  For his part, \nKatsav has denied the charges but was nonetheless forced to resign as president in 2007. Katsav has \ncharacterized himself as the \"victim of lynching\" by the judiciary; Katsav has also said he wants to make clear his \ninnocence in court. To that end, he ended a plea bargain in 2008 that called for him to plead guilty to sexual \nmisconduct while avoiding the serious rape charges. Should Katsav be convicted, he could face as many as 16 \nyears in jail.\n\nIsraeli General Election of 2009: Kadima versus Likud\n\nSummary:\n\nLikud had the edge over Kadima in pre-election polls but exit polls showed reversal of fortune. Final results \nconfirmed Livni's Kadima had a slim advantage over Netanyahu's Likud; both camps have claimed victory with \nultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu of Avignor Lieberman acting as ultimate kingmaker. Lieberman's endorsement of \nNetanyahu set the stage for President Shimon Peres to call on the Likud leader to form the next government of \nIsrael.\n\nIn full:\n\nParliamentary elections in Israel were set for Feb. 10, 2009. The two leading parties vying for control over the \ncountry, and indeed, the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations, were the centrist Kadima party and the right-wing \nLikud party. While the efforts against Hamas in Gaza boosted support for Defense Minister Ehud Barak, his Labour \nParty was still not within striking distance of a big win. By contrast, the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu appeared to \ngaining support.\n\nOn the main issue of the day, Kadima leader, Tzipi Livni, has advocated the resumption of intense peace \nnegotiations with the Palestinians. By contrast, Likud leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that he opposes any \nagreement that would divide Jerusalem. He has also said that his efforts toward the Palestinians would concentrate \non economic relief. If Likud gained the most seats, it would have the opportunity to join with the ultra-nationalist \n\n\n\nYisrael Beitenu to form a coalition government. Such an alliance would present a clear move to the right since \nYisrael Beitenu leader, Avigdor Lieberman, has advocated strong military action against Hamas as well as the \nexpulsion of Arab citizens from Israel.\n\nAhead of the election, both Likud and Kadima were carrying out vigorous campaigns, reminiscent of the recent \n2008 election in the United States. Both parties utilized trendy websites, YouTube videos, blogs, enhanced rhetoric \nand string imagery. That said, ahead of the election, Kadima was running competitively against Likud, but \nNetanyahu's party had a slim but clear advantage of two seats according to the last Haaretz-Dialog poll.\n\nWhen the polls closed on election night, there appeared to be a slight reversal of fortune for the two main parties. \nAccording to exit polls, the centrist party, Kadima, held a slight edge over the right-wing party, Likud. That said, the \nultra-nationalist, Yisrael Beitenu, was performing strongly and was in place to become the most significant player in \nthe post-election coalition building process. The left-wing Labour Party, according to the exit polls, was trailing in \nfourth place despite high approval ratings for its party leader. The ultra orthodox Shas was behind Labour in fifth \nplace. Exit polls, though, have not always been harbingers for final results in close elections so the political fate of \nIsrael was yet to be seen.\n\nWith actual vote counting underway, results appeared to indicate that Kadima had won one seat more than Likud. \nLivni quickly claimed victory for her party, Kadima. She said, \"Today the people chose Kadima... We will form the \nnext government led by Kadima.\" But Netanyahu also asserted that he was confident that he would be asked to \nform the next government. He said, \"With God's help, I will lead the next government.\" These two statements \naugured a collision course on the political landscape.\n\nBy Feb. 12, 2009, the final results of Israel's parliamentary elections confirmed the centrist Kadima party, led by \nForeign Minister Tzipi Livni , had a slim majority over its main rival, the right-wing Likud Party, led by Benjamin \nNetanyahu. The final tally, according to Israel's Central Elections Committee, showed that Kadima secured 28 \nseats in the Knesset while Likud took 27 seats in the 120-member parliament. Among the other 10 parties that \npassed the two-percent minimum threshold to the Knesset were Yisrael Beiteinu with 15 seats, Labour Party with \n13 seats, and Shas with 11 seats. United Torah Judaism received five seats, while the National Union, Hadash and \nthe United Arab List-Ta'al received four seats each, and Habayit Hayehudi, Meretz and Balad got three seats each. \nAs such, the right-wing bloc of parties had secured 65 seats -- more than the center-left bloc of parties.\n\nWith Kadima holding on to its one-seat advantage in parliament, the question that was being asked was whether or \nnot Livni, as the head of Kadima, would be best positioned to form a government? Even if she joined with Labour, \nshe would have to cobble together a wider coalition with other parties in order to control the majority of seats in \nparliament. Alternatively, even if Likud came up one seat short, would Netanyahu be in a stronger position to form a \ngovernment, given the strong performance of the right-wing at the polls? Would he be more easily able to form a \ncoalition government? To that end, Yisrael Beitenu was certainly in a position to play kingmaker since the ultra-\nnationalist party had captured the third most seats in parliament.\n\nYisrael Beitenu's leader, Avigdor Lieberman, said he had talked with both Livni and Netanyahu about participating \nin a coalition government. Lieberman said he would be willing to join either camp, so long that the government \nultimately formed was of a nationalist orientation. His campaign platform was likely to find greater commonality with \nLikud rather than with Kadima; it was certainly at odds with Labour. Meanwhile, what role would Labour and Shas \nplay? The notion of a grand coalition -- spanning the political expanse from left to right and including all the main \nparties -- was not likely to materialize; Livni of Kadima was reported to have stated that she would not serve in a \ngovernment with Likud's Netanyahu.\n\nUltimately, President Shimon Peres would have to make the decision to ask a party leader to try to form a \ngovernment. To that end, Peres held consultations with leaders of parliamentary factions; based on the findings of \nthose discussions, he would then assign the cabinet-formation task to a party leader in parliament who has the best \nchance of crafting a stable and successful coalition government. Traditionally, that mission has been given to the \nleader of the party with the plurality of seats in the Knesset. As demonstrated by the final results discussed above, \nKadima was the party with the most seats in the Knesset, meaning that Livni was in a strong position to be given \n\n\n\nthe mission of government formation. But since the right-wing now collectively dominated the parliament, Likud \nmight have an easier time at forming a sustainable government.\n\nBy the third week of February 2009, the leader of the ultra-nationalist party, Yisrael Beitenu, made it clear that he \nwas supporting Netanyahu and not Livni, although he expressed hopes for a grand coalition that would include \nwhat he called \"the big three\" -- a reference to the three parties receiving the most votes. Lieberman's endorsement \nof Netanyahu set the stage for President Shimon Peres to call on the Likud leader to form the next government of \nIsrael.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu, said he would attempt to form a broad national unity government that would include his \npolitical rivals. To that end, he expressly called for the participation of both Kadima and Labour in that endeavor \nsaying, \"I call on Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni and Labour Party chairman Ehud Barak and I say to them - let's \nunite to secure the future of the State of Israel.\"\n\nBut, as before, Livni made it apparent that Kadima's interests and agenda might better be served in opposition, \nrather than in a right-wing government headed by Netanyahu. Indeed, she vociferously rejected the notion of a \ngovernment dominated by the far right saying that it would be a government \"without political vision, a government \nwith no values.\" She went on to asset, \"I will not be a pawn in a government that would be against our ideals.\"\n\nOf key importance to Kadima, and its occasional ally, Labour, has been a commitment to continuing the peace \nprocess and support for the Oslo Peace Accords, which aims for a two-state solution.. But such a position was at \nodds with both Likud and Yisrael Beitenu. Likud's 1999 charter clearly rejects the notion of a sovereign Palestinian \nstate although it supports the idea of some sort of Palestinian autonomy. As noted above, Yisrael Beitenu has \nadvocated the Elon Plan, which includes the expulsion of Arab citizens who are unwilling to sign loyalty oaths \nsupporting the preservation of the Jewish state.\n\nGiven the philosophical chasm between the major parties, Netanyahu may be forced to form a hard right \ngovernment, which may not sit well with the totality of the Israeli population. Forging a more inclusive government \ncould only be reached if Kadima exacted an expensive price -- such as a shared head of government role, which \ncould commence with a Prime Minister Netanyahu but rotate to have Livni at the helm in two years.\n\nSuch a possibility receded after it was announced in late February 2009 that talks between Likud and Kadima \nended in failure. Netanyahu said, I have done everything possible to achieve unity... but to my great regret, I faced \ncategorical rejection from Mrs Livni.\" For her part, Livni said that her meeting with Netanyahu did not resolve the \nimportant matters that were fundamental to her party and, as such, Kadima would be \"a responsible opposition.\"\n\nIn March 2009,  the Likud leader reportedly signed a coalition deal in mid-March 2009 with the far-right part, Yisrael \nBeiteinu.  The party is opposed to an independent state for the Palestinians, advocates expelling Arab Israelis,  and \nendorses settlement deemed to be illegal by international law.  Ensconced in the agreement was a provision for \nYisrael Beiteinu's leader, Avigdor Lieberman, to become foreign minister. As well, Yisrael Beiteinu would control \nfive significant ministerial portfolios, including internal security, infrastructure, tourism, and the integration of new \nimmigrants.  Later in the month,  Netanyahu's Likud signed another coalition deal -- this time with the ultra-\nOrthodox Shas party.  While of the hard-line variety, Shas, unlike Yisrael Beiteinu, has not rejected the peace \nprocess with the Palestinians outright and has said that poverty alleviation is its most important issue.\n\nEven with Yisrael Beiteinu and Shas joining Likud, the government formation process was far from complete. \nIndeed, there were reports that Netanyahu was trying to strike a deal with the Labour Party to join in the formation \nof a broader \"national unity\" government. Accordingly, Netanyahu was given an additional gets more time two \nweeks to form a new government. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Kadima decried the notion of Labour joining in \nNetanyahu's government, noting that any party interested in a two-state solution to the peace process could not join \nthe government proposed by Netanyahu. For his part, if Netanyahu could not convince Labour to join him, then he \nwould be forced to form a narrow right-wing government with parties such as Jewish Home, National Union and \n\n\n\nUnited Torah Judaism, essentially placing Israel on an ideological collision course with the new United States \ngovernment.\n\nBy March 24, 2009, such a hard-line course was averted when the Labour Party approved a bid to join in \nNetanyahu's coalition. Labour Party leader, Ehud Barak, who had earlier said that his party would be in opposition, \nindicated that his party would have a significant position in the coalition that already included Yisrael Beitenu. Barak \nsaid, \"I am not afraid of Benjamin Netanyahu. We won't be anyone's fig leaf or anyone's third wheel.\" He continued, \n\"We will act as an opposing force that will prevent the creation of a narrow right-wing government, but rather a \nproper government that cares for the state of Israel.\" The deal under discussion would convey five ministerial \nportfolios to the Labor Party, the chairmanship of a Knesset committee, continued commitment to the Middle East \npeace process, as well as respect for existing peace accords and laws. To that latter end, the Israeli government \nwould have to adhere to legislation prohibiting illegal settlement and would also have to abide by international \ntreaties including those that envisage a two-state solution. Those particular provisions could well create friction \nwithin the coalition, given Avignor Lieberman's position on those two issues.\n\nA number of Labour politicians nonetheless decried the proposal, including Labour Party Secretary-General Eitan \nCabel, who said, \"What killed us over the last decade is the fact that we lost faith in our path.\" Labour \nparliamentarian, Ophir Paz-Pines, expressed virulent opposition saying, \"They're trying to buy us off with portfolios \nand empty promises.\" But Labor member, Isaac Herzog, warned that a far-government would be catastrophic. He \nsaid, \"If it was possible for a government to be formed in which we could have a truly dramatic influence over all \naspects, then I would want to be there and think that my party will not be damaged as a result.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Saeb Erekat, a senior advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as being the \nchief negotiator with Israel's outgoing Kadima-led government, expressed some anxiety about the prospect of a \nLikud-led government. He said that Israel needed a government committed to peace. Moreover, he signaled that \nbilateral talks were at risk of ending. Erekat said, \"We will not be in the negotiations with an Israeli government that \ncontinues settlement activities, that refuses the two-state solution, and that doesn't accept agreements signed.\"\n\nWith a coalition in tact, Netanyahu was sworn into office at the close of March 2009  as the new Israeli prime \nminister.  Netanyahu assumed the post following a vote in parliament, which effectively ratified the new right-leaning \ngovernment.  The new government was the largest in the political history of the country -- a clear result of the \npolitical wrangling needed to cobble together the coalition.  Included in that government would be right-wing \nLieberman as Foreign Minister and left-leaning Barak as Defense Minister.  Another result of the political wrangling, \nas indicated above,  was Netanyahu's concession to Labour to adhere to prevailing laws and treaties, as well as his \nstatements suggesting that he would pursue peace with the Palestinians.  To that end, Netanyahu said,  \"I say to \nthe Palestinian leadership, if you truly want peace, peace can be obtained\"  and \"I am telling the leaders of the \nPalestinian Authority, if you really want peace, it is possible to reach peace.\"  Netanyahu, however, never made \nmention of a two-state solution -- a feature the Palestinian Authority viewed as less than encouraging. As \nbefore, Netanyahu has emphasized  economic, political and security tracks toward peace.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman was the source of controversy on \ntwo fronts in early April 2009. First, Lieberman was questioned by police under suspicion of a litany of corruption \nallegations. Included in the long list were allegations including bribery, money-laundering and breach of trust, and \ninvolved a company administered by Lieberman's daughter. A spokesperson for the foreign minister dismissed the \nmatter saying that the investigation had been ongoing for more than a decade. The second issue involved \nLieberman's comments at the foreign ministry handover ceremony in which he claimed that Israel was not bound \nby the 2007 Annapolis Accord between Israel and the Palestinians. He argued that only the Road Map peace plan \nof 2003 should stand, since it was ratified by the Israeli government and the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThese positions on the peace process would clearly contradict Netanyahu's agreement with another coalition \npartner, Ehud Barak of the Labour Party. The terms of their coalition deal called for Netanyahu's government to \n\n\n\nrespect prevailing treaties and agreements. Moreover, Lieberman's stance seriously undermined Netanyahu's \nevolving and increasingly restrained stance on relations with the Palestinians, including his pledge to seek peace.  \nMeanwhile, Lieberman's expressed opposition to Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- a central part of \nnegotiations with Syria -- could short-circuit the prospects for peace with that country. At the wider level, this \nposition, along with the rejection of the Annapolis Accords, and Lieberman's call for Arabs to be expelled from \nIsrael, could weaken already fragile trust with Arabs in the region. Indeed, it could deepen animosity.\n\nLieberman's remarks have reinforced critics' perceptions that he was a questionable choice for the position of \nIsrael's chief diplomat. To that end, Kadima leader, Tzipi Livni, excoriated Lieberman's statements saying that they \ndemonstrated that the new government of Israel was not a good faith partner in the pursuit of peace. In calling on \nNetanyahu to disavow them, she said, \"The remarks do not represent Israel, the remarks hurt Israel.\" Chief \nPalestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, also condemned Lieberman for undermining international efforts to advance \nthe peace process saying, \"He [Lieberman] has slammed the door in the face of the United States and the \ninternational community.\"\n\nIn late June 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to dismiss \nultra-nationalist, Avigdor Lieberman, as foreign minister and replace him with centrist opposition leader, Tzipi Livni.  \nAccording to Israeli media, President Sarkozy  urged the Israeli leader to work with both Livni's Kadima Party and \nDefense Minister Ehud Barak's Labour Party to \"make history\" and advance the peace process during a private \nmeeting.  It was already well-know that Lieberman's controversial views in support of the Elon Plan, which includes \nthe expulsion of Arab citizens unwilling to sign loyalty oaths supporting the preservation of the Jewish state, could \nwell compromise that peace process.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, Sarkozy said: \"I've always received Israeli foreign ministers. I met \nwith Tzipi Livni in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, but with that one I simply can't meet. I'm telling you, you need to get rid of that \nman. Get him out of the government and bring in Livni. With her and with Barak you can make history.\"  In the \narticle published by Yediot Aharonot,  Netanyahu replied: \"No need to exaggerate. Lieberman is a very nice person, \nand in private conversations he speaks differently.\"  Sarkozy then responded by comparing the Israeli foreign \nminister to the French far-right xenophobe, Jean Marie Le Pen, saying:  \"In private conversations, Jean-Marie Le \nPen is also a nice person.\"\n\nThe exchange was confirmed by several participants at the meeting and evoked much debate both at home in \nIsrael and within the wider international community. \n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn May 2009, following a meeting with United States President Barack Obama, newly-inaugurated Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he was ready to commence peace talks with Palestinians and Syria. He \nsaid, \"I said I am willing to open peace talks with the Palestinians - [and] by the way with the Syrians as well - of \ncourse without preconditions.\" He also noted that such talks should include the wider regional players saying, \"We \nalso agreed on the need to expand the peace process to Arab states.\"\n\nNetanyahu, however, issued a caveat that there could be no peace agreement without Israel's security needs being \nadequately addressed. This move to embrace peace negotiations came after a visit to the United States where he \nwas pressured by President Barack Obama to consider a two state solution to the ongoing conflict with \nPalestinians. Netanyahu described his meeting with Obama saying, \"There was an agreement that we need to \nimmediately begin the peace process.\" But he stopped short of endorsing the two-state concept, as advocated by \nPresident Obama, instead saying that Israel was ready to live \"side by side\" with the Palestinians.\n\nMeanwhile, an aide to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, entered the spotlight when it was widely reported that he decried \nthe two-state solution, characterizing it as \"childish and stupid \" Faced with questions as to why he would condemn \nthe idea of an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living side by side, Dermer offered the following \nclarification to the Associated Press: \"I told reporters that the focus by the media on the concept of solving the \n\n\n\nIsrael-Palestinian issue through a two-state solution is childish and stupid, but I deny that I described the idea that \nway.\"\n\nLater in May 2009, on the heels of meetings with both the Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and his Palestinian \ncounterpart Mahmoud Abbas, United States President Barack Obama said that he was confident about a two-state \nsolution in the Middle East peace process.  Earlier, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed these \nstatements saying \"We believe strongly in a two-state solution.\"\n\nShe  noted that a two-state solution was in the \"best interests\" of both Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nPresident Obama said he believed Israel would see that such a path would help that country achieve sustainable \npeace and security.  President Obama also said that all Arab countries would be expected to support and respect \nthe two-state solution, which would essentially require recognition of the legitimacy of the Jewish state.\n\nWith these ends in mind, President Obama said that Israel should stop its expansion of settlements -- a call made \nin emphatic terms earlier by Obama's Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  But Israel was not quick to give wholesale \nassent to this demand.  While Israeli President Netanyahu said that no new settlements would be constructed, he \nnoted that the natural growth of existing settlements would be allowed.  Meanwhile, President Obama also \ndemanded that Palestinians stop their violent attacks against Israel.\n\nOn June 14, 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would back the notion of a \nPalestinian state within limits.  Describing his peace plan, Netanyahu said that a Palestinian state would have to be \ndemilitarized -- essentially without an army, with no control over the air space, and without means of smuggling \nweapons.  These limits were clearly set forth to ensure Israel's security.  He also noted that his support for a \nPalestinian state would be contingent upon recognition of Israel as a Jewish homeland.  This proposal \nencompassed many elements advocated by the Obama administration in the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu extended an overture to Palestinian counterparts, calling for immediate talks without \npreconditions.  He also struck a conciliatory tone saying, \"We want to live with you in peace as good neighbors.\"  \nThe Israeli prime minister additionally acknowledged the need for concurrence on a potential peace deal at the \nregional level, saying that he would consider traveling to Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia to consolidate support \nfor the proposed agreement.\n\nStill at issue, however, has been the call for cessation of settlement activity in the West Bank.  Netanyahu's \ngovernment has been resistant to comply with this provision set forth by the United States.  Indeed, even as he put \nforth his peace plan, the Israeli prime minister indicated little movement on this issue.  Instead, Netanyahu said that \nJewish settlers were not \"enemies of peace\" and did not reverse his stance in favor of \"natural growth\" of existing \nsettlements.\n\nIn late June 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called for the creation of a Palestinian state \nwithin a two year timeframe.  He said, \"I call on all our people to unite around the project of establishing a state and \nto strengthen its institutions ... so that the Palestinian state becomes, by the end of next year or within two years at \nmost, a reality.\"  Speaking at al-Quds University in East Jerusalem, Prime Minister repeated the Palestinian \nAuthority's demand that Israel stop its settlement activity in the West Bank, in order to pave the way for  talks \nbetween the two sides.  While settlements remained a prevailing obstacle to restarted peace negotiations, Prime \nMinister Fayyad introduced a new sticking point by calling for a Palestinian capital in Eastern Jerusalem.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the notion \nof a demilitarized Palestinian state, pending recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.  But, while the Israeli prime \nminister has said that his country would not construct new settlements in the West Bank,  he has said Israel would \nnot stop the \"natural growth\" of existing settlements. Moreover, Netanyahu has asserted that Jerusalem -- Israel's \n\n\n\nofficial capital city -- should remain \"united.\"  That is, he made clear that he would not support the partition of the \ncity as part of the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nAt the start of July 2009, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak denied that there was any impasse with the United \nStates over Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank. Barak made the remarks even as talks with United States \nenvoy George Mitchell ended without a clear agreement on the matter.  Instead, the two sides issued a joint \nstatement noting that a \"full range of issues related to Middle East peace\" had been discussed.  These issues \nincluded security, normalization of relations between Arab countries and Israel, as well as settlement activity.\n\nOf key significance was this latter issue and the prevailing call by the United States for Israel to cease all settlement \nactivity in the West Bank, while at the same time, Israel has maintained its right to the \"natural growth\" of existing \nJewish settlements. Driving the perception of some sort of impasse has been the Palestinians' position that peace \ntalks cannot be started without a settlement freeze in areas it hopes to one day become part of an independent \nPalestinian state.\n\nDefense Minister Barak characterized the meeting with Mitchell as \"positive,\" although  he acknowledged that there \nwere differences.  In an interview broadcast on Israeli radio, he suggested that a compromise was in the offing.  \nThe actual nature of such a compromise was unknown.  However, it was revealed that Israel had approved the \nconstruction of several new residences in the Adam settlement -- an unofficial outpost deemed to be illegal under \nthe aegis of international law.\n\nFor its part, Israel has said disputed this claim of illegality.\n\nIn August 2009, Israel's government was reported to have stopped issuing settler housing tenders in the West \nBank, in a possible overture of cooperation with the United States in pursuing the peace process. The Obama \nadministration in the United States has pressured the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel \nto freeze  settlement activity, in the interests of peace with the Palestinians.  In an interview on Israeli radio,  \nHousing Minster Ariel Atias acknowledged the cessation of settlement tenders for construction in Judea and \nSamaria, but insisted it was just a temporary move saying, \"There is no freeze, there is a waiting period.\"  He went \non to note,  \"It's no secret that the prime minister is trying to reach some sort of understandings with the Obama \nadministration, which is being tough with us.\" Atias made no mention of Prime Minister Netanyahu's continuing \ninsistence that \"natural growth\" of settlements (i.e. to accommodate family members) should not be stopped.\n\nMeanwhile, United States President Barack Obama appeared satisfied with the measure saying that it showed \n\"movement in the right direction.\"  That direction pointed toward the revitalization of the peace process.  In the \ninterests of making progress along that path, the White House has called on Israel to stop settlement activity in line \nwith prevailing \"roadmap for peace,\" which also mandates that the Palestinian authorities crush anti-Israeli militants. \nThe White House was also placing pressure on Arab nation states to move towards the normalization of ties with \nIsrael, which would automatically concede recognition of the Jewish state.\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government was making progress on \nthe path toward the reconvening of peace talks with the Palestinians. The announcement came after a meeting with \nUnited States envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, which resulted in Netanyahu's acceptance of Mitchell's \nproposal for the resumption of talks with the Palestinians.  To that end, there were tentative plans afoot for \nNetanyahu to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the United Nations in September 2009.\n\nAlso in late August 2009, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was officially indicted in three corruption cases, \naccording to reports from the attorney general's office. Among the charges listed in the 61-page indictment were \nfraud, breach of trust, registering false corporate documents and concealing fraudulent earnings. The allegations \ninvolved the period when Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem and a cabinet minister, and effectively preceded his \n\n\n\ntenure as prime minister. A spokesperson for the former head of government said, \"Olmert is convinced that in the \ncourt he will be able to prove his innocence once and for all.\"The corruption trial of Olmert was set to begin at the \nclose of September 2009.\n\nAs discussed above, the corruption scandal erupted involving then-Prime Minister Olmert erupted more than a year \nearlier in May 2008.  At issue were alleged bribery claims, due to an investigation that linked him with payments \nfrom a New York businessman, Morris Talansky.  Olmert acknowledged receiving the payments but said that they \nwere legal contributions to his campaign and, as such, he had done nothing wrong.  By July 2008, the corruption \nprobe widened so that it could also investigate whether or not Olmert committed fraud. A joint statement by police \nand the justice ministry noted that the Israeli prime minister was suspected of seeking \"duplicate funding for his trips \nabroad from public bodies.\" Another source of controversy involved suspected conflict of interest and surrounded \nallegations that Olmert arranged investment projects for a friend, Uri Messner, when he was serving as industry \nminister.  In September 2008, Israeli police officially recommended that Prime Minister Olmert  be indicted in the \naforementioned  corruption investigation. For his part, Olmert has consistently maintained his innocence but, \nnonetheless, resigned from his post as leader of Kadima, once then-Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni won the party's \nprimary election later 2008.\n\nIn the first part of September 2009,  two rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon; the explosions were \nreported in the Israeli city of Nahariya only six miles from the border with Lebanon. The Israeli military responded by \nfiring eight shells into a fruit plantation near the city of Tyre.  There were no reports of deaths or injuries as a result, \nalthough Israeli police said they did manage to find the remnants of a Katyusha rocket.\n\nUnited Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon urged both sides to exercise restraint in response to the situation. The \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said that it was deploying extra troops and released the following \nstatement:  \"Unifil is in contact with both sides, urging them to exercise maximum restraint, uphold the cessations of \nhostilities and avoid taking steps which would lead to further escalation.\"  Unifil was established in 1978 following \nIsrael's incursion into Lebanon and was expanded after Israel's 2006 war with the militant Islamic group, \nHezbollah. That situation was spurred by a Hezbollah offensive from Lebanese terrain into Israel, in which two \nIsraeli soldiers were seized at the onset. Israel retaliated and Lebanese citizens -- more than 1,000 in total -- were \nkilled in the crossfire of violence.  As well, about 160 Israelis, most of whom were soldiers, also died in the war as \na result of rocket fire and fighting. The border region maintained a sense of uneasy calm since the end of 2006, \nalthough there have been occasional flare ups of rocket fire and clashes between the two sides.\n\nWith news abounding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had left his office on the clandestine trip, speculation \ngrew that he may have been visiting a security facility in Israel, or, meeting with an Arab state that has not officially \nrecognized the Jewish state of Israel. But according to Haaretz, on Sept. 9, 2009,  Prime Minister Netanyahu had \nmade a secret visit to Moscow to discuss the matter of  Russian arms sales to Iran and Syria.  At issue has been \nrising tensions between Israel and Russia over Moscow's arms sales to Iran and Syria. Of particular concern have \nbeen the transfers of weapons to the extremist Islamic organization, Hezbollah, in Lebanon -- a particular flashpoint \neven since the 2006 between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  The Russian trip reportedly garnered other \nresults on the wider international stage.  With the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program still looming, Russia \ncalled on Iran to act with \"sensitivity\" to Israel's geopolitical plight.\n\nSeptember 2009 was also marked by developments on the peace process front. United States envoy George \nMitchell has met with Israeli leaders to discuss the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  The issue of \ncontinued expansion of Jewish settlements has been an obstacle in the peace process, and one that the Obama \nadministration in the United States  has taken a key role in resolving. On the other side of the equation, Mitchell was \nalso pushing Arab nation states to officially recognize the Jewish state of Israel.  The dual moves were part of an \neffort by the Obama administration in the United States to finalize the terms of fresh peace negotiations between \nIsrael and Palestinians.  Following a meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres, Mitchell said, \"While we have not \nyet reached agreement on many outstanding issues, we are working hard to do so.\"\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in \nCairo. Netanyahu was cautious about the peace process noting that much work was still to be done on minimizing \nthe differences on both sides before serious peace talks could begin again. He said,  \"I hope we will be able to \nnarrow the gaps and perhaps bridge them so we will be able to get peacemaking moving.\" Talks between the two \nsides stalled in late 2008.  For his part, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas foreclosed a meeting with Israeli \nleaders until Israel commits to a full freeze on new settlements in the West Ban\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Sept. 22, 2009, with an eye on \nrevitalizing the peace process.  President Obama held separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas before convening the joint meeting. This announcement \ncame in the aftermath of a visit by United States Middle East envoy, George Mitchell to the region, with an eye on \ntrying to find some common ground ahead of the meeting in the United States. Mitchell  returned home without \nconsensus and with both sides blaming one another for the inability to find  common ground.  Nevertheless, \nMitchell, said that President Obama's willingness to engage directly at this stage with the two principal players \nshowed his \"deep commitment to comprehensive peace.\" \n\nMeanwhile, also in September 2009, Israel warned India that Islamic extremists were plotting attacks similar to \nthose carried out  in Mumbai the year before. Israel's counter-terrorism unit said that the terrorist group responsible \nfor the 2008 Mumbai attacks were planning further attacks that would target Western and/or Israeli tourists. They \ncharacterized their findings as \"as concrete, very serious threat.\" To that end, Israel was reportedly set to issue a \ntravel advisory warning Israelis not to travel to India.  According to the Indian government, the terrorist group \nLashkar-a-Taiba, was responsible for the attacks in November 2008, which targeted luxury hotels, a train station, \nand an orthodox Jewish Lubavitch center, and left more than 170 people dead.\n\nOn Oct. 13, 2009, during an address marking the opening of the Knesset's winter session, Israeli President Shimon \nPeres called on the government of his country to resume peace talks with the Palestinians.\n\nPresident Peres' call for the government to actively pursue peace with the Palestinians came a few days ahead of \nthe 15th anniversary of the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.  Moreover, November 2009 would mark 32 \nyears since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made his historic visit to Israel.  President Peres noted that while \nIsrael's respective relationships with Jordan and Egypt were not based on amity, the peace deals paved the way for \nstability with these two neighboring Arab nation states.\n\nPresident Peres said that Israel was faced with two options: (1) Israel's isolation, while facing hostility from \nPalestinians and Arab nation states, as well as criticism from the international community; and (2) negotiations with \nthe Palestinian Authority, aimed at finding a sustainable solution.  He warned that a failure to pursue the second \noption would serve only to bolster the likes of Hamas and Iran, while destroying hopes for peace and stability in the \nregion. To these ends, he said, \"In my opinion if we move forward with peace and make peace with the \nPalestinians, and if we start negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, we will remove the main pretext for the Iranian \nmadness - against us and against the other residents of this region.\"  President Peres also made the foundation for \nany peace deal clear.  He said that in order to achieve peace, \"we must give up land and the Palestinians must stop \nterrorism.\"\n\nIn early November 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the Middle East to pursue peace \ntalks between Israel and Arab states over the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nArab leaders were reported to have been disappointed that the United States' top diplomat  did not pressure the \nNetanyahu government in Israel more over its settlement activity.  But Secretary of State Clinton explained the \nUnited States' position saying, \"The Israelis have responded to the call of the U.S., the Palestinians and the Arab \nworld to stop settlement activity by expressing a willingness to restrain settlement activity. This offer falls far short of \n\n\n\nwhat our preference would be but if it is acted upon it will be an unprecedented restriction on settlements and would \nhave a significant and meaningful effect on restraining their growth.\"\n\nSecretary of  State Clinton also acknowledged that the Palestinian leadership of Mahmoud Abbas for taking  \n\"positive steps\"  to improve security in the West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, around the same period in early November 2009, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \nannounced that he would not to seek re-election to the highest post in the Palestinian territories. President Abbas \nsaid he had made the decision to protest the impasse in peace negotiations. He was particularly vocal in his \naccusation that the United States had not fulfilled its promise to pressure Israel to freeze its settlement activity in \nthe West Bank. He has also been faced with an internal and unresolved power struggle with the extremist Hamas \nmovement. Some analysts suggested that while President Abbas may have been genuinely upset by what he saw \nas the United States' backtracking on its position on the settlements, his announcement was actually a tactical \nmaneuver.  Indeed, President Abbas indicated that he was not exiting the political scene but intended to remain as \nthe head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.\n\nNevertheless, Israeli officials responded to the news with concern and warned that President Abbbas' decision \ncould derail the peace process. To that end, Israeli President Shimon Peres reportedly called President Abbas \nahead of the formal announcement and attempted to persuade him to change his mind. According to the Israeli \nnewspaper, Ha'aretz, President Peres said, \"If you leave, the Palestinians would lose their chance for an \nindependent state. The situation in the region would deteriorate. Stay, for the Palestinian people's sake.\" As well, \nIsraeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak issued a statement conveying his hope that President Abbas' announcement \nwould not damage \"efforts to launch negotiations and achieve a peace accord.\"\n\nIn other developments at the start of November 2009, the Israeli navy intercepted a ship and seized the 300 tons of \narms it was transporting aboard. According to Israeli intelligence, the arms were tracked for 2,500 miles and \noriginated from Iran's port of Bandar Abbas.  The port has been known to be a base of the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuards Corps and has been linked with Hezbollah. Israeli, Lebanese and Cypriot sources also asserted that  the \narms had been shipped from Bandar Abbas on an Iranian cargo ship called the Visea, which was itself owned by \nthe state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The Visea reported sailed in the Arabian Sea, moved north up \nthe Red Sea, then traveled via the Suez Canal before docking in the Egyptian port of Damietta.  There, 36 \ncontainers were offloaded; within them were 3,000 Katyusha rockets, as well as a significant  number of hand \ngrenades, artillery shells and other ammunition.  After remaining at Damietta for a week, the containers were then \ntransferred to a German-owned vessel called the Francop, which flew an Antiguan flag.  That ship was ultimately \ndestined for the Syrian port of Latakia.  Israel said that the ship's crew and German owners were unaware that the \nweapons were hidden behind other cargo.\n\nIsrael has alleged that the arms were to be moved from Syria over land and ultimately delivered to Hezbollah.  \nIsrael has thusly argued that this was the latest evidence that Iran has been arming Hezbollah and Hamas -- the \ntwo extremist groups that have been responsible for rocket attacks from the Palestinian territory of Gaza into Israeli \nterritory.  But there have also been reports that Israel was emphasizing the Iranian arms connection to Hezbollah \nand Hamas in order to deflect attention from a scathing United Nations report, which accusing both Israel and \nHamas of committing war crimes during a conflict in Gaza less than a year earlier.  Meanwhile, both Iran and Syria  \nhave denied the transportation of arms, as alleged by Israel.\n\nIn January 2010, Israel's government approved plans for the construction of a barrier along its border with Egypt in \nan effort to restrict the movement of militants.  The barrier would be built in two segments -- close to the Red Sea at \nEilat and on the edge of the Gaza Strip respectively -- and would take approximately two years to complete.  Israeli \nPrime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision to build the barrier was intended to secure Israel's Jewish \nand democratic character.  The barrier would also presumably restrict -- but not completely bar -- the entry of \n\n\n\nmigrants from Africa. To this end, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that refugees would be permitted to seek entry \ninto Israeli territory.\n\nIn this regard the move was likely to be supported by Egypt, which has been trying to deal with the problem of \nhuman trafficking from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. For its part, Egypt was constructing an underground barrier \nalong its border with Gaza, aimed at curtailing the smuggling of weapons through tunnels.\n\nMeanwhile, the first week of January 2010 saw three Palestinians killed as a result of Israeli air raids; those strikes \nby Israel were carried out in response to rocket attacks from Gaza.  Days later, more Palestinian militants died \nafter another Israeli air strike on Gaza.  The militants apparently were from the group, Islamic Jihad, and were \ngathered in a field, preparing to launch rocket attacks into Israel. An Israeli military spokesperson said in an \ninterview with Agence France Presse: \"We won't tolerate the firing of rockets into Israel and we will respond harshly \nas we did now.\"  In the background of these developments was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's \nannouncement on Jan. 10, 2010, to his cabinet that there had been 20 mortar bombs and rockets from the Gaza \nStrip in the first week of 2010. According to Reuters, he warned of an \"immediate and powerful response\" to further \nattacks.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nAssassination of Hamas commander in Dubai leads to speculation of Israeli Mossad involvement\n\nIn the third week of February 2010, the assassination of a Hamas commander in Dubai led to speculation of Israeli \nMossad involvement. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was seemingly killed in a hotel room in Dubai on Jan. 20, 2010, while \nreportedly purchasing weapons for the extremist Islamic group.  At issue a month later was the claim by the United \nArab Emirates that 11 \"agents with European passports\" may have carried out the killing. The authorities in the \nUnited Arab Emirates released video-taped footage showing some of the suspects in the killing dressed in disguise \nin the hotel where the killing took place.\n\nSeveral of the foreign-born Israelis who were named as suspects said that they believed their passports were stolen \nand used by the alleged assassins.  Meanwhile, the governments of France, Germany, United Kingdom and Ireland \nrespectively noted that they believed fake passports from their countries were fraudulently used by the apparent \nassassins.\n\nFor its part, Israel said there was no evidence of its involvement with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman \nasserting that there was no proof the Mossad -- Israel's secret security agency -- carried out the assassination of \nal-Mabhouh in Dubai. In an interview on Army Radio, he said: \"I don't know why we are assuming that Israel, or the \nMossad, used those passports. There is no reason to think that it was the Israeli Mossad, and not some other \nintelligence service or country up to some mischief.\" However, it was clear that Israel was not actually denying that \nit had carried out the assassination, since it instead cited its \"policy of ambiguity\" on such matters.  Lieberman said,  \n\"Israel never responds, never confirms and never denies. There is no reason for Israel to change this policy.\"\n\nIndeed, Mossad has in the past used fraudulent foreign passports and stolen identities to carry out political \nassassinations, although as noted by the Israel foreign minister, his country \"never confirms\" such actions. \nNevertheless, experts on Mossad's techniques, such as former Israeli officer Gad Shimron expressed the view that \nthe killing of al-Mabhouh bore the hallmarks of an Israeli operation.\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2010, the United Kingdom summoned the Israeli ambassador to discuss  the use of fraudulent British \npassports in the assassination of al-Mabhouh. It was not known as to whether or not a diplomatic imbroglio would \nbe provoked as a result.  It was certainly not known as to whether or not Israel was definitively behind the killing.  \nShould that indeed be the case, Israel would have managed to deliver a clear but undeclared message that it \nwould strike out against its enemies -- even on foreign soil.  But it would also have to deal with the fact that the 11 \nsuspects were now placed on Interpol's wanted list.  Although the issuance by Interpol of \"Red Notices\" for the \nsuspects was  not akin to international arrest warrants, they nonetheless call for the suspects to be arrested \n\n\n\npending extradition.  Of course, as noted by Ronald Noble, the secretary general of Interpol, the actual identities of \nthe suspects remained unknown.\n\nOn March 23, 2010,  the United Kingdom decided to expel an Israeli  diplomat for the use of forged British \npassports in the suspected Mossad  assassination of a Hamas commander,  Mahmoud Al Mabhouh, in a Dubai \nhotel room.  The move came after an investigation into the matter and was made official with an address by British \nForeign Secretary David Miliband to parliamentarians in the House of Commons.  To date,  Israel has neither \nconfirmed nor denied involvement in the apparent targeted assassination of al-Mabhouh.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nRoadmap for peace hits roadblock with East Jerusalem settlement plan; diplomatic imbroglio ensues between \nIsrael and United States\n\nOn March 8, 2010,  Israeli and Palestinian negotiators  agreed to indirect peace talks. Following a meeting with \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Israeli Vice Premier Silvan Shalom confirmed  that his country  \nwanted to \"move to direct talks\" with the Palestinians.  He said,  \"Israel would like to resume the negotiations \ndirectly immediately.\"  He also called for a shortened period before both parties moved toward direct dialogue.  At \nissue has been the so-called \"roadmap for peace,\" which has been sanctioned by the Middle East  Quartet made \nup of the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia, and which calls for the establishment of two \nstates -- Israel and Palestine -- living side by side in peace and security.\n\nDays later on March 11, 2010, this \"roadmap for peace\" appeared to have hit a roadblock when the Palestinian \nAuthority made clear that indirect talks could not proceed unless Israel could commit to a total construction freeze \nof Jewish settlements.  According to Ynetnews.com, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was not willing to \nnegotiate \"under the current circumstances\"  -- an apparent reference to the news that Israel had new construction \nplans for east Jerusalem.  At the heart of the matter was a plan by Israel to build 1,600 new homes in  in Ramat \nShlomo in east Jerusalem, despite repeated pressure by the United States for a halt on Jewish settlements in the \ninterests of peace.\n\nFor some time,  Jerusalem has been a flashpoint in the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.  \nJerusalem is the official  capital city of the Jewish state of Israel, and Israel has laid claim to  the eastern part of the \ncity since the 1967 war.  However, Palestinians have clamored for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future \nPalestinian state.  Palestinians have argued that settlement activity in east Jerusalem is illegal under international \nlaw.  Israel, though, has disputed this view of international jurisprudence. Of course, to date, these competing \nclaims over the contested part of the city have seen no resolution, and the status of Jerusalem has remained a \nsticking point in the peace process.\n\nKey officials  in the Obama administration in the United States  have registered disapproval of the development, \nnoting that it was an obstacle to the process of building trust, confidence, and ultimately peace between Israelis and \nPalestinians.  Indeed, the Obama administration in the United States railed against Israel in response to the \nannouncement of settlement activity in east Jerusalem.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who was ironically in Israel at the time for the purpose of advancing the peace process, \ndenounced the development.  On NBC News, David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, referred  \nto Israel's settlement announcement as both destructive to the peace effort, and  insulting to the United States, a \nlikely reference to the timing of the announcement when Vice President Biden was in Israel.  He said, \"This was an \naffront, it was an insult but most importantly it undermined this very fragile effort.\" He continued, \"We have just \nstarted proximity talks, that is shuttle diplomacy, between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and for this \nannouncement to come at that time was very destructive.\" Earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this move by Israel was \"deeply negative\" for American-Israeli relations.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his apologies for the situation that unfolded \nand explained that the announcement had been accidental, however,  even a promise for an inquiry into the timing \nof the announcement did little to assuage the White House.  Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the Israeli premier's \nregrets were only \"a good start\" and pressed for more constructive dialogue with an eye on peace.  The situation \nwas not helped by news reports that Prime Minister Netanyahu's brother in law, Hagi Ben-Artzi, referred to \nPresident Obama as \"anti-Semitic.\" This declaration only exacerbated the tense climate of relations and Netanyahu \nwas compelled to make it clear that he did not share the views of Ben-Artzi.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu was trying to negotiate a difficult balancing act.  On one hand, he could not \nafford to alienate Israel's most important and most powerful ally, the United States.  This was a particularly pressing \npriority at a time when global action was needed to deal with the nuclear ambitions of Iran, whose leadership has \nbeen vitriolic in its anti-Israeli sentiment.  But on the other hand, Prime Minister Netanyahu also had to deal with \ncoalition partners at home from  nationalist and Orthodox parties that embrace expanded settlement activity.  In an \neffort to simultaneously downplay the diplomatic imbroglio unfolding with the United States, and to shore-up the \nright-wing elements of his fragile ruling coalition, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed members of a cabinet \nmeeting as follows: \"I propose not to be carried away and to calm down.\" He continued, \"We know how to handle \nthese situations, calmly, responsibly and seriously.\"\n\nBy March 16, 2010,  the situation in Jerusalem was marked by a lack of calm  as angry Palestinians in the Arab-\ndominated eastern part of the city set fire to garbage cans and tires, and also hurled stones and rocks at Israeli riot \npolice.  In response,  Israeli riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to quell the violence.  The devolving \nsecurity scene only served to underline the complicated scene unfolding in Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, United States  envoy George Mitchell cancelled his scheduled trip to Israel as a result of the diplomatic \nimbroglio.  On the issue of that diplomatic imbroglio, Secretary of State Clinton brushed aside claims that relations \nbetween the United States and Israel were in a state of crisis. She emphasized the \"close, unshakeable bond\"  \nshared between the two countries.  But at the same time, Clinton noted that her country wanted Israel and the \nPalestinians to demonstrate their clear commitment to the peace process.  Days later, at an address before the pro-\nIsrael lobby group, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged \nIsrael to make \"difficult but necessary choices\" if it desired a peace agreement with the Palestinians, emphasizing \nthe \"unsustainable\" nature of the status quo.  She also highlighted the \"unshakable\" bond between her country and \nIsrael.\n\nIn a move intended to emphasize Israel's commitment in this regard, Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed \"trust-\nbuilding measures\" with the Palestinians, in the context of renewed peace negotiations.  Of course, the Palestinians \nnoted it would be difficult to move forward with \"proximity talks,\" given Israel's decision to expand settlement in \nRamat Shlomo, as discussed above.  An already-scheduled trip to the United States to address AIPAC, Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  offered the opportunity for face-to-face talks with United States President \nBarack Obama, with an eye on resolving the diplomatic imbroglio.  However, Netanyahu's decision not to call for a \nhalt on the settlement plan in Jerusalem did not bode well for progress. Indeed, the closed nature of the talks \nsuggested that the dissonance would not easily be ended.\n\nAt the broader level, the Middle East Quartet of peace mediators -- the United Nations, European Union, United \nStates and Russia - - issued its own condemnation of  Israel's construction plan in east Jerusalem.  The Quartet \nmade it clear that the matter would be reviewed during its forthcoming  ministerial meeting, which took place on \nMarch 19, 2010,  in Moscow.\n\nUpdate --\n\nFormer Israeli PM prime suspect in corruption scandal\n\n\n\nIn mid-April 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert  was identified as a prime suspect in a corruption \nscandal. Earlier, in August 2009, Olmert had been indicted in three corruption cases. Among the charges listed in \nthe 61-page indictment were fraud, breach of trust, registering false corporate documents and concealing fraudulent \nearnings. The allegations involved bribery claims in the period when Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem, and preceded \nhis tenure as prime minister. That particular corruption scandal, which actually  erupted more than a year earlier in \nMay 2008, involved payments by a New York businessman, Morris Talansky.  Olmert acknowledged receiving the \npayments but said that they were legal contributions to his campaign and, as such, he had done nothing wrong. \nBut  police and the justice ministry noted that the Israeli prime minister was suspected of seeking \"duplicate funding \nfor his trips abroad from public bodies.\" Another source of controversy involved suspected conflict of interest and \nsurrounded allegations that Olmert arranged investment projects for his former lawyer, Uri Messner, when he was \nserving as industry minister.  Those two cases were ultimately closed by Israeli authorities. Now  in 2010, the \nclimate of scandal was again gaining steam as Olmert's successor as mayor,  Uri Lupolianski, the aforementioned \nMesser, as well as five other people, were arrested  on suspicions ranging from bribery to money laundering, fraud, \nbreach of trust, tax avoidance and conspiracy, in connection with a notorious property development project known \nas \"Holyland.\"  Olmert returned to Israel from vacation in Europe after Israeli authorities said he was needed for \nquestioning in the Holyland case. Israeli media has reported that one key figure in the scandal, identified only by \ninitials, was alleged to have received, through intermediaries,  bribes intended to facilitate the approval of the \nproperty development scheme.  Israeli media has intimated that the anonymous high ranking official was Olmert.  \nFor his part, Olmert has denied involvement in any such scandals.\n\nPro-Palestinian activists challenge Gaza blockade yielding deadly consequences --\n\nOn May 31, 2010, a flotilla of six ships carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid supplies sailed from \nCyprus to the Gaza Strip, in a bid to challenge Israel's blockade on the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.  \nClashes between the two sides ultimately led to the deaths of 10 people, and injuries to scores more, including \nseveral Israeli soldiers. The activists travelling on the flotilla were then detained and taken into Israeli custody.  It \nshould be noted that while no violence ensued on several vessels of the flotilla, the issue at hand  involved a \nTurkish ship, called the Marmara.  It was aboard that particular vessel that clashes between weapons-brandishing \npro-Palestinian activists and Israeli commandos unfolded.\n\nAccording to Israeli accounts, the activists on the flotilla attacked Israeli soldiers using knives and other weapons.  \nUpon gaining permission to take retaliatory action, Israeli commandos then led a raid on the flotilla, and opened fire \nwhen confronted by angry, weapons-wielding activists on the vessel called the Marmara.  The confrontation \nultimately led to the deaths of 10 people and the detainment of several others.  Israel released videotaped footage \nof the incident showing its soldiers being attacked, presumably as evidence to shore up its version of the events \nthat transpired. Israel also expressed its regret over the loss of life.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the \"Free Gaza Movement,\" which organized the flotilla, disputed Israel's version \nof events that Israeli forces opened fire in self-defense.  Activists aboard the flotilla argued that no weapons were \nused to provoke Israel, as alleged by Israeli soldiers.  The pro-Palestinian activists also insisted that their ships \nhad a peaceful purpose and that they had been attacked in international waters.\n\nThis latter issue could well be a defining element of the crisis since the United Nations Charter on the Law of the \nSea proscribes the boarding of a vessel in international waters, unless that ship is suspected on transporting \nweaponry.  Without such conditions at play, then permission must be sought by the country identified by the ship's \nflag.\n\nThat being said, the United Nations Charter on the Law of the Sea contains provisions for naval blockades of the \ntype Israel has had against Gaza, so long as the effect of the blockade on civilians is deemed proportionate to the \neffect on the military blockade.  Stated in different terms, a vessel trying to breach a blockade --such as the ones in \n\n\n\nthe flotilla at stake -- can be legally subject to boarding and military force within \"necessary and proportionate\" \nparameters.\n\nThe scenario has provoked international outrage and resulted in a call by the United Nations for an inquiry into the \nmatter. Indeed,  United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appeared to place preliminary blame on Israel for \nthe ten deaths.  In an interview with Agence France Press, he said, \"Had Israelis heeded to my call and to the call \nof the international community by lifting the blockade of Gaza, this tragic incident would not have happened.\" \n\nMeanwhile, NATO  Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Israel should  release both the people \nand shipping vessels that had been detained.\n\nThe Obama administration in the United States struck a cautionary tone by expressing sadness over the deaths of \nthe ten people and urging the full disclosure of the facts related to the incidence.  The Sarkozy government in \nFrance, however, made an emphatic declaration of condemnation of Israel for the tragedy, while the newly-elected \nCameron-Clegg government in the United Kingdom demanded an end to the \"unacceptable\" blockade of Gaza.\n\nTurkey, an unofficial backer of the flotilla, characterized the Israeli raid as a \"bloody massacre\" and recalled its \nambassador from Israel.  While the activists who died or were injured in the tragedy held passports from various \ncountries, a significant number of them appeared to be Turkish citizens. Turkey also cancelled plans to participate \nin joint land and marine exercises with Israel.\n\nTurkey additionally demanded that the United States -- a fellow NATO member state -- strongly condemn the raid \nby the Israeli military. This development was expected to have long-ranging repercussions for geopolitics in the \nregion since Turkey has been one of Israel's most important allies with a predominantly Muslim population. Of \nsignificance was the fact that Turkey was one of the first countries with a predominantly Muslim population to \nrecognize the Jewish State of Israel in 1949.  As well, in recent times, the two countries have signed a free trade \nagreement, and enjoyed strong ties.  Indeed, Turkey signed a 20-year agreement  to supply Israel with water, while \nIsrael supplies military weapons to Turkey and trains its armed forces.\n\nAt first, it was believed that the damage to Israeli-Turkish relations would not be ceaseless.  The defense ministries \nof both countries apparently held talks and confirmed that the delivery of $183 million in Israeli drones to Turkey \nwould proceed, as scheduled, essentially indicating that military ties would endure.  But the bilateral landscape \nchanged several days later as Turkey suggested that it might actually reduce both economic and defense ties with \nIsrael as a result of the deadly altercation between Israeli forces and pro-Palestinian activists on the Marmara. To \nthat end, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc warned that Israel would face long-term consequences, \nsaying in an interview on NTV, \"We are serious about this subject.\"  He said that deals with Israel were being \nassessed and explained, \"We may plan to reduce our relations with Israel to a minimum, but to assume everything \ninvolving another country is stopped in an instant, to say we have crossed you out of our address book, is not the \ncustom of our state.\"\n\nThe chasm expanded between Israel and Turkey when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed \nthe view that Hamas -- the radical and militant Islamic group controlling Gaza -- was not a terrorist organization.  \nInstead, in a speech broadcast to the media, the Turkish head of government said that Hamas was composed of \n\"resistance fighters who are struggling to defend their land.\"  Clearly, such a perspective was not likely to gain \nconcurrence from Israel, the United States, and the countries of the European Union, which have all expressly cast \nHamas as a terrorist organization responsible for violent acts against innocent civilians, and as a grave existential \nthreat to Israel.\n\nAt home in Israel, several questions emerged about the wisdom of the raid.  Israeli headlines, such as \"Botched \nraid on Free Gaza Flotilla\" and \"Flotilla Fiasco\" indicated a dawning awareness about the deleterious \nconsequences of the raid on Israel's standing in the global community.  Perhaps with these anxieties in mind, there \n\n\n\nwas a chorus of calls from within Israel for an impartial and transparent inquiry into the tragedy that transpired. As \nwell, military analysts in Israel criticized the decision to board the Marmara, saying that other tactics, such as \nsabotage to the vessel's engine, or, the use of tear gas, could have stopped the progress of the flotilla without \ndeadly consequences.\n\nThat being said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has staunchly defended the blockade, arguing that it is \nneeded to protect key cities, such as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, from missile attacks.\n\nAs well, Nentanyahu's government accused the pro-Palestinian activists aboard the flotilla  of having links to \nIslamist militant groups.\n\nThis stance (re: links to militant groups) could well be the foundation of Israel's argument that it had the right to raid \nthe ships, if they were determined conclusively to have been in international waters.  It should be noted that Israel \nmaintains its right to a blockade against the Gaza Strip, which has been controlled for several years by the militant \nIslamist entity, Hamas.  Backed by Iran, and deemed a terrorist enclave by several countries around the world, \nHamas refuses to acknowledge the state of Israel and has been responsible for relentless rocket attacks on the \nJewish state. From Israel's point of view, it holds the right to protect itself from the existential threat posed by \nHamas.  Of course, many countries of the international community have argued that such a right should not \npreclude prudent action and the avoidance of unnecessary bloodshed.  Still others have argued that the blockage \nagainst Gaza has failed to squash Hamas, while exacerbating the dire conditions of Palestinians in that territory, \nwho  require relief from external sources.\n\nIn terms of the transportation of humanitarian and aid supplies, Egypt announced it would temporarily open a \ncrossing at Rafa in to the Palestinian territory.  As well, Israel has indicated that it would explore ways to ease the \nblockade in Gaza, to accommodate assistance for the poverty-stricken people who live in the Hamas-controlled \nterritory.  Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev suggested that efforts were in the works to accomplish this \nend.  However, he warned that even if more supplies could be transported into Gaza, the blockade would continue \nin order to prevent the transshipment of rockets and other weapons to Hamas.  Regev said unequivocally: \"We \ncannot have unfettered naval cargo going into the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nA day after the deadly clashes, pro-Palestinian activists indicated that other vessels were headed for the Gaza \nStrip.  Leaders of the \"Free Gaza Movement,\" which organized the flotilla, indicated that despite the deaths of ten \npeople, they  would not be deterred from their cause.  Indeed, they confirmed that another cargo vessel was en \nroute to Gaza, with yet another ship carrying activists following close behind.  Israel refused to expressly state how \nit would respond to the two vessels headed for Gaza, however, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor \nsaid, \"We have no intention to use violence and there is no need for this to end violently.\"  He urged the activists to \nuse authorized means to transport aid and supplies saying, \"If they want the aid to get to Gaza, they can send \nthrough the regular peaceful channels. I think they understand that seeking confrontation will not do them any \ngood.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu argued that the activists aboard the flotilla were primarily interested in \nchallenging the blockade.  This view was indirectly supported by a member of the \"Free Gaza Movement\" itself \nwho, in an interview with MSNBC News in the United States, said that her group believed that if it publicized its \nhumanitarian intent in advance, it would be able to successfully circumvent the blockade and have its supplies \nreach Gaza. For its part, the Israeli government declined to prosecute the detained activists from the \"Free Gaza \nMovement\" who were in Israeli custody; they were deported on June 2, 2010.\n\nBy June 4, 2010, another ship, the Rachel Corrie, was en route to the Gaza Strip, with the apparent objective of \nbreaking Israel's blockade on Gaza.  Pro-Palestinian activists aboard the vessel said they expected to arrive \noutside Israel's 20-mile exclusion zone off Gaza by the early hours of June 5, 2010.\n\n\n\nThose aboard the ship confirmed that although the cargo included humanitarian aid, it also carried cement and \nconstruction materials to rebuild homes.  Such items have been banned by Israel since they can be used in terror \nattacks.\n\nIsrael has said that due to its desire to prevent cargo that might contain weapons from reaching Hamas, it intended \nto maintain its blockade of Gaza, and would not allow ships to dock at Gaza.  Instead, Israel has said that \nhumanitarian aid can be processed through procedures that adhere to  established regulations.\n\nWith an eye on finding a workable solution that would satisfy both sides, the Israeli government said that once the \nshipment of cargo was inspected to ensure nothing in the cargo could be used for attacks, it could be transported \nby land to Gaza.  Explaining Israel's intent, Israel's Foreign Ministry Director-General Yossi Gal said, \"We have no \ndesire for a confrontation. We have no desire to board the ship.\"  He continued. \"If the ship decides to sail to the \n[Israeli] port of Ashdod, then we will ensure its safe arrival and will not board it.\"\n\nAnother maritime showdown between Israel and pro-Palestinian activists was, nonetheless, being anticipated since \nthose aboard the Rachel Corrie indicated that they would not be complying with Israel's guidelines.  Instead, Irish \npeace activist, Mairead Corrigan Maguire, who was aboard the incoming vessel said that the intent was to sail \nthrough to Gaza.  She said that if Israeli forces stopped the ship and/or boarded the ship, she and fellow pro-\nPalestinian activists would show use no violence.  Indeed, the pro-Palestinian activists were renewing their effort to \nbreak the blockade and test Israel's resolve on the matter.\n\nBut Israel was making it vividly clear that despite the international community's condemnation of the deadly raid \ndays earlier, it was holding steady and would resolutely maintain its blockade of Gaza.  Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu warned  that the Rachel Corrie --  en route to Gaza -- would not be allowed to dock at the \nPalestinian territory, and that there was no change in Israel's policy.  Israel's Foreign Ministry echoed the stance \nwith director, Yossi Gos, emphatically stating: \"There is a maritime blockade on Gaza.\"\n\nThe arrival of the Rachel Corrie, however, ensued without incident on June 5, 2010. Israel took control of the ship \nupon arrival, detained the pro-Palestinians aboard, and then deported them 24 hours later on  June 6, 2010.\n\nThe contested narratives -- Israeli versus pro-Palestinian -- continued almost a week after the deadly altercation on \nthe Marmara. The Israeli military released some photographs of knives, metal rods, and other weapons, which it \nsaid had been taken from pro-Palestinian activists on the Marmara.  However, the head of the group that organized \nthe flotilla [\"Free Gaza Movement\"], Huwaida Arraf, dismissed the evidence saying that all passengers had been \nscreened for weapons. That being said, subsequent photographs published in the Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, \ndepicted wounded Israel commandos.  Israeli authorities said these newly-released pictures corroborated Israel's \nversion of the events that transpired.\n\nAmid these developments, Israel rejected a call by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for an \ninternational commission to investigate the raid.  A meeting was scheduled to take place on June 7, 2010,  among \nthe members of the Middle East peace Quartet \u2014- composed of representatives from the United States, Russia, \nthe European Union and the United Nations \u2014  to discuss possible paths ahead.  Following that meeting,  United \nNations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was renewing his call for an investigation into Israel's raid of Marmara, \ninsisting that such an inquiry be carried out by the international community. A spokesperson from his office at the \nUnited Nations said that Ban wanted \"credible international involvement\" at the helm of an impartial and transparent \nprocess.\n\nIsrael has steadfastly maintained that it will carry out an internal investigation itself, noting that it would concentrate \non the legality of Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and the raid on the aid flotilla.  On June 6, 2010 on Fox News, \nMichael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States, insisted that his country had both the right and the ability \nto investigate its own military. On June 13, 2010, Israel announced plans for an internal \"independent public \ncommission.\"  While Israel rejected the United Nations' call for an international inquiry, it agreed to the inclusion of \ntwo foreign observers in the investigative process.  Then, by mid-June 2010, Israel was indicating some movement \non the matter of the Gaza blockade, saying that it would ease restrictions in order to allow more civilian products \n\n\n\ninto the Palestinian Gaza Strip via border crossing points. Israel was, however, making clear that the naval \nblockade of Gaza would remain in place.\n\nIsrael-Lebanon border clash --\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2010, Lebanese and Israeli soldiers  exchanged fire along their shared border. There were competing \nclaims as to what spurred the incident. Lebanese officials claimed that it started firing only after warning Israeli \nsoldiers not to uproot a tree impeding their view on the Lebanese side of the border; they said that Israeli troops \nresponded with artillery fire. Lebanese authorities also accused Israeli troops of crossing the border into Lebanon \nand said that three of their soldiers and a journalist had been killed in the fracas. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad \nHariri criticized Israel for its \"aggression.\" For its part, Israel said that it also had casualties with two of its soldiers \nbeing shot in the border zone; Israel also denied ever encroaching on Lebanese territory. Indeed, Israel said that \nits armed forces were on the Israeli side of the internationally-sanctioned \"blue line\" separating the two countries, \ncarrying out routine operations, when they were warned to withdraw from the area. The Israeli Defense Forces said \nthat individuals in Lebanese army uniforms then opened fire on them.\n\nIt was the most serious diplomatic imbroglio between Israel and Lebanon since the 2006 conflict between Israel \nand the Lebanon-based militant extremist organization, Hezbollah. Perhaps not surprisingly, United Nations \npeacekeeping forces stationed in southern Lebanon called on both sides to exercise \"maximum restraint\" at a time \nof heightened tensions.\n\nIn Focus\n\nIsrael considers its options in response to Iran's nuclear program\n\nSummary --\n\nWith Iran's military and nuclear moves dominating the geopolitical landscape in 2010, there has been increasing \nanalysis about Israel's possible responses. Indeed, the one country in the Middle East most likely to feel threatened \nby a nuclearized Iran is Israel, given the clear antipathy expressed by the Iranian regime against the Jewish state of \nIsrael. Speculation has abounded regarding the likelihood of Israel carrying out military strikes against Iranian \nnuclear facilities, not unlike the 1981 air strike Israel reportedly carried out against Saddam Hussein's nuclear \nreactor in Osiraq. That scenario has frequently been touted as a model of preventative military strikes to be used \nagainst looming nuclear threats. See below for the latest developments regarding Iran's provocative moves and \nanalysis about Israel's options.\n\nIran's provocative moves --\n\nOn Aug. 22, 2010, Iran unveiled its newest addition to its military -- an unmanned bomber jet. While the Karrar \ndrone was not expected to have a significant impact on the strategic balance of the Middle East, Iran's decision to \nprocure the craft appeared to signify that country's desire to expand its conventional weapons capabilities. Not one \nto miss an opportunity to threaten geopolitical antagonists, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was \naddressing the country's annual Defense Industry Day ceremonies, described the Karrar drone as a \"messenger of \ndeath for the enemies of humanity.\"\n\nOnly days later, Iran remained in the international spotlight when it announced that it had successfully test-fired an \nupgraded version of a short-range surface-to-surface missile. The new version of the Fateh-110 missile, which \ntranslates into \"conqueror\" in Farsi, has been equipped with a guidance control system known for its accuracy. As \nwell, its range has been increased as compared with earlier versions. According to Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad \nVahidi, the solid-fuel Fateh-110 missile was developed domestically by Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization \nand held the potential of striking targets up to 120 miles away. On Iranian state television, Vahidi said, \"Employing a \n\n\n\nhighly accurate guidance and control system has enabled the missile to hit its targets with great precision.\" The \nupgraded missile was to be transferred to the possession of the Iranian military by September 2010.\n\nWhile a short-range surface-to-surface missile is not evidence of a nuclear threat, it nonetheless recalls a report \nissued a year earlier by experts at the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA), which indicated their belief that Iran could have the ability to manufacture a nuclear bomb. In that \nreport titled, \"Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program,\" experts intimated that Iran could well be trying \nto develop a missile system capable of carrying an atomic warhead. The document was based on intelligence \nprovided by internal IAEA investigations, external nuclear arms experts, as well as IAEA member states. Of \nparticular concern in that document were the following three findings by the IAEA:\n\n- Iran worked on the development of an internal chamber of a ballistic missile, which would have the capacity to \nhouse a warhead payload described as \"quite likely to be nuclear\"\n\n- Iran may have engaged in \"probable testing\" of explosives used to detonate a nuclear warhead; this method is \nreferred to as \"full-scale hemispherical explosively driven shock system\"\n\n- Iran may have enough technical knowledge to enable the design and production of animplosion nuclear device \n(i.e. an atomic bomb) \"using highly enriched uranium as the fission fuel\"\n\nMoreover, the document concluded that while Iran was not yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its \nShahab-3 medium-range missile, further research and development could lead to the production of a prototype \nsystem. To that end, the Shahab-3 missile -- with a range of up to 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) -- would place \nIsrael within striking distance. Clearly, the upgraded Fateh-110 would not have comparable range; however, it was \nclear that Iran was intent on publicizing its growing military weapons capacity to the outside world. This was the \ncase in September 2009 when Iran test-fired two short-range missiles -- the Tondar-69 and the earlier incarnation of \nthe Fateh-110 -- followed by the long-range Shahab-3 ballistic missile and the surface-to-surface Sajjil. As was the \ncase a year prior, these unambiguous acts of defiance by Iran in 2010 were sure to raise the ire of the West.\n\nMeanwhile, around the same period (August 2010), Iran announced it would commence building a new uranium \nenrichment plant in early 2011. The new facility would be only one of 10 new uranium enrichment facilities planned \nfor construction in Iran. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said in an interview with Iranian state \ntelevision that \"studies on finding locations for the construction of 10 new sites are going through their final stages.\" \nHe also confirmed that construction would commence on one of these sites \"by the end of the current Iranian year \n(in March 2011), or shortly afterwards.\"\n\nThese moves have been part of Iran's insistence on pursuing a nuclear program in defiance of Western powers, \nwho have accused Iran of having a nuclear weapons proliferation agenda. While Iran has denied these ambitions \nand insisted on a program for peaceful purposes, it has nonetheless violated international regulations by \nconstructing a clandestine enrichment plant at Qom. The construction of the secret enrichment plan in Qom -- \nrevealed in 2009 -- was in violation of the safeguard provisions set forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT), and effectively fueled global anxieties about Iran's true intent. In response, the United \nNations, as well as the United States and European Union, have imposed sanctions against Iran in an effort to \nsuppress that country's nuclear ambitions.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2010, Iran launched its first nuclear reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power station in the southern part of \nthe country. The plant, which took 35 years to construct due to a series of delays, was to be operated by Russia. \nIndeed, Russia was to be responsible for supplying nuclear fuel and removing the nuclear waste. Due to Russian \ninvolvement in the project, the opening ceremony of the Bushehr nuclear power station was witnessed by Iranian \nand Russian officials.\n\nThe Iranian government hailed the development as a victory over its enemies. However, because the power plan \nhas taken more than three decades to construct, it was an older model with limited contribution to the national grid. \nAs a result, despite the celebration surrounding the opening of the plant, which would begin producing electricity in \nfour weeks from the launch date, the significance of the Bushehr power station was regarded as more symbolic \n\n\n\nthan substantive. Moreover, the real issue within the international community has not been a matter of nuclear \nenergy production, but fears that Iran seeks to build a nuclear weapon. Accordingly, Iran has been the target of four \nrounds of United Nations sanctions due to its uranium enrichment program, which was quite separate from this \nnuclear reactor project. That is to say, whereas the Bushehr nuclear power plant used uranium enriched by 3.5 \npercent, weapons-grade uranium must be enriched by more than 90 percent. Throughout, it has been Iran's \nuranium enrichment activities at levels higher than three percent that have sparked alarm bells across the West.\n\nNevertheless, as before, Iran appeared intent on defying the international community with the head of Iran's Atomic \nEnergy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, saying that his country would continue uranium enrichment. To that end, a \nserious concern for the international community has been a pilot program to enrich uranium to 20 percent, which \nIran contends is necessary for a medical research reactor. Clearly, this higher level of uranium enrichment has \nbeen a concern for Western powers more than Bushehr nuclear power station, sparking fears in Israel, which has a \nparticularly hostile relationship with Iran and has suggested the notion of targeted military strikes against Iranian \nnuclear facilities.\n\nIsrael's options in dealing with Iran's nuclear program --\n\nWith Iran's nuclear moves dominating the geopolitical landscape in 2010, there was increasing speculation about \nIsrael's own alternative options. Indeed, the one country in the Middle East most likely to feel threatened by a \nnuclearized Iran was Israel, given the clear antipathy expressed by the Iranian regime against the Jewish state of \nIsrael. Speculation has abounded that Israel has been considering military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, \nnot unlike the 1981 air strike Israel reportedly carried out against Saddam Hussein's nuclear reactor in Osiraq. That \nscenario has frequently been touted as a model of preventative military strikes to be used against looming nuclear \nthreats.\n\nBut the landscape in 2010 was quite different from the situation almost three decades ago. Notably, in 1981, even \nthough Iraq and Iran were embroiled in a war, Israeli F-16 jet fighters encountered little resistance as they carried \nout their mission. While there was limited anti-aircraft fire, there were no air patrols of surface-to-air missiles to \ncontend with. Clearly, three decades later, Israel was not likely to have such an easy field of action in Iran.\n\nThen there has been the matter of whether Israel can achieve the same objective in 2010 as it did in 1981. Almost \nthree decades ago, Israel was able to land such a blow on Iraq's nuclear facility that Saddam Hussein's regime was \nnever able to build nuclear weapons. As of 2010, there was no such confidence that Iran's nuclear breakout \ncapabilities would be curtailed in similar strikes. Of significant consideration has been the fact that Iran's multiple \nnuclear sites are dispersed with some in remote areas and others underground. The revelation about the \nclandestine Qom facility only bolsters the belief that there may be other such nuclear facilities across Iran. Indeed, \nIsraeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak acknowledged during a parliamentary meeting that facilities such as the Qom \nsite \"cannot be destroyed through a conventional attack.\" Accordingly, there is no guarantee that air strikes could \ndo more than setback Iran's nuclear ambitions a year or two.\n\nNevertheless, there were clear signs that the military option remained on the table, given the Netanyahu \ngovernment's decisions to increase the defense budget, distribute gas masks to all citizens, and simulate a \nbiological attack. But there were also signals of Israel's awareness that the military options may not yield optimal \nresults. Accordingly, Israel has shown support for the notion of sanctions against Iran, although its call for crippling \nsanctions may not coincide with the new impetus by the international community for targeting the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps in its sanctions. The international community, including the Obama administration in the \nUnited States, has not been keen to punish the Iranian people for the regime's ills, and has had to balance reticent \npowers, such as Russia and China, to even entertain the notion of sanctions. Thusly, targeted sanctions against the \nRevolutionary Guard and clerical elite have gained support. But Israel believes that only crippling, broad-based \nsanctions will have a sufficiently strong effect to stoke internal fissures, and possibly spur the collapse of the clerical \nregime.\n\nBy August 2010, around the same period that Iran launched a nuclear reactor at Bushehr and announced its plans \nto start building new uranium enrichment plant in 2011, the government of the United States reportedly tried to \n\n\n\nassuage Israel on the nuclear threat posed by Iran. According to a report by the New York Times, the Obama \nadministration conveyed evidence to Israeli counterparts showing that problems within Iran's nuclear program \nmeant that it would take at least a year for that country to actually build a nuclear weapon. That timeline, it was \nbelieved, would decrease the possibility that Israel would soon carry out a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear \nfacilities.\n\n\"Soon,\" though, has been a relative consideration. According to Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic Monthly, Israel was \nbiding its time to see if the non-military options could yield positive results; however, it was nevertheless prepared to \ncarry out unilateral strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. To that end, Goldberg contended that, at this time, it was \nIsrael's belief that strikes against Iran's nuclear sites could halt progress on that country's nuclear development \nprogram for several years. That is to say, Israel now held the view that it could strike a blow at the nuclear breakout \ncapability of Iran.\n\nIt should be noted that several strikes -- in the plural --would be needed to achieve such an end; among the likely \ntargets would be the uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, the formerly clandestine enrichment site at Qom, the \nnuclear-research center at Esfahan, and the Bushehr reactor.  Undoubtedly, flying multiple jet fighters through \nforeign air space would present Israel with a constituently complicated proposition.\n\nThe logistics of such a military operation by Israel notwithstanding, the cost of such an offensive endeavor might be \ndetermined to be too high. Certainly, the likely effects were forecast to be manifold ranging as they do from \ngeopolitical chaos to economic turbulence due to a potentially drastic spike in the price of oil.  Iran and its allies \ncould well retaliate by firing rockets at Israeli cities, which could effectively ignite a regional war.  As well, extremist \nterrorist enclaves in the region, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, would have an accentuated rallying cry. The result \nmight be an even more imperiled Israel.\n\nYet the question of peril has been at the top of Israel's agenda, given the belief that Iran may gain the technological \nknowledge to construct nuclear bombs within a relatively short period of time. It may be Israel's calculation that \npotentially deleterious consequences are worth the effort, given the existential stakes for the Jewish nation state.  \nThose existential stakes were brought into high relief as a result of the vituperative threats uttered by Iran's leaders \nthat Israel should be \"wiped off the map.\"\n\nWorth noting is the fact that a nuclearized Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but to other countries in the Middle \nEast. Indeed, a nuclear-armed Iran would, itself, have a destabilizing effect across the Middle East, most obviously \nby potentially triggering a nuclear arms race in the region among other countries not willing to cede power to \nnuclearized Iran. But quite in contrast to the arms race of the Cold War, which actually functioned as a deterrent \nand managed to stabilize the international scene in some \"realpolitik\" sense, a modern arms race in a region known \nfor suicide bombings could trigger catastrophic results.\n\nFor this reason, Israel may find some unlikely allies in its neighborhood in the form of certain powerful Arab \ncountries, such as Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, which is not keen on the notion of a nuclearized Shi'a-dominated \nIran in their backyard. Israel may also find there is a geopolitical benefit to resolving the Palestinian issue, thereby \nminimizing its field of enemies.  But the very complexity of the Arab backyard may present yet another reason why \nIsrael may decide that targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities -- regardless of the risk -- are worth the effort. \nThe smaller Arab states may be compelled to move from moderation and tacit pro-Western inclinations toward \nmore hardline and pro-Iranian stances by virtue of the influence of a nuclearized Iran. That is to say, small Arab \nstates may believe they have no choice but to throw their lot in with a nuclear Iran despite their past cooperation \nwith the West. It was implausible that Israel -- and, indeed, the West -- would look positively on the prospect of a \npolitically-strengthened and nuclearized Iran standing strong in the heart of the Middle East.\n\nUpdate --\n\nWith the prospect of strikes by Israel against Iran's nuclear facilities looming, on September 5, 2010, Iranian \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that any attack against his country would mean the end of the Jewish \n\n\n\nState of Israel. During  a visit to Qatar, Ahmadinejad said, \"Any offensive against Iran means the annihilation of the \nZionist entity.\"  Expressing his antipathy for Israel, he continued, \"Iran does not care much about this entity \nbecause it is on its way to decay.\" Ahmadinejad also appeared to dismiss the notion of an attack by either Israel or \nthe United States on Iranian nuclear facilities in the first place, saying that those two countries, \"know that Iran is \nready and has the potential for a decisive and wide-scale response.\"  But with an eye on shoring up support from \nsmaller Arab countries that house United States military bases, Ahmadinejad said called for more cooperation \nbetween Muslim countries of the Middle East despite the sectarian schism between Shi'ites and Sunnis.\n\nOn Jan. 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Iran's weapons development capacity may have been \ncurtailed by the more stringent sanctions regime championed by the West and imposed by the United Nations \nSecurity Council.  According to Israel's outgoing intelligence head, Meir Dagan,  Iran was unlikely to be able to \nbuild a nuclear weapon until 2015.  Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon was making a similar claim on \nIsraeli Army Radio also that Iran was three years away from developing a nuclear warhead.\n\nThis stance was quite a departure from an earlier timeline by Israel that suggested Iran was close to being able to \nbuild a bomb, thus raising speculation about a potential strike by Israel on nuclear targets in Iran. Now, Israel's \nposition  appeared to be in line with the United States' claim that international sanctions have limited Iran from \nprocuring materials needed for the building of a nuclear bomb.  Of course, the outgoing Dagan also pointed to \n\"covert activities\" as being an additional reason for the revised timeline.  In fact, officials across the world have \nnoted that Iran's ability to deploy advanced centrifuge machines, which would be needed for the production of \nhighly enriched uranium, has been stymied to some degree. That is not to say that concerns about Iran's nuclear \nambitions have abated in any way.  Both Israel and the United States have maintained the view that Iran actively \nseeks to produce nuclear weapons and that it has sufficient stockpiled low enriched uranium to build up to four \nnuclear bombs, assuming that further processing was possible.  That being said, the revised timeline would suggest \nthat Israel was unlikely to carry out targeted strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran in the near future.  As well, the \nUnited States was highly likely to champion the idea of continuing, and even intensifying, the harsh sanctions* \nimposed on Iran.\n\n*Note that the punitive  sanctions imposed in June 2010 were regarded as the harshest set of measures to date. \nThe main provisions included an arms embargo, which would prohibit Iran from purchasing heavy weapons, such \nas attack helicopters and missiles;  stringent rules regarding financial transactions with Iranian banks;  and a wider \nswath of Iranian individuals and companies to be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. In addition, a new \nsystem of cargo inspections would be established to detect and stop Iran from acquiring banned materials.  This \nround of sanctions was intended to bypass affecting the lives of average Iranians while concentrating on the \npowerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which has emerged as a power center within that country, and which was \nbelieved to be the leading entity behind Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nRestarting the Peace Process --\n\nIn the third week of August 2010, Israeli and Palestinian officials were set to resume direct negotiations for the first \ntime in 20 months and a decade after the last serious final status talks. United States Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \nhad been invited to Washington on Sept. 2, 2010, for the commencement of the talks.  Both parties agreed to a \none-year timeline on the direct negotiations. Speaking from the State Department, Secretary of State Clinton said \nthat the two leaders had been invited by President Barack Obama to come to the United States to \"re-launch direct \nnegotiations to resolve all final status issues, which we believe can be completed within one year.\"\n\nCertain core issues -- known as \"final status issues -- have continuously caused consternation by both sides, but \nwould be taken up during the forthcoming meetings. These core issues included the status of Jerusalem, the \nconstruction of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories, the borders of a future Palestinian state, as well as the \n\n\n\nright of return. Analysts have warned that the prospects of an actual deal arising from the talks were unlikely, given \nthe intensity of these contentious differences. Nonetheless, the movement back to the negotiating table was being \nviewed as productive.\n\nWith an eye on keeping the process moving in a productive direction, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"It is \nimportant that actions by all sides help to advance our effort, not hinder it.\" She continued, \"There have been \ndifficulties in the past, there will be difficulties ahead. Without a doubt, we will hit more obstacles. But I ask the \nparties to persevere, to keep moving forward even through difficult times and to continue working to achieve a just \nand lasting peace in the region.\"\n\nAlso invited to join the talks were the leaders Egypt and Jordan --  two Arab countries with relatively positive ties to \nIsrael. To this end, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"President Obama has invited President Mubarak of Egypt and \nKing Abdullah of Jordan to attend, in view of their critical role in this effort. Their continued leadership and \ncommitment to peace will be essential to our success.\" Also invited to join the meetings was former British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair, the special representative of the Middle East Peace Quartet, composed of the United States, \nthe European Union, Russia and the United Nations.\" Excluded from the talks was the Islamic extremist group, \nHamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, noted that if the two sides were unable to \nmake progress, then the United States would be prepared to submit bridging proposals. Before such an end could \ntranspire, there was a sense of cautious hope tinged with reality. Indeed, Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged, \n\"reaching an agreement is a difficult challenge but is possible.\" Netanyahu's office issued a statement that read: \n\"We are coming to the talks with a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement between the two peoples that will \nprotect Israel's national security interests.\" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said in an interview with the \nBBC: \"I hope that Mr. Netanyahu will be our partner in peace... and we can do it.\"\n\nHamas attempts to derail the peace process --\n\nJust ahead of the much anticipated peace talks, four Israelis were shot to death in the West Bank.  Two Israeli men \nand two Israeli women died when their car came under gunfire as it traversed a road between the Palestinian \nsettlement of Bani Naim and the Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba, located near to the city of Hebron. The militant \nextremist  Palestinian organization, Hamas, which has not been a player in peace negotiations, claimed \nresponsibility for that attack. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak characterized the killings as an act of sabotage, \naimed at derailing the peace process, and warned of retribution for those responsible. Then, just as the peace talks \nwere due to begin,  another act of violence ensued when two Israelis were shot and wounded at the Rimonim \nJunction in the West Bank, close to the Jewish settlement of Kochav Hashahar.  Again, Hamas claimed \nresponsibility for this attack.\n\nNevertheless, even in the face of this tragic violence in the West Bank, peace talks commenced in the United \nStates amongst the stakeholders.  United States President Barack Obama, the host and main peace broker,  \nencouraged the Israeli and Palestinians leaders to remain on the course of engagement and not allow the \nopportunity to build a lasting peace \"slip away.\"  Promising that the United States would not waver in its \ncommitment to broker peace, President Obama said, \"This moment of opportunity may not soon come again.\"  The \nUnited States leader also condemned the aforementioned bloodshed in the west Bank at the hands of Hamas.\n\nCommencement of Peace Negotiations --\n\nOn September 1, 2010  -- ahead of the commencement of actual talks -- President Obama convened a meeting \nbetween Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of \nJordan, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  As noted above, that meeting was also included former British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair, the special representative of the Middle East Peace Quartet.\n\nPresident Obama said that the impending negotiations were \"intended to resolve all final status issues.\"  The United \nStates president explained that the talks, which were scheduled to last for a year, were aimed at ultimately  forging  \na permanent settlement to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in the form of two democratic states  -- one \n\n\n\nIsraeli and one Palestinian -- living side by side in peace.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu struck a similar tone \nsaying, \"Our goal is to forge a secure and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\"  He continued, \"We do \nnot seek a brief interlude between two wars. We do not seek a temporary respite between outbursts of terror. We \nseek a peace that will end the conflict between us once and for all.\" For his part, Palestinian President Abbas said, \n\"We will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause.\" \nHe also condemned the attacks on Israelis and called for  an end to the bloodshed.\n\nOn September 2, 2010, the actual negotiations began between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acting as the main \narbiter.  Opening the talks, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, you have the \nopportunity to end this conflict and the decades of enmity between your peoples once and for all.\" Secretary of \nState Clinton asserted that her country had \"pledged its full support to these talks,\"  and said, \"We will be an active \nand sustained partner.\" However, she cautioned that Washington would not impose a solution on the Middle East. \nSecretary of State Clinton  issued the following warning: \"The core issues at the center  of these negotiations - \nterritory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and others - will get no easier if we wait, nor will they resolve \nthemselves.\"\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Abbas seemed to be fully cognizant of the challenge of the task at hand.  Prime Minister \nNetanyahu said, \"This will not be easy. True peace, a lasting peace, will be achieved only with mutual and painful \nconcessions from both sides.\"  President Abbas said: \"We do know how hard are the hurdles and obstacles we face \nduring these negotiations \u2013 negotiations  that within a year should result in an agreement that will bring peace.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the two leaders of Israel and the Palestinian territories appeared to have respectively enjoyed cordial \nrelations during the talks, despite Abbas' insistence that Israel cease its settlement activity in Palestinian territories.  \nAt issue has been the expiration of a partial freeze on building homes for Jewish settlers.  The matter has been the \ncause of much consternation with the Israeli saying that they might not renew the freeze, and Palestinians \nthreatening to walk away from the negotiating table if such the settlement activity resumed. But also of equal \nimportance was Israel's demands that (1) any peace deal consider the particular and special security needs of \nIsrael, and (2) that Palestinians recognize the unique identity of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nNevertheless, by the close of the first round of talks, the United States deemed the exercise to be constructive. \nUnited States envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, characterized private talks between the two leaders -- \nNetanyahu and Abbas -- as  \"cordial\" and observed that the meeting were conducted in a \"constructive and positive \nmood.\"  Moreover, Mitchell announced that both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas agreed not simply \nto continue to work toward peace in the abstract, but to meet again in just two weeks in the Middle East.  Mitchell \nsaid that the next talks would take place in mid-September 2010, with further negotiations to take place on a \nphased continuing basis every two weeks after that.  One of the immediate goals was to  arrive at a framework \nagreement on the contentious \"final status\" issues, effectively paving the way for a comprehensive peace treaty.\n\nAt that meeting in mid-September 2010 in Sharm-el-Sheik in Egypt, which was attended by Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Abbas, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and United \nStates envoy George Mitchell,  all the relevant parties said that they were committed to the negotiations. Special \nEnvoy Mitchell said that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders  held \"serious discussions on core issues.\"  He also said \nthat the objective of \"two states for two peoples\" remained at the heart of the matter, with efforts being expended to  \nachieve a framework for that goal.  Secretary of State Clinton noted this end result could not be achieved without \nongoing dialogue. \"It is a question of how can we work toward making these direct negotiations break through the \nclear and difficult obstacles that stand in the way toward achieving a comprehensive peace,\" she asserted.\n\nThe encouraging words aside, there appeared to be little resolution on the outstanding issue of Jewish settlements.  \nDespite Palestinian threats to exit the negotiations in settlement activity resumed, and in the face of Secretary of \nState Clinton's call for Israel to extend its freeze on West Bank construction, Israel was not promising to extend its \nmoratorium on settlement activity.\n\n\n\nStill, Prime Minister Netanyahu appeared to be making some concessions by suggesting that while the ban on all \nconstruction would not be renewed at the end of September 2010, the plan for the construction of thousands of \nhouses in the West Bank might not go forward.  Chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, however, appeared \nunimpressed in an interview with the Associated Press.  He said that \"half solutions\" by Israel were unacceptable.\n\nComplications--\n\nMeanwhile, on September 28, 2010, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman asserted  that the boundaries of a \nnew Palestinian state should not be drawn based on a map from 1967. Instead, Lieberman said the borders should  \ncut through predominantly Arab sections of Israel, essentially leaving the new state inhabited by Arabs, and leaving \nthe Jewish State of Israel to the Jewish Israeli population. In a bid to cast aside possible accusations of uprooting \npeople, Israel's top diplomat said, \"We are not talking about population transfer but about defining borders so as \nbest to reflect the demographic reality.\"\n\nLieberman's statements prompted a quit exit of the Palestinian delegation from the room.  Riyad Mansour, the \npermanent observer for Palestine, said of the Israeli foreign minister, \"This man is completely detached from \npolitical reality.\"\n\nLieberman's statements came at a time when the issue of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian West Bank has \nbeen an issue of contention amidst ongoing -- and tenuous -- Middle East peace negotiations.  Indeed, with a \nmoratorium on the construction of new settlements having expired on September 26, 2010 without renewal, \nPalestinian negotiators were deciding whether or not to continue with negotiations, while Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu was calling for continued talks despite the ongoing dispute.  Clearly, the matter of territory was \nalready a sore subject among the key parties, with the Israeli foreign minister re-opening unhealed wounds.\n\nMaking matters worse was the fact that Lieberman made these remarks at the United Nations.  Apart from the \nimprudent nature of his statements, blame was also cast on Prime Minister Netanyahu for allowing a hardline, ultra-\nnationalist, such as Lieberman, to speak on behalf of Israel at an international forum during a time of extreme \nsensitivity.  In fact, the situation spurred doubts about Netanyahu's sincerity in pursuing the revitalized peace \nprocess.\n\nWhile Netanyahu released a statement making clear that  Lieberman was speaking  for himself and not the \ngovernment, there was nonetheless an uproar even at home in Israel.  A spokesperson for the prime minister \nasserted that Netanyahu was in charge of peace negotiations and not Lieberman; the spokesperson also explained \nthat Lieberman had given the address at the United Nations because Netanyahu had decided to observe the \nJewish holiday of Sukkoth at home.  In response, Naham Shai of the centrist Kadima party (currently in opposition) \nsaid, \"The Prime Minister needs to decide if he is running a country or conducting a choir.\"  He continued, \"The \nforeign minister's statements are in complete opposition to the declared policies of the government.\" Netanyahu's \nresponse was also characterized as \"flaccid\" by another member of parliament.\n\nSettlement Impasse --\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Clinton suggested that the construction freeze -- a highly politicized issue in Israel \n-- could be made more palatable with assistance from the Palestinians. Moreover, she suggested that there were \nalternate ways of crossing \"the hurdle posed by the expiration of the original moratorium. \" In an interview with \nAgence France Presse, Secretary of State Clinton said: \"Remember the goal is to work toward agreement on core \nissues like borders and territory that would, if agreed upon, eliminate the debate about settlements.\" Presumably, \nthe United States' top diplomat was suggesting that rather than taking on the settlement issue outright as part of the \npeace process, the matter could be circumvented by focusing on finding agreement on long-term issues of borders \nand territory. Whether or not that proposal was feasible was yet to be determined.\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2010, in an address to other world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack \nObama urged an extension of the settlement freeze, noting that it \"improved the atmosphere for talks.\" Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu has been reluctant to consider such a move, largely due to the fact that hardline, pro-settler, \n\n\n\nnationalists within his right-wing coalition would not back an extension to the settlement moratorium. That being \nsaid, he suggested that he would be open to alternate options, such as construction limits, if not a complete freeze. \nThe spirit of compromise also echoed in the words of President Abbas who was now taking a more nuanced \nposition on the settlement issue saying, \"I cannot say I will leave the negotiations, but it's very difficult for me to \nresume talks if Prime Minister Netanyahu declares that he will continue his (settlement) activity in the West Bank \nand Jerusalem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, news of a United States-brokered compromise on the settlement emerged ahead of the construction \nmoratorium, which was set to expire Sept. 26, 2010. At issue were mediation efforts by United States envoy, \nGeorge Mitchell. The actual nature of the compromise was unknown although speculation abounded about it \ncentering on some sort of limited settlement plan, or possibly a temporary moratorium extension. Senior Palestinian \nofficials indicated that they would consider the compromise proposal and they would show \"some flexibility.\"\n\nHowever, by Sept. 26, 2010, Israel had allowed the settlement construction freeze to expire in the West Bank -- a \nmove expected to upset United States-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians. That being said, only minutes \nafter the moratorium expired, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas to continue \"expedited, honest talks\" aimed at achieving an \"historic\" peace deal within a year. In a \nstatement, the Israeli leader said, \"Israel is ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to \ncontinue peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\" Netanyahu also specifically called on Abbas \nsaying, \"I hope that President Abbas will remain in the talks and continue with me on the path to peace that we \nbegan three weeks ago.\" He continued, \"My intentions to achieve peace are serious and honest.\" Netanyahu's \nstatement also urged restraint by all affected parties. It read as follows: \"The prime minister calls on the residents in \nJudea and Samaria and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as \nthey showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze.\"\n\nAs discussed above, President Abbas already indicated that, despite his earlier protestations, he would not \nimmediately walk away from the peace negotiations in the event that the moratorium expired.\n\nBy October 7, 2010, Palestinian negotiators said that they accepted a United States-brokered proposal, aimed at \nending the dissonance surrounding the settlement controversy, and preventing the collapse of peace talks.  That \nproposal would require Israel to extend a slowdown of settlement activity in the West Bank for a two month period.  \nPalestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath, said the two month period could function as a timeframe in which negotiations \non a border between Israel and a future Palestinian state could be take place.\n\nAs already noted by Secretary Clinton, addressing the central issues in the peace process could very well function \nto circumvent the other contentious matters that have only served to prevent trust from being built between the two \nsides.\n\nYet to be determined was the matter of whether or not Israel would accept the terms of the proposal.  Indeed, to \ndate, Israel has been reticent about the notion of a construction slowdown.  Still, reports from Israel indicated that \nunder pressure from the United States, Prime Minister Netanyahu was in discussion with key cabinet ministers \nabout the construction slowdown proposal. Further reports indicated that the prime minister scheduled a vote on \ncitizenship legislation that would amend a loyalty oath for non-Jewish immigrants, in which Israel would be \ndescribed as \"Jewish and democratic.\"  There were suggestions that the legislation -- controversial in its own right -- \nwas being tabled in exchange for support from hardline, nationalist members of the ruling coalition for the \nconstruction slowdown concept.  Certainly, the need to emphasize the Jewish nature of the Israeli state has been a \nsignificant concern among many Israeli politicians, especially as peace negotiations continue.  To this end, Prime \nNetanyahu said,  \"There is a very big struggle today to abolish, to blur, the state of Israel as the national homeland \nof the Jewish people.\"  Of course, for minority Arab Israelis, the very notion of Israel as an official Jewish state has \nbeen regarded as alienating, and it would certainly mitigate the concept of the \"right of return\" for Palestinian \nrefugees.  Still, that very concept has long been regarded as a \"non-starter\" for Israeli Jews who, like Netanyahu, \nwish to ensure that Israel is a national homeland for the Jewish people.\n\n\n\nBy October 11, 2010, after  the Israeli cabinet approved legislation requiring non-Jewish immigrants to pledge \nallegiance to the \"Jewish and democratic\" state of Israel,  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his \nown conditional deal, aimed at ending the settlement impasse. In a speech before parliament, Prime Minister \nNetanyahu he said that his government would extend settlement restrictions in the West Bank, pending Palestinian \nrecognition of Israel as the Jewish national homeland.  He said, \"If the Palestinian leadership would say \nunequivocally to its people that it recognizes Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people, I will be willing \nto convene my government and ask for an additional suspension.\"\n\nNetanyahu's  proposal was quickly rejected by Palestinians with chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, \ncharacterizing the idea as \"unacceptable\" and asserting that there was connection between Jewish settlements and \nIsrael's national character. To be sure, while some Palestinians -- not including Hamas and its supporters --  accept \nthe notion of Israel's right to exist, they have stopped short of accepting Israel as a Jewish state, claiming that it \nviolates the right of Palestinian refugees. But for his part, the Israeli prime minister pointed out his proposal was not \nunreasonable since Palestinians would want an equivalent assurance.  To this end, Netanyahu said, \"As the \nPalestinian expect that we will recognize a Palestinian state as their national homeland, we are entitled to expect \nthat they will recognize Israel as our national homeland.\"\n\nDeals and decisions were also being made at the multilateral level.  In exchange for accepting the United States' \nproposal, Israel was reportedly being offered a package of incentives  that included United States military \nassistance,  diplomatic support at the United Nations, and support for certain pro-Israeli positions during the peace \ntalks.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu appeared to be giving serious consideration to the proposal by the United States, even \ncalling on the Arab league to postpone its impending vote on whether or not the Palestinians should exit the \nrenewed peace process at this early stage.  To that end, members of the Arab League said on October 8, 2010 that \nwhile they supported the decision by Palestinian negotiators to halt  direct talks with Israel pending an agreement \non the settlement construction issue in the West Bank, they also wanted to offer the United States a month to try to \nfind a way of bridging the divide between the two sides.  That is to say, the Arab League was offering a compromise \nresponse, effectively breathing some life into a process that was on the verge of collapse.\n\nBy October 17, 2010, attention was on the Palestinian side of the equation when  President Mahmoud made the \nhistoric announcement that Palestinians were ready to end long-standing claimed against Israel, pending the \nestablishment of an independent state on lands occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. At stake, therefore, was a \nPalestine encompassing the West bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.  However, Abbas stopped short of \nspecifying what actual claims would be dropped if this goal was realized.  Typically, the most contentious \"final \nstatus\" issue has been the right of Palestinian refugees to return to homes in Israeli territory.\n\nSpeaking during an  interview with Israel television, Abbas also noted that while direct negotiations with Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remain his preferred path en route to peace, he would consider alternative \noptions if talks collapsed over Israel's continued settlement expansion.  He said, \"All the options are open, but we \ndon't want to use all of them right now. We are focusing on resuming direct talks.\"  To that end, Abbas described his \ndirect meeting with Netanhayu as follows: \"I told him this is a historic opportunity for you that we sign a peace \nagreement. I am afraid if we can't do it these days, the opportunity will be lost.\"\n\nNote, however, that as of October 21, 2010, the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank had found no \nresolution.  Indeed, more than 600 homes were being built in the region since the expiration of the construction \nmoratorium a month prior.\n\nCharting the Path for Peace --\n\nThe decision by the United States to commence an intensive diplomatic push for Middle East peace may be viewed \nas ambitious -- especially given the fact that it is a conservative, hardline Israeli government negotiating with the \nleader of the Palestinian Authority, while Hamas -- which controls Gaza -- has been left out of the equation.  In fact, \nPalestinian President Abbas would be negotiating on behalf of all Palestinians despite the fact that he has held no \neffective power over Gaza for some time.  Making matters more complicated, a conflict that had once been \n\n\n\nunderstood predominantly in territorial terms has increasingly taken on a more religious orientation in the current \nglobal arena. Clearly, resolving a conflict with religious undercurrents promised to be an even more challenging \nendeavor.\n\nIndeed, even under theoretically more favorable circumstances, peace has eluded the region.  Under the \nstewardship of former United States President Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a most \npromising peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians collapsed at the hands of the Palestinian leader of the \ntime, Yasser Arafat, despite much compromise by former Prime Minister Ehud Barack in 2000.  In fact, the collapse \nof that deal ushered in a bloody period of violence known as the Intifada.\n\nNow, in 2010, President Obama was trying to revitalize the peace process and find success in an arena that has \nbedeviled American presidents for generations.  But President Obama seemed to be something of a realist amidst \nthe ideals of Middle East peace.  Along with the imposition of a  deadline on peace talks, President Obama \nemphasized that success would ultimately be determined by the decision makers of Israel and the Palestinian \nTerritories.  He noted that his country -- the United States -- could not want peace  more than Israelis and \nPalestinians.  President Obama also warned that the peace process would be subject to the negative machinations \nof \"extremists and rejectionists who, rather than seeking peace, are going to be seeking destruction.\"  Whether  the \npeace process would move in a generative -- rather than destructive -- direction was yet to be determined.\n\n2011 Update\n\nOn Jan. 17, 2011, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak announced that he was quitting the Labor Party and would \nbe establishing a  new political called Atzmaut or Independence.  Barak -- who had served as the chairman of the \nLabor Party --  would be joined by four other cabinet members in this endeavor.  In a statement, Barak said,  \"We \nare setting up a faction, a movement and later on a party, based on Zionist, centralist and democratic values and \nwill follow David Ben-Gurion's legacy.\" The move would have a two-fold effect.  First, it would bolster the \nadministration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's sometimes-fractious coalition government. Second, it could \nwell augur the demise of the Labor Party, which was now diminished on the political scene.  \n\nEarlier, at the close of 2010,  former Israeli President Moshe Katsav was found guilty of sexual offenses in a court in \nTel Aviv. Among the convictions was the rape of an employee in the 1990s,  a period when he served as tourism \nminister, and sexual misconduct in 2003 and 2005, a later period when he served as president. The judges at the \ncourt rendered a unanimous decision and said that the testimony of the rape victim had been compelling. Facing \ntime in prison of at least four years, Katsav was expected to appeal the ruling in Israel's Supreme Court. At the time \nof his indictment, Katsav blamed his \"political lynching\" on former Attorney-General Menahem Mazuz. But human \nrights groups in Israel hailed the verdict as a victory for the rights of women. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu noted that it was a \"sad day for the State of Israel and its citizens\" but pointed to the strength of the \ncountry's judicial system. He said, \"Today the court conveyed two clear-cut messages, that all are equal before the \nlaw and that every woman has exclusive rights to her body.\"\n\nOn March 22, 2011, former President Katsav  was sentenced to seven years in prison and gained the dubious \ndistinction of being the country's highest-ranking official to  be sentenced to jail. The seven year jail sentence was \nthe result of a split decision of the court with one of the three judges favoring less time in prison for Katsav.  His \nsentence was set to commence on May 8, 2011, effectively offering the former head of state a month to prepare a \nlegal defense.  For his part,  Katsav reacted furiously to the sentence in court screaming at the judges, \"You have \ncommitted an injustice! The verdict is untrue. It is a lie. The lies have won!\"  Should Katsav's attempt at overturning \nhis conviction on appeal fail, he could presumably appeal to President Shimon Peres for a pardon. Such an end \nwas unlikely since President Peres was already on the record asserting that Katsav's sentence \"illustrates that in \nthe state of Israel no one is above the law.\"  Another avenue available to Katsav might be the possibility of the \nSupreme Court moving to reduce his prison sentence due to the court's aforementioned split decision.\n\n\n\nKatsav served as president from 2000 to 2007 and resigned when these charges against him surfaced. Katsav, \nhowever, has not been the sole Israeli politician caught up in a legal scandal. Indeed, former Prime Minister Ehud \nOlmert, has faced corruption charges.\n\nIn the last week of March 2011, a bomb exploded at a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem, killing at least one person \ndead and more than 30 others injured.  According to Israeli police, the explosion was not caused by a suicide \nattack; instead, the bomb had been placed in a small suitcase and left close to the side of the road at a bus station \nin the center of the city.  While Jerusalem was struck by several bus bombings at the hands of Palestinian terrorists  \nbetween 2000 and 2004, this was the first such attack in recent times.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \nsought to strike a restrained but responsive tone saying, \"Israel will act aggressively, responsibly and wisely to \npreserve the quiet and security that prevailed here over the past two years.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu \ncharacterized the attack an attempt by extremists to undermine the  determination of the Israeli people.  Palestinian \nPrime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the bus bombing, notably characterizing it as \"a terrorist attack.\"\n\nIn the background of these developments was the fact that Israeli-Palestinians tensions were on the rise.  Prior to  \nthe bus bombing, rockets were fired by Palestinian extremist militants into southern Israel.  That action spurred air \nstrikes by Israeli warplanes into Gaza.  While no Palestinian terror enclave claimed responsibility for the bus \nbombing in Jerusalem, a leader of Islamic Jihad intimated that an attack by Palestinian extremist militants would be \na \"natural  response\" to the aforementioned air strikes in Gaza.\n\nIn mid-April 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman was informed by the office of Israeli Attorney-General \nYehuda Weinstein that he could soon be indicted on graft charges.  At issue, according to Israel's Justice Ministry, \nhave been pending charges of fraud, money laundering and witness tampering. The Justice Ministry has accused \nLieberman of utilizing shell companies and third-party accounts to obfuscate his receipt of illegal funds during his \ntenure in office, in what was characterized as an effort to \"defraud the public.\" While the police reportedly tried to \nhave bribery added to the list of charges, bribery was not included in the statement from the Justice Ministry.  \nConviction on the charge of money laundering alone could yield up to ten years in jail.\n\nFor his part, Lieberman was dismissive of the possible indictment, saying, \"I have always acted in accordance with \nthe law and I have no reason to worry. After 15 years, I will finally have the chance to prove that I always conducted \nmyself legally.\" Should the indictment indeed materialize, then Lieberman could well be forced to resign from office.  \nIt was yet to be seen how the government would be affected since Lieberman's ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu \nparty has been a senior coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Should Lieberman \nresign, followed by a withdrawal of Yisrael Beiteinu from the ruling coalition, Israel could be faced with early  \nelections.  of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu could avoid a return to the polls by courting a new coalition partner \nin the form of the centrist party, Kadima.  To date, though, Kadima has shown little interest in entering an alliance \nwith Netanyahu and Likud, which they do not view as sufficiently committed to the peace process.\n\nMay 2011 saw the emergence of a report by the United Nations watchdog nuclear agency, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), in which it was reported that Iran was continuing its efforts to build nuclear weapons, in \ndefiance of United Nations sanctions.  The IAEA asserted that Iran was stockpiling low-enriched uranium,  pointing \ntoward the fact that Iran's total output of low-enriched uranium since 2007 had reached 4.1 tons  -- an increase from \n3.6 tons earlier in the year, and indicating an amount that, if refined further, could potentially contribute to the \ndevelopment of at least two bombs. Throughout, Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian energy \ngenerating purposes, the actual evidence notwithstanding.  A second report by the IAEA claimed that a Syrian \nfacility allegedly bombed by Israel four years prior was probably a nuclear reactor that had been constructed in \ncovert fashion.  While Syria has claimed that the building had no nuclear use, it has also eschewed IAEA efforts to \ninspect the site.  Earlier inspections in 2008 indicated nuclear activities there. The two reports by the IAEA, which \nwere compiled ahead of a meeting of the IAEA board in June 2011, were expected to be delivered to the United \nNations Security Council, where that body would have to consider how to respond to the nuclear developments in \nIran and Syria respectively.\n\n\n\nIn other developments related to Israel, the two Palestinian factions -- Fatah in the West Bank and militant Hamas \nin Gaza -- reached a reconciliation in the first part of May 2011 and set the path for a government of unity.\n\nIt was hoped by Palestinians that a unified front could help their position in the fight for an independent Palestinian \nstate. That being said, divisions could still affect the new unified Palestinian front with the matter of Israel remaining \na matter of contention.  Unlike Fatah, Hamas has adamantly refused to recognize the Jewish state of Israel; \nhowever, the unity agreement did not require Hamas to change this stance, concentrating instead on Hamas ending \nattacks on Israeli interests. \n\nBy mid-month, in a show of protest against the founding of the Jewish state of Israel,  Palestinians from Syria \nentered the Golan Heights.  The move sparked violence and compelled Israeli forces to fire on the protesters, \nleaving at least a dozen people dead. The flare of violence in that strategic region came at a time when the Assad \nregime in Syria was experiencing mass anti-government protests.  There were suggestions that the scenario \nunfolding at the Golan Heights might be linked with the Assad regime's desire to deflect attention from the internal \nstrife plaguing that country.  Indeed, as noted by an Israeli official in an interview with Agence France Presse: \"Syria \nis a police state. Demonstrators do not randomly approach the border without the prior approval of the central \ngovernment.\" That being said, violence was also breaking out at crossing points in other areas -- in the West Bank \nand at the border with Lebanon, in addition to the Golan Heights. In those cases, Palestinians hurled stones at \nIsraelisecurity forces, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.  As protesters tried to cross a checkpoint at \nGaza, sparking clashes, Israeli forces opened fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the quick \nreturn of \"calm and quiet\" but warned that Israel's borders and sovereignty would be protected.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged calm and called on both sides to show \"utmost \nresponsibility.\"  He also addressed the broader matter of peace between Israelis and Palestinians saying there was \nan \"unsustainable status quo in the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is only thrown into sharper relief by the profound \npolitical changes now under way in the region.\"  The United Nations head thusly called for a reinvigorated pathway \nto peace.  That pathway was not so clear given the resignation of the United State' Middle East peace envoy, \nGeorge Mitchell.  It became even more murky after United States President Barack Obama on May 19, 2011, called \nfor a two state solution -- Israel and a Palestinian state -- living side by side, but consistent with pre-1967 borders.  \nThis call was quickly rejected by the Netanyahu administration in Israel, which rejected the notion of contracted \nIsraeli territory.  See below for details.\n\nAt the start of June 2011, Israeli soldiers opened fired on pro-Palestinian protesters in the Golan Heights, an area \nof Syria occupied by Israel.  According to Syrian media sources, up to 20 people were killed and more than 300 \nwere wounded as the pro-Palestinian protesters marked the anniversary of the 1967 war. For its part, Israel said \nthat warnings were shouted in Arabic, as well as warning shots being fired in the air, before soldiers opened fire at \nthe legs of the protesters and used tear gas to disperse the crowds. Israeli military said that there had been only 12 \ninjuries as a result of confrontation. A similar incident occurred the month prior as Palestinians from Syria entered \nthe Golan Heights, sparking violence and compelling Israeli forces to fire on the protesters, leaving at least a dozen \npeople dead at that time.  Israel said at the time that there would respond to future marches of this type, and since \nthen Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu warned that \"extremists\" would not be allowed to breach Israel's \nborders.\n\nThe flare of violence in that strategic region came at a time when the Assad regime in Syria was experiencing mass \nanti-government protests.  There have been suggestions that the scenario unfolding at the Golan Heights might be \nlinked with the Assad regime's desire to deflect attention from the internal strife plaguing that country.  Indeed, as \nnoted in May 2011 by an Israeli official in an interview with Agence France Presse: \"Syria is a police state. \nDemonstrators do not randomly approach the border without the prior approval of the central government.\" That \nbeing said, violence had already broken out at crossing points in other areas -- in the West Bank and at the border \n\n\n\nwith Lebanon, in addition to the Golan Heights. In those cases, Palestinians hurled stones atIsraeli security forces, \nwho responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.  As protesters tried to cross a checkpoint at Gaza, sparking \nclashes, Israeli forces opened fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the quick return of \"calm \nand quiet\" but warned that Israel's borders and sovereignty would be protected.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 2011, several people died as a result of a series of attacks by Palestinian extremist militants on \nsouthern Israel. The violence commenced when gunmen opened fire on an Israeli bus traveling close to the \nEgyptian border.  That incident was followed by a rocket attack on another vehicle, and an assault by an explosive \ndevice on a third vehicle.\n\nAs Israeli troops moved into pursuit mode, seven of the Palestinian gunmen and five Egyptian security personnel \nwere killed in the exchange of fire.\n\nIt was the first major attack on Israel in several years and suspicion quickly rested on Hamas for orchestrating the  \nattacks.  Israeli officials said that the extremist militants came from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip,  and they \ntraveled via the Sinai in Egypt  into Israeli territory to carry out the attacks.\n\nIn response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised retaliation saying, \"This was a grave incident in \nwhich Israelis and Israeli sovereignty were harmed;  Israel will respond accordingly.\"  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud \nBarak also promised retaliation saying,  \"The real source of the terror is in Gaza and we will act against them with \nfull force and determination.\" He continued, explaining that the attacks \"underscored the weak Egyptian hold on \nSinai and the broadening of the activities of terrorists.\"\n\nIndeed, the situation showed that the border region between Israel and Egypt was relatively unprotected, and \nappeared to indicate that the new interim authorities in Egypt have not made cross-border security as much of a \npriority as the former Mubarak regime.\n\nLater on the same day,  despite denials from Hamas  that it was not behind the attacks on southern Israel, the \nIsraeli military had launched  air strikes over the Gaza Strip. Palestinian sources said that at least six people, \nincluding a senior Palestinian militant, died as a result. The cycle of violence continued on Aug. 19, 2011 when  \nabout a dozen rockets were fired from Gaza at the Israeli town of Ashdod, leaving at least one person injured. Most \nof the missiles landed harmlessly; however, one landed in the grounds of a religious seminary and left an individual \nseriously wounded.  The cycle of violence continued for a few more days and was characterized by volleys of \nmissile and rocket attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, as well as air strikes from Israel.  By Aug. 22, 2011, the \ndeath toll had unsurprisingly increased.\n\nAfter a joint call for restraint by the Quartet of Middle East peace mediators -- the United Nations, the United States, \nthe European Union, and Russia -- an informal truce was forged, bring an end to the violence and bloodshed.  \nHamas, which earlier denied being behind the attacks form Gaza, said that it would work to make sure the ceasefire \nwas respected by smaller extremist organizations, such as Gaza's Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), which \nwas deemed to be responsible for the originating attack that spurred the five-day exchange of hostilities.  On the \nother side of the equation, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the air strikes would stop contingent on an \nend to the rocket attacks.\n\nMeanwhile,  on Aug. 6, 2011, hundreds of thousands of young Israelis took to the streets to protest against the \nrising cost of living in that country.  Some of the largest demonstrations took place in the city of Tel Aviv where \nstudent protesters chanted, \"The people demand social justice.\"  This mass action was not the first of its kind.\n\nFor several weeks, an ongoing populist campaign had been rocking the country, with gatherings being established \nalong  Rothschild Boulevard, in an effort to draw attention to the socio-economic hardship being experienced by \npeople.  Of particular concern was the escalating cost of housing, food, education, childcare and gas taxes, which \ndisproportionately hurt the younger generation of students, young professionals, and couples just starting their \n\n\n\nfamilies.  Some protesters demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resign from office due to his lack of \neffectiveness in addressing these concerns, while other demonstrators directed their anger more generally to the \ngovernment and its policies.  Opposition parties, such as centrist Kadima and left-wing Labor, wasted no time in \njoining the chorus of criticism against the Likud-led right-wing government, whom they said has done nothing to \nrespond to the needs of the people.\n\nThe protests continued and even gained steam with a massive protest composed of tens of thousands of people \nacross the country taking place on Aug. 13, 2011. It should be noted that by the middle of August 2011, Prime \nMinister  Netanyahu was  under fire and facing a special debate in parliament, which was recalled from its summer \nrecess to deal with the domestic crisis. For his part, Netanyahu commented on the obvious in a discussion with a \nfinance panel as he said, \"We are experiencing great turbulence.\"  He continued,  \"We want to deal with both these \nproblems -- to relieve the cost of living and reduce gaps.\" Subsequently, Prime Minister Netanyahu's government \nestablished a committee to consider reforms, although the prime minister warned that it was unlikely that all the \nprotesters' demands would be met.\n\nThe start of September 2011 saw renewed economic protests in Israel with hundreds of thousands of people taking \nto the streets in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. It was apparent that the mass action was not decreasing with time.  \nAs noted by Student union President Itzik Shmuli in an address to the crowds: \"They told us that the movement was \nslowing down. Tonight we are showing that it's the opposite. We are the new Israelis, determined to continue the \nfight for a fairer and better society.\"\n\nMeanwhile, earlier in September 2011, Egyptian rioters stormed the Israeli embassy in Cairo.  The fracas yielded \nthe deaths of three people as security forces clashes with the rioters.  Egyptian authorities deployed security forces \nto disperse the protesters, even firing tear gas.  They also placed the country on alert as a result.\n\nThe attack  on the Israeli embassy occurred in the aftermath of the violence in Gaza in August 2011 (discussed \nabove)which resulted in the deaths of  five Egyptian policemen. On one hand, the situation  showed that the border \nregion between Israel and Egypt was relatively unprotected, and appeared to indicate that the new interim \nauthorities in Egypt have not made cross-border security as much of a priority as the former Mubarak regime.  But \non the other hand, the violence in Gaza caused outrage among Egyptians, to some degree sparking latent \nhostilities felt by some Egyptians in regard to Israel. Now, a month later, those tensions were emerging in the form \nof the attack in September 2011 on the Israel embassy in Cairo.\n\nIt should be noted that Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said that his country would maintain its peace \ntreaty with Egypt despite the assault on its embassy in Cairo. Speaking from Jerusalem, the Israeli prime minister \nsaid; \"Israel will continue to hold fast to the peace accord with Egypt.\" He continued, \"We are working together with \nthe Egyptian government to return our ambassador to Cairo soon.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu also thanked United \nStates President Barack Obama for assistance in arranging the evacuation of the embassy's diplomatic staff.  \nSome\n\nembassy security staff were reportedly trapped  there but were ultimately rescued by Egyptian commandos.\n\nMeanwhile, Egyptian authorities made it clear that they intended to try the culprits of the embassy attack in an \nemergency court.  As well, Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf  offered to step down from office but the \ncountry's interim military leader, Mohamad Hussain Tantawi, quickly rejected the offer of  resignation.  The scenario \nilluminated an uneasy balance that the Egyptian authorities would have to strike in being responsible to the cause \nof regional stability, while meeting the needs of people empowered by the ethos of liberation.\n\nAround the same time, Turkey threatened to challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza at the International Court of \nJustice (ICJ).  At issue was the attempt by a Turkish flotilla in 2010 to penetrate the Israeli blockade on Gaza.  On \nMay 31, 2010, a flotilla of six ships carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid supplies sailed from \nCyprus to the Gaza Strip, in a bid to challenge Israel's blockade on the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.  \nClashes between the two sides ultimately led to the deaths of 10 people, and injuries to scores more, including \nseveral Israeli soldiers. The activiststraveling on the flotilla were then detained and taken into Israeli custody.  It \n\n\n\nshould be noted that while no violence ensued on several vessels of the flotilla, the issue at hand  involved a \nTurkish ship, called the Marmara.  It was aboard that particular vessel that clashes between weapons-brandishing \npro-Palestinian activists and Israeli commandos unfolded.\n\nAccording to Israeli accounts, the activists on the flotilla attacked Israeli soldiers using knives and other weapons.  \nUpon gaining permission to take retaliatory action, Israeli commandos then led a raid on the flotilla, and opened fire \nwhen confronted by angry, weapons-wielding activists on the vessel called the Marmara.  On the other side of the \nequation, the \"Free Gaza Movement,\" which organized the flotilla, disputed Israel's version of events that Israeli \nforces opened fire in self-defense.  Activists aboard the flotilla argued that no weapons were used to provoke Israel, \nas alleged by Israeli soldiers.  The pro-Palestinian activists also insisted that their ships had a peaceful purpose \nand that they had been attacked in international waters.\n\nThe contested narratives -- Israeli versus pro-Palestinian -- continued almost a week after the deadly altercation on \nthe Marmara. The Israeli military released some photographs of knives, metal rods, and other weapons, which it \nsaid had been taken from pro-Palestinian activists on the Marmara.  However, the head of the group that organized \nthe flotilla [\"Free Gaza Movement\"], Huwaida Arraf, dismissed the evidence saying that all passengers had been \nscreened for weapons. That being said, subsequent photographs published in the Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, \ndepicted wounded Israel commandos.  Israeli authorities said these newly-released pictures corroborated Israel's \nversion of the events that transpired.\n\nRegardless, now more than a year later, Turkey was rejecting the conclusions of a United Nations report that found \nIsrael's blockade of Gaza to be a legal and legitimate security measure.  Turkey instead said that it would challenge \nthe finding at the ICJ, halted military cooperation with Israel, and expelled the Israeli ambassador.  It should be \nnoted that the United Nations report did not find Israel blameless for the bloodshed that occurred on May 31, 2011. \nIndeed, the report found that Israel's Israel's decision to board the vessels \"with such substantial force at a great \ndistance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and \nunreasonable.\"\n\nNevertheless, the situation was emblematic of a phase of devolving relations between Israel and Turkey.  Indeed, \nthe decision by Turkey to recognize a Palestinian state was certain to raise bilateral tensions further.  At issue here \nwas the impending unilateral declaration of independence by Palestinians (discussed below) and a ratification vote \nat the United Nations General Assembly.  While intended to strengthen the Palestinians' negotiating hand, the \nmove would not actually yield an independent Palestinian state with veto-wielding United States threatening to \nclose down this trajectory in the United Nations Security Council, and force the players back to the peace process.  \nThus, in many ways, this Palestinian move was likely to metaphorically open a \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic \ntensions with countries in the global community forced to take sides. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan \nsaid in address to the Arab League that recognition of a Palestinian state was an obligation rather than  an option \nfor his country.\n\nOn Oct. 11, 2011, a tentative agreement between the government of Israel and Hamas was reached. The deal \nmeant the release of an Israeli soldier after five years in captivity in exchange for the release of 1,000 Palestinian \nprisoners in Israeli jails.  Should the deal go forward,  Staff Sargeant Gilad Shalit would return home to Israeli soil \nas part of the prisoner exchange agreement.  While the Israeli cabinet had yet to meet for an emergency session to \ndiscuss the deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled that the agreement would move forward.  He \nsaid, \"If all goes according to plan, Gilad will be returning to Israel in the coming days.\"  On the other side of the \nequation,  Izzeldein al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, was confirming the deal had been mediated by \nEgypt.\n\nDays later, Gilad Shalit returned home to Israel, via Egypt, after five years in captivity in Gaza.  After undergoing \nmedical tests for untreated shrapnel wounds and complications because of a lack of sunlight, he was greeted by \ncheering crowds.  In his first interview, Shalit expressed hopes for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  Shalit's \nfather noted, \"We are concluding a long and difficult journey. We're glad that we won our son back.\"\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among those offering greetings to the returning Shalit, before reuniting the \nsoldier with his family.  The Israeli head of government addressed the controversial prisoner exchange deal during \na televised national address in which he explained that it had be a difficult decision to free more than 1,000 \nPalestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of one Israeli soldier, but that it was crucial that Shalit be brought \nhome.\n\nIn Gaza, an estimated 200,000 people gathered to welcome the freed Palestinian prisoners.  A celebratory crowd \nwas also gathered in Ramallah on the West Bank where Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas hailed the \nformer prisoners as \"freedom fighters.\"  However, some quarters in Israel and some elements of the Obama \nadministration in the United States have criticized this characterization, noting that most of the prisoners who were \nreleased had been serving life sentences for terrorism and the murder of Israeli citizens. In a letter released to the \nfamilies of bereaved Israeli families whose loved ones were killed at the hands of many of the prisoners who were \nreleased, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote,  \"I understand the difficulty in accepting that the vile \npeople who committed the heinous crimes against your loved ones will not pay the full price they deserve.\"\n\nAlso in October 2011, United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies uncovered a conspiracy plot by \nIranian agents working on behalf of the elite Iranian Quds Force. The plot included plans to assassinate the Saudi \nArabian ambassador to the United States, and to bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington D.C. and \nBuenos Aires. The White House has promised to hold Tehran responsibility for  its involvement in this elaborate plot \nof assassination and terrorism.  Meanwhile, a connection between the Iranian agents and Mexican drug cartels \n(whom the Iranian agents were hoping to hire to carry out the assassination) has been uncovered, effectively \ncomplicating the already-tangled web of complex geopolitics.\n\nAt the end of October 2011, the Israel military and Palestinian militants were engaged in a spate of attacks in \nGaza.  Israel launched an air strike on a Jihadist militant training camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.  \nPalestinian militants belonging to the Islamic Jihad (Holy War) movement's armed Al-Quds Brigades either died or \nwere injured in that action.  Among the dead was Ahmed al-Sheikh Khalil, a senior member of Islamic Jihad who led \nthe group's rocket engineering team. Israel also carried out a second raid in Rafah, this time killing another two \nmilitants from the Al-Quds Brigades.  Israel was accusing the militants of carrying out rocket attacks only day prior \nand said that it was responding to those acts of violence.  In retaliation for Israel's airstrikes, Palestinian militants \nreportedly tried to launch another volley of rockets into southern Israel.\n\nFor its part, Israeli Police announced that  in response to the increase in attacks emanating from Palestinian \nmilitants  in Gaza, the national alert level  was being elevated to \"G\", just one level below the most severe alert. The \nPalestinian National Authority (PNA) urged Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip to be  utilize more self-\nrestraint and \"not to give Israel an excuse to wage a war on the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIt should be noted that on October 30, 2011, a cease-fire between the two sides was being brokered by Egypt.  \nThese efforts died on the proverbial vine when Palestinian militants in Gaza attempted to fire rockets once again at \nIsrael, prompting the Israeli military to bomb Gaza.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nPresident Obama calls for pre-1967 boundaries as basis for two state solution in Middle East\n\nOn May 19, 2011, during a speech at the United States Department of State outlining United States policy and the \nMiddle East,  President Barack Obama said that a future Palestinian state would be based on the 1967 borders.\n\nThe United States president said, \"The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with \nmutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\"  Although a long-\nstanding tenet of Middle East negotiations (as discussed below), President Obama's statement yielded rebuke from \nhardliners who claimed he was abandoning Israel, and tensions with the Netanyahu administration. The \n\n\n\ncontroversy -- false though it might be -- over President Obama's policy stance  on Middle East Peace was \nexpected to carry over for several days.  The president was scheduled to offer a speech at an American pro-Israel \nlobbying entity, AIPAC, at its annual conference.  As well, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the \nUnited States for a visit and was scheduled to a joint session of the United States Congress.\n\nPalestinians prepare unilateral bid for recognition at United Nations; Israel wants return to peace negotiations while \nUnited States promises veto at Security Council\n\nSummary --\n\nPalestinian  Authority President Mahmoud Abbas  has sought full membership for a Palestinian state within the \nUnited Nations.  He said that full status and recognition at the United Nations was a legitimate right for the \nPalestinian people, and that this cause would be taken up at the meeting of the United Nations.  Of course, the \nunilateral measure has been opposed by Israel, which has cast the move as divisive and unlikely to help the peace \nprocess, which aims to achieve a two-state solution with an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living \nside by side  in peace and security. For its part, the United States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return \nto the peace process and the negotiating table as the only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  The \nUnited States also warned the Palestinians that it would use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to \nquell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for recognition. The  unilateral bid for recognition at the United Nations by the \nPalestinians was expected to  open the metaphoric \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions, with countries in the \nglobal community forced to take sides.\n\nPolitical Background --\n\nA key issue has been the Palestinians' call for recognition of a state consistent with the 1967 borders, which \nencompasses the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip.  This terrain has been occupied by \nIsrael since 1967 and has been a keystone issue in all discussions and peace negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinians.  A peace plan advanced by United States President Barack Obama  in May 2011 had  called for  pre-\n1967 boundaries (with swaps) as the basis for two-state solution in Middle East. The plan evoked anxiety on the \npart of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite the fact that this has been the \nfoundation for previous peace initiatives.\n\nIndeed, the pre-1967 boundaries refers to the borders that existed before the six-day Middle East war in 1967 that \nextended Israeli control into the West Bank and Gaza with predominantly Palestinian populations.  That terrain has \nconstituted the literal and figurative grounds of contestation in Israel and the Palestinian territories since some \n300,000 Israeli Jews have constructed settlements on the outlying areas.  Settlement activity has raised the ire of \nPalestinians who believe that the encroachment will curtail their own rights to land for a future Palestinian state.  \nThe matter has been one of great consternation, and has resided at the heart of peace negotiations with \nPalestinians demanding a halt to settlement activity, always alongside Israelis' demands for an end to attacks by \nPalestinian militants.\n\nTo be precise, peace initiatives on the Middle East over the years have often rested on the notion of resorting to \npre-1967 borders -- at the very least as a point from which to begin negotiations.  Stated another way, while brokers \nof peace in the Middle East may not have overtly foregrounded the pre-1967 borders in the forthright manner of \nPresident Obama, the same principle has been cast as a \"jumping off point\" of sorts (and not the ultimate \ndestination) of peace negotiations for decades.  It is well known that Israel will not accept the wholesale notion of \nthe pre-1967 borders, however, trade offs  for other priority issues have always been part of the terms of peace \nnegotiations. In this respect, President Obama's stance has differed little from predecessors in orientation, \nespecially as he emphasized the notion of \"mutually agreed swaps\" of terrain for the creation of \"a viable Palestine, \nand a secure Israel.\"\n\nNevertheless,  President Obama's peace initiative earlier in the year set off a firestorm  at home and abroad among \nright-leaning and hard line politicians.  Republicans at home accused him of abandoning Israel, while Israeli Prime \n\n\n\nMinister  Benjamin  Netanyahu was quick to note that the borders that existed prior to the 1967  war were \n\"indefensible.\" The Israeli head of government was referring to settlements such as those in  Judea and Samaria \nthat would be left undefended beyond those territorial lines.  Prime Minister Netanyahu also said that he \nappreciated President Obama's \"commitment to peace\" but that for peace to endure, \"the viability of a Palestinian \nstate cannot come at the expense of the viability of the one and only Jewish state.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu , \ntherefore, called for President Obama to affirm the United States' 2004 commitment to Israel, in which then-\nPresident George W. Bush said that Israel would be able to hold on to substantial settlements as part of a future \npeace deal.\n\nIt should be noted that despite this sudden controversy erupting from President Obama's plan, in fact, a 2002 \"land \nfor peace\" deal tabled by Saudi Arabia contained the very same \"withdrawal to pre-1967 borders\" provision and \nwas seriously considered by Israel at the time.\n\nCentral to the Saudi \"land for peace\" plan was  pan-Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for Israel's withdrawal \nfrom Arab lands captured in 1967 \u2013 the West Bank, Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.  During its \nown tenure at the helm of government in the United States, the Bush administration appeared to entertain the Saudi \n\"land for peace\"  plan as a worthy companion to its own \"roadmap for peace\" in the early 2000s.  Moreover, by \n2008,  Israel -- then under the control of the centrist Kadima Party -- reportedly was reconsidering the dormant \n\"land for peace\" deal, albeit with reservations.  Palestinian negotiators encouraged Israel to pursue this track at the \ntime.  That being said,  members of the conservative Likud Party of Netanyahu rejected this proposal as a non-\nstarter due to the aforementioned matter of leaving Jewish settlements vulnerable.  Now in power, Prime Minister \nNetanyahu was unlikely to soften his position since he was in an uneasy alliance with the hard line party, Yisrael \nBeiteinu, which strenuously rejects any halt to settlement activity.  Given the need to massage the interests of his \ncoalition partner, the domestic political scene in Israel would underline Netanyahu's imperative to reject the 2008 \n\"land for peace\" deal and the 2011 position, as articulated by President Obama.\n\nIt should also be noted that  foreign policy analysts could not interpret President Obama's speech as anything less \nthan a strong affirmation of the United States' enduring relationship with Israel.  Notably, President Obama offered \nIsrael an exit strategy from peace negotiations with the Palestinians -- for the moment, unified in governance \namong Fatah and Hamas factions.  Specifically, in pointing to Hamas' refusal to recognize the Jewish State of \nIsrael, President Obama noted that it would be ludicrous for Israel to pursue serious talks with an entity that would \nnot even acknowledge existential and geopolitical realities.  Moreover, President Obama signaled that the United \nStates would be siding with Israel should the Palestinians petition the United Nations for statehood and  recognition \nlater in 2011 without resolving the outstanding territorial issues.\n\nThe Scene Ahead of the Palestinians' Bid for Statehood --\n\nAt the start of August 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said he was prepared to discuss a peace \nplan with the Palestinians, based on United States President Obama's borders proposition.  Netanyahu's \nannouncement to Middle East power brokers appeared aimed at reinvigorating stalled peace talks.  Months earlier \nin May 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu excoriated President Obama for advancing a plan that called for pre-1967 \nboundaries as a basis for two-state solution in Middle East.  Then, in August 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu \nappeared to be accepting the pre-1967 borders as a starting point for discussions, although the prime minister's \noffice refused to admit that it was reversing its earlier-stated objections to the terms put forth by President Obama.  \nPrime Minister Netanyahu's office, though, said that any peace agreement would be contingent upon the \nrecognition of Israel as a Jewish state -- a stance that has not found acceptance among Palestinian quarters.\n\nIt should also be noted that amid these moves by Israel was the impending decision by the Palestinian Authority to \npresent its application for international recognition of statehood to the United Nations in September 2011.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has made the claim that it does not wish to wait for independence via peace negotiations \nwith Israel, thus the thrust to vitiate the peace process.  However, with the United States -- an ally of Israel -- on the \nUnited Nations Security Council, it was inevitable that the Palestinian Authority's unilateral declaration of \n\n\n\nindependence would be be subject to veto.  As noted above, United States President Barack Obama had already \nwarned of such an outcome months earlier when he re-introduced the aforementioned terms of the peace process.  \nNonetheless, the Palestinian Authority was hoping that affirmative votes at the United Nations (United States \nexcluded) would  strengthen its hand in trying to achieve independence.\n\nAt the start of September 2011, in a last-ditch effort to avert a diplomatic showdown at the United Nations, the \nObama administration in the United States circulated a proposal aimed at restarting peace talks.  The proposal \nincluded a provision for the Palestinians to abandon the membership and recognition vote in the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly, which was expected to take place on Sept. 20, 2011.\n\nAs Israel's closest ally, the United States had been hoping to shift the momentum, while realizing that it could not \neasily  coalesce enough support from individuals countries to block ratification of the Palestinians' aspirations at the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. Accordingly, it had advanced the aforementioned proposal aimed at restarting \nthe peace process. Clearly, the United States was hoping to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to the table -- \nto traverse the course of the peace process.  The United States was also hoping that by providing an an alternate \npathway (i.e. distinct from the unilateral and inevitably controversial membership and recognition vote in the United \nNations), several individual countries would opt to support the peace process option at a vote in the General \nAssembly.\n\nAs noted above, the Palestinians were hoping to bypass the peace process, and if not outright achieve \nindependence via a vote at the United Nations, at least garner significant political power for the cause. Should the \nPalestinians ultimately decide to pursue this path at the United Nations, the United States warned the Palestinians \nthat it would use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to quell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for \nrecognition.\n\nPalestinians Bid for full UN membership --\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would seek full membership for a \nPalestinian state at the anticipated meeting of the United Nations in New York, set to take place within days.  As of \n2011, Palestinians hoed permanent observer status at the United Nations and were represented by the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO).  This move to pursue full membership could  be understood as the desire to seek an \nupgrade in status, of sorts.\n\nAbbas, who spoke from the Palestinian Authority headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah,  said that full \nstatus and recognition at the United Nations was a legitimate right for the Palestinian people, and that this cause \nwould be taken up at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nNote that this strategy involved a modest shift from the initial plan to pursue ratification at the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. Now, Abbas was opting to seek  full membership at the United Nations Security Council. \nSpeaking of this impending effort, Abbas said: \"We are going to the United Nations to request our legitimate right, \nobtaining full membership for Palestine in this organization.\" He added, \"We take with us all the suffering and hope \nof our people to achieve this objective.\"  Abbas also noted that more than 100 countries already recognized \nPalestine as a state and that the patience of the Palestinians people had been exhausted.\n\nIt should be noted that while Abbas was speaking on behalf of the collective Palestinian people, the extremist \nmilitant  Islamist entity, Hamas, which controls Gaza, was not on board with the decision of the Palestinian Authority \npresident.  Instead, Hamas has said that the venture into the United Nation was a \"risky\" endeavor.  Of course, \nHamas has never endorsed the notion of a two-state solution since it does not recognize the right of existence for \nthe Jewish state of Israel.\n\nThe unilateral measure by the Palestinians for statehood and United Nations membership has been strenuously \nopposed by Israel, which has cast the move as both  divisive and provocative.  Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister \nDanny Ayalon observed in dire terms, \"A unilateral declaration by the Palestinians of independence or any UN \n\n\n\ndecision will actually be a vote for friction and conflict over co-operation and reconciliation and I think that would be \ndeplorable for many years.\"\n\nIsrael has further said it would undermine the peace process, which aims to achieve a two-state solution, \ncharacterized by an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living in peace and security beside one \nanother.  Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev declined to offer an official response to Abbas' speech.  \nThat being said, Regev warned that the Palestinians' move would deleteriously affect the prospects for peace; he \nalso emphasized that the two state solution would only be reached via direct negotiations in Ramallah and \nJerusalem, rather that through the United Nations.\n\nIsrael has additionally accused the Palestinians of attempting to undermine its legitimacy in pursuing this path at \nthe United Nations. In response, Abbas struck a somewhat more diplomatic tone, saying, \"We are not heading \nthere to de-legitimize Israel, no one can do this, it is a state with full membership at the UN. We want to de-\nlegitimize the Israeli occupation and its measures on our territories.\"  This stated objective  notwithstanding, in fact,  \nthe vote would do nothing to end Israeli jurisdiction in certain spheres of control over the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nFor its part, the United States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return to the peace process and the \nnegotiating table as the only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  While the United States was not \nkeen to go down the path of halting the independence aspirations of the Palestinian people at a time of instability in \nthe wider Middle East region,  it was, nonetheless, maintaining its veto threat.  Indeed, the Obama administration \nhas made it very clear that if the Palestinians went through with their pursuit of full recognition and membership \nvote, the United States intended to wield its veto power at the United Nation Security Council.  A veto by the United \nStates would effectively render the membership and recognition aspirations of the Palestinians  null and void.\n\nStriking a diplomatic course, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy was calling for a  compromise in the form of \nenhanced status (as a non-member state) for the Palestinians at the General Assembly, with a timetable for \nnegotiations on the road to a definitive agreement.\n\nThe French leader was anxious to see a showdown at the Security Council averted.  But it seemed that this \ncompromise found little resonance among the Palestinian leadership.  Indeed, Palestinian Authority President \nAbbas asserted that he was pressing forward with that move.\n\nLeaving no doubt of his course  of action to be undertaken, President Obama reportedly told the Palestinian leader \n(Abbas)  on Sept. 22, 2011 that he would veto his bid for United Nations membership.  In an address to the United \nNations, President Obama reiterated the United States' stance, emphasizing that a sovereign Palestinian state \ncould only be achieved through direct negotiations with Israel.  He said,  of the road to achieving the two-state \nsolution: \"There is no short cut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Abbas was apparently crafting his written application , which would be submitted \nto Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Sept. 23, 2011.  Pending approval by the Ban Ki-moon, the application would \nthen be taken up by the Security Council and would require nine affirmative votes of the 15 members, and no \nvetoes, to pass.  That vote, though, was not expected for several weeks. Of course, with a guaranteed veto by the \nUnited States in the offing, the application was on the road to nowhere.  That being said, Palestinians were claiming \nimminent victory, suggesting that they had successfully brought the matter of Palestinian independence onto the \nnational agenda.\n\nAt the same time, the Netanyahu  government in Israel  -- not exactly an entity that has enjoyed warm relations with \nthe Obama White House -- was praising President Obama for his country's stalwart support.  President Netanyahu \ndeclared that the American president deserved a \"badge of honor\" for his defense of Israel.  Indeed, Israel's \nfriends and allies on this subject were limited in the context of the global community.\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Abbas formally requested full United Nations membership as a \npath toward statehood.  Abbas conveyed the written request to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthen  delivered a speech to the annual gathering of the General Assembly.  Following protocol, United Nations \n\n\n\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon then passed on Abbas' request to the Security Council.  A vote on the matter was \nnot expected for several weeks.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it was clear that the Palestinian independence move was likely to metaphorically open \na \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions with countries in the global community forced to take sides. Moreover, it \ncould well inflame passions in the region of the Middle East, which was already experiencing historic upheaval, \never  since the \"season of unrest\" began to sweep across the Arab world at the start of 2011.\n\nNote: On Oct. 31, 2011 the Palestinians were granted membership in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO).  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded on Nov. 3, 2011 by \nfreezing  Israeli funding to UNESCO.  Netanyahu argued, \"Such moves do not advance peace, but rather push it \nfurther away.\"\n\nUpdate (as of 2012)\n\nOn Feb. 13, 2012, Israel's embassies in India and Georgia were struck by bomb attacks.  In the Indian capital city, \na magnetic bomb attached to a vehicle left the wife of an Israeli diplomat wounded as she traveled to retrieve her \nchildren from school at the American embassy.  She was said to be in stable condition in a New Delhi hospital.  In \nthe Georgian capital, a bomb was discovered attached to a car in the Israeli diplomatic fleet.  Georgian police were \nable to defuse the bomb after an Israeli embassy employee alerted them to the situation in Tbilisi.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted no time in accusing Iran of being behind the two bombs,  \ncharacterizing Iran as  \"the greatest exporter of terror in the world.\"  Netanyahu also observed that there were \nrecent thwarted attacks on Jews and Israelis in places such as Azerbaijan and Thailand,.  Speaking of this trend, \nthe Israeli prime minister noted, \"In all these cases, the elements behind the attacks were Iran and its proxy, \nHezbollah.\"\n\nIsrael said that its foreign missions would be placed on high alert, given the current landscape.\n\nWhile Iran offered no immediate response, it was certainly the case that Tehran had promised to seek revenge for a \nnumber of targeted assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, which that country blames on Israel.\n\nMarch 2012 saw a renewal of the notorious cycle of violence between Palestinian militants and Israeli security \nforces.  This latest bout of Israeli-Palestinian violence appeared to have been sparked by an Israeli air strike that \nkilled a senior leader of the militant group, the Popular Resistance Committees PRC).  Israel said the strike against \nthe PRC was due to prevailing evidence that the extremist entity was planning a massive terrorist attack.\n\nIn March 2012, Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israeli territory, and in retaliation, Israel launched further air \nstrikes into Gaza.  More than 35 people were injured in the relentless volley of more than 240 rocket attacks by \nPalestinian militants, while about 25 Palestinians died in the more than 30 air strikes by Israeli security forces.\n\nIt should be noted that the Hebrew publication, Maariv, claimed that 22 of the 25 Palestinians who died in air strikes \nwere militants and not civilians.\n\nBy the middle of the month,  an Egyptian-mediated truce between the two sides was officially in place and the \nIsraeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was claiming that the violence had passed. There \nwas a sense of skepticism about whether or not the truce would hold.  Indeed, despite the fact that the ceasefire \nwent into force, Palestinian militants in Gaza quickly violated it by firing rockets and mortars into southern Israel, \nincluding an attack on Netivot and another on Beersheba, which was intercepted by the anti-missile Iron Dome \n\n\n\nsystem.  In retaliation, Israel launched an air strike on Gaza City and Khan  Khounis.  Meanwhile, Hamas was in \ntalks with smaller militant groups, trying to persuade them to observe the ceasefire arrangement.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, Shaul Mofaz was chosen to be the new leader of Israel's centrist Kadima Party. Mofaz  \ndecisively defeated outgoing Tzipi Livni to become the new leader of Israel's largest party with about two-thirds of \nthe vote share in Kadima's primary election. It should be noted that although Kadima gained the most seats in the \nunicameral parliament or Knesset in the last election, it is in opposition.  Israel is governed by Benjamin Netayahu \nof the right-wing Likud, which was able to put together a ruling coalition.\n\nIn April 2012, global concerns over the prospects of Iran developing a nuclear weapon tamped down to some \ndegree.  At issue was a claim by the head of the Israeli military that  Iran was not yet committed to the path of \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  In an interview with the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General \nBenny Gantz said he did not believe Iran would necessarily develop nuclear weapons. He said Iran's Supreme \nLeader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had not yet made a final decision whether to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nWhile Gantz acknowledged that Iran was moving \"step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether \nto manufacture a nuclear bomb,\" he expressed the view that the Iranian regime \"hasn't yet decided to go the extra \nmile.\" Gantz additionally said the following of Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iranian power brokers: \"I don't think he \nwill want to go the extra mile. I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people.\"  But Gantz also \nwarned that a decision of some sort in the offing. He said, \"Either Iran takes its nuclear program to a civilian footing \nonly, or the world -- perhaps we too -- will have to do something. We're closer to the end of discussions than the \nmiddle.\"\n\nThis tempered view was a far cry from the rhetoric to date that Iran has been intent on a plan to develop weapons \nas part of its nuclear technology program.  Those fears by leading members of the international community have \nonly been accentuated by Iran's failure to abide by international agreements regarding the monitoring of its nuclear \ndevelopment activities.  Indeed, in late 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published a report \nwhich noted the fact that it was unable to \"provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear \nmaterial and activities in Iran.\" The IAEA report also warned that  it continued to have \"serious concerns regarding \npossible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.\" More recently in February 2012, the IAEA concluded that \nIran was not cooperative and that prevailing questions regarding the possible military dimension of the Iranian \nnuclear development program remained unanswered.  Overall, the findings from the IAEA served only to underline \nexisting suspicions by the West that Iran held ambitions to build a nuclear bomb, and raised the specter of a \ntargeted military strike by the Israelis on suspected Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTo date, Iran's continued non-compliance with nuclear monitoring has led to the imposition of sanctions by the \nUnited Nations, as well as by individual countries including the United States,  Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as \nthe European Union. For his part,  Israeli military chief Gantz  appeared to be of the mind that international pressure \nwas yielding results.\n\nStill, not everyone in Israel was of the same view.  In an interview with CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu  said that he would not want to bet \"the security of the world on Iran's rational behavior.\"  Moreover, \nNetanyahu made it clear that he was willing  to take action against Iran to stop it obtaining a nuclear weapon.  That \nbeing said, the nuanced differences between the words of Gantz and Netanyahu highlighted a growing divide in \nIsrael between political leaders and military/intelligence specialists over the wisdom of attacking Iran.  As such, the \noverall political and diplomatic climate had cooled from its previous level of heated turmoil.\n\nAt the close of April 2012, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said his far right  Yisrael Beitenu party -- the \nsecond largest party in the current ruling coalition -- was  no longer obligated to the Netanyahu government. \nMoreover, Lieberman  called for general elections to be held in Israel \"as soon as possible.\"  The foreign minister \nsuggested that the governmental system was \"paralyzed\" and drew attention to a brewing political imbroglio over \nmandated military service in Israel.\n\n\n\nAt issue was the so-called  Tal Law, which allows full-time Yeshiva students to delay their army service until age 23 \nand shortens their service time. Lieberman was pushing to replace it with new legislation that would ensure equal \nmilitary service for all, and threatening to quit the government if a vote on a new law did not pass.  While Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for new legislation that would ensure military service by all \nIsraelis on equal terms, his coalition partners were not finding agreeing on the matter. Indeed, the ultra religious \nShas party strongly opposed the idea, preferring the religious provisions contained in the Tal Law.  In this way,\n\nLieberman's Yisrael Beitenu  was more closely aligned with Netanyahu's Likud over the notion of forging \"equal \nservice for all\" legislation.  Partners in the ruling coalition were therefore on a collision course ahead of the \nimpending vote set for May 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu was signaling that he was open to the idea of holding early elections.  The \nIsraeli head of government said that an early vote could  be regarded as a referendum on the notion of military \nservice for all.  But political analysts noted that his motivation for early elections was likely more practical. Indeed, \nrecent polling data shows his Likud party leading opponents by a wide margin.  An early election could prevent \nnewly-minted Kadima leader, Shaul Mofaz, as well as increasingly popular Yair Lapid  of  Yesh Atid (Future), from \nhaving enough time to leverage themselves into politically advantageous positions on the Israeli scene.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, Israeli Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin said a bill would soon be introduced to dissolve the \nparliament and bring forward general elections. The plan for early elections in Israel was  soon formalized when \nPrime Minister Netanyahu said that voting would be moved up by a full year with an election  expected on Sept. 4, \n2012. The Israeli head of government said that political pressure from his coalition partners had forced him to bring \nthe elections  forward.  This seemed to be a tacit reference to the brewing dissonance between Yisrael Beiteinu and \nShas over the \"military service for all\" issue.  Speaking of the stability of his outgoing government and the \nemergence of differences only recently, Netanyahu said, \"Our government has been the most stable one in dozens \nof years, but with the beginning of our fourth year we started seeing signs that it started to weaken. Political \ninstability attracts extortion and populism, and these are damaging the security, economy and society.\"\"\n\nPolling data by the Hebrew daily Maariv  suggests that Netanyahu's Likud party was likely to garner as many as 31 \nof the 120 seats in the Knesset; Labor could regain its footing as a major player with the possible acquisition of 18 \nsears;  Yisrael Beitenu  and the centrist Kadima Party were each projected to win 11 seats. Such a result would be \ncatastrophic for Kadima, which was actually the single largest party in parliament, although it had decided to be the \nopposition party following the previous elections.  Hence, it was Netanyahu who formed a coalition after the last \nvote, with Likud as the main player, and augmented by Labor and several minor parties.  Now in 2012, a coalition \ngovernment was the expected outcome of these impending elections, with Netanyahu hoping to hold on to his post \nas head of that government.\n\nBut before snap elections could actually be called, a new government coalition agreement was forged between \nLikud and Kadima.  Until this time, Kadima had remained in opposition; now, with  snap elections looming and the \npossibility of suffering losses, the centrist party decided to enter government.  The  sudden and surprising deal \nwould conjoin Likud and Kadima in a national unity government that would be in effect until 2013. The deal would \nalso  position the new Kadima leader, Shaul Mofaz, as deputy prime minister.  In exchange for Kadima's support \nthrough the end of the existing term of office, Likud would back Kadima's plan to replace the Tal Law (discussed \nabove).\n\nOn July 17, 2012, Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Vice Prime Minister and leader of the centrist Kadima party, announced \nthat his party would be withdrawing from the Likud-led coalition government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nMofaz made the announcement that his party was exiting the short-lived \"grand coalition\" saying, \"With great \nsorrow, we have no choice but to announce that we are leaving the coalition.\"  The decision for Kadima to quit the \ngovernment appeared to be sourced in prevailing differences between Mofaz and Netanyahu over legislation that  \nwould compel ultra-Orthodox Jews  and Arab residents to participate in military service.  The issue first came to the \nfore  months earlier, as discussed above.\n\n\n\nNow, in July 2012 as the conscription issue resurfaced, Netanyahu proposed that Yeshiva students be drafted at \nthe age of 23. Kadima opposed the proposal as it has demanded that all conscripts be drafted at the age of 18 -- \nconsistent with army policy. As stated by Mofaz, \"This issue is fundamental, and there is no choice but to leave the \ncoalition. Every concession will harm Kadima's image.\"  Clearly, the exit of Kadima from the coalition returned \nIsrael to the state of political impasse once. That being said, there was no need for early elections as Prime \nMinister Netanyahu retained a majority in the Knesset even without Kadima.\n\nMeanwhile, at the start of July 2012, the Israeli government announced the death of former Prime Minister Yitzhak \nShamir. Shamir  served as prime minister from 1983 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1992. Shamir's background included \nparticipation in Irgun Zvai Leumi, a  paramilitary group that opposed British control of Palestine, as well as a \ncommander role at the helm of Lehi, a group regarded as an extremist militant entity by the United Nations Security \nCouncil. He  served in the Mossad from 1955 to 1965. In that capacity, Shamir  directed the assassinations of \nformer Third Reich scientists working on an Egyptian missile program, known as Operation Damocles. Although \nShamir entered the political scene of independent and sovereign Israel as a member of the Herut party, headed by \nMenachem Begin, he was more well-known as a Likud hardliner. As prime minister, Shamir  advocated a muscular \nmilitary stance as well as expansive settlement in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nOn July 18, 2012, eight people died and more than 30 others were injured when a bomb exploded at the Burgas \nairport in Bulgaria.  The victims included the Bulgarian bus driver and the suspected suicide bomber who carried out \nthe attack. The bombing appeared to target a bus carrying Israeli tourists in the Black Sea region of Bulgaria.\n\nSignificantly, the attack occurred on the 18th anniversary of a deadly attack on a Jewish community center in \nArgentina, raising the likelihood that the Bulgaria bombing was another instance of anti-Jewish terrorism by \nextremist elements.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Iran for the act of terrorism in a statement \nthat read: \"All the signs lead to Iran. Only in the past few months we have seen Iranian attempts to attack Israelis in \nThailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other places.\" He additionally promised retaliation, asserting in the \nstatement, \"Murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent people. This is an Iranian terror attack that is \nspreading throughout the entire world. Israel will react forcefully to Iranian terror.\"\n\nA day later, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak expanded on Netanyahu's claim that Iran was behind the act of \nterrorism, explaining that the Lebanese Hezbollah was the direct perpetrator of the attack, but had been acting \nunder the aegis  of Iran.  Netanyahu himself explained the connection using the following phrase: \"Hezbollah, the \nlong arm of Iran.\"\n\nAnalysts were suggesting that the terror attack in Bulgaria was likely another manifestation of the covert  war \nbetween Israel and Iran.  To that end, there were intimations that the Bulgaria bombing might have been a \nretaliatory attack for the series of targeted strikes against  Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\nFor its part, Iran dismissed the accusation and expressed condemnation for \"all terrorist acts.\"  No statement, \nthough, came from Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaking from the United States, President Barack Obama condemned the bombing, calling it a \"barbaric terrorist \nattack.\" The United States president also promised to assist Israel in actualizing justice, saying: \"The United States \nwill stand with our allies, and provide whatever assistance is necessary to identify and bring to justice the \nperpetrators of this attack.\"  While the male suicide bomber had falsified United States documents in his \npossession, his identity remained unknown at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nBy July 20, 2012, United States officials were suggesting that the suicide bomber on the bus in Bulgaria was a \nmember of Hezbollah.  According to the New York Times,  their sources did not wish to be identified as the \ninvestigation was under way, however, the suicide bomber was in Bulgaria on a mission to attack Israeli interests. \nThe New York Times' unnamed sources also observed that Hezbollah was being guided and sponsored by Iran in \nthis effort. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov was on the record confirming that the suicide bomber had \nbeen \"in country\" for several days prior to the terror attack.\n\n(See below for later developments in this case.)\n\nAs September 2012 began, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) \nreport that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According to the IAEA, \nthere were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new equipment was not \nyet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had \"significantly hampered\" its ability to inspect the Parchin military \nsite, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been \"sanitized,\" presumably to obfuscate Iranian nuclear \nactivities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian \nnuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to address \nthe United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nWith that gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in the offing, Israeli Prime Minister \nattempted to schedule a meeting with United States President Barack Obama. Media reports indicated that \nNetanyahu said that he was prepared to travel to Washington D.C. to meet with President Obama.  The White \nHouse declined the meeting on the basis of the United States' leader schedule; it also drew attention to the fact that \nthere were no bilateral meetings scheduled for the United States president with any other leaders.  The White \nHouse also pointed to a meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .\n\nThe White House further noted that there was ongoing contact between President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu over a number of security issues, including the nuclear threat posed by Iran. In  statement, the  White \nHouse confirmed that President Obama had just spoken with President Netanyahu for an hour on Sept. 11, 2012.  \nThe statement included the following assertions: \"The two leaders discussed the threat posed by Iran's nuclear \nprogram, and our close cooperation on Iran and other security issues. President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, \nand agreed to continue their close consultations going forward.\"\n\nNevertheless, Netanyahu's inability to secure a meeting with President Obama fueled speculation about poor \nrelations between the two men.  It was certainly possible that the White House was not in the mood to reward \nNetanyahu after he criticized the United States for not being tough enough on Iran over its nuclear program.  \nDuring  a news conference in Jerusalem with  Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov,  Netanyahu spoke of of the \ninternational community's reluctance to sanction a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.  He said, \"The \nworld tells Israel: wait, there's still time. And I say: wait for what? Wait until when?\" He continued, \"Those in the \ninternational community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before \nIsrael.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu went on to characterize  Iran as \"the greatest threat to world peace.\"  The level \nof rhetoric from the Israeli leader was so high that the Haaretz newspaper described Netanyahu's remarks as \"an \nunprecedented verbal attack on the United States government.\"\n\nBy the close of September 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had addressed the United Nations General \nAssembly and declared that time was running out to halt Iran's push to acquire enough enriched uranium to develop \na nuclear bomb.  Using a crude visual and a red pen, Netanyahu again reiterated his demand that there be a \"red \nline\" draw as regards the Iranian nuclear threat.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu charged that Iran might have sufficient material to create a nuclear bomb by the middle \nof 2013, thus requiring a clear message from the international community in the form of the \"red line.\"  Netanyahu \nsaid, \"Red lines don't lead to war, red lines prevent war. Nothing could imperil the world more than a nuclear-armed \nIran.\"  He also dismissed the effectiveness of sanctions passed against Iran, saying that they had not curtailed \nIran's nuclear program and asserting that \"The Iranian nuclear calendar does not take time out.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the United States has generally taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the \nbest path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program.  As well, United States Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton seemed to dismiss Netanyahu's call, saying instead that her country was not prepared to \ncommit to drawing \"red lines.\"  In his own address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack \nObama asserted that his country  would \"do what we must\" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms.\"  But he also \nmade it clear that while the United States has not foreclosed a military option against Iran, multinational \nnegotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.\n\nFor its part, Iran responded  to the Israeli prime minister's address by warning that it had the right to retaliate to any \nmilitary strike on its territory or interests.  Iran's deputy United Nations ambassador also said that his county \npossessed enough military might to defend itself and that it was not seeing nuclear weapons capability in the first \nplace.  Eshagh al-Habib said his country was \"strong enough to defend itself and reserves its full right to retaliate \nwith full force against any attack.\"\n\nThat being said, Iran's often-repeated claim that it had the right to a civilian nuclear program was itself subject to \nserious challenge. In mid-September 2012, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), issued a stern rebuke of Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. Notably, the IAEA's \nresolution was proposed jointly by the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in \na rare display of unity as regards the Iranian nuclear development issue. Meanwhile, IAEA Director General Yukiya \nAmano noted that despite a series of meetings with Iran throughout 2012 aimed at ensuring that the IAEA would be \nable to carry out its investigations, there had been no concrete results.  Amano characterized the lack of progress  \nas \"frustrating.\"\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2012, the Israeli air force shot down an unmanned aircraft, commonly referred to as a \"drone,\"  after it \nentered southern Israeli territory and remained in Israeli air space for several minutes. The unmanned aircraft  was \nkept under Israeli military surveillance and then followed by Israeli air force jets before it was shot down and \ncrashed in the sparsely-populated northern area of the Negev desert.  The Israeli military said there was no \nconclusive information as to whether or not the drone was being used for a reconnaissance mission or if was \nintended to be used in an attack.  However, at least one Israeli lawmaker speculated that the Iran and Lebanon-\nbased Hezbollah might be linked with the incident.  Miri Regev,  a member of parliament, said via Twitter that it was \nan \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah.\"  Of course, it should be noted that Israeli defense officials offered no \nsuch confirmation about either an Iranian or Hezbollah connection to the drone. Nevertheless, Israeli Defense \nMinister Ehud Barak said his country was taking the incident seriously and pondering  the possibility of retaliatory \naction. In a statement, Barak said: \"We view with great severity the attempt to compromise Israeli air space and will \nconsider our response in due course.\"\n\nIt should be noted that on Oct. 11, 2012, Hezbollah's leader,  Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, admitted on  the al-Manar \ntelevision network that the drone was manufactured  in Iran, assembled in Lebanon, and had been flown over what \nit characterized  as \"sensitive sites\" in Israel.  Observers surmised that the term \"sensitive sites\" might be a \nreference to Israel's Dimona nuclear reactor. Nasrallah said: \"A sophisticated reconnaissance aircraft was sent \nfrom Lebanese territory... and traveled hundreds of kilometers over the sea before crossing enemy lines and into \noccupied Palestine.\"  He  warned that further such expeditions were in the offing; to this end, he said: \"Possession \nof such an aerial capacity is a first in the history of any resistance movement in Lebanon and the region.\"  He \ncontinued with a clear reference to the drone Hezbollah used in its 2006 war against Israel as follows: \"It's not the \nfirst time and it will not be the last. We can reach all the zones.\"\n\n\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nConflict in Gaza after killing of Hamas militant, rocket attacks on Israel, and air strikes on Gaza City; ceasefire \nagreement brokered by Egypt and United States\n\nGaza -- the stronghold of Hamas -- was the epicenter of an unfolding confrontation between Israel and the militant \nIslamic Palestinian entity in mid-November 2012. In the first days of the emerging conflict, fatalities and casualties \nwere reported on both sides.\n\nLeading up to the conflict, the border area between Israel and Gaza was hardly the picture of stability. Indeed, at \nthe start of the second week of November 2012, members of the Israeli military patrolling close to the border were \nhit by an anti-tank missile fired from inside the Gaza Strip. That incident left three soldiers were seriously injured. \nIsraei tanks retaliated by firing into Gaza, killing four Palestinians. At that point, Palestinian militants lobbed rockets \ninto Israel while Israeli air strikes targeted a rocket crew in Gaza.\n\nThat being said, the emerging conflict was believed to have been sparked when the head of the military wing of \nHamas, Ahmed Said Khalil al-Jabari, died as a result of Israeli air and naval strikes on the Gaza Strip. As reported \nby international media, Lietenant Colonel Avital Leibovich -- the spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) -\n- noted that Jabari had \"a lot of blood on his hands.\" Presumably in response to this act of targeted terrorist \nelimination by the Israeli authorities, a relentless wave of rocket attacks were fired from Gaza into Israel. There \nwere also reports from the international media that residents of Gaza were urging Hamas to enact some form of \nretaliation, with chants of \"We want you to hit Tel Aviv tonight\" reported to have been heard outside the hospital \nhousing Jabari's body.\n\nThe cycle of violence escalated when the Israeli military launch a massive offensive operation against militant \nHamas targets in Gaza. Prior to this operation, Israeli authorities dropped leaflets into Gaza informing civilians of \nthe impending strikes and warning Hamas leaders that elimination would be imminent \"if they raised their heads \nabove ground.\" With further extremist militants killed in the ensuing air strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu asserted in a national broadcast that his government was willing to widen the scope of its operation in \nGaza, explaining, \"Today we sent a clear message to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\" He continued, \"And \nif there is a need, the Israeli Defense Forces are prepared to widen the operation. We will continue to do everything \nto defend our citizens.\"\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama reportedly shared a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu in which he affirmed Israel's right to defend itself, while advocating the protection of civilians. \nMeanwhile, the new leadership of Egypt condemned the strikes by Israel, summoned the Israeli ambassador to \nCairo for consultations, and called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League. It \nshould be noted that an emergency \"closed door session\" of the United Nations Security Council was soon held, at \nthe request of Egypt, to discuss the situation unfolding between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It should also be noted \nthat United States President Obama and Egyptian President Morsi were able to find common ground on the vital \nneed to calm the tensions and stabilize the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nEgypt's reaction was being closely watched with attention focused on the fate of the prevailing bilateral peace \nagreement between Egypt and Israel. Whereas the former Mubarak regime shared Israel's anti-terrorism goals and \nplaced a priority on the peace agreement, there was no clear sign that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who \nhad political roots within the Muslim Brotherhood, intended on continuing along that path.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government showed concern for the fate of the people in Gaza who were under constant \nbombardment from Israeli strikes, with a rising death toll as a result, the fact was that civilians in Israel were also \n\n\n\nsuffering from a ceaseless volley of rockets emanating from Gaza. Indeed, Israelis died in the southern town of \nKiryat Malachi as a result of rocket fire.\n\nOf note was the fact that a day after the conflict broke out, rocket fire reportedly hit the area around Israel's largest \ncity, Tel Aviv. This would mark the first time since the 1991 Gulf war that missiles landed in the Israeli city.\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2012, the Twitter feed for the Israeli military noted that Israel's \"Iron Dome\" missile defense system \nwas successfully intercepting most of the rocket attacks, although some did manage to get through. In addition to \nrockets landing in the suburbs around Tel Aviv, there were other hits in Beersheba and Rishon Lezion.\n\nThere was no sense that Hamas would let up its own efforts against Israel. In fact, a Hamas spokesman, Abu \nZuhri, was on the record saying, \"Israel will regret the moment they even thought of doing this.\" That being said, \naccording to Agence France Presse, it was the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, the Quds Brigade, who claimed \nresponsibility for firing Iranian-built rockets at Tel Aviv. A day later on Nov. 16, 2012, there were reports of rocket \nattacks by militants in Gaza on the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\nThe rocket launch on Jerusalem was actually claimed by Hamas, according to BBC News. Hamas said that it had \nhoped to hit the Israeli parliament, but the missile landed harmless outside the city in Gush Etzion, effectively \nthwarting the militant extremist Islamic group's plans to strike at the heart of Israel. It was the first time since 1970 \nthat a rocket had been fired at the holy city and marked a significant escalation in the conflict. Meanwhile, rocket \nattacks on Tel Aviv continued with the Israeli government noting that up to 600 missiles had been fired at Israel in \nonly a three-day period.\n\nThe ongoing rocket attacks emanating from Gaza raised questions about the success of the Israeli offensive \noperation in the Gaza Strip. While the Israeli military was claiming that it had seriously undermined Hamas's long-\nrange missile capabilities and underground weapons storage facilities, it was apparent that rocket fire (possibly \ninitiated by the Quds Brigade if not Hamas) was still reaching Israeli terrain, and in some cases, areas close to \nmajor metropolitan areas. Given this capability, questions were rising about the utility of Israel's offensive against \nHamas in Gaza, especially the timing just months ahead of snap elections in which hard-line Prime Minister \nNetanyahu hoped to secure a clear parliamentary majority.\n\nMark Toner, a spokesperson for the United States Department of State reiterated the call made by the Obama \nadministration to \"encourage Israel to continue to take every effort to avoid civilian casualties.\" However, Toner \nalso issued a rebuke of Hamas saying, \"Hamas claims to have the best interests of the Palestinian people at heart, \nyet it continues to engage in violence that is counterproductive to the Palestinian cause.\"\n\nThe governments of the United Kingdom and Germany appeared to echo this rebuke of Hamas as both countries \ncalled for an end to the violence while simultaneously placing most of the blame for the escalating conflict at the \ndoor of the militant extremist Islamic group. Egyptian President Morsi took a different approach and dispatched \nPrime Minister Hisham Qandil to the Gaza Strip in an apparent show of solidarity. He said, \"Egypt will not leave \nGaza on its own, and what is happening is a blatant aggression against humanity.\"\n\nFor its part, actions in Israel indicated that the government of that country intended to continue its mission against \nHamas in Gaza. After rockets struck the suburbs of Tel Aviv and were fired at Jerusalem, Prime Minister Netanyahu \nconvened a cabinet meeting. There, members of his cabinet were called on to support the move to call-up as many \nas 75,000 reservists, possibly in anticipation of a ground operation. This theory was bolstered by the fact that \n\n\n\nthoroughfares leading to the Gaza Strip and bordering the territory were cordoned off from civilian traffic. Heavy \nweaponry, including tanks, were identified in the area close to Gaza.\n\nIt should be noted that these measures could just as easily be interpreted as psychological tactics against the \nPalestinian extremist organization in Gaza. But there was no sign that such tactics would have an effect on Hamas \nas its spokesperson, Sami Abu Zuhri said, \"The Israelis should be aware of the grave results of such a raid and \nthey should bring their body bags.\"\n\nBy Nov. 17, 2012, Israel had launched air strikes on key Hamas interests, facilities, and particular militants. \nSpecifically, Israeli strikes hit the headquarters of the Hamas leadership, as well as the office of Prime Minister \nIsmail Haniya in Gaza. Also hit was the home of a Hamas leader in Jabaliya to the north of Gaza City. Israeli strikes \nincluded successful targeting of three members of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades -- one of Hamas' military \nwings. Meanwhile, sirens were going off in Tel Aviv as Palestinian militants lobbed rockets at the city, which were \nintercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. As well, rocket fire resulted in injuries to victims in the Israeli \ntowns of Ashkelon and Ofakim.\n\nIt should be noted that almost a week after the conflict broke out more than 150 people had died as a result of \nhostilities between the two sides. Of note was the fact that an Israeli strike intended to target a Hamas official \nlanded on a home in Gaza, killing at least ten people. Women and children were among the victims. Palestinian \nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of carrying out \"massacres\" while Egyptian President Morsi \ncharacterized Israel's air strikes as \"blatant aggression against humanity.\" It should, however, be noted that Hamas \nhas made a point of hiding rocket launchers and militants themselves in civilian neighborhoods. Israel has argued \nthat this tactic is akin to using women and children as human shields.\n\nBy Nov. 20, 2012, efforts were underway to try to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with help from \nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on behalf of the Obama administration, and Egyptian President \nMorsi. The United States top diplomat flew from Cambodia, where she was accompanying President Obama on a \nlandmark trip to east Asia, to Israel for talks with the Netanyahu government. From there, she went onto Egypt to \nshare talks with President Morsi.\n\nThe diplomatic efforts were taking place amidst a climate of ongoing violence as Israel continued its bombardment \nof Gaza, and as Hamas militants continued to hurl rockets at Israel. The diplomatic efforts were certainly not helped \nby an attack on a bus in Tel Aviv in the early hours of Nov. 21, 2012. Three people were injured as a result of this \nbus bombing incident, which was not immediately attributed to a particular group. That being said, Hamas praised \nthe attack. Speaking on MSNBC, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, noted that while his \ncountry laments the loss of Palestinian lives in the conflict, Hamas praises attacks on Israel.\n\nLater on Nov. 21, 2012, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was finally forged and made official. The ceasefire \nagreement was announced jointly by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister \nKamel Amr. Under the agreement, Israel would halt its operation on Gaza \"by land, sea and air, and including \nincursions and targeting of individuals,\" while Hamas would stop attacks \"from Gaza against Israel, including rocket \nattacks and attacks along the border.\" Addressing the deal, Secretary Clinton said, \"Now we have to focus on \nreaching a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security, dignity and legitimate \naspirations of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\"\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas were claiming advantage rhetorically as a result of the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu said he agreeing to the United States' call \"to give a chance to Egypt's proposal for a ceasefire,\" while \nsimultaneously making it clear that Israel was prepared \"to apply greater force,\" if the need arose. Meanwhile, a \nHamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, expressed thanks for the effort by Egypt in negotiating a truce while claiming that \nIsrael's offensive had \"failed.\" Irrespective of such posturing, the ceasefire truce, if enforced, would bring an end to \nthe violence for the time being. It was to be seen if the agreement to end the violence would hold.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the ceasefire deal was illustrative of the new negotiating regime on the matter of Middle East peace \nand stability. The collaboration between the United States and Egypt on the matter of stabilizing the scene between \nIsrael and Hamas intimated the start of a constructive diplomatic partnership between the two countries in the \naftermath of the Nile Revolution, which swept the Mubarak regime from power. Despite anxieties about Egypt's \norientation towards Israel, it was apparent that, at least in this instance, Egypt was moving on a compatible path \nwith the United States, even if the new Morsi regime might be more connected to the Palestinian people, in much \nthe same way as the Obama administration has expressed stalwart support for Israel.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nThe Palestinian territory of Gaza Strip has long been a stronghold of the extremist militant Islamic group, Hamas. \nBy contrast, the Palestinian territory of the West Bank has been under the control of the Palestinian Authority, led \nby President Mahmoud Abbas. Whereas Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and is regarded as a \nterrorist entity by international powers, the Palestinian Authority recognizes Israel as a legitimate entity and, in the \npast, has supported the peace process, with an eye on a two-state solution, ending with an independent Palestine \nliving peacefully alongside Israel. With the peace process stalled in recent years, the Palestinian Authority has \npursued statehood at the United Nations -- a process unlikely to end favorably, given the United States' veto power \nat the United Nations Security Council and that country's advocacy of a negotiated settlement involving \nconcurrence by both Israel and the Palestinians. That being said, the international community has tended to \nrecognize the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people in their pursuit of \nindependence and sovereignty. The aspirations of Palestinians in the West Bank, under the leadership of President \nAbbas and the Palestinian Authority, has been distinguished from Hamas-controlled Gaza. There, extremism and a \ntolerance for the use of terrorism has created a challenge for regional stability. Of course, it should be noted that the \nPalestinian Authority has remained largely sidelined in these negotiations of November 2012, thus suggesting the \nlimited political influence of Palestinian President Abbas.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly grants Palestinians non-member observer state status\n\nSummary\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly has granted Palestinians non-member observer state status at the \ninternational body. This development at the close of November 2012 came more than a year after Palestinian  \nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas began the process of seeking full membership for a Palestinian state within \nthe United Nations. At issue was the Palestinian desire to achieve the United Nations' recognition of a Palestinian \nstate in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.  Abbas has said that full status and recognition at the \nUnited Nations was a legitimate right for the Palestinian people.\n\nOf course, this unilateral move was opposed by Israel.  Indeed, Israel has cast the Palestinians' bid for full United \nNations membership as divisive and unlikely to help the peace process, which aims to achieve a two-state solution \nwith an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living side by side  in peace and security. For its part, the \nUnited States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return to the peace process and the negotiating table as \nthe only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  The United States also warned Palestinians that it \nwould use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to quell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for \nrecognition.  But before reaching the United Nations Security Council, the Palestinians were hoping to augment \ntheir sovereign aspirations with an affirmative vote in the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\nThe path towards international recognition was helped when the  Palestinians were granted  membership in the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in October 2011.  Then, more than a \nyear later in late November 2012, the Palestinians won a favorable vote overwhelmingly in the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly, which granted them  non-member observer state status.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas characterized the vote in the United Nations General Assembly as the \"last \nchance to save the two-state solution\" with Israel. Of course, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu cast the vote as \nbeing at cross-purposes with the peace process leading to that very two-state solution.  Meanwhile, many \ngeopolitical analysts have warned that the unilateral bid for recognition at the United Nations by the Palestinians \nwould open the metaphoric \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions, with countries in the global community forced to \ntake sides. That being said, the vast majority of the United Nations General Assembly voted on Nov. 29, 2012, to \nupgrade the Palestinians to non-member observer state status.\n\nNote:  See below for a chronology of the details ensconced in this process to date.\n\nThe Scene Ahead of the Palestinians' Bid for Statehood --\n\nIn August 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said he was prepared to discuss a peace plan with the \nPalestinians, based on United States President Obama's borders proposition.  Netanyahu's announcement to \nMiddle East power brokers appeared aimed at reinvigorating stalled peace talks.  Months earlier in May 2011, \nPrime Minister Netanyahu excoriated President Obama for advancing a plan that called for pre-1967 boundaries as \na basis for two-state solution in Middle East.  Then, in August 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu appeared to be \naccepting the pre-1967 borders as a starting point for discussions, although the prime minister's office refused to \nadmit that it was reversing its earlier-stated objections to the terms put forth by President Obama.  Prime Minister \nNetanyahu's office said that any peace agreement would be contingent upon the recognition of Israel as a Jewish \nstate -- a stance that has not found acceptance among Palestinian quarters.\n\nIt should also be noted that amid these moves by Israel was the impending decision by the Palestinian Authority to \npresent its application for international recognition of statehood to the United Nations in September 2011.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has made the claim that it does not wish to wait for independence via peace negotiations \nwith Israel, thus the thrust to vitiate the peace process.  However, with the United States -- an ally of Israel on the \nUnited Nations Security Council -- it was inevitable that the Palestinian Authority's unilateral declaration of \nindependence would be subject to veto.  United States President Barack Obama had already warned of such an \noutcome months earlier when he re-introduced the aforementioned terms of the peace process.  Nonetheless, the \nPalestinian Authority was hoping that affirmative votes at the United Nations (United States excluded) would \nstrengthen its hand in trying to achieve independence.\n\nAt the start of September 2011, in a last-ditch effort to avert a diplomatic showdown at the United Nations, the \nObama administration in the United States circulated a proposal aimed at restarting peace talks.  The proposal \nincluded a provision for the Palestinians to abandon the membership and recognition vote in the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly, which was expected to take place on Sept. 20, 2011.\n\nAs Israel's closest ally, the United States had been hoping to shift the momentum, while realizing that it could not \neasily  coalesce enough support from individuals countries to block ratification of the Palestinians' aspirations at the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. Accordingly, it had advanced the aforementioned proposal aimed at restarting \nthe peace process. Clearly, the United States was hoping to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to the table, in \norder to traverse the course of the peace process.  The United States was also hoping that by providing an an \n\n\n\nalternate pathway (i.e. distinct from the unilateral and inevitably controversial membership and recognition vote in \nthe United Nations), several individual countries would opt to support the peace process option at a vote in the \nGeneral Assembly.\n\nAs noted above, the Palestinians were hoping to bypass the peace process, and if not outright achieve \nindependence via a vote at the United Nations, at least garner significant political power for the cause. Should the \nPalestinians ultimately decide to pursue this path at the United Nations, the United States warned the Palestinians \nthat it would use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to quell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for \nrecognition.\n\nPalestinians Bid for full United Nations membership --\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would seek full membership for a \nPalestinian state at the anticipated meeting of the United Nations in New York, set to take place within days.  As of \n2011, Palestinians hoed permanent observer status at the United Nations and were represented by the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO).  This move to pursue full membership could  be understood as the desire to seek an \nupgrade in status, of sorts.\n\nAbbas, who spoke from the Palestinian Authority headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said that full \nstatus and recognition at the United Nations was a legitimate right for the Palestinian people, and that this cause \nwould be taken up at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nNote that this strategy involved a modest shift from the initial plan to pursue ratification at the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. Now, Abbas was opting to seek  full membership at the United Nations Security Council. \nSpeaking of this impending effort, Abbas said: \"We are going to the United Nations to request our legitimate right, \nobtaining full membership for Palestine in this organization.\" He added, \"We take with us all the suffering and hope \nof our people to achieve this objective.\"  Abbas also noted that more than 100 countries already recognized \nPalestine as a state and that the patience of the Palestinians people had been exhausted.\n\nIt should be noted that while Abbas was speaking on behalf of the collective Palestinian people, the extremist \nmilitant  Islamist entity, Hamas, which controls Gaza, was not on board with the decision of the Palestinian Authority \npresident.  Instead, Hamas has said that the venture into the United Nation was a \"risky\" endeavor.  Of course, \nHamas has never endorsed the notion of a two-state solution since it does not recognize the right of existence for \nthe Jewish state of Israel.\n\nThe unilateral measure by the Palestinians for statehood and United Nations membership has been strenuously \nopposed by Israel, which has cast the move as both  divisive and provocative.  Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister \nDanny Ayalon observed in dire terms, \"A unilateral declaration by the Palestinians of independence or any UN \ndecision will actually be a vote for friction and conflict over co-operation and reconciliation and I think that would be \ndeplorable for many years.\"\n\nIsrael has further said it would undermine the peace process, which aims to achieve a two-state solution, \ncharacterized by an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living in peace and security beside one \nanother.  Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev declined to offer an official response to Abbas' speech.  \nThat being said, Regev warned that the Palestinians' move would deleteriously affect the prospects for peace; he \nalso emphasized that the two state solution would only be reached via direct negotiations in Ramallah and \nJerusalem, rather that through the United Nations.\n\n\n\nIsrael has additionally accused the Palestinians of attempting to undermine its legitimacy in pursuing this path at \nthe United Nations. In response, Abbas struck a somewhat more diplomatic tone, saying, \"We are not heading \nthere to de-legitimize Israel, no one can do this, it is a state with full membership at the UN. We want to de-\nlegitimize the Israeli occupation and its measures on our territories.\"  This stated objective  notwithstanding, in fact,  \nthe vote would do nothing to end Israeli jurisdiction in certain spheres of control over the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nFor its part, the United States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return to the peace process and the \nnegotiating table as the only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  While the United States was not \nkeen to go down the path of halting the independence aspirations of the Palestinian people at a time of instability in \nthe wider Middle East region,  it was, nonetheless, maintaining its veto threat.  Indeed, the Obama administration \nhas made it very clear that if the Palestinians went through with their pursuit of full recognition and membership \nvote, the United States intended to wield its veto power at the United Nation Security Council.  A veto by the United \nStates would effectively render the membership and recognition aspirations of the Palestinians  null and void.\n\nStriking a diplomatic course, then-French President  Nicolas Sarkozy was calling for a  compromise in the form of \nenhanced status (as a non-member state) for the Palestinians at the General Assembly, with a timetable for \nnegotiations on the road to a definitive agreement.\n\nThe French leader was anxious to see a showdown at the Security Council averted.  But it seemed that this \ncompromise found little resonance among the Palestinian leadership.  Indeed, Palestinian Authority President \nAbbas asserted that he was pressing forward.\n\nLeaving no doubt of his course  of action to be undertaken, President Obama reportedly told Abbason Sept. 22, \n2011, that he would veto his bid for United Nations membership.  In an address to the United Nations, President \nObama reiterated the United States' stance, emphasizing that a sovereign Palestinian state could only be achieved \nthrough direct negotiations with Israel.  He said,  of the road to achieving the two-state solution: \"There is no short \ncut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Netanyahu  government in Israel  -- not exactly an entity that has enjoyed warm relations with \nthe Obama White House -- was praising President Obama for his country's stalwart support.  President Netanyahu \ndeclared that the American president deserved a \"badge of honor\" for his defense of Israel.  Indeed, Israel's \nfriends and allies on this subject were limited in the context of the global community.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Abbas was apparently crafting his written application, which would be submitted \nto Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Sept. 23, 2011.  Pending approval by the Ban Ki-moon, the application would \nthen be taken up by the Security Council and would require nine affirmative votes of the 15 members, and no \nvetoes, to pass.  Of course, with a guaranteed veto by the United States in the offing, the application was on the \nroad to nowhere.  That being said, the Palestinians were hoping to augment their sovereign aspirations with an \naffirmative vote in the United Nations General Assembly.  To that end, Palestinians were claiming imminent victory, \nas they noted that they had successfully brought the matter of Palestinian independence onto the forefront of the \ninternational agenda.\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Abbas formally requested full United Nations membership as a \npath toward statehood.  Abbas conveyed the written request to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthen  delivered a speech to the annual gathering of the General Assembly.  Following protocol, United Nations \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon then passed on Abbas' request to the Security Council.  A vote on the matter was \nnot expected to happen in the immediate future.\n\nPalestinian granted UNESCO membership --\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2011, the  Palestinians were granted  membership in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO).  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded on Nov. 3, 2011, by \nfreezing  Israeli funding to UNESCO.  Netanyahu argued, \"Such moves do not advance peace, but rather push it \nfurther away.\" Nevertheless, this development  strengthened the Palestinians' public relations hand in their thrust \nfor international recognition.\n\nPalestinians granted upgraded non-member observer state status  --\n\nMore than a year later on Nov. 29, 2012, the Palestinians won a favorable vote overwhelmingly in the United \nNations General Assembly when they were granted non-member observer state status by the international body.  \nAt issue was the Palestinian desire to achieve the United Nations' recognition of a Palestinian state in the West \nBank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.\n\nThe vote outcome was not close.  The United Nations General Assembly voted 138-9 in favor of non-member \nobserver state status for the Palestinians, with 41 nation states abstaining from the vote.  The United States was, as \nexpected, among the nine countries voting against the measure; Canada, the Czech Republic and Panama were \nalso among this group. France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland,  Sweden, and Japan  were among the countries \nvoting in favor of the measure. Germany,  the United Kingdom, and Australia were among the 41 countries \nabstaining from the vote. The result was met with great celebration in the streets of Ramallah -- the major city in the \nWest Bank.\n\nWhile the vote outcome was expected, it was nonetheless a sharp blow to Israel, which has opposed such \nmeasures as discussed above. It was also opposed by the United States, which has argued that a sovereign \nPalestinian state should emerge from bilateral negotiations, as set forth under the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, which \nestablished the Palestinian Authority.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas characterized the vote in the United Nations General Assembly as the \"last \nchance to save the two-state solution\" with Israel.  On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu cast the \nvote as being at cross-purposes with the peace process leading to that very two-state solution.  United States \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton struck a similar tone as she referred to the vote \"unfortunate and counter-\nproductive,\" and noted that it cast more obstacles on the path to peace.  Likewise, Israel's ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, Ron Prosor, said the move did not advance peace; he argued that the vote instead \"pushed it [re: \nthe peace process] backwards.\"  Prosor additionally noted that \"the only way to reach peace is through \nagreements\" and not unilaterally  at the United Nations.  To that end, United States Ambassador to the United \nNations, Susan Rice, called on Israel and the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table for peace talks and \nexpressed misgivings about unilateral actions.\n\nOf course, not all Israeli and Palestinian politicians were in lockstep with the stances of the principal players in this \ndrama.  Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who engaged in intense direct negotiations with Abbas during \nhis tenure in office, said in an interview with  The Daily Beast that he viewed the Palestinian request for recognition \nas \"congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution.\" He continued, \"Therefore, I see no reason to \noppose it.\" Clearly, his view was inconsistent with that of the Netanyahu-led government of Israel.  Meanwhile, the \nmilitant Islamic group, Hamas, which controls Gaza  said that it would now no longer stand in the way of the United \nNations bid for statehood, although it maintained its position of refusing to recognize  the state of Israel.\n\nIt should be noted that the thrust to seek international recognition and statehood at the United Nations General \nAssembly was more of a public relations victory for the Palestinians, rather than a catalyst to actually achieve these \n\n\n\nends.  As discussed above, with the United States poised to exercise its veto at the United Nations Security \nCouncil, the Palestinians' aspirations in the United Nations arena would likely ultimately be blocked.  Still, gaining  \nnon-member observer status would endow the Palestinians with certain advantages, such as stronger footing to \noppose Israel in the realm of international jurisprudence. Moreover, the strong international backing for the \nPalestinians was a clear symbolic victory, and highlighted Israel's isolation on the matter.\n\nBut Israel was not about to back down easily. Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Prosor, drew upon the \nJewish people's lengthy historic claim to Israel as he declared: \"No decision by the UN can break the 4,000-year-\nold bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel.\"\n\nThe timing of the vote was significant as it occurred on the 65th anniversary of the General Assembly vote that \ninitially partitioned the former British Mandate of Palestine into two entities --  one Jewish and the other Arab \u2014- \nthus initiating the birth of the modern Jewish state of Israel. Now, 65 years later, the Palestinians were claiming the \nday as the birth of their state.  As noted by Palestinian President Abbas, \"Sixty-five years ago on this day, the \nUnited Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, which partitioned the land of historic Palestine into two \nstates and became the birth certificate for Israel. The General Assembly is called upon today to issue a birth \ncertificate of the reality of the State of Palestine.\"\n\nGeopolitical analysts have warned that the unilateral bid for recognition at the United Nations by the Palestinians \nwould open the metaphoric \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions, with countries in the global community forced to \ntake sides. That being said, with the vast majority of the United Nations General Assembly voting on Nov. 29, 2012, \nto upgrade the Palestinians to non-member observer state status, that division was clearly asymmetrical.  Still, \nthese moves could well inflame passions in the region of the Middle East, which was already experiencing historic \nupheaval, ever  since the season of unrest began to sweep across the Arab world in the spring of 2011.  In practical \nterms, though, the Middle East peace process between Israel and the Palestinians remained stalled and the \nroadway to a two-state solution was no further along the path of progress as November 2012 came to a close.\n\nNote on Israel's settlement expansion plan --\n\nOnly a day after the landmark vote in the United Nations General Assembly, Israel approved the construction of \n3,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  Israel also accelerated the processing of 1,000 \nplanning permits. At issue was the proposed expansion into the so-called E1 territorial stretch between Jerusalem \nand Ma'ale Adumim.  Expansion into this strategic area would ultimately  hinder the existence of a contiguous \nPalestinian zone, and thus make the creation of a future Palestinian state geographically difficult.  As noted by \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, \"It [the settlement expansion into the E1 territorial stretch] would \nrepresent an almost fatal blow to remaining chances of securing a two-state solution.\"\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States have eschewed the notion of such expansion \nin the past.  Now, in December 2012,  the United States was responding to this settlement expansion news with \ndisapproval.  The Obama White House released a statement in which it cast the settlement expansion plans as \ncounterproductive and warned that these moves would only hinder the peace process.  Several European countries \nalso expressed dismay over the settlement expansion plans, with some of them hinting at diplomatic \nconsequences.\n\nOpposition critics at home in Israel expressed anxiety that the expansion plan would isolate the country in relation \nto the global community. The Netanyahu government, however, appeared undeterred by these criticisms and \nbuoyed by strong domestic support for its moves. Prime Minister Netanyahu declared: \"We will carry on building in \nJerusalem and in all the places that are on the map of Israel's strategic interests.\"\n\n\n\nNote on Hamas leader's \"Jihadist\" declaration --\n\nOn Dec 8, 2012, having returned to Gaza to celebrate Hamas' 25th anniversary, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal \ndeclared to supporters: \"Jihad is the way to liberation.\"  Addressing tens of thousands of Palestinian supporters, \nMeshaal offered little in the way of restraint as he underlined and augmented the militant extremist Islamic entity's \nJihadist orientation saying, \"Resistance is the means not the end ... for 64 years we have tried all other options but \nto no avail ... there is no victory without resistance.\"  He continued, \"Jihad is the way to liberation, along with all \ntypes of national and diplomatic struggle ... there is no value for all those types without resistance.\"\n\nMeshaal referenced the  bid for United Nations' recognition of Palestine as \"a small but important step,\" but took an \nintransigent and confrontational line in declaring, \"Palestine is ours from the river to the sea and from the south to \nthe north. There will be no concession on an inch of the land.\"  Using bellicose language, he reiterated Hamas' \nuncompromising stance of not recognizing Israel as follows: \"We will never recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli \noccupation and therefore there is no legitimacy for Israel, no matter how long it will take.\"\n\nIsrael responded to Meshaal by describing his speech as \"hateful and extremist.\"  Israeli government \nspokesperson,  Mark Regev, noted that Meshaal message clearly \"says no to peace and no to reconciliation, a \nmessage that says every Israeli man, woman and child is a legitimate target.\"  He additionally noted, \"That sort of \nextremism won't help peace, the opposite is true.\"\n\nUpdate (Early 2013):\n\nIn January 2013,  snap parlimentary elections were held in Israel leading to a fairly inconclusive result and a \ncomplicated government formation process.  Please see \"Primer\" below for details.\n\nIn February 2013, Bulgarian officials were placing the blame on Lebanon-based Hezbollah for a  bus bombing that \nkilled five Israelis and a local bus driver, in the Black Sea resort town of Burgas in mid-2012.\n\nThe attack on July 18, 2012, which also resulted in the death of the suspected suicide bomber, occurred at the \nBurgas airport in Bulgaria.  The bombing appeared to target a bus carrying Israeli tourists and ensued on the 18th \nanniversary of a deadly attack on a Jewish community center in Argentina, raising the likelihood that the Bulgaria \nbombing was another instance of anti-Jewish terrorism by extremist elements.\n\nAt the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Iran for the act of terrorism in a \nstatement that read: \"All the signs lead to Iran. Only in the past few months we have seen Iranian attempts to attack \nIsraelis in Thailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other places.\" He additionally promised retaliation, asserting \nin the statement, \"Murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent people. This is an Iranian terror attack that is \nspreading throughout the entire world. Israel will react forcefully to Iranian terror.\" A day later, Israeli Defense \nMinister Ehud Barak expanded on Netanyahu's claim that Iran was behind the act of terrorism, explaining that the \nLebanese Hezbollah was the direct perpetrator of the attack, but had been acting under the aegis  of Iran.  \nNetanyahu himself explained the connection using the following phrase: \"Hezbollah, the long arm of Iran.\"\n\nAnalysts were suggesting that the terror attack in Bulgaria was likely another manifestation of the covert  war \nbetween Israel and Iran.  To that end, there were intimations that the Bulgaria bombing might have been a \nretaliatory attack for the series of targeted strikes against  Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\nFor its part, Iran dismissed the accusation and expressed condemnation for \"all terrorist acts.\"  No statement, \nthough, came from Hezbollah.\n\nBy July 20, 2012, United States officials were suggesting that the suicide bomber on the bus in Bulgaria was a \nmember of Hezbollah.  According to the New York Times,  their sources did not wish to be identified as the \ninvestigation was under way, however, the suicide bomber was in Bulgaria on a mission to attack Israeli interests. \n\n\n\nThe New York Times' unnamed sources also observed that Hezbollah was being guided and sponsored by Iran in \nthis effort. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov was on the record confirming that the suicide bomber had \nbeen \"in country\" for several days prior to the terror attack.\n\nMore than six months later in February 2013, and with an investigation having taken place, Bulgarian officials were \nnow officially saying that there were  \"obvious links\" to Lebanon and Hezbollah.  Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan \nTsvetanov said  that two suspects involved in the Burgas bombing plot  were directly linked to Hezbollah.  He said, \n\"We have established that the two were members of the militant wing of Hezbollah. There is data showing the \nfinancing and connection between Hezbollah and the two suspects.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time re-entering the fray.  He accused Lebanon-based \nHezbollah and Iran of \"waging a global terror campaign across borders and continents\" and called on Europe to \n\"reach the required conclusions regarding  the true nature of Hezbollah.\"  That latter call appeared to reference the \nfact that many European countries have not gone so far as Israel and the United States in classifying  Hezbollah  \nas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn mid-February 2013, the trial of  former Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman  on charges of fraud and \nbreach of trust commenced in Jerusalem. Lieberman was charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with \na long-standing financial scandal in December 2012.  At issue were allegations relating  to Lieberman's suspected \ninvolvement in the promotion of Zeev Ben Aryeh, Israel's former ambassador to Belarus, to a new post in Latvia.\n\nWhile Lieberman was cleared of more serious charges, such as bribery and money laundering, the breach of trust \nissue was not expected to be helpful, emerging as it did only six weeks ahead of the country's parliamentary \nelections, which took place in the first part of 2013 (as discussed below).  Lieberman resigned as foreign minister \non Dec. 14, 2012. At that time, he  said, \"Though I know I committed no crime... I have decided to resign my post as \nforeign minister and deputy prime minister.\"\n\nLieberman's name returned to the headlines at the end of December 2012 when he was formally indicted on the \naforementioned grounds of fraud and breach of trust.\n\nIn February 2013, not only was Lieberman no longer a cabinet minister, he was also in the legal fight of his life.  In \nthe background was the question of his political future.  Although the alliance of Likud and\n\nYisrael Beitenu won the most seats in the elections held on Jan. 22, 2013, they were markedly short of forming a \nworkable majority in parliament.  While Netanyahu was busy trying to cobble together a coalition government, \nLieberman was in court facing trial in mid-February 2013.  Should Lieberman be found guilty and  and sentenced to \nthree months or more in prison, he would be forced to relinquish his parliamentary seat and he would be banned \nfrom government office for seven years.\n\nPrimer on 2013 Parliamentary Elections in Israel\n\nParliamentary elections were set to take place in Israel on Jan. 22, 2013. At stake would be the 120 seats in the \nunicameral \"Knesset\" (Parliament). Members are popularly elected by one district proportional representation to \nserve four-year terms. The main political parties contesting the elections would be Likud, Kadima, Yisrael Beiteinu, \nShas, the Labor Party, SHAS, United Torah Judaism, United Arab List, among others. Details of the election \nlandscape leading up to voting were as follow.\n\nOn Oct. 9, 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that fresh elections would be held for the \n120-member Knesset or parliament. Prime Minister Netanyahu said the general election could be held as early as \n\n\n\nJanuary 2013 -- nine months ahead of schedule. The decision to call fresh elections appeared to have been \nmotivated by an inability to forge an agreement with his coalition partners over the annual budget. Speaking of this \nissue, Netanyahu said, \"At this time, in the face of the turmoil around us, it is my obligation as prime minister to put \nthe national interest above all. Therefore I have decided for the benefit of Israel to hold elections now and as \nquickly as possible.\" To that end, the election date was set for Jan. 22, 2012. The conventional wisdom was that \nNetanyahu's conservative Likud party was positioned to win this forthcoming election. However, as was the case in \nthe previous election of 2009, without an outright parliamentary majority, he would more than likely have to form \nanother coalition government.\n\nNote that on Oct. 25, 2012, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who leads the ruling Likud Party, and Foreign \nMinister Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of Yisrael Beiteinu, agreed that their parties would run on a united list in the \ncountry's forthcoming elections set for Jan. 22, 2013. Clearly, the move was intended to consolidate the right-wing \nfactions of the political spectrum. Speaking of this tactical move, Netanyahu said: \"At this time, Israel needs this \njoining of forces. This union would give us strength to lead Israel for the upcoming years and defend it against the \nexternal threats we're facing from Iran, as well as the internal issues like the cost of living and other socioeconomic \ntopics.\"\n\nThe move was met with some criticism from within Likud. As reported by the Ha'aretz newspaper, a senior \ngovernment official said: \"We're repulsed by this partnership with Lieberman. I don't want to run with a person like \nLieberman and the kind of values he stands for.\" This vociferous comment appeared to reference Lieberman's \nnotoriety as a far right hardliner, illustrated by his advocacy of a loyalty-citizenship bill.\n\nBut Lieberman had his own political problems.  On Dec. 13, 2012, the Israeli foreign minister was charged with \nfraud and breach of trust in connection with a long-standing financial scandal. While he was cleared of more serious \ncharges, such as bribery and money laundering, the breach of trust issue was not expected to be helpful, emerging \nas it did only six weeks ahead of election day.  Although he said that he committed no wrongdoing, Lieberman \nresigned as foreign minister on Dec. 14, 2012.  He said, \"Though I know I committed no crime... I have decided to \nresign my post as foreign minister and deputy prime minister.\"\n\nLieberman  was nonetheless expected to contest the impending election.  Note that at the end of December 2012, \nLieberman was formally indicted on the aforementioned grounds of fraud and breach of trust.\n\nMeanwhile, on Nov. 26, 2012, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, said he would not be contesting the forthcoming \nelections as he intended to retire from politics. The Labor Party would, thus, enter the election contest without Barak \nwho served in the past as  both party leader and as prime minister of Israel.\n\nTwo months ahead of the election in Israel, which was set to be held in January 2013, most polls showed the right-\nwing with the clear lead and headed for victory.  The aforementioned alliance between Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu \nlooked to be paying political dividends at that time.  Divisions within the center-left, and the exit of Barak, appeared \nto be hurting that bloc politically.\n\nBut by mid-December 2012, the election race appeared to have become a closer one, with the gap narrowing \nbetween the two main political wings in the contest for control over the 120-seat Knesset. At the close of December \n2012, polling data showed Likud with the lead in voters' preferences although the ultra-right Habayit Hayeudi \n(\"Jewish Home\") was gaining strength.  The sudden surge towards Habayit Hayeudi came as a result of a \nstatement by party leader Naftali Bennet promising to resist the evacuation of settlements.  Still, it was Likud poised \nto win about 35 seats, with Labor headed to capture 17 seats, and Habayit Hayeudi  set to carry 13 seats, \naccording to a  Dialog Group poll for the Ha'aretz newspaper.\n\n\n\nNote: On the political right, the political parties and blocs contesting the election in January 2013 included the Likud-\nYisrael Beiteinu alliance, the religious Shas party, Jewish House, and United Torah Judaism. For the center-left \nbloc, the parties and blocs contesting the election in January 2013 included the Labour party, Kadima,  the newly-\nestablished  Hatua party of Tzipi Livni, the newly-established Yesh Atid party of Yar Lapid, the left-wing Meretz, and \na number of Arab parties.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2013, Israeli voters went to the polls in droves.  Reports from the ground in Israel suggested high voter \nturnout.  Exit poll data released after the polling station were closed indicated that although Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu's right-wing  Likud-Beitenu alliance had won the most seats, it actually lost support overall.  Indeed, the \nalliance of Likud and\n\nYisrael Beitenu won the most seats in the elections held on Jan. 22, 2013, they were markedly short of forming a \nworkable majority in parliament.\n\nMoreover, the right wing appeared to have ceded political ground to center-left parties.  In first place was Likud-\nBeitenu, which was expected to secure about 31 seats.  In second place after Likud-Beitenu was the center-left  \nYesh Atid (There is a Future) party, led by  journalist-turned-politician Yair Lapid , which was expected to take about \n19 seats. The Labour Party was in third place with 17 seats expected to go its way.  Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish \nHome), which would likely carry about 12 seats.  The religious Shas party was on track to win 11 seats.  Hatua, the \nparty of former Kadima leader, Tzipi Livni, was expected to take six seats.\n\nSince victory for  Netanyahu's alliance was anticipated, the real news from the Israeli election was the shockingly \nstrong performance of a newly-formed party like Yesh Atid. The Labour Party's healthy poll performance was also \nworthy of attention.\n\nThese results also meant that Netanyahu was poised to return as prime minister, although he would likely have to \nform a coalition with another  party to do so.\n\nIf Netanyahu chose to form a right-wing coalition, he would see major challenges from an ascendant center-left \nbloc.  Meanwhile, that theoretical right-wing coaliton could include  Habayit Hayehudi --  a party that  has been \nvocal in its plan to annex significant swaths of the West Bank, while rejecting the notion of a two-state solution to \nthe Israel-Palestinian conflict.  Israel was thusly headed for a highly-polarized political future.  With such a \npossibility in sight, some voices from within Likud were calling for the formation of a broad coalition that might \ninclude the center-left.  Those voices seemed cognizant that entrenchment of the hardline right  would likely  evoke \nthe sharp consternation of most of the international community.\n\nTo these ends, a day after the election, Netanyahu said that he hoped to create a broad-based government.  \"The \nelections are behind us and the challenges are in front of us, including the Iranian nuclear threat, the global \neconomic crisis and striving for a peace with the Palestinians. We would like to join hands with as many partners as \npossible to work and solve those challenges,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIt was yet to be seen if he could achieve the goal of forming a broad coalition government.  On the one hand, Lapid \nof the  Yesh Atid made it clear that he was not interested in political gamesmanship and did not intend to block \nNetanyahu from forming a government.  Lapid indicated that he was also interested in reaching the goal of a broad \ncoalition,  saying, \"The outcome of the election is clear: we must work together.\"  But on the other hand, Lapid was \nhighly emphatic about the priority of the peace process with the Palestinians during the election campaign.  It was \nnot clear that Netanyahu and his party shared that aspiration. Another bone of contention for Lapid was the matter \nof  ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students  deferring their military service.  This was a major issue leading up to \nthe election with religious parties strongly opposed to changing this provision and Lapid's party demanding reform \nof the law. Meanwhile, Labour leader, Shelly Yachimovich, made it clear that she was interested in\n\n\n\nforming a center-left governing coalition.  But Yachimovich was not expected to have that opportunity since the  \nleader of the largest party in parliament is usually asked by the president to form a government.\n\nThe government formation process was  to go on for about one month.  But as discussed here, Netanyahu was not \nhaving success in forging a coalition easily.  Although President Shimon Peres originally said that he hoped the new \ngovernment could be quickly formed in the interests of Israel's economic and political stability, more time was \nneeded to form a coalition.  Accordingly, President Peres  granted  Netanyahu a two-week extension to the \ngovernment formation process.\n\nBut it was difficult to determine if that two week extension would yield results, and create a softening stance from \nother parties  since Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming the other parties for his failure to form a new coalition \ngovernment. In an interview with Israeli media, Netanyahu said, \"The reason there is no coalition so far is because \nthere are boycotts of an entire public in the State of Israel and that does not match my views.\"\n\nLapid, leader of the Yesh Atid (There is a Future), wrote on his Facebook page that he did not see how his party \ncould find resolution with religious parties, stating: \"I do not believe that Shas and UTJ (United Torah Judaism)  can \nsit in a government that will make the changes for which we went to elections.\"  His statement was a direct \nreference to the election results, which showed Israelis wanting equal treatment on the matter of the military draft, \nand irrespective of the religious ideology of ultra-orthodox Jewish factions.  Naftali Bennet of the Bayit Yehudi \n(Jewish Home) was more vociferous in his stance, stating on his Facebook page: \"The message from was simple: \nat no price will religious Zionism be in the government. Forget about it.\"\n\nThe passionate declarations from these three players aside, by mid-March 2013, a coalition government had been \nformed.  To this end, Netanyahu said: \"We have kept the government in our hands.\" The new government would \ninclude Netanyahu's Likud-Yisrael Beitenu party list, Lapid's Yesh Atid, Livni's Hatnua, and Bennet's Jewish Home.  \nIt would be the first time in years that Israel would be led by a government that did not include ulta-orthodox Jewish \nparties.  Left out of the alliance were the ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, as well as left-\nwing Labour, which made it clear it would not join a government with Netanyahu.  Also out of government would be \nKadima  and the Arab parties.\n\nThe inclusion of Yesh Atid, Hatnua, and  Jewish Home indicated a collision course of sorts between Lapid and \nLivni, who favored a return to the peace process with the Palestinians, and Bennet, who championed a nationalist \nand pro-settler cause.  Nevertheless, Netanyahu would return as prime minister, while also holding the foreign \nministry portfolio since  Avigdor Lieberman (the former foreign minister and co-leader of the Likud-Beitenu party list) \nwas busy facing legal charges of fraud and breach of trust.  Lapid would become finance minister while  Bennett \nwould become the minister of trade and industry. Livni would be justice minister and chief negotiator in talks with \nthe Palestinians.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe new government of Israel would take charge in Israel just ahead of a visit by United States President Barack \nObama.\n\nThe  first official visit to Israel of  a sitting American head of state occurred as the issue of Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment program was dominating the international geopolitical landscape.  For some time, Israel has \nthreatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear facilities, in the interests of national security.  Indeed, Iran does not \nrecognize the Jewish state of Israel and has issued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to \"wipe Israel off the \nmap,\" essentially posing an existential threat to the Jewish State.\n\n\n\nWhile the United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in \nasserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear \nweapon.\n\nAhead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to \nproduce a nuclear weapon.  In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israeli, he said that Iran was \"over a year or \nso\" away from being able to develop a nuclear weapon.  Still, President Obama said that he was not interested in \nleaving action against Iran for the last moment.  He said, \"We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to \nactually develop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close.\" Describing the purpose of his \nmeeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, \"My message  \nwill be the same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to \nkeep all options on the table.\"  The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear \nfacilities, saying, \"When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States \nobviously has significant capabilities.\"\n\nSee \"Special Entry\" below for further details related to the Iranian nuclear issue and President Obama's 2013 visit \nto Israel.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nUnited States President Obama emphasizes bond with Israel in first official state visit as president\n\nOn March 20, 2013, United States President Barack Obama traveled to Israel in his first official state visit as \npresident. The trip would offer an opportunity for the American president to improve frosty personal ties with Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, rather than operate as a policy catalyst of any sort. The White House in the \nUnited States indicated that meetings between Obama and Netanyahu were not likely to focus on the peace \nprocess with Palestinians, since the movement on that track was expected to be slow. Instead, the focus would be \non the matter of Iran's nuclear aspirations and the priority to prevent that country, which poses a threat to Israel, \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. The war in Syria was also likely to be addressed during bilateral meetings. But \nthe essential purpose for the trip appeared to be oriented towards recalibrating the relationship between the two \nleaders.\n\nIn 2013, the political landscape was quite different from the scenario of the last few years, and the political \ndynamics for the two men had certainly changed. Whereas United States President Obama had been decisively re-\nelected to power in November 2012 and inaugurated for a second term in January 2013, Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu had emerged from his country's elections as the weakened leader presiding over a precarious coalition. \nNow, with both men having to deal with one another and with the geopoitical stakes in the ever-more volatile Middle \nEast higher than ever, it appeared that the time was right for a \"re-setting\" of the relationship between the two men \nand an affirmation of bilateral ties.\n\nPresident Obama arrived in Israel for this highly-anticipated visit on March 20, 2013. As the president disembarked \nfrom Air Force One onto the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport, he was personally greeted by both Israeli \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres.\n\nPresident Obama affirmed the United States' long-standing and unbreakable bond with Israel saying, \"Just as we \nhave for these past 65 years, the United States is proud to stand with you as your strongest ally and your greatest \nfriend.\" Emphasizing the bilateral bond between the two countries, President Obama characterized his visit to Israel \nas \"an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our nations, to restate America's unwavering \n\n\n\ncommitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.\" He continued \nby noting that the United States' interests intersected with those of Israel, saying, \"It's in our fundamental security \ninterest to stand with Israel.\" There was a moment of levity when President Obama said to Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Peres, \"It's a lovely day. Great to see you, great to be here ... It's good to get away from \nCongress.\"\n\nDuring a joint press conference, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made a clear departure from the challenging tone \ntaken with President Obama in previous venues of this sort. In one infamous case, Netanyahu stood next to Obama \nduring a news conference and lectured the leader of the free world on Israel's unique security challenges. This \ntime, Netanyahu's attitude towards Obama was significantly more conciliatory, and even marked by amity. Indeed, \nPrime Minister Netanyahu offered a heartfelt welcome to the American president, saying, \"I come here today with a \nsimple message. Thank you.\" He continued, \"Baruch haba ley Israel \u2014 welcome to Israel. The people of Israel are \nhonored to have you visit.\" Netanyahu further thanked President Obama for the United States' support for the \nJewish state of Israel saying, \"Thank you for standing by Israel at this time of historic change in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe trip was not purely focused on improved personal relations between the two heads of government, The serious \nchallenge of a nuclearized Iran was also on the table for discussion. Indeed, even before President Obama's trip to \nIsrael, the issue of Iran's nuclear development program has loomed large. It should be noted that Iran does not \nrecognize the Jewish state of Israel and has issued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to \"wipe Israel off the \nmap,\" essentially posing an existential threat to the Jewish State. With such threats prevailing and with the prospect \nof a nuclear-armed Iran on the horizon, Israel has threatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear facilities. While \nthe United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in \nasserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear \nweapon.\n\nAhead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to \nproduce a nuclear weapon. In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israel, he said that Iran was \"over a year or so\" \naway from being able to develop a nuclear weapon. Still, President Obama said he was not interested in leaving \naction against Iran for the last moment. He said, \"We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually \ndevelop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close.\" Describing the purpose of his meeting \nwith Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, \"My message will be \nthe same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to keep all \noptions on the table.\" The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, \nsaying, \"When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States obviously \nhas significant capabilities.\"\n\nOnce \"in country\" in Israel, President Obama confirmed his stance on Iran, asserting the United States' resolve to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu underlined the United States \npresident's commitment on this issue, saying he was \"absolutely convinced that the president [Obama] is \ndetermined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a significant development, Netanyahu acknowledged that Obama's stated one year timeline on Iran's nuclear \nweapons development capacity was correct, although he noted that his [Netanyahu's] so-called \"red line\" involved \nthe uranium enrichment aspect of weaponization and not the actual building of a nuclear weapon. Of course, both \nuranium enrichment and the manufacture of a bomb would be involved in nuclear weapons development. \nAccordingly, it seemed that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu were respectively offering a sense of \nunanimity on the issue of Iran and its nuclear development program. Indeed, as noted by President Obama himself, \nthere was \"not a lot of daylight\" between American and Israeli assessments on the stage of Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment program, although he added that there was \"time to resolve this diplomatically.\"\n\n\n\nNetanyahu reserved the right to take unilateral action against Iran saying that he was certain Obama appreciated \nthe fact that Israel \"can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends.\" He \ncontinued, \"Today we have both the right and the capability to defend ourselves.\" For his part, President Obama \noffered concurrence on this point, saying \"Each country has to make its own decisions when it comes to the \nawesome decision to engage in any kind of military action. And Israel is differently situated than the United States.\"\n\nPresident Obama also expressed hopes that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process might be revitalized. Although \nPresident Obama was scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinians in the West Bank \nand Gaza appeared to have no enthusiasm for the American president. The previously-hopeful attitude of \nPalestinians towards Obama was now replaced with jaded resentment, presumably due to the United States' \nopposition to the Palestinians' unilateral bid for statehood at the United Nations and the lack of active participation \nby the Obama administration on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\n\nConversely, President Obama -- who arrived in Israel in 2013 without great support from the Israeli people -- was \nnow experiencing the benefits of thawing relations. The majority of Israelis were not fans of President Obama, \nviewing with suspicion his relentless push for Israel to end its settlement activities in predominantly Palestinian \nareas, as well as his decision not to visit Israel during his 2009 trip to the Middle East when he gave his landmark \npro-democracy speech in Cairo. Now, however, the tide appeared to be turning.\n\nIsraelis watched President Obama's motorcade as it drove through the streets of Jerusalem from the homes and on \ntelevision with interest. News commentators in Israel cast the temperature between Obama and Netanyahu as \ngenuinely warmer. If the news commentators in Israel were reflective of national sentiment, Obama's declaration \n\"Tov lihiyot shuv ba'aretz\" -- Hebrew for \"It is good to be back in Israel\" -- resonated very positively with Israelis. \nThe Israeli news commentators also paid particular -- and affirmative -- attention to President Obama's statement \nthat Israel was \"the historic homeland of the Jewish people.\" President Obama said, \"More than 3,000 years ago, \nthe Jewish people lived here, tended the land here, prayed to God here. And after centuries of exile and \npersecution, unparalleled in the history of man, the founding of the Jewish state of Israel, was a rebirth, a \nredemption, unlike any in history. Today, the sons of Abraham and the daughters of Sarah are fulfilling the dream of \nthe ages: to be masters of their own fate in their own sovereign state.\" This fulsome nod to the plight of Jews \nthrough history appeared to reify the essential and historic claim of the Jewish people on the land of Israel.\n\nPresident Obama also earned personal capital in the simple gesture of assisting 89-year old President Peres along \nthe red carpet. As stated by one Israeli commentator, \"Who Remembers Romney Now?\" in a clear reference to the \nfact that Prime Minister Netayahu and many Israelis were hoping for a one-term Obama presidency. Likewise, as \nnoted by Herb Kleinom in the Jerusalem Post, \"He had us at \"Shalom.\"\n\nOn March 21, 2013, as expected, President Obama met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in \nRamallah. There he called on Palestinian leaders to resume peace talks with Israel, regardless of ongoing Israeli \nsettlement building. Obama's arrival in the West Bank was not without political stress. Palestinian extremists \ngreeted the United States leader by firing rockets from Gaza into the Israeli border city of Sderot in violation of a \nprevailing ceasefire agreement.\n\nOn the same day, President Obama delivered a speech to Israeli university students at the International Convention \nCenter in Jerusalem. In that address, he acknowledged the obstacle to resolving the Palestinian issue, but asserted \nthat peace \"is the only path to true security.\" President Obama noted that the path to ensuring Israel remained a \n\n\n\ndemocratic and Jewish state necessitated peace and a two-state solution with Israel existing alongside a future \nPalestinian state.\n\nPresident Obama said, \"Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and \nthrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine.\" He also \noutlined the rights for Palestinians, saying, \"The Palestinian people's right to self-determination and justice must \nalso be recognized.\" On the issue of national security, and given the challenge of global opinion, President Obama \nurged Israel to take on the challenge of peace, saying: \"Given the frustration in the international community, Israel \nmust reverse an undertow of isolation. And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli \npeople is through the absence of war -- because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough, to stop \nevery enemy from inflicting harm.\"\n\nIrrespective of the controversial subject matter, President Obama's address was well-received by the Israeli youth \nwho applauded his passionate call for the cause of peace, gave him a standing ovation in response to his good \nhumored attitude to a heckler, and even expressed support for the notion of a Palestinian state.\n\nA state dinner, hosted by Israeli President Shimon Peres, brought a conclusion to President Obama's first official \nvisit to israel as the American head of state and leader of the free world. There, President Peres awarded Obama \nwith Israel's Presidential Medal of Distinction in recognition of his [Obama's] \"tireless work to make Israel strong, to \nmake peace possible.\" As he bestowed on President Obama Israel's highest honor, President Peres said: \"The \npath to tomorrow may be fraught with obstacles, I believe we can overcome them with our determination and with \nyour commitment.\"\n\nNote: Barack Obama is the first serving United States president to receive the Medal of Distinction from the state of \nIsrael.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nIsrael carries out strikes into Syrian territory to stop transfer of weapons to Hezbollah\n\nOn May 3, 2013,\n\nIsrael carried out an initial air strike into Syrian territory. While Israel was highly reticent about providing any \nconfirmation of its activities, various reports indicated that the first air strike was intended to stop the transfer of \nmissiles from Syria to the militant Islamic group, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which has posed a clear and \naggressive threat to Israel's national security.  Indeed, the Assad regime in Syria along with Lebanon-based \nHezbollah have long been allied with Iran, which has repeatedly voiced the desire for the destruction of the Jewish \nstate of Israel.\n\nTwo days later on  May 5, 2013,  it was reported that Israeli warplanes struck  a military research facility in Syria.  \nThere were some suggestions in the media that the second strike was  aimed at neutralizing or destroying a \ndelivery system for chemical weapons.\n\nHowever, as reported by Reuters News, an Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity made it clear that \nthese air strikes by Israel on Syrian targets were for the singular purpose of stopping the transfer of weapons from \nSyria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.  The official was cited in Reuters as saying: \"There was an air strike. The target was \nnot a chemical weapons facility. It was missiles intended for Hezbollah.\"  A separate report by the New York Times \nappeared to corroborate this view, as anonymous United States officials were reported to have said that the \n\n\n\nweapons targeted included advanced Fateh 110 surface-to-surface missiles from Iran, which were  located in a \nwarehouse at the Damascus International Airport.\n\nThe Netanyahu government in Israel has made it clear that it would use force, if necessary, to prevent weapons \nfrom reaching Hezbollah that could be used against Israel.  Indeed, months earlier in January 2013,  Israel \nreportedly bombed a convoy in Syria, with an eye on preventing the delivery of weapons to Hezbollah.\n\nAt the international level, the Arab League condemned the Israeli air raids, while United Nations Secretary General \nBan Ki-Moon expressed his worry over the situation and urged \"maximum calm and restraint.\"\n\nStill, NBC reporter, Richard Engel, said via Twitter that irrespective of official disapproval over Israel's actions, there \nwere many activists privately applauding the moves.\n\nFor his part, United States President Barack Obama offered little in the way of an admonishment to Israel, saying \ninstead that Israel had the right to protect itself. In an interview with the Spanish-speaking network, Telemundo, he \nsaid:  \"What I have said in the past and I continue to believe is that the Israelis justifiably have to guard against the \ntransfer of advanced weaponry to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. We coordinate closely with the Israelis \nrecognizing they are very close to Syria, they are very close to Lebanon.\"\n\nTo that end -- Israel acting to protect itself from potential threats posed by enemies in the region -- it should be \nnoted that it was unlikely that Syria actually entered Syrian air space when it carried out its strikes. All expectations \nwere that the Israel used \"stand off\" bombs to hit Syria  from a distance.\n\nNot surprisingly, Syria was not at all sanguine in its response to Israeli air strikes.  At first Syria did not even \nacknowledge that any of its interests had been bombed at all. But late in the day on May 5, 2013,  Syria promised \nthat retaliation was in order.  As reported by CNN News, the strike by Israel was being treated by Syria as  \"an act \nof war.\"\n\nTo that end, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad  described the  Israeli air strikes as a \"declaration of \nwar\" and warned of retaliation.  At the same time, Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi declared: \"Syria is a \ncountry that does not accept insults and it doesn't accept humiliation.\"  He further added that the strikes left \"a wide \ndoor for all possible options.\"\n\nProgress on the Middle East peace process?\n\nSince mid-July 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry  has been traveling to the Middle East in another \neffort of \"shuttle diplomacy\" as he attempted to revitalize the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Secretary of State Kerry's peace efforts,  and noted that the \nre-engagement with the Palestinians was of \"vital and strategic interest\" to Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu \nintimated that challenges in the region from Iran and Syria demanded that the Israeli-Palestinian issue be settled for \nthe long run.  He said, \"It is important in itself to try and end the conflict between us and the Palestinians and it is \nimportant in light of the challenges we face from Iran and Syria.\"\n\nAs part of an apparent good faith agreement, Israel announced plans to  release a number of high value \nPalestinian prisoners who had been in  jail for decades.  The actual release of the prisoners would ensue on a \n\n\n\nphased basis. On the other side of the equation,  the Palestinians  committed to participating in \"serious \nnegotiations\" over the course of a  minimum nine-month period.\n\nContentious issues, such as the matter of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, did not appear \nto be part of the immediate agreements.  However, they found their way into the initial discussions anyway.  A \nsenior Palestinian official was reported to have said, \"Our position remains clear: resumption of negotiations should \nbe based on the two-state solution and on the 1967 borders.\" But Israel made clear that it would not be accepting \nthe Palestinians' demands that a future Palestinian state be crafted on the basis of 1967 borders. Israeli Strategic \nAffairs Minister Yuval Steinitz asserted: \"There is no chance that we will agree to enter any negotiations that begin \nwith defining territorial borders or concessions by Israel, nor a construction freeze.\"\n\nAs well, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu promised to subject any future peace deal with the Palestinians to a \nreferendum. He said there was a need for a potential peace deal to be ratified directly by Israelis in order to \n\"prevent a rift among the people.\" He continued, \"Any agreement that is not approved by the people is not worthy of \nbeing signed.\"  That being said, Netanyahu noted that peace was the ultimate objective for his country.  He said, \n\"Achieving peace is a crucial goal for Israel.\"  Critics of Netanyahu said that subjecting such a major policy decision \nto a popular referendum would be akin to tacitly sabotaging the peace process; however, the actual proposition for \na referendum (which was approved by the Israeli cabinet), would relate to a peace deal involving territorial \nconcessions.\n\nSecretary of State Kerry noted that both Israelis and Palestinians had an important foundation for the resumption of \ndirect peace talks after an impasse that had lasted three years. Secretary of State Kerry's peace agenda was also \nsupported by the Arab League, which indicated that it would also be interested in moving forward with some variant \nof its earlier \"land for peace\" deal that did not really gain traction about a decade earlier.  The actual peace talks \nwere set to begin at the end of July 2013. The White House said the task head would be \"an enormous challenge.\"\n\nOn July 28, 2013, the United States Department of State announced that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would \nresume peace talks on July 29, 2013.  After those talks, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced \nthat the two  sides had agreed to remain engaged in sustained peace negotiations for at least a  nine-month period, \nwith the goal of forging a peace treaty.\n\nSecretary Kerry explained:  \"The parties have agreed here today that all of the final-status issues, all of the core \nissues, and all other issues are all on the table for negotiation, and they are on the table with one simple goal: a \nview to ending the conflict, ending the claims.\"  Speaking of the difficulty of the task at hand, Secretary Kerry said, \n\"We all appreciate -- believe me, we appreciate the challenges ahead.  But even as we look down the difficult road \nthat is before us and consider the complicated choices that we face, we cannot lose sight of something that is often \nforgotten in the Middle East, and that is what awaits everybody with success.\"\n\nThe next round of talks would resume in mid-August 2013. Before those talks resumed, the contentious issue of \nJewish settlements emerged when Israel approved the construction of close to 1,200 new Jewish  homes in east \nJerusalem as well as the West Bank.  Palestinian negotiators said the move undermined Israel's good faith  in the \npeace process. In an interview with Reuters, chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said, \"If the Israeli \ngovernment believes that every week they're going to cross a red line by settlement activity, if they go with this \nbehavior, what they're advertising is the unsustainability of the negotiations.\" But Israeli Housing Minister Uri Ariel \ndefended the move saying that no country in the world would take orders on where its citizenry could build its \nhomes. He said:  \"No country in the world takes orders from other countries [about] where it can build and where it \ncan't.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some political analysts have suggested that the settlement move had less to do with the government's \nattitude to the peace process, and was more about satisfying the right-wing base of the Likud-led Israeli coalition \n\n\n\ngovernment. That hardline base has been outraged over the Israeli government's concession to release Palestinian \nprisoners.  Rather than flagrantly undermining the peace process, the Israeli government  very well may have been \nthrowing the hard-right flank a proverbial \"bone\" ahead of the resumption of peace talks and just as 26 of the 100 \nPalestinian prisoners were released from captivity.\n\nThe peace process was challenged in mid-August 2013 when Hamas militants fired rockets from the Gaza Strip into \nIsraeli territory, spurring the Israeli military to respond by launching an airstrike on Gaza. There were no casualties \nin either incident but the scenario was a reminder of the ongoing tensions on both sides at a time when peace talks \nwere set to resume in Jerusalem.\n\nIt should be noted that on Aug. 22, 2013,  militants fired rockets from southern Lebanese territory into Israel, \nyielding damage at a kibbutz close to the coastal town of Nahariya.  One rocket was intercepted using the Iron \nDome missile defense system.  Israel did not place the blame on Lebanon-based Hezbollah,  with whom Israel was \nengaged in a short war in 2006, but instead on global jihadists.  It was unknown if this incident was in response to \nongoing peace efforts.\n\nMonths of shuttle diplomacy by United States Secretary of State John Kerry followed but  in November 2013, United \nStates-brokered Middle East peace talks  hit a snag. Palestinian negotiators resigned over a lack of progress and in \nprotest over Israel's continued settlement in Palestinian areas.\n\nAs noted by chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, \"In reality, the negotiations stopped last week in light of the \nsettlement announcements.\" At issue was the news that Israel announced plans for new Jewish settler homes in \nthe  West Bank and East Jerusalem.  Palestinian negotiators reacted negatively to that development by walked \naway from the peace negotiations.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry entered the fray to note that the settlement plan undermined the peace \nprocess, and he urged Israel to limit its settlement activity in the interests of creating \"a climate for these talks to be \nable to proceed effectively.\" Secretary of State even went so far as to move away from the usual stance by the \nUnited States in characterizing settlement expansion as \"unhelpful.\" In this case, the United States top diplomat \ncast the settlement activity as \"illegitimate.\"  He said, \"Let me emphasize that the position of the United States is \nthat we consider now, and have always considered, the settlements to be illegitimate.\"\n\nPerhaps cognizant of the negative effect on the peace process that the settlement activity might have on \nnegotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intervened into the brewing crisis.  He said that he has no \nknowledge of the Israeli Housing Ministry's decision to grant construction permits and  called for a halt on the \nsettlement projects.  That being said, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for the current \nobstacle to the peace process, accusing them of creating \"artificial crises.\"\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu nevertheless indicated his hopes that the talks could return to more positive footing \nthanks to the presence of  United States Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nFor his part, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  made clear that the resignation of his negotiating team did not \nsignal a death knell to the peace process, and that he would be willing to appoint a new team, if needed.  He said,  \n\"Either we can convince it to return, and we're trying with them, or we form a new delegation.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the Palestinian leader had his own problems in trying to meet the needs of a Palestinian \npeople lacking a sense of political unity. The goal for the Palestinian political establishment has been the formation \nof an independent Palestinian state in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip; however, Gaza has long been under the \n\n\n\ncontrol of the Islamist militant group, Hamas, which is hostile to the Jewish state  and opposes peace with Israel.  \nHamas could hardly be regarded as a partner in the peace process.\n\nBy the first week of December 2013,  United States Secretary of State John Kerry was back in Israel for peace \ntalks. The United States' top diplomat, Secretary of State Kerry noted that progress had been made and security \nproposals were under consideration with an eye on addressing Israel's main concerns.  He said,  \"We are closer \nthan we have been in years in bringing about the peace and prosperity and security that all the people in this region \ndeserve and have been yearning for.\"  Striking a positive tone during a news conference with Secretary of State \nKerry,  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel was ready for historic peace with the Palestinians based on \na two-state solution.\n\nIn an ironic twist, despite the positive tone taken by the Israeli prime minister,  the Israeli foreign minister suggested \nthe peace talks were at a \"dead end.\" Avignor Lieberman argued that no deal was in sight, even indicating that the \ntwo sides were at an impasse as he said, \"We are at a dead end.\" Although Lieberman was not playing a part in \npeace negotiations, he suggested that there was simply not enough trust between the two sides to hold credible \nnegotiations.  He said, \"...Something simple like trust and reliability. The trust between the two sides is non-existent. \nIt is hard to make peace when you don't believe the other side.\"  On the issue of the prospects of a peace deal, \nLieberman said,  \"My feeling is that there is great desire but I don't think it's possible. It is not easy to bridge the \ngaps. We are not even close to a deal, not even an interim one. That is my estimate.\"\n\nBy mid-December 2013,  the \"mixed\" report on the progress of peace negotiations continued.  Palestinian \nnegotiators accused  United States Secretary of State Kerry of dooming the peace process by adopting the Israeli \nposition on security arrangements, which they said would short-circuit all the other issues under consideration.\n\nAt issue was the Israeli demand that it retain a security presence along the Jordan River -- something the \nPalestinian Authority has rejected as a non-starter.  One possible compromise might be the notion of an Israeli \nJordan River presence  for a limited period of time for 10 to 15 years.\n\nNevertheless, Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Israel's chief negotiator, said  that progress was being made \nalthough the process would be difficult and laborious.  She also made it clear that Israel should not take positions \nthat would impair the peace process -- such as the construction of settlement.  During an address to students at Tel \nAviv University, Livni said: \"My choice is clear -- peace and security, and not settlements and isolation.\"  She \ncontinued by noting, \"We are capable of making a decision that will lead to two states,\" but the process \"will be \ngradual, and its implementation will be gradual.\"\n\nDisagreements over measures and obstacles to the peace process have continued to crop up at the start of 2014.  \nThe decision by Israel to continue to build Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem raised the ire \nof Palestinians, who questioned Israel's commitment to a long-term \"two-state solution,\" given these moves.  But \nIsrael has also questioned the  proposed security arrangement in the Jordan Valley between a future Palestinian \nstate and Jordan (discussed above) charging that there remained a serious security demand for Israeli forces to \nretain its military presence in flashpoint areas.\n\nIt should be noted that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has dismissed the Israelis' demand that it \nretain its military presence in the West Bank for decades for security reasons.  He instead said that the Palestinian \nAuthority would favor a  would  said in an interview aired Tuesday a three-year transition period for three years.  \nAbbas said, \"A transitional period cannot exceed three years, during which Israel can withdraw gradually. We are \nwilling to allow a third party to take Israel's place, during and after withdrawal to soothe our concerns and Israel's.\"  \nThe vast distance between three years and several decades suggested that there was a major negotiating chasm \nyet to be bridged. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, bilateral tensions flared between Israel and its closest ally, the United States in January 2014.  At issue \nwere what the United States called the \"offensive\" comments of Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon regarding \nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry.  For his unrelenting efforts to advance peace between  the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians,  Secretary of State Kerry was rewarded with insult instead of accolades.\n\nAccording to Israel's Yediot Ahronot newspaper, Israeli Defense Minister Yaalonn said, \"John Kerry -- who has \ncome to us determined and is acting out of an incomprehensible obsession and messianic fervor -- cannot teach \nme anything about the conflict with the Palestinians.\"  Yaalon further disparaged the security plan recommended by \nKerry saying,  the proposal presented to Israel was \"not worth the paper it was written on.\"\n\nThe United States -- the one country that has stood steadfastly by Israel as most of the Western world moved to \nsupport the Palestinians' bid for recognition at the United Nations, and which has provided unrelenting security \nsupport to Israel for decades -- reacted with outrage.\n\nThe White House in the United States condemned Yaalon's comments, characterizing them as \"offensive\" and \nrebuking Israel for this \"inappropriate\" stance, given the Unites States' support to Israel's security.  White House \nspokesman Jay Carney, speaking on behalf of the government of the United States, further added the following \ncondemnation: \"Secretary Kerry and his team have been working non-stop in their efforts to promote a secure \npeace for Israel because of the deep concern the United States has, and the deep commitment the United States \nhas for and to Israel's future and the Israeli people....To question his motives and distort his proposals is not \nsomething we would expect from the defense minister of a close ally.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, perhaps realizing the extent of the bilateral damage, distanced himself \nfrom his own defense minister, saying, \"Even when we have disagreements with the United States, they always \npertain to the matter at hand, and are not personal.\"  However, the Israeli defense minister was forced to issue an \napology of his own.  A  statement issued by Yaalon's office read as follows: \"The defense minister... apologizes if \nthe secretary was offended by words attributed to the minister.\"  Yaalon further added  that he had no intention of \n\"causing offense\" and expressed gratitude for the United States' top diplomat's work in advancing peace, saying \nthat Israel and the United States shared \"a common goal\" of advancing peace talks with the Palestinians and  that \nhis country appreciated \"Secretary Kerry's many efforts towards that end.\"\n\nDeath of former Israeli leader Ariel Sharon\n\nOn Jan. 11, 2014, former  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon died at age 85 --  eight years after suffering a massive \nstroke that left him in a comatose state.  Sharon's condition deteriorated rapidly at the start of 2014, ultimately \nresulting in his death less than two weeks later. \n\nA mix of condolences and accolades for Sharon were soon registered with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres \nleading the charge to lionize the man he described as his \"dear friend.\"  President Peres characterized Sharon as \n\"a brave soldier and a daring leader who loved his nation and his nation loved him.\" A commander in the Israeli \narmy from its creation in 1948, Sharon would certainly be viewed as a national hero for his role in the 1967 Six Day \nWar and the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Indeed, he gained the nicknames \"The King of Israel,\" and \"The Lion of God\" \nfor these efforts that resulted in victories for the Jewish state of Israel.\n\nOf course, Sharon's biography would be written quite differently by Palestinians and by members of the \nconservative Likud party from which he ultimately withdrew. \n\n\n\nFor Palestinians, Sharon would be forever linked with his role as defense minister when Israel invaded Lebanon in \n1982  and the finding by a commission that  found him indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of \nPalestinians by Lebanese Christian fighters in refugee camps under Israeli control.  Sharon would also be linked \nwith sparking the 2000\n\nal-Aqsa Intifada  when he visited the sacred site Temple Mount/ Haram al-Sharif (Holy Sanctuary) in Jerusalem. \nThe visit sparked angry protests by Palestinians who were disgruntled with the lack of improvement in their daily \nlives since the Oslo Agreement, and the progress of the peace process as a whole.  They viewed the sight of  \nhawkish Sharon surrounded by police and bodyguards at the Muslim holy site as a clear provocation. \n\nWhile Sharon was long considered an integral part of the conservative Likud party, in-fighting within the party over \nthe matter of peace with Palestinians led the former prime minister to resign from Likud and start a new centrist \nparty, known as Kadima (which translates into \"Forward\"). As the head of government in 2005, he took the \nunprecedented step of calling for Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers to withdraw from  Gaza and parts of the West \nBank.  This move was aimed at advancing the peace process -- a remarkable shift from his previous hardline \nstance -- but for which he earned the ire of conservative and pro-settler Israelis.\n\nRegardless of his controversial political legacy, Ariel Sharon -- born Ariel Scheinermann -- would be remembered \nas a leading figure in Israel's national narrative. The Israeli government said that Sharon's\n\nbody would lie in state at the Israeli parliament,  followed by a state funeral, and a burial at his ranch in the Negev.\n\nIsrael announces arrest of Palestinian al-Qaida cell with plans to attack U.S. embassy\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2014, Israel announced it had foiled a terror plot by a  Palestinian al-Qaida cell in East Jerusalem.  \nIsraeli authorities from the Shin Bet security service said that they had arrested three Palestinians who were \nrecruited  in the Gaza Strip  and the West Bank and  were planning terror attacks.  Those planned attacks included \nan operation against the United States embassy in Tel Aviv, an attack on  a  conference center in Jerusalem, and \nthe abduction of Israeli soldiers from a Jerusalem's bus station.  The Islamist extremist Hamas movement, which \ncontrols the Gaza Strip, dismissed Shin Bet's allegations, casting them as  \"silly fabrications,\" and suggesting that \nIsrael was just trying to find justifications for its military strikes in Gaza.  However, Shin Bet had fairly detailed \nclaims against the cell saying that the operative were headed to Syria  for weapons training and were in possession \nof fake Russian documents.  As well, Shin Bet also noted that the Palestinian operatives used their Israeli resident \ncards to procure intelligence on  their intended terrorism targets.\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Olmert convicted of bribery\n\nAt the close of March 2014, former Israeli Prime Minister  Ehud Olmert, who resigned from office in 2008 as a result \nof a corruption probe,  was convicted of bribery.  At issue was Olmert's guilty verdict in the so-called \"Holyland \naffair.\" The case implicated Olmert in the payment of bribes to public officials, for the purpose of advancing a luxury \nproperty development project in Jerusalem at a time when he was the mayor of that city.  The former leader of the \nKadima has long insisted that he was innocent and has, indeed, been cleared of wrong doing in other corruption \ninquiries.  Olmert, who succeeded Ariel Sharon as head of government when Sharon had a stroke in early 2006, \nwas hoping for a political comeback. Having been cleared in 2012 of two major corruption charges, Olmert was on \nhis way to actualizing that goal.  However, that same year he was convicted of illegally granting favors to a \nbusiness  associate  during his tenure as trade and industry minister in the Sharon administration.  A suspended \nsentence and $19,000 kept his political ambitions alive; however, it was not known if he could survive the guilty \nverdict in the Holyland affair -- one of Israel's most scandalous corruption cases ever.\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Kerry cancels Middle East; peace process on \"pause\"\n\nSince mid-July 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry  has been traveling to the Middle East in another \neffort of \"shuttle diplomacy\" as he attempted to revitalize the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.  But \nat the start of April 2013, the peace process hit a significant obstacle and United States Secretary of State Kerry \ncancelled a scheduled trip to the Middle East.\n\nBy April 2014, the peace process was was not simply faltering- it was on its symbolic \"death bed.\" At issue was the \ndecision by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to sign 15 international conventions pertaining to the \nPalestinians' attempt to be recognized as an independent country by the United Nations.  The attempt to bypass the \npeace process and seek independent recognition at the United Nations has long been a contentious issue and one \nthat the United States has opposed in favor of a negotiated settlement with both Israelis and Palestinians as \nstakeholders.  For his part, Abbas said he was reacting to Israel's decision to issue 700 new tenders for \nsettlements in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo across the so-called  Green Line (i.e. sometimes referred to as \nthe \"pre-1967 borders\" but actually the line of demarcation set out in the 1949 Armistice Agreements between \nIsrael and its neighbors following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  Throughout, Israel's intermittent decisions to move \nforward with Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have been cause for consternation among \nPalestinians, and have frustrated the United States as it attempts to broker peace.\n\nFrom the point of view of the United States, which was acting as the peace negotiations broker, both the Israelis \nand Palestinians were acting in bad faith .  As such, Secretary of State Kerry signaled his outrage over their actions \nby cancelling his visits to Jerusalem and Ramallah respectively.  He stopped short of casting the renewed Middle \nEast peace effort as being in a state of crisis, and instead issued the following call: \"We urge both sides to show \nrestraint.\"  Secretary of State Kerry also indicated that the peace effort would continue for a month as he said, \n\"Abbas has given me his word that he will continue to negotiate until end of April.\"  However, Kerry also intimated \nthat there was no hope for peace without the commitment of the Israelis and  the Palestinians, as he added,  \"It is \nup to the parties to make decisions.\"  Israel itself was making its stance known  as it decided not to go forward with \na planned release of Palestinian prisoners -- a central element of the confidence-building measures in the larger \npeace process.\n\nThe  fate of the peace process moved in a negative direction on April 4, 2014, when Secretary of State Kerry noted \nthat the Obama administration in  Washington was evaluating whether or not to continue its role as a broker in the \nMiddle East peace talks.  During a visit to Morocco, Kerry warned there were limits to his country's efforts.  He said, \n\"This is not an open-ended effort, it never has been. It is reality check time, and we intend to evaluate precisely \nwhat the next steps will be.\"\n\nEfforts were underway to try to rescue the peace process as April 2014 moved into its second week, although \nhopes for a breakthrough remained limited since the negotiations schedule was set to expire on April 30, 2014.\n\nThose remaining hopes for a breakthrough were dimmed on April 23, 2014, when the  Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (largely dominated by the more moderate Fatah wing of Palestinian President Abbas) decided to enter \ninto a reconciliation agreement with the extremist Palestinian entity, Hamas, which has refused to recognize the \nright of Israel to exist and has been responsible for countless terror attacks against Israel.  The agreement would \nfacilitate a unity Palestinian government.\n\nFor several years, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Hamas have been at odds with one another.  The so-\ncalled \"seven-year schism\" resulted with the Palestine Liberation Organization  holding sway in the more moderate \nWest Bank and Hamas controlling the more extremist Palestinian elements in the Gaza Strip.  Peace talks between \n\n\n\nPalestinians and Israelis have been involved the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with Hamas \nessentially left out of the equation and uninterested in pursuing peace with a country it has expressly sought to \ndestroy.  Now, however, rapprochment between the two Palestinian sides was sure to augur further stress and \npressure on an already fragile United States-sponsored peace process.\n\nNot surprisingly, on April 24, 2014, one day after the announcement of the reconciliation deal between the Palestine \nLiberation Organization and Hamas, the government of Israel decided that it would suspend the  peace talks. \nFollowing a six hour meeting of select members of the cabinet, Israel made it clear that under no circumstances \nwas it prepared to negotiate with a Palestinian administration backed by a terrorist organization, such as Hamas.\n\nA statement dispatched by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu read as follows: \"Whoever \nchooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace.\"  The government of Israel also warned that there would be  \nretaliatory measures implemented  against the Palestinians for forming a unity government with the Gaza-based \nHamas, which has made no secret of its rejection of the State of Israel.  That statement read as such: \"Israel will \nrespond to unilateral Palestinian action with a series of measures.\"\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu observed that the reconciliation deal between the Palestinians \" was signed \neven as Israel is making efforts to advance the negotiations with the Palestinians.\"  Regarding that move as a \nbetrayal of the peace process, Netanyahu added, \"It is the direct continuation of the Palestinians' refusal to advance \nthe negotiations.\"  In interviews with both BBC News and MSNBC News, Netanyahu emphasized the fact that there \nwould be no resumption of peace talks unless Abbas abandoned his pact with Hamas.  On MSNBC News, during \nan interview with Andrea Mitchell, Netanyahu outlined the parameters for future talks with the Palestinians, saying, \n\"I hope (Abbas) changes his mind...I will be there in the future if we have a partner that is committed to peace. Right \nnow we have a partner that has just joined another partner committed to our destruction. No-go.\"\n\nIt should be noted that  earlier in the month of April 2014, the peace process was plunged into a stalemate when the \nPalestinians signed 15 United Nations conventions and Israel decided not to move forward with the prisoner \nrelease.  There were some suggestions that Palestinian President Abbas' decision to refocus on rapprochment with \nHamas was a tactic intended to revitalize negotiations  and force Israel into concessions.  However, Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu instead seized upon Abbas' move as a legitimate rationale for exiting the peace process \nentirely.  It was no secret that Netanyahu and the right-wing flank of the political spectrum in Israel had little \nenthusiasm for the peace process as exemplified by the \"offensive\" comments by Israeli Defense Minister Moshe \nYaalon regarding United States Secretary of State John Kerry's peace efforts (discussed above).\n\nOn the other side of the equation, there was no sign that the Palestinians were willing to acknowledge the \ndestructive impact of the reconciliation agreement with Hamas on the peace process. Instead, Wasel Abu Yousef, a \nPalestine Liberation Organization official, rejected what he called \"Israeli and American threats.\"\n\nA day later on April 26, 2014, Palestinian President Abbas issued a collection of confusing statements that only \nadded to the perception that he had bungled the Palestinian side of the negotiations.  He suggested that he was still \nprepared to move forward with peace talks with Israel, and insisted that his new unity government partner, Hamas, \nwould renounce violence and recognize the state of Israel.  But Hamas quickly refuted this claim, declaring that the \nmilitant entity  \"will not give any cover for any negotiations with the enemy.\" It was hardly the language of a group \ninterested in a peace process with Israel and suggested that Abbas himself was not sufficiently cognizant of the \nactual political dynamics at play.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the United States appeared to be weary of the tactics and bad faith employed by both Israel and the \nPalestinians in this latest peace effort, with President Barack Obama saying that it was time for a \"pause.\"\n\nThe collapse of the peace process was thus to be regarded as an unfortunate blow to United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry and his peace envoy, Martin Indyk, who have diligently attempted to bridge the gaps between the \ntwo sides.  At the start of the process, there was cautious optimism about the cause of advancing the peace agenda \nin the Middle East, and inching closer to achieving a two-state solution with Israel living peacefully beside an \nindependent Palestine.  Now, however, that mixture of anticipation and optimism had given way to anxiety and \ndespondency.\n\nPalestinian President Abbas swears in unity government following reconciliation deal with Hamas --\n\nAt the start of June 2014, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had sworn into office a unity government \nsolidifying the aforementioned reconciliation deal with  Hamas.  The move essentially ensured that Israel would no \nlonger be prepared to engage with in peace negotiations with the Palestinians, given their decision to renew \nrelations with a terrorist entity that has repeatedly refused to accept Israel's right to exist.\n\nFor his part, Abbas concentrated on the reconciliation between Palestinian factions, declaring: \"Today, and after \nannouncing the government of national unity, we declare the end of division that caused catastrophic harm to our \ncause.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Israel made its disapproval clear, preventing three Gaza-based ministers from \ntraveling to the West Bank for the cabinet inauguration ceremony.  Israel issued a statement noting: \"We are \ndeeply disappointed\" but also warning that the existence of the new unity government meant that President Abbas \nwould now be directly responsible for any terrorist attacks emanating from Palestinian areas.  Accordingly, the \nstatement continued: \"The agreement with Hamas makes Abbas directly responsible for any terrorist activity from \nGaza.\"  Israel also had harsh words for the United States, which it accused of giving cover to Abbas for forming a \ngovernment with a terrorist entity.  This was a reference to the United States' restrained response to Abbas' \nannouncement of the unity government.\n\nTo be clear, the United States was charting a cautious course.  Since it was not interested in entirely alienating the \nPalestinian government, the United States authorities focused on the fact that the actual cabinet did not contain any \nmembers of Hamas and suggested they would try to work with the new Palestinian government.  As noted by \nUnited States Department of State spokesperson Jen Psaki,  \"It appears that President Abbas has formed an \ninterim technocratic government that does not include ministers affiliated with Hamas.\" She continued, \"But we will \ncontinue to evaluate the composition and policies of the new government and calibrate our approach accordingly,\"\n\nHamas, as before, did Abbas no favors.  Instead of choosing the path of silence,  its outgoing prime minister, Ismail \nHaniyeh, promised to  continue \"resistance by all forms\" in its fight against Israel.  In fact, Haniyey said that its \ninclusion in the new unity government meant that Hamas' militant wing -- the Qassam Brigades that has often been \nresponsible for  terror attacks -- was now transformed into a legitimate army.  That type of messaging was not likely \nto assuage opponents of the Palestinian unity deal.\n\nPrimer on 2014 presidential election in Israel\n\nAn internal presidential election was held in Israel on June 10, 2014 to choose the successor to the outgoing chief \nof state,  President Shimon Peres, who has served in that capacity since 2007. In Israel, the president is  elected \nfor a seven-year term by the \"Knesset\" or Parliament.\n\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2007 vote, Peres won 58 ballots -- just shy of the 61 needed for a majority in the 120-seat \nKnesset.  In that round, Reuven Rivlin of Likud received 37 votes, while Colette Avital of the Labour Party garnered \n21 votes.  They  both expressed support for Peres after the first round results were announced. Peres then won the \nsupport of 86 out of 120 parliamentarians to take victory in a second round voting.  The president-elect was \ninaugurated on July 15, 2007. The election of Peres as president came  after Moshe Katsav took a leave of \nabsence from his presidential role, in the wake of accusations of rape.  That matter had contributed to rising calls \nfor his resignation, and created something of a domestic political crisis in Israel.\n\nIn 2014, the main candidates were  Reuven Rivlin (who contested the 2007 election as discussed above) and  Meir \nSheetrit of the moderate Hatnuah party. Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the Labor candidate and a veteran politician, \nwithdrew from the race amidst rising allegations of  financial malpractice. Rivlin ultimately claimed victory, securing \nthe most votes in the second round.\n\nAs noted here , Rivlin belonged to  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his position in opposition \nto a Palestinian state presented a defined departure from outgoing President Peres who has supported a two state \nsolution to the Middle East peace process. That being said, Rivlin was yet able to garner support from the left-wing  \nHaaretz newspaper on the basis of his interest in advancing Jewish-Arab cooperation.  Indeed, it should be known \nthat Rivlin was something of a political independent and was certainly  no stalwart of Netanyahu, who has been \nantagonistic towards the peace process.\n\nAt an inauguration ceremony in the Knesset after the election, Rivlin declared, \"The faith you have shown in me \ntoday, in all corners of this house, obliges me to shed, from this moment on, my political role.\"\n\nSpecial Report\n\n2014 Crisis in Gaza:\n\nJuly 2014 saw already-dismal relations between Israelis and Palestinians devolve to a new nadir in the aftermath of \nthe murder of three Israeli teenage seminary students.  The three youth disappeared in mid-June 2014 having been \nlast seen at a popular hitchhiking spot.  The bodies of Naftali Frenkel, Gilad Shaar, and Eyal Yifrach were found \nunder a pile of rocks close to the Palestinian town of Halhul.  Their murders raised the ire of Israelis and the \ndiscovery of the bodies of the three students in a Palestinian town directed blame to Palestinian extremist militant \nelements.\n\nThe government of Israel, led by hardliner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Hamas \nand promising retribution against that militant extremist Palestinian entity.  It should be noted that Hamas  recently \nentered into a unity agreement with the relatively more mainstream Palestinian Liberation Organization, essentially \nending the peace process with Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu said: \"Hamas is responsible and Hamas will pay.\" \nIsrael's Deputy Defense Minister, Dan Danon, issued a similar assertion, noting that  Hamas \"must pay a price.\"\n\nFor its part, Hamas denied any involvement in the killing on the three youth, claiming that Israel was just looking for \nan excuse to justify an anti-Palestinian operation.  However, Israeli authorities have insisted that Hamas was \nresponsible for the abduction and murder of Frenkel, Shaar, and Yifrach.  In fact, Israeli authorities named two \nsuspects as Ayoub al-Kawasma and Abu Aisheh, having raided the homes of both individuals in the West Bank city \nof Hebron.\n\nThe situation turned more grim on July 2, 2014, when the body of an abducted Palestinian youth was found  in a \nwooded area close to Jerusalem.  All expectations were that that 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khudair, who was \nseen being pushed into a van, was the victim of a revenge killing, this time at the hands of Israelis.  The discovery \nof  Khudair's body spurred angry clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in Jerusalem. Palestinian \n\n\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas reacted angrily and  accused Jewish settlers of behind the  killing of the Palestinian \nyouth.  He also called on  Israel to \"mete out the strongest punishment against the murderers if it truly wants \npeace.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also reacted with condemnation to the death of the young \nKhudair and called on police \"to swiftly investigate who was behind the loathsome murder and its motive.\"  He also \nurged  both sides -- Israeli and Palestinian -- \"not to take the law into their own hands.\"\n\nA controversy soon erupted when mobile phone footage was released showing two officers relentlessly beating a \nteenager believed to have been a participant in the clashes, which included attacks on police.\n\nThat teenager was soon revealed to be Tariq Khudair, the American cousin of the Palestinian murder victim, \nMohammad Abu Khdair.\n\nIt should be noted that Tariq Khudair and his family have denied the charges that he had been taking part in the \nstreet violence.  Regardless of the veracity of their claims, the footage was sufficiently disturbing that the United \nStates Department of State entered the fray, expressing concern over the treatment of a United States national at \nthe hands of Israeli police.\n\nAs the first week of July 2014 came to a close, Israel's Shin Bet security agency confirmed that six suspects has \nbeen arrested in connection with the murder of the Palestinian youth, Mohammed Abu Khudair, discussed above.  \nThe statement from Shin Bet read as follows: \"In the wake of intelligence and operational information, the Israel \nPolice and the ISA (Shin Bet) this morning arrested several Jewish suspects regarding the 2 July abduction and \nmurder of Mohammad Abu Khdair.\" The suspects, who were identified as Jewish, were described as being \nmotivated by revenge for the deaths of Frenkel, Shaar, and Yifrach.  (Note that a week later, three Jewish Israelis in \ncustody confessed to the murder of young Khudair.)\n\nIt was apparent that that at least one of Israel's investigations to find the killers of murdered youth had seen some \nsuccess.  Nevertheless, there was little indication that Palestinians were applauding the arrests of the Jewish \nsuspects, with many Palestinian spokespersons instead concentrating on the brutal murder of young Khudair.  Of \ncourse, the fact of the matter was that the same story of irrevocable death applied to the murders of the three \nJewish youth --  Frenkel, Shaar, and Yifrach -- whose parents were yet to see their tragedy find any sense of \nclosure.  Also of note was the fact that Hamas, which was officially  a participant in the Palestinian unity \ngovernment, was doing little to apprehend those responsible for the deaths of the three Israeli teenagers.\n\nMeanwhile,  in response to a relentless barrage of rocket attacks by Palestinian extremists from Gaza into southern \nIsrael, the Israeli military launched scores of  air strikes on the Gaza Strip.  This action should be interpreted as \nseparate from the promised retribution sure to descend upon Hamas for the deaths of  Frenkel, Shaar, and Yifrach.  \nWith  the killing of Khudair in the background, the Israeli government made clear that it would not be pursuing the \nretribution path against Hamas with any degree of rapidity.  Given the increased tensions over the tragic deaths of \nyouth on both sides, the Israeli Defense Forces issued a statement saying that their  immediate task, instead, was \non defense in southern Israel against the volley of rocket fire from Gaza.  As well, the Israeli government made  \npublic statements that it wanted to tamp down tensions.  Clearly, it was in no one's interests to incite another \nIntifada.\n\nNevertheless, Hamas was increasing its brazen rocket attacks on southern Israel as July 2014 entered its second \nweek.  Hamas was actually quite proud of its work, declaring that it managed to fire more than one hundred rockets \nonto Israeli territory.  Israeli authorities confirmed that as many as 20 rockets per hour had been fired, with several \nscores of rockets  striking inside Israel --  even triggering sirens in the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem -- and the \nrest being successfully shot down by Iron Dome interceptors.\n\n\n\nWhile Israel had intended to aim for a restrained response to both the murders of the youth and the initial volley of \nattacks from Palestinian extremists in Gaza, the latest attacks from Hamas changed the calculus and prompted the \nmobilization of reservists.  According to an Israeli military spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, \"Now the \nIsraeli military is talking about preparedness for an escalation.\"  While the Netanyahu government stopped short of \na ground offensive (at least in the immediate future),  it was clearly not prepared to ignore the blatant and \ncontinuous attack by Hamas.\n\nYet even so, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued to try to track the path of prudence, cautioning against a \nsignificant confrontation with Hamas. This stance by Netanyahu -- a well-known hardliner -- was insufficiently \nvigorous for far-right Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who decided to end his party's coalition with the prime \nminister's Likud. Lieberman said, \"A situation in which a terrorist group has hundreds of rockets which it can decide \nany moment to use is intolerable... There have been suggestions that we wait but I don't know what we're waiting \nfor.\"\n\nBut it was soon apparent that the Israeli government intended to plan its strategy  against Hamas carefully rather \nthan to react rashly.  While Israel was already carrying out targeted  strikes against Hamas terror centers and the \nhomes of Hamas members in Gaza, it was yet to intensify its actions.  To this end, Defense Minister Moshe Yalon \nsaid Israel was getting ready for an escalation in its conflict with Hamas, saying, \"We are preparing for a battle \nagainst Hamas which will not end within a few days.\"  He continued, \"We will not tolerate missiles being fired at \nIsraeli towns and we are prepared to extend the operations with all means at our disposal in order to keep hitting \nHamas.\"\n\nA Hamas spokesperson claimed that the Israeli strikes in Gaza City, which killed a Hamas terrorist Mohammed \nShaaban, and another strike on the home of a Hamas leader in Khan Younis that killed six people, constituted \"a \nhorrendous war crime.\"  However, it was clear that Israel was reserving its wrath for Hamas and not the civilian \nPalestinian population with Israeli authorities issuing warnings of impending strikes. Indeed, the Palestinian Interior \nMinistry acknowledged that it had received calls from the Israeli military urging family members of Hamas, who are \noften used as human shields, to depart from strike target locations.\n\nOf note was the fact that Hamas takes no such action in warning Israeli civilians of impending rocket attacks from \nGaza.  But also worthy of note was the reality that even so-called targeted attacks often yield civilian casualties, \nwhich serve only to amplify already-heightened tensions.  Indeed, as of July 12, 2014, more than 120 Palestinians \nhad died in Gaza.  While  several of them were legitimate targets linked with Hamas and terrorism, there was no \nescaping the fact that many civilian Palestinians were also among the dead.  Indeed, the  United Nations Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that more than 75 percent of those killed in Gaza were civilians.\n\nThat civilian death toll was unsurprisingly evoking concerns from the international community about the \nproportionality of Israel's air strikes in response to Hamas' rocket attacks.  On the face of it, rocket attacks by \nHamas from Gaza might not seem as pressing a threat as aerial bombardment by Israel.  As well, Israel had the \ncapability of its Iron Dome anti-missile defense system to defend itself against rocket attacks. Taken together, critics \nof the Jewish state of Israel have suggested that it often reacts in an overly-harsh manner, usually exacting a \npainful death toll on Palestinians.\n\nHowever, for Israeli citizens, the rocket attacks from Gaza have not been viewed in terms  of effectiveness, but \nrather through the valence of intent.  The fact of the matter for Israeli citizens was that Hamas militant extremists \nwere actively and relentless attempting to attack and kill them.  As such, the people of Israel both expected and \n\n\n\ndemanded that their government protect them and put an end to the campaign of terror to which they have been \nexposed. \n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu on July 12, 2014, emphasized Israel's right and responsibility to defend \nitself, adding that \"no international pressure will prevent us from acting with all power.\"\n\nWhile United States President Barack Obama has backed Israel's right to take action in the face of aggression from \nHamas, he also conveyed his concern over further escalation and called for both  sides \"to do everything they can \nto protect the lives of civilians and restore calm. \"  President Obama additionally made it clear that the United States \nwas prepared to broker a truce.  It was to be seen if his offer would be taken up.\n\nBut it was Egypt and the United States who took the first steps toward brokering a truce by advancing a ceasefire \ndeal on July 14, 2014.  Several Arab and Western countries, including the United States, welcomed the ceasefire \nproposal.  For its part, Israel quickly assented to agreement, with members of the Netanyahu government voting to \nmove forward with the Egypt-sponsored truce.  Thus, there were high hopes that the ugly cycle of violence would \nbe brought to an end.\n\nHowever, on July 15, 2014, Hamas killed all such hopes by rejecting the blueprint to immediately de-escalate \nhostilities and end the fighting entirely within 12 hours.  Instead, Hamas promised to \"increase its attack on Israel \nwith \"ferocity and intensity\" and continued its barrage of rocket attacks onto Israeli territory. In fact, while the \nceasefire was supposed to be going into effect, Hamas was firing more than a hundred rockets at Israel, with that \ncountry's Iron Dome anti-missile system repelling many of them -- including some that targeted the Israeli city of Tel \nAviv.\n\nThese defiant acts of aggression propelled Israel to abandon the Egypt-sponsored ceasefire deal and return to its \nair strike mission. As noted by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, his country had no choice but to \"expand and \nintensify\" its efforts to end Hamas' rocket attack capacity.  It seemed that the terror group, Hamas, was not \ninterested in the path of peace, irrespective of the fact that Palestinian civilians were paying the highest price in \nblood for the ongoing conflict.\n\nSome analysts pointed to the fact that Hamas was suspicious of the new Egyptian government, which largely \norchestrated the 2013 ousting of the former Islamist Egyptian executive government, led by Mohammed Morsi and \nthe Muslim Brotherhood. It was certainly true that Hamas had more luck in gaining the cooperation of former \nPresident Morsi, although it was still seeking to  ease blockades at the Rafa crossing in Gaza into Egypt.  As such, \nHamas  may have hoped that its rejection of the July 2014 ceasefire deal might press the new Egyptian government \ninto further concessions that favored Gaza.  However, President Sisi of Egypt, with his strong military ties, was not \nwarm to the notion of granting concessions to a terrorist entity, and he was certainly not about to ease a tight \nsecurity hold on the Egypt-Gaza border region.\n\nHamas' rejection of the truce shifted global support in the direction of Israel, which had embraced the opportunity to \nend the violence. Moreover, the decision of Hamas members to cloister themselves in hospitals and residential \nbuildings only bolstered Israel's argument that Hamas was prepared to use Palestinian civilians as human shields. \nNotably, United States Secretary of State John Kerry condemned Hamas, asserting:  \"I cannot condemn strongly \nenough the actions of Hamas in so brazenly firing rockets, in multiple numbers, in the face of a goodwill effort (to \nsecure) a ceasefire.\"  He additionally warned that Hamas would now have to bear the brunt of the responsible for \nwhatever bloodshed occurred.  Certainly, the terror enclave was delivering a curious message that it was more \ninterested in the pursuit of aggression than it was in protecting the lives of Palestinians, on whose behalf it claimed \nto be operating.\n\n\n\nWhatever limited pro-Israel momentum occurred in mid-July 2014 was short-circuited on July 16, 2014.\n\nIsrael had resumed its air strikes in the Gaza Strip and one such strike ended  tragically with the deaths of four \nchildren playing on a beach close to Gaza City.  Mindful that the international community reacted in horror to the \nnews, and cognizant of the fact that the deaths of children did not help its public relations campaign to justify \ncontinuing air strikes in Gaza, the Israeli government on July 16, 2014, announced a  humanitarian ceasefire for six \nhours.  The temporary \"pause\" by Israel was intended to allow Palestinian civilians to seek humanitarian and \nmedical assistance.  Israel also said it would launch an investigation into the strike that killed the four \naforementioned children.  Hamas, however, ignored these overtures and continued to strike Israel with rocket \nattacks.\n\nIn the wake of Hamas' rejection of an Egypt-sponsored peace deal, and in light of its continued attacks on Israel, it \nseemed that peace was not on the agenda of the Israeli government either.  As noted by Israeli cabinet minister, \nNaftali Bennet, \"We are moving from Iron Dome to an iron fist.\"\n\nOn July 17, 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had \ncommenced a ground operation in Gaza. The intervention of IDF into Gaza marked a new phase of \"Operation \nProtective Edge\"  as Israeli authorities said they intended to target Hamas militant sites.  Those sites included \nHamas \"infiltration\" tunnels used to transport arms, munitions, and terrorists intent on carrying out attacks and \nabductions on Israeli territory. A statement from the Israeli government read as follows: \"The prime minister and \ndefense minister have instructed the IDF (Israel Defense Force) to begin a ground operation tonight in order to hit \nthe terror tunnels from Gaza into Israel.\"\n\nHeavy  artillery and naval shelling was soon reported along the Gaza border, while Israeli  tracer fire into the sky. \nSome shells landed close to the al-Wafa rehabilitation hospital  to the east of Shejaia.  The head of the hospital, \nBasman Alashi, told Reuters News that his staff had not been able to evacuate all of the patients, and as such, the \nfacility was in bad shape, having been hit \"many times.\"  In a separate incident, the aerial bombardment of a house \nin Gaza left several  children dead. Overall the death toll was increasing on the Palestinian side of the border -- \ncrossing the 300 mark on July 19, 2014.  On that day, two  Israeli soldiers were killed in a cross-border attack by \nHamas militants, while a third soldier was injured in a raid by Palestinian militants who reached Israel through a \nconcealed tunnel.\n\nMeanwhile, rocket attacks by the Palestinian terrorist group, Hamas, continued to be fired in the direction of Tel \nAviv, Beersheba, and Ashkelon, triggering air sirens across the country as Israelis ran for shelter from incoming \nattack. As well, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  reported that it had \ndiscovered several rockets hidden in an empty Gaza school.  There were other reports that Hamas leaders were \ntaking up residence in the basement of a hospital. These discoveries bolstered Israel's contention that Hamas was \nprepared to use children and civilian facilities -- such as schools and hospitals --  as human shields and as hiding \nplaces for their weaponry. Indeed, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Ron Prosor,  noted that  Hamas was \nusing ambulances filled with children \"to move their terrorists around Gaza.\"\n\nJuly 20, 2014, was the deadliest day in the conflict with the death of close to 90 Palestinians and more than a dozen \nIsraeli soldiers in a 24-hour period. On the Palestinian side, most of the deaths occurred in the hard-hit \nneighborhood of Gaza City called Shejaiya. The overall death toll now stood at 425 Palestinians -- most of them \ncivilians -- and around 20 Israelis -- at least 18 of them being soldiers.  Its should be noted that the number of  \n\n\n\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) deaths after only a few days of the ground offensive in Gaza in 2014 already exceeded \nthan the final number of IDF deaths sustained  during the last ground operation in to Gaza in 2008-2009.\n\nFor his part, United States  President Barack Obama warned against the escalation of violence.  He also made it \nclear that  he remained supportive of Egyptian ceasefire proposal, as well as the continuing efforts by  Egypt, Qatar, \nFrance,  and the United Nations to secure a resolution. He said that his government  would also use its diplomatic \nresources to pursue an end to the violence and dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry to Cairo.  There, the \nUnited States' top diplomat was expected to meet with Egyptian officials about the Israeli-Hamas conflict.  President \nObama  additionally maintained his stance in support of Israel's right to defend itself, while simultaneously \nexpressing \"serious  concerns\" over  the civilian deaths on the Palestinian side of the equation.\n\nBut the civilian deaths were not the only casualties of this Israeli-Hamas conflict. Palestinians lucky enough  to \nsurvive the offensive were being forced to abandon their homes in order to escape the crossfire of violence. The \nUnited Nations reported that tens of thousands of Gaza-based Palestinians were seeking shelter provided by the \nUnited Nations.\n\nThe stakes in the Israeli-Hamas conflict intensified on July 20, 2014, when the Qassam Brigades -- a militant wing \nof Hamas -- announced the abduction of an Israeli soldier. Abu Ubaida, a spokesperson for the Qassam Brigades \nannounced that his militant group had \"captured a Zionist soldier.\" He also identified the soldier as Shaul Aron and \noffered the soldier's military identity tag number. For its part, the Israeli government had limited comment on the \nmatter -- presumably because it was seeking to verify the veracity of this claim.\n\nHowever, the Israeli people were likely to react in shock to this news since Aron would be the  first Israeli soldier to \nbe captured by Palestinian militants since Gilad Shalit, who  was held for more than five years following his 2006 \ncapture in a cross-border raid.  Shalit's release was secured following a deal with the Palestinians to release 1,000 \nmilitants.\n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said during a news conference that the IDF would continue its \ncampaign in Gaza.  He  noted that the goals of the campaign included the destruction of Hamas' terrorist \ninfrastructure in Gaza, as well as the \"restoration of quiet\" in Israel.  Regarding the costs and risks of the operation, \nthe Israeli leader said, \"We are undeterred. We shall continue the operation as long as is required.\"\n\nBy July 22, 2014, the death toll on both sides of the conflict was increasing.  The IDF was sustaining some of its \nworst losses in recent times, with 25 soldiers dead in ground conflict with Palestinian terrorists from Hamas. Two \nIsraelis were also killed but the civilian death toll on the Israeli side was largely mitigated by the effectiveness of the \nIron Dome anti-missile interceptor system.  Undaunted by the fact that Palestinian civilians were paying the price for \ntheir terrorism, Hamas militants continued to hurl missiles at Israel, presumably hoping that one of these projectiles \nof death would slip past Iron Dome.  On July 22, 2014, alone, more than 130 rockets were fired from Gaza. At the \nsame time, as promised by the Netanyahu government,  Israel continued its offensive in Gaza. \n\nGiven the bloodshed and violence, United Nations Secretary General Ban ki-Moon demanded a ceasefire, while \nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry was in Egypt attempting to broker such an end.  Caught in an \"open \nmike\" moment, Kerry was heard talking to an aide sarcastically about Israel's \"pin-point\" anti-Hamas operation that \nseemed to be killing far more civilians than Hamas terrorists.  But in official remarks, Kerry was more balanced as \nhe said that the United States was  \"deeply concerned about the consequences of Israel's appropriate and \nlegitimate effort to defend itself.\"  He noted,  \"No country can stand by when rockets are attacking it.\"  Kerry then \nadded, \"But always, in any kind of conflict, there is a concern about civilians -- about children, women, communities \nthat are caught in it.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, with Hamas terrorists continuing to attack Israel with rockets, and with a rocket from Gaza striking close \nto the Ben Gurion International Airport on July 22, 2014, the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) temporarily \nprohibited United States  air carriers from flying to or from the Tel Aviv airport.  That ban was lifted  on July 24, \n2014.\n\nOn that day, a United Nations shelter for Palestinians fleeing the crossfire of violence was struck, resulting in \nmultiple casualties.  Women and children were among those believed to have been killed.  The international media  \nsaid that Israel had been given the precise coordinates of  the shelter in Beit Hanoun, presumably in an effort to \nensure that it would not be bombed by Israeli forces.  For its part, the IDF released a statement reminding readers \nthat Hamas habitually used civilians as human shields, while also suggesting that Hamas had launched rockets in \nthe region and might be responsible.  Later, Israel acknowledged that it may have hit the outer compound of the \nshelter; however, Israel said that its imagery of the incident indicated that the area was clear of all persons and thus \nit could not have been responsible for the deaths there -- the footage of the bloodshed broadcast by international \nmedia notwithstanding.\n\nWhile this response by Israel on July 28, 2014,  produced an uproar on the part of Palestinians, there was a \ndeafening silence from that side of the conflict when it was revealed on July 29, 2014, that Hamas had concealed \nweapons in yet another United Nations shelter. That discovery bolstered Israel's claim that Hamas was, indeed, \nusing human shields to protect its leadership -- many of whom were hiding in hospitals \u2013 and using United Nations \nshelter to hide its weapons cache, as exemplified in this case.\n\nAs July 2014 was coming to a close, outrage over the bloodshed of civilians was adding to the pressure to forge a \nceasefire in the violent conflict with an ever-increasing death toll.  That death toll in Gaza now stood at well over \n1,000 Palestinians, with the vast majority of victims being civilians and with a disturbing number of children being \namong the dead.  The death toll on the Israeli side included 50 soldiers and a number of civilians. As discussed \nabove, this was the highest price the IDF had paid in a regional conflict in recent years.  Despite the high cost in \nhuman life, there was little progress on the ceasefire front.\n\nA humanitarian truce lasted only a few hours on July 26, 2014, and although there were overtures intended to \nextend it, Hamas ultimately violated the truce by shooting rockets once again into Israeli territory. As such, Israel \nresumed its operations with Prime Minister Netanyahu warning Israeli citizens to be prepared for a long campaign.  \nIn an address, he said, \"We need to be prepared for a protracted campaign. We will continue to act with force and \ndiscretion until our mission is accomplished.\"\n\nNevertheless, there was a continuing global push for an end to the death and destruction. With wide swaths of \nGaza destroyed and the death toll on both sides rising, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon issued a \npassionate call for peace, urging both sides to do their best to bridge the gap. He said: \"It's a matter of their political \nwill. They have to show their humanity as leaders, both Israeli and Palestinian.  Why are these leaders allowing \ntheir people to be killed by others? It's not responsible, (it's) morally wrong.\"\n\nThe cause of humanity appeared to elude both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership. For Hamas, there were only \ndemands that the blockade of Gaza be lifted in totality, along with dramatic declarations that the leadership was \nwilling to die for the cause.  Hamas commander, Mohammad Deif, asserted proudly that his soldiers were \"eager \nfor death.\"  But in fact, most of Hamas' leadership figures were in hiding, and the actual people confronting the \nreality and tragedy of death were the Palestinian civilians.  Making matters worse was the fact that Hamas was \nusing its al-Asqa media to broadcast messages to Gaza residents, instructing them to ignore warnings by the Israeli \nDefense Forces to vacate certain areas ahead of  military activity there.\n\n\n\nFor Israel, its central mission was to disarm and disable Hamas.  Economy Minister Naftali Bennett said, \"Hamas \nmust be permanently stripped of its missiles and tunnels in a supervised manner. In return we will agree to a host of \neconomic alleviations.\"  Buoyed by the support of the vast majority of Israelis for the operation in Gaza,  Prime \nMinister Netanyahu was single-minded in his goals, and seemingly incognizant of the rising global outrage over the \ncivilian casualty list.  Calling on Israelis to prepare for a long fight, he said, \"The process of preventing the \narmament of the terror organization and demilitarization of the Gaza Strip must be part of any solution. And the \ninternational community must demand this forcefully.\"  But in fact, what the international community was demanding \nwas an end to the bloodshed.\n\nIt should be noted that United States Secretary of State John Kerry had spent a week in the Middle East attempting \nto broker an agreement that would bring an end to the hostilities.  However, Israel condemned his efforts, \nsuggesting it conceded too much ground to Hamas. Israeli cabinet members even cast the ceasefire plan as \"a \ndisaster\" even though it was essentially a reconstitution of the earlier Egyptian agreement that Israel had signed \nonto.  There was no acknowledgement of Secretary of State Kerry's unflagging efforts to end the conflict from \nIsrael,  whose security -- including the Iron Dome that was saving Israeli lives on a daily basis -- was largely funded \nby United States taxpayers.\n\nAs July 2014 came to an end, a United Nations-run school in the Jabaliya district of Gaza City being used as a \ncivilian shelter was shelled, thus leading to the deaths of more than a dozen people.\n\nMark Regev, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, would not forthrightly take responsibility for the shelling of \nthe school, saying instead, \"We have a policy - we don't target civilians.\"  However, for the United Nations -- a \nneutral body tasked with caring for civilians -- the fact of the matter was that its facility, which was intended to \nprovide safe haven for Gaza civilians, was struck.  The United Nations was also making it clear that it blamed Israel \nfor the incident and the ensuing loss of life. Pierre Krahenbuhl, the commissioner-general for the United Nations \nRelief and Works Agency (Unrwa), declared: \"Children were killed as they slept next to their parents as a result if a \nserious violation of international law by Israeli forces.\"  The United Nations also emphasized the fact that it was now \nimpossible to guarantee safety to the civilian population of the area.  As noted by United Nations humanitarian \nchief, Baroness Valerie Amos, in an address to the United Nations Security Council, \"The reality of Gaza today is \nthat no place is safe.\"\n\nThe United States -- Israel's closest ally  -- reaffirmed its belief that Israel had the right to defend itself while \ncondemning the shelling of the United Nations shelter.  In fact, the White House cast the tragic incident as \"totally \nunacceptable and totally indefensible.\"  In remarks to the media, White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said: \n\"There is a difference in approach between what Hamas is perpetrating on the Israeli people and what Israel is \ndoing to defend their country. But the shelling of a UN facility that is housing innocent civilians who are fleeing \nviolence is totally unacceptable and totally indefensible, and it is clear that we need our allies in Israel to do more to \nlive up to high standards that they have set for themselves.\"\n\nFor its part, Israeli authorities said that it had been successful in \"neutralizing\" 70 percent to 80 percent of Hamas' \ntunnel network into Israel, and asserting that it would not cease its work to destroy the full network of Hamas' \ntunnels until the job was complete.\n\nThat being said, late on July 31, 2014, the United Nations and the United States were able to jointly broker a three-\nday humanitarian truce aimed at allowing time to people in Gaza to collect the dead and gain vital supplies.\n\n\n\nIn his announcement regarding the truce, United States Secretary of State John Kerry explicitly noted that the truce, \nwhich was agreed to by Israel, would allow that country to maintain its positions in Gaza, and also continue its \nmission of destroying the tunnel system.  Envoys from Qatar, along with other Palestinian representatives, indicated \nthat the Palestinian side -- including Hamas -- had agreed to the humanitarian ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe three-day truce was also aimed at allowing Israeli and Palestinian negotiations to travel to Egypt to participate \nin talks aimed at finding a longer-term resolution. Egypt made it clear that its role was simply to facilitate talks, \nadding that any eventual agreement would be up to the two stakeholders.\n\nThus, on Aug. 1, 2014, the first hour and a half of the truce went forward with no sound of warfare in the battle \nzone.  However, only 90 minutes into the humanitarian truce, Israel accused Hamas of violating the agreement and \nimmediately declared the ceasefire to be over.\n\nAt issue was the claim by Israel that Hamas militants attacked Israeli soldiers who were searching for tunnels in \nthe southern Gaza Strip.  Israel said that Palestinian militants killed two IDF soldiers and took a third hostage \nalthough it was later announced that the third Israeli soldier died in the fracas.  Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, a \nmilitary spokesman for Israel, described the incident that ended the truce as follows: \"Out of a tunnel access point \nor several, terrorists came out of the ground. At least one was a suicide terrorist who detonated himself. There was \nan exchange of fire.\"\n\nFor Israel, the fact of the matter was that Hamas had again violated a ceasefire agreement and the grounds for \ntrust were null and void. For its part, the Hamas leadership insisted that it was simply defending its interests in that \nclash with Israeli troops in the southern Gaza Strip, and accused Israel of continuing its actions (destroying the \ntunnel network).  However, it should be noted that the Aug. 1, 2014, truce was expressly predicated on the notion \nthat Israel could hold its positions in Gaza and continue its tunnel destruction work.  As such, the violation of the \nceasefire could plausibly be attributed to Hamas.\n\nAcknowledging that the prospects for another truce looked grim, given the failure of this one after being in effect for \nonly 90 minutes, United States President Barack Obama said, \"I think it's going to be very hard to put a ceasefire \nback together again if Israelis and the international community can't feel confident that Hamas can follow through \non a ceasefire commitment.\"  It was certainly clear that the Palestinian leadership had no control over its disparate \nfactions, and even less control over its militant extremist factions.  The consequences of such weak leadership \nwould undoubtedly fall upon the Palestinian civilian population since Israel wasted little time in resuming its \noffensive operations in Gaza -- large swaths of which had now been reduced to rubble.\n\nIn a news conference, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the military campaign in Gaza would go on, \nand that the mission to disrupt and destroy Hamas' warren of tunnel would prevail until the goal was accomplished.  \nNetanyahu said,  \"From the beginning, we promised to return the quiet to Israel's citizens and we will continue to \nact until that aim is achieved.\" he continued, \"We will take as much time as necessary, and will exert as much force \nas needed.\"  But the prime minister also tacitly hinted towards an eventual end to the engagement in Gaza, as he \nsaid, \"We will deploy in the places most convenient to us.\"\n\nBefore any redeployment could take place, the ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza yielded further unfortunate \nconsequences on Aug. 3, 2014, striking yet another United Nations shelter -- this time in Rafa. It was the second \nsuch shelling incident in less than a week.  According to the  Israeli military, it was targeting \"three Islamic Jihad \nterrorists on board a motorcycle in the vicinity of an UNRWA school in Rafah.\"  Clearly, what they actually hit was \nanother United Nations school being used to house Gaza residents with no other place to go.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the United Nations erupted with outrage.  Robert Serry, the United Nations' Middle East Special \nCoordinator, said the school had been providing shelter to  3,000 displaced persons and the strike caused \ncasualties.  Serry said, \"It is simply intolerable that another school has come under fire while designated to provide \nshelter for civilians fleeing the hostilities.\" The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was particularly \nvehement in his ire as he characterized the strike on the shelter as  a \"moral outrage and a criminal act\" and \ndemanded that those responsible for the \"gross violation of international humanitarian law\" be held to account.  The \nUnited States also entered the fray, with State Department spokesperson, Jen Psaki, saying that her country was \n\"appalled by today's disgraceful shelling.\"  The United States also demanded that  Israel do far more to prevent \ncivilian casualties  and urged an investigation into the disturbing number of strikes on United Nations shelters.\n\nFaced with international recrimination, Israel said that it was \"reviewing the consequences of this strike.\"  But Israel \nwas also bristling from the criticism received from the United States.  Nevertheless,  Israel announced that it would  \nunilaterally hold fire for several hours across most of the Gaza Strip on Aug. 4, 2014 in order to allow humanitarian \naid to flow into the region, and also to allow some displaced  Palestinians to go  home. It was, of course, an open \nquestion as to whether or not they would have habitable homes where they could return. Israel also warned that if \nHamas or other Palestinians violated the \"hold fire\" window from 10 am to 5 pm, they would return fire.\n\nViolence at the hands of Hamas also prevailed with the Palestinian terror group  resuming its barrage of rocket \nsalvoes into Israeli territory, effectively ensuring that the cycle of violence would  continue.  On Aug. 3, 2014, alone, \nHamas had fired  as many as 80 rockets into Israeli territory.  In one incident, a rocket was shot down by  Israel's \nIron Dome interceptor system but not before shrapnel fell inside a Tel Aviv playground.  Siren alarms ensured that \npeople had taken cover and thus there was no injury; however, the incident was illustrative of the threat posed by \nHamas' relentless rocket attacks. Meanwhile, in the southern Gaza Strip, Israeli forces unearthed a store of more \nthan  150 mortar bombs ostensibly intended to cause harm to Israelis.\n\nThe temporary truce instituted on Aug 4, 2014, by Israel ended with both sides accusing one another of carrying \nout attacks.  Palestinians claimed that Israel bombed a refugee camp in Gaza City that left one child dead and \nseveral others injured.  On the other side of the equation, Israel  pointed out that Hamas fired rockets from Gaza \nthat landed in Israeli territory during the time of the strike.  Hamas leaders, though, made it known that they had not \nsigned onto Israel's humanitarian ceasefire so they were carrying out their \"resistance\" operation against Israel as \nwas their right. That resistance operation --  which included using concrete intended for the construction of Gaza \ninfrastructure instead to build tunnels -- was precisely what sparked the chaos and conflict now rocking Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, some Palestinians were apparently willing to take up arms against Israelis. On Aug. 4, 2014,  one man \nusing an excavator to run over and kill an Israeli in an apparent terrorist attack in Jerusalem. The man also rammed \na bus; however, because there were no passengers in the vehicle, that attack yielded no casualties.  The incident \nended when Israeli police eliminated the terrorist. In a separate attack, a Palestinian gunman shot and badly injured \nan Israeli soldier close to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem; the assailant was able to escape on a motorcycle.  \nRioting at the  Temple Mount left five police officers wounded.\n\nSuch  tactics were not likely to persuade Israel to end its operation in Gaza.  Instead, Israel was more likely to dig \nin its heels and insist on calm and security before withdrawing from Gaza. Sure enough, while  Prime Minister \nNetanyahu had earlier indicated that the effort to disrupt and destroy Hamas' tunnel network was coming to an end, \nthe Jerusalem attacks may have reinforced Israel's commitment to broader security goals in Gaza.  Israeli military \nspokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said its operations -- including aerial bombardment -- \"against \nterrorist infrastructures in Gaza\" would be resumed.  He said in an interview with BBC News,  \"The mission is not \ntime bound, but rather goal bound.\"Likewise, a statement from the prime minister's office read as follows: \"The \ncampaign in the Gaza Strip goes on. What is about to end is the Israeli military's handling of the tunnels, but the \noperation will end only when a prolonged period of quiet and security is restored to Israel's citizens.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Hamas has remained essentially isolated in the Middle East throughout the duration of this \nconflict. Many Arab countries have been notably silent in regards to the actions of Hamas.  While several Arab \ncountries have condemned the civilian death toll in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive operation, they have been \nnot seen fit to issue statements justifying the actions of  the extremist Palestinian terror group.  Indeed, most Arab \ncountries have conveyed no support whatsoever for Hamas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Arab Spring of 2011 and the ensuing years, many Arab countries were now wary of extremist \nIslamist populism that was now creating havoc in Libya, Syria, and beyond, and which had brought Morsi and the \nMuslim Brotherhood to power in Egypt.  In fact, Egypt under Morsi had been far more sympathetic to Hamas, \nwhereas the new  military-backed government of Egypt had its eye on security and was making it clear it was no \nfriend of Hamas. Cast against this background, the vast majority of Arab nation states in the Middle East were \nessentially willing to let Israel do the \"dirty work\" of dealing with Hamas, which they viewed as the Palestinian \nversion of extremist Islamist populism that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe Egyptian media has been particularly harsh in criticizing the Hamas leadership for living in the lap of luxury -- \noutside of Gaza --  while the Palestinian civilian population suffered the consequences of the conflict with Israel.  \nBut the criticism was coming from other quarters as well.  On Aug. 3, 2014, the security chief for Dubai (United Arab \nEmirates) uttered a rhetorical blow against Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, who has found safe haven in Qatar.  \nVia the social media outlet, Dhahi Khalfan wrote: \"Hamas must cease firing rockets at Israel and accept the \nEgyptian ceasefire proposal, accept the Saudi leadership, and abandon Qatar.\"  He added, \"He who lives in \nluxurious five-star hotels in Qatar cannot meet achievements for the Palestinians. The Palestinians must unite \naround Abu Mazen (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas).\"\n\nBut in truth, it was Hamas and not Abbas who was influencing Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nAs of the start of August 2014, more than 1,800 Palestinians, mostly civilians, had been killed, in the Gaza conflict.  \nOn the other side of the equation, about 65 Israeli soldiers died in clashes with Hamas terrorists, while three \ncivilians died on the Israeli side as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks.\n\nDespite the  repeated failed attempts at a ceasefire, late on Aug. 4, 2014, a fresh truce was finally announced with \nboth the Israeli and Palestinian authorities agreeing to the Egyptian-brokerd deal.  That truce went forward with \nIsrael withdrawing its ground forces from Gaza and without any violations on either side as of Aug. 7, 2014.\n\nWith the agreement set to expire a day later, negotiations in Egypt were afoot to attempt to extend the ceasefire.  \nWhile the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority were supportive of an extension of the truce, Hamas \nwas threatening to withdraw from the agreement if it did not gain any concessions from Israel. These concessions \nincluded an end to the blockade on Gaza and control over the Rafa border crossing into Egypt.  In truth, no such \nend of the blockade was likely to be possible without addressing Israel's security concerns.  It was also highly \ndebatable as to whether the Egyptian government would be willing to allow a terrorist group to hold sway over a \ncrossing into its sovereign territory.\n\nIsraeli's security concerns were being illustrated by video footage made available by international journalists \nshowing Hamas terrorists launching attacks from civilian areas within Gaza.  The video footage appeared to bolster \nIsrael's argument that Hamas was indeed prepared to carry out provocative  attacks from heavily populated areas, \nsometimes using human shields, and certainly with an eye on increasing the civilian death toll for politically \nadvantageous reasons.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2014, despite the fact that the government of Israel and Palestinian negotiators said they favored an \nextension of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas made clear it was rejecting the move.  Hamas said that Israel had \nnot met its demands (intimated above).  Before the expiration of the existing ceasefire, and in clear violation of that \nagreement, Hamas was shooting rockets once again into Israeli territory.  Israel responded by resuming air strikes \non Gaza.\n\nBy Aug. 10, 2014, after two days of renewed violence, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had agreed to a  new 72-\nhour ceasefire in the Gaza.  The fresh truce was to go into effect on Aug. 11, 2014, and this time had the \nconcurrence of not only of the Israeli government and the mainstream Palestinian Authority, but also Hamas.  There \nwere high hopes that the new ceasefire agreement would provide the foundation for negotiations to take place, \nwhich would be aimed at forging a comprehensive and durable deal.  Such an agreement would end the bloodshed \nand -- ideally --  meet some of the security demands of Israel, while easing the blockade on Gaza.\n\nHowever, on Aug. 13, 2014, sirens were heard in Israel in response to apparent rocket attacks being fired from \nGaza.  Israeli authorities said the rockets landed in an open area near Ashkelon.  Clearly, such actions would be in \nviolation of the fresh truce that was still in effect on this day. It should be noted that Hamas denied being \nresponsible for the rocket attack; however, with Hamas controlling militant activity in Gaza, their denial was being \nviewed with grave skepticism.\n\nIsrael was soon launching air strikes on Gaza, which were aimed at \"terror sites\" in Gaza.\n\nThere remained high hopes that these developments would not affect ongoing negotiations in Egypt, which were \naimed at forging a comprehensive and durable ceasefire deal.  For the shorter term, both sides agreed to an \nextension to the prevailing truce for a five  more days.\n\nBy Aug. 19, 2014, as the truce was set to expire, Palestinian militant terrorists launched fresh rocket attacks into \nIsraeli territory.  The first volley of rockets landed close to Beersheba while the Iron Dome system intercepted two \nrockets in Netivot. That being said,  sirens were sounding the alarm for Israelis to rush to safe rooms in their homes \nand offices in Tel Aviv as further rockets were lobbed in the direction of Israel's largest city. Not satisfied to simply \nhurl rockets into Israeli territory, Hamas' armed wing issued a clear threat of terrorism against Israel, saying that a \n\"gateway to hell\" had been opened and that it would now actively\n\ntarget Israel's Ben-Gurion International Airport.\n\nAs noted by Mark Regev, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the rocket attacks \nconstituted \"a grave and direct violation of the ceasefire\" and essentially ended the negotiations process in Egypt.  \nRegev said, \"The Cairo talks were based on an agreed premise of a total cessation of hostilities. When Hamas \nbreaks the ceasefire, they also break the premise for the Cairo talks. Accordingly, the Israeli team has been called \nback.\"\n\nBut the negotiations were already in jeopardy since there was little concurrence between the Palestinian and Israeli \nsides on certain key issues such as Hamas' disarmament and the end of a blockade on Gaza. Given this lack of \ndiplomatic progress, in conjunction with extremist Palestinians' decision to resume attacks on Israel, it was clear \nthat no comprehensive and durable ceasefire deal would soon be produced.\n\n\n\nLate on Aug. 19, 2014, in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian extremists,  the clear violation of the \nprevailing ceasefire, and the ongoing threats of terrorism by Hamas, Israeli renewed its air strikes on Gaza.  By \nAug. 20, 2014, Palestinian militants had lobbed more than 80 rockets into Israel, while Israeli had carried out more \nthan 60 air strikes into Gaza in retaliation.  Israel had also targeted Mohammed Deif,  the military head of Hamas' \nIzz al-Din al-Qassam brigades, in one strike.  That event killed Deif's wife and child rather than Deif himself.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2014, Israeli strikes targeted and eliminated three top Hamas commanders in the southern part of the \nGaza Strip.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2014, an Israeli strike flattened an apartment block in Gaza that Israeli authorities said functioned as a \nHamas command center.  Prior to that event, Israeli aircrafts fired non-explosive rockets at the building to alert \nresidents of the impending strike, which ultimately injured 17 people.\n\nOn the same day, an Israeli strike on a commercial center in the  Gaza town of Rafah left three people injured.\n\nA day later on Aug. 24, 2014, Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Palestinian civilians to vacate any \nstructures where Hamas militants were located.  Netanyahu issued the following warning publicly: \"I call on the \ninhabitants of Gaza to evacuate immediately from every site from which Hamas is carrying out terrorist activity. \nEvery one of these places is a target for us.\"  On the same day, 10 homes including one that was owned by a \nleading member of Hamas member, were destroyed in an air strike in the town of Khan Younis.  Several people \nwere injured in that aerial attack as a result of airborne debris; however, there were no deaths thanks to another \nwarning using non-explosive rocket fire.\n\nDeath visited  Gaza city as a result of an Israeli strike on a Hamas official, Mohammed al-Ghoul, whom Israel \ndescribed as being an orchestrator of \"terror fund transactions.\"  Other fatalities were reported as a result of the \nbombing of the Jabalya refugee camp; a woman and three children were among the victims.\n\nOn Aug. 25, 2014, a strike on a mosque in Gaza city killed a 17-year-old boy and injured another 25 people.  On \nAug. 26. 2014, Israel carried out strikes on two Gaza buildings housing both apartments and commercial \nenterprises.  Because warnings were issued prior to the strikes on the  Basha Tower and the Italian Complex, the \nonly casualties reported involved injuries to 25 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian terrorists continued to hurl hundreds of rockets and mortars into Israeli territory, sparking \nsiren alerts in Israel. The Iron Dome system did its job of intercepting several of the rocket assaults into southern \nIsrael  however several Israelis were wounded in a mortar attack at the Erez border crossing.  Separately on Aug. \n22, 2014, a mortar attack killed a four-year-old boy.\n\nAs before the rhetorical war was occurring alongside the military engagement.  Hamas accused Israel of war \ncrimes, with little regard for its own actions in the dynamic of violence, or its blatant use of human shields.  At the \nsame, while Israel  spared fer words for its own role, and instead blamed Hamas for operating amidst the non-\ncombatant population, thus ultimately causing Palestinian civilian casualties.\n\nAs August 2014 was drawing to a close, Israel made clear that it was not interested in returning to the negotiating \ntable unless Palestinians ceased their rocket assaults. Justice Minister Tzipi Livni -- typically an advocate for the \npeace process -- said in an interview with the Israeli media that a ceasefire would have to be the foundation for any \nrenewed negotiations. \"Israel is not ready to talk while under fire.\"  Livni's stance was illustrative of the overall \nfrustration shared by Israeli citizens of all political persuasions with regard to Hamas. To that end, Livni made it \n\n\n\nclear that the Israeli government had no intention of entering any agreement with the Palestinians that would reward \nHamas in any way.\n\nALERT:\n\nNote that on Aug. 26, 2014, a long-term ceasefire in Gaza was agreed upon by Israelis and Palestinians.  The  \ntruce was brokered by Egypt and included no timeline for termination.  The deal called for an easing of the blockade \nof Gaza, while facilitating talks that would deal with the diarmament of Palestinian extremists in Gaza and controls \non the transfer of weapons into Gaza. The deal, however, offered no promises regarding Hamas' demands for  a \nsea port, an airport, and prisoner releases.  Nevertheless, in Gaza, Palestinians were taking to the streets to \ncelebrate with Hamas-sympathizers declaring \"victory,\" while in Israel, the government was claiming that it had \ndelivered a \"devastating\" blow to Hamas.  In truth, Hamas had not achieved many of its central goals in this conflict \ndespite the cost of more than 2,000 Palestinian lives.  On the other side of the equation, Israel could not truly claim \nto have crippled Hamas, which continued to hurl rockets into Israeli territory even as the latest ceasefire was being \nannounced.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian collapse to new low over  brutally slaying of four Jewish rabbis, death of Palestinian minister, and \nplan for new \"national rights\" for Jewish citizens --\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2014, two Palestinians from East Jerusalem armed with a gun, axes and meat cleavers carried out a \nbarbaric attack on Jewish worshippers who were praying at a West Jerusalam synagogue.  Four Jewish rabbis and \na Druze police officer died, while several other people were seriously injured  as a result of the horrific massacre.  A \nmilitary wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, known as the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, quickly \nclaimed responsibility for the bloodshed.\n\nThe brutal killing of the Jewish rabbis and the Druze police officer  by Palestinian terrorists on Nov. 18, 2014, was \nonly the latest episode in a spate of attacks on civilians.  In the first week of November 2014, Palestinians in \nJerusalem used their vehicles to run down pedestrians, killing four people.  On Nov. 10, 2014,  two Israelis -- and \nIsraeli soldier and a female civilian -- were stabbed to death in separate incidents of violence. The soldier was \nstabbed and killed at a train station in Tel Aviv; the woman was stabbed and killed at the Alon Shvut Jewish \nsettlement in the West Bank.  A day later on Nov. 11, 2014,  clashes broke out in Hebron when approximately 150 \nPalestinians hurled  stones and Molotov cocktails at a convoy of Israeli soldiers.  In the melee that followed, as \nIsraeli forces sought to disperse the crowds,  a young Palestinian man was shot to death during clashes with the \nIsraeli army.  As well, a Palestinian gunman on a motorcycle shot and wounded a well-known Jewish activist who \nwas advocating greater access for Jews to the Temple Mount.\n\nThese developments were illustrative of increasing Israeli-Palestinian tensions, and augured the possibility of a \nfresh Palestinian Intifada.  Palestinians said relations were devolving in response to  Israeli settlement plans in East \nJerusalem as well as the Jewish call for prayer rights at the holy Dome of the Rock (located on the Temple Mount in \nthe Old City of Jerusalem).  The sensitivity of these moves would likely give significant weight to the Palestinian  \nview.  However, Israeli authorities have placed the blame on the Palestinian leadership for inciting violence that has \nleft random Israeli civilians dead. Despite the Israeli government's insistence that there would be no change to the \nsecurity regulations preventing Jews from worshipping at the Temple Mount, Palestinian leaders have suggested \notherwise, fueling tensions ever further.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' incendiary claim that Israel was starting a \"religious war\" and his call for \nPalestinians to \"protect\" the Temple Mount was likely to further bolster Israel's claim on that score.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau warned that the spate of violence would not go unanswered and that his \ngovernment would respond to \"terror being directed at all parts of the country.\"  In a speech to the Israeli \nparliament, he said, \"Terror ... is being directed at all parts of the country for a simple reason: the terrorists, the \ninciters, want to drive us from everywhere.\"  He continued, \"As far as they are concerned, we should not be in \nJerusalem, Tel Aviv, or anywhere. I can promise you one thing -- they will not succeed. We will continue to fight \nterror ... and we will defeat it together.\"\n\nBut before Israel could make headway in the fight to defend itself from Palestinian terrorism, the horrific attacks at \nthe synagogue in West Jerusalem described above had transpired on Nov. 18, 2014.\n\nTwo Palestinians from East Jerusalem armed with a gun, axes, and meat cleavers stormed the Bnei Torah Kehilat \nYaakov synagogue and seminary site  on Harav Shimon Agassi Street in the mostly Jewish Orthodox Har Nof \nneighbourhood of West Jerusalem.\n\nScreaming \"God is great!\" in Arabic, they proceeded to carry out a heinous massacre with worshippers as the \nprimary victims. Four Jewish rabbis and a Druze police officer died, while several other people were seriously \ninjured  as a result of the horrific violence, which included attempts by the assailants to hack  and shoot the victims \nto death.\n\nA shootout between  the Palestinian terrorists  and  police ensued, and the assailants --  Uday and Ghassan Abu \nJamal -- were ultimately killed in the exchange of fire.  A military wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine,  known as the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, quickly claimed responsibility for the bloodshed.\n\nFour of the five victims were soon identified as  Rabbi Moshe Twersky, the head of the seminary, Arieh Kupinsky,  \nKalman Levine, and Avraham Goldberg. It should be noted that the first three of the victims listed  were dual \ncitizens of the United States and Israel, while the fourth victim was a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Israel. \nThe fifth victim was Zidan Seif, a police officer who was on the scene and came under attack, ultimately dying at \nthe Hadassah hospital.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vociferously condemned the killings, and placed the blame for the \nviolence on Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for \"inciting\" extremists.\n\nHe also demanded that the West react with the expected level of furor, saying: \"I call on all leaders of countries in \nthe Western world: I want to see outrage over this massacre.\" The United States was the first country to answer \nNetanyahu's call with President Barack Obama declaring,  \"There is and can be no justification for such attacks \nagainst innocent civilians.\"  He warned, \"The murderers for today's outrageous acts represent the kind of extremism \nthat threatens to bring all of the Middle East into the kind of spiral from which it's very difficult to emerge.\"\n\nHamas had a very different reaction to the grizzly killings.  As reported by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, a \nspokesperson for Hamas responded as follows:  \"The new operation is heroic and a natural reaction to Zionist \ncriminality against our people and our holy places. We have the full right to revenge for the blood of our martyrs in \nall possible means.\"  To be utterly clear, Hamas was essentially sanctioning the synagogue massacre.\n\nA cousin of the two terrorists who carried out the massacre not only lauded the murders but called for more \nbloodshed.  Huda Abu Jamal said of his cousins, \"I salute Odai and Ghassan for this heroic act.\"  He added, \"Every \nPalestinian should strike.\"\n\nWhile Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued his own condemnation of the bloodshed, Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu quickly dismissed the gesture, noting that it was not enough, and that Abbas was instrumental \n\n\n\nin inciting Palestinians to violence.  Netanyahu pointed out that Abbas and Hamas had made the claim that a bus \ndriver who committed suicide in East Jerusalem on Nov. 17, 2014, was \"murdered by Jews.\" The erroneous and \nhighly inflammatory claim no doubt heightened tensions; however, there was no conclusive evidence of a link \nbetween the dissemination of such misinformation and the synagogue massacre.  Moreover, some Palestinians \nwere questioning the findings of the forensic autopsy that showed evidence consistent with suicide.\n\nThat being said, in the immediate aftermath of these acts of pure brutality, videotaped footage was made available \nof Palestinians in Gaza celebrating the murder of the Jewish rabbis. Such expositions of pleasure over the \ngruesome hacking and shooting deaths of four men of the cloth -- while in prayer -- were not likely  resonate \npositively with the global community.\n\nThat global public has become increasingly weary of extremists willing to use revolting measures to advance their \npolitical measures.\n\nIn the aftermath of Israel's hardline 50-day war on Gaza in mid-2014, which left thousands of Palestinians dead \n(with many of them being children), the pro-Palestinian side of the divide had garnered the sympathy of the world, \nessentially \"winning\" the public relations debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  While many countries abhored \nthe tactics of the terror group Hamas, which the Palestinian authorities brought into government, the gobal \ncommunity was nevertheless highly disturbed  by the fact that Israel's effort to disrupt and destroy Hamas' tunnel \nnetwork was actually killing more civilians than terrorists.  However, in November 2014, the world was being \npresented with a new vista -- one marked by appalling murderous acts, and highlighted acutely by the sight of \nPalestinian civilians celebrating those acts.\n\nThat new vista was further accentuated by  reports  from the Jerusalem Post about disturbing Palestinian songs \nlionizing and inciting the killing of Israelis.  One such song issued praise of a so-called \"car intifada\" in which \nPalestinian militants were urged to  purposely drive into crowds of Israelis.  Lyrics in the song included \"\"Zionist run \naway, run away Zionist, you are about to be killed by a car\"  and was accompanied by a shocking animated video. \nAnother Palestinian song of the same ilk was titled \"Run Over the Settler.\"\n\nThe songs appeared to reflect a shifting landscape in the region whereby individual Palestinians were being \nencouraged to use cars and butcher knives to kill Israelis.  Whereas previous acts of violence have been marked by \nsuicide bombings, the hallmark of this new burst of bloodshed has been carried out by \"lone wolves\" ploughing into \ncivilians with cars and  hacking civilians to death with knives and axes.  These barbaric methods of assassination \nwere  reminiscent of Islamic State-type executions in Iraq and Syria and, in fact, were being advocated by that \nnotorious terror entity in its global Jihadist mission.  It was to be seen if Palestinian Islamic militants would actually \nalign with Islamic State or simply borrow the group's strategies.\n\nRegardless, the cycle of violence would go on, given Israel's clear record of never letting acts of Palestinian \nterrorism go unanswered. To this end, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's promise of \"heavy\" retribution \nfor the synagogue massacre.  Indeed, the Israeli leader wasted no time in ordering the destruction of the homes of \nthe attackers, as he said,  \"We are in a battle over Jerusalem, our eternal capital.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu then \npromised to  \"settle the score with every terrorist\" saying that those \"who want to uproot us from our state and \ncapital... will not succeed.\" The Israeli prime minister called for national unity in the face of tragedy, but also warned \nIsraelis to exercise restraint and let the appropriate process run its course.  To this end, Netanyahu  said, \"No one \nmust take the law into their own hands, even if spirits are riled and blood is boiling.\"\n\nBut Netanyahu's warning went unheeded. In the West Bank,  Israeli settlers attacked a school in the village of Urif \nto the south of Nablus.  The incident sparked clashes  and left five Palestinians injured. In Hebron to the south of \nthe West Bank, Israeli settlers  attacked Palestinian cars.  Meanwhile, there were reports of Israelis chanting \"Death \nto Arabs\" during a rally in Jerusalem. Clearly, the animosity was building on both sides.\n\n\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian hostility promised to sink to even newer lows when on Nov. 19, 2014, Israel announced that it \nhad  approved the construction of almost 80 new homes in two settlements in the West Bank.  The move was \nguaranteed to inflame tensions. A  spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas reacted to the news of \nthe new settlement permits as follows: \"These decisions are a continuation of the Israeli government's policy to \ncause more tension, push towards further escalation, and waste any chance to create an atmosphere for calm.\" To \ndate, Israeli settlement activity has been a continuing source of consternation and a prevailing obstacle to the \npeace process.\n\nIn late November 2014, obstacles to the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians only increased when \nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu advocated legislation that would solidify Israel's status as a Jewish nation state. \nThe legislation would \"uphold the individual rights of all of Israel's citizens\" (presumably including Arab Israelis) but \npreserve \"national rights\" for Jewish people alone.  Netanyahu's support for the legislation was believed to be \ndriven by a desire to curry favor with hardliners in his right-wing Likud party and retain his leadership position.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu defended his support for the bill, saying that it would guarantee \"Israel's character as the \nnational state of the Jewish people.\"  Critics, however, have said that the only thing it would guarantee was legal \ndescrimination with two categories of citizens.\n\nWhile the controversial measure won support in the Israeli parliament, it was rejected by Israeli President Reuven \nRivlin who warned that the bill was contrary to the notion of equality for Arab citizens envisioned by Israel's \nfounders. The president said, \"The formulators of the Declaration of Independence, with much wisdom, insisted the \nArab communities in Israel, as well as other groups, should not feel as the Jews had felt in exile.\"  Of note was the \nfact that while the 1948 declaration proclaimed Israel to be a Jewish state, it also enshrined the country with \ndemocratic values and  promised \"complete equality\" for all citizens of Israel. Also of signficance was the fact that \nthis criticism was coming from Rivlin -- a right-wing politicians who was well known for his opposition to an \nindependent state for Palestinians and instead in favor of a confederation model.  The fact that he found the \nlegislation at stake to be anti-democratic was regarded as highly relevant.\n\nIn the first part of December 2014, Israeli-Palestinian relations sunk to a new low following the death of a \nPalestinian cabinet minister during an altercation with Israeli police.  Ziad Abu Ein,  a minister without portfolio, was \namong several  activists stopped at an Israeli checkpoint en route to a demonstration aimed at protesting Jewish \nsettlements.  The actual \"protest action\" was intended to be the planting of  olive tree saplings on some land close \nto the Jewish settlement of Shiloh.\n\nAccording to reports, an altercation ensued and Israeli security forces used tear gas and sound grenades to \ndisperse the crowd.  In the fracas that ensued. Abu Ein  was grabbed by an Israeli police officer at the throat and \nshoved. It was not known if he was additionally hit by a tear gas cannister.  Regardless, he soon became faint, fell \nto the ground, and died on the way to the hospital.\n\nHis actual cause of death was unknown at the time of writing although an autopsy was scheduled to be carried out.  \nVideo footage furnished by Reuters News indicated that Abu Ein was not resisting Israeli police with any \naggression. Thus, that Reuters video footage promised to increase the controversy surrounding the already-\nshocking news of a death of a Palestinian cabinet minister.  Perhaps mindful of this impending fallout, Israeli  \nDefense Minister Moshe Yaalon expressed regret for the minister's death in a statement. But Palestinian President \nMahmoud Abbas reacted passionately, describing the death of Abu Ein as  \"a barbaric act which we cannot be \nsilent about or accept\" and promised that consequences would be in the offing.\n\nNote: For its part, the Israeli military said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Abu Ein's death.\n\n\n\nSpecial Report\n\nU.N. Security Council rejects call for Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories; Palestinians move to join ICC --\n\nWith the hardline government moving to solidify special national rights for Jews in israel and with the peace \nprocess a distant memory, the international community's patience waiting for an independent Palestinian state was \nbeing exhausted.  Already, several countries around the world recognized Palestine as a nation state, irrespective \nof Israel's objections, the stymied peace process, as well as obstacles at the United Nations Security Council \nwhere Western permanent members, such as the United States, have insisted on a negotiated settlement as the \nonly vehicle to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nBut Palestinians gained a powerful boost at the start of December 2014 when the Socialist-dominated French \nparliament voted to recognize Palestine.  The move was symbolic and was not expected to directly influence the \nstatus of Palestine internationally.  However, it was a  clear sign that even major European powers -- including a \nveto-wielding permanent Security Council member like France -- were frustrated by the stalled peace process. \nAlready, other European countries, such as Sweden and Spain, had taken similar symbolic measures as their \nparliaments \"blessed\" the non-binding resolutions calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nPalestinians have continued to insist that their only option is to pursue recognition unilaterally while Israel has said \nthat this latest move will only make a negotiated settlement more difficult.  A statement by the Israeli Foreign \nMinistry read as follows: \"Israel believes that the vote ... will only jeopardize the possibility of reaching an \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Palestinians took their cause to the United Nations, putting forth a resolution calling for Israel to \nwithdraw from Palestinian territories by late 2017.  But the draft measure went down to defeat in the United Nations \nSecurity Council, failing to garner the requisite nine votes needed to pass the measure. The outcome was not a \nsurprise since Western delegations had warned the Palestinians that there was no appetite for a controversial vote \nahead of Israel's elections in 2015.  However, the Palestinians were eager to move forward in the face of this \ncautionary guidance.\n\nIt should be noted that even if that nine vote threshold had been passed, the measure would have ultimately been \ndefeated by the United States -- one of the  veto-wielding permanent members of the  United Nations Security \nCouncil. Samantha Power, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, defended her country's stance \nagainst the Palestinians' unilateral approach and in favor of a negotiated peace agreement, saying,  \"The United \nStates every day searches for new ways to take constructive steps to support the parties in making progress toward \nachieving a negotiated settlement. The Security Council resolution put before us today is not one of those \nconstructive steps.\"  She added,\n\n\"This text addresses the concerns of only one side.\"\n\nUndeterred by the failure of the draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council discussed above, the \nPalestinians followed up by advancing a bid to join the International Criminal Court (ICC).  To this end, Palestinian \nPresident Mahmoud Abbas signed the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the ICC.  Given the Palestinians' \nupgraded status of \"non-member observer state\" at the United Nations General Assembly, the chances of the \nPalestinians qualifying to join the Rome Statute were strong.\n\nFor its part,  Israel responded to this move to join the ICC  by halting the  transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinian \nAuthority. Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat condemned the move to hold the transfer of $127 million collected \n\n\n\non behalf of the Palestinian Authority, calling it a \"new war crime.\" An anonymous Israeli official responded to this \nvituperative  accusation from Erekat in an interview with the Haaretz newspaper, saying, \"It is the Palestinian \nAuthority -- which is in a unity government with Hamas, an avowed terrorist organization that, like ISIS [Islamic \nState], perpetrates war crimes -- that needs to be concerned about the ICC.\"\n\nNote that in January 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon confirmed that the Palestinians would \nofficially become a member of the International Criminal Court on April 1, 2015.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nExchange of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah leaves two Israeli soldiers and a peacekeeper dead\n\nIn the worst eruption of violence between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah since the 2006 war, Israeli forces \nand Hezbollah fighters exchanged fire at the end of January 2015,  leaving two Israeli soldiers and a Spanish \npeacekeeper dead. The two Israeli soldiers died  when Hezbollah fired five missiles at a convoy of Israeli military \nvehicles along the border with Lebanon.  The Spanish  peacekeeper, who was serving as part of a United Nations  \nmonitoring mission in southern Lebanon died when Israel responded to the assault by Hezbollah with artillery fire \nand air strikes.  Hezbollah wasted little time claiming responsibility for the eruption of violence, saying that its attack \non Israel was carried out in retaliation for an Israeli air strike in southern Syria that killed an Iranian general and \nseveral members of Hezbollah weeks earlier.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised retribution, \nsaying \"Those behind the attack today will pay the full price.\"  Across the border in Lebanon, supporters of \nHezbollah in southern Beirut shot gunfire into the air in celebration of the killing of the Israeli soldiers.  But other \nresidents of the city were preparing to evacuate Beirut in the event that Israel made good on its promise of \nretribution, and with the memory of the devastation associated with the 2006 war still fresh in their memories.  That \nbeing said, with an election in Israel looming ahead, there was deep skepticism that Netanyahu would pursue a \nmilitary effort against Hezbollah anytime soon.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nSpecial Report:  United States-Israeli relations at new low due to Israeli PM Netanyahu's address to Congress on \nIranian nuclear program\n\nHighlights:\n\n- President Obama and PM Netanyahu at odds over Iranian nuclear negotiations\n- Key Democrats boycott speech in protest of Speaker Boehner's invitation to Israeli PM only weeks ahead of \nelection and in violation of White House protocols\n- Mossad report differs from Netanyahu's claims in United Nations speech about timing of Iran nuclear breakout \nthreat\n\n- 47 Republican senators dispatch letter to leader of Iran in attempt to put curbs on diplomatic process\n\n- Despite diplomatic contretemps between U.S. and Israel, progress still being made during multilateral nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran\n\nIn detail:\n\nA diplomatic contretemps was brewing between the United States and Israel in the latter part of January 2015 \nwhen United States  House Speaker John Boehner (Republican) invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu \n\n\n\nto address Congress without first consulting the White House, as is normal practice. Even with this breach of \nprotocol, Netanyahu accepted Boehner's irregular invitation.\n\nAt the heart of Boehner's overture to Netanyahu was President Obama's State of the Union warning that he would \nveto any legislation from Congress for new sanctions against Iran while tough multilateral negotiations were still \nongoing. At issue was the effort to forge a deal with Tehran that would prevent that country from manufacturing \nnuclear weapons. Those multilateral negotiations were advanced precisely with the understanding that the United \nStates would not introduce fresh sanctions while talks continued. President Obama noted that new sanctions would \ndeliver the message to the international community that the United States was operating under bad faith. But \nknowing that the Israeli prime minister has long opposed the talks with Iran in the first place, Boehner was making \nthe calculation that Netanyahu could influence members of Congress to act on sanctions in contravention to \nPresident Obama's stance.\n\nThat very calculation to undermine the United States president by calling on a foreign leader to offer a \ncountervailing foreign policy view in the chambers of Congress soon erupted into a foreign relations fracas. \nBoehner's irregular invitation to Netanyahu without first seeking concurrence from the White House was already a \nsource of controversy.  However, the situation devolved further when it was revealed that the Israeli Ambassador to \nthe United States, Ron Dermer, planned the invitation in concert with Boehner, believing that it would boost \nNetanyahu's prospects at the polls in Israeli elections set for March 2015.  The sordid nature of that blatantly \npolitical move was intensified when it was revealed that Dermer did not notify United States Secretary of State John \nKerry of the move during a meeting with the United States' top diplomat.\n\nSuch machinations have been regarded at best as suspect, and at worst, as duplicitous. Indeed, the moves evoked \ncondemnation from the opposition Labor bloc in Israel, which warned that Netanyahu's address would damage \nrelations with the Obama White House. The possible consequences to United States-Israeli ties appeared to be a \nreal risk and was being discussed among the Israeli cognescenti. In Israel's leading daily newspaper, Yedioth \nAhronoth, former diplomat Alon Pinkas wrote: \"These relations are the greatest strategic asset that Israel has had \nsince its establishment. Netanyahu has harmed, weakened, and finally destroyed the interpersonal channel (with \nthe U.S. president) and created an unprecedented rift in the relations between president and prime minister.\"\n\nAt home in the United States, former United States Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, entered the fray, warning:  \n\"Netanyahu is using the Republican Congress for a photo-op for his election campaign....Unfortunately, the U.S. \nrelationship will take the hit. It would be far wiser for us to stay out of their politics and for them to stay out of ours.\"\n\nThee situation devolved even further when Netanyahu asked Boehner to change the date of the proposed address \nto Congress from February 2015 to March 2015 -- only weeks ahead of the Israeli elections the prime minister \nhoped to win.\n\nIn a rebuke to Israel, the Obama White House soon announced that United President Obama would not meet with \nNetanyahu while the Israeli Prime Minister was in the United States at Capitol Hill in March 2015.  The White House \nmade clear that such a meeting would be entirely inappropriate, given the proximity to the Israeli elections. A more \nvivid view of the Obama White House's outrage  was illuminated with the release of an anonymous quote by a \nUnited States official, which was published by Israel's Haaretz newspaper.  That newspaper quoted the unnamed \nUnited States official as saying, \"We thought we've seen everything. But Bibi managed to surprise even us. There \nare things you simply don't do. He spat in our face publicly and that's no way to behave. Netanyahu ought to \nremember that President Obama has a year and a half left to his presidency, and that there will be a price.\"\n\nNote that in the first week of February 2015, Israeli Ambassador Dermer met with key Congressional Democrats in \nan effort to smooth tensions that had arisen over Netanyahu's irregular speech to be given before Congress.  \n\n\n\nDermer appeared to place the blame on House Speaker Boehner for the diplomatic crisis, suggesting that the \nspeaker of the House of Representatives had misled Israel into believing the invitation was a bipartisan one.  At the \nend of the day, those meetings did not appear to have yielded positive results for Dermer.  Instead, Jewish \nDemocrats in Congress blasted Dermer for his part in the brewing fiasco, while  House Minority Leader Nancy \nPelosi urged that the speech be postponed, noting under the current conditions it would be \"inappropriate.\"\n\nExacerbating the situation was the news that  Congressman John Lewis -- a known civil rights icon -- would be \nboycotting the Nentanyahu address.  In the House of Representatives,  Representative John Clyburn, one of the \nhighest ranking Democrats in the lower chamber, along with Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the head of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus, Representative Jim McDermott and others all said they would not be attending \nthe Netanyahu address. Representative Earl Blumenauer went so far as to write an artice in The Huffington Post \nexplaining his decision. In that piece, he said that the Constitution \"vests the responsibility for foreign affairs in the \npresident.\"\n\nThe list of prominent Democrats boycotting the Netanyahu speech grew  with Senator Bernie Sanders casting the \nevent as \"wrong,\" and saying he would skip it.  Senator Patrick Leahy not only announced his own boycott of the \nspeech, but paired it with a searing rebuke of the Republican-led Congress.  He said: \"They [House leaders] have \norchestrated a tawdry and high-handed stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself. It has \nlong been an unwritten rule and practice through the decades that when it comes to American foreign policy, we \nspeak and act thoughtfully, with one voice when we can, with the national interests of the United States as our \nuppermost consideration, and with caution about the unintended consequences of unilateral actions like this. They \nhave diminished that valuable precedent.\"  Also of note was the decision by Senator Brian Schatz -- a Jewish \nDemocrat from  the president's home state of Hawaii --  who said he would not attend the Netanyahu speech \n\"because it does more harm than good to the bipartisan U.S.-Israel alliance.\"  Schatz also added that he believed \nthe House Speaker issued the invitation to the Israeli prime minister for \"the apparent purpose of undermining \nPresident Obama's foreign policy prerogatives.\"\n\nDuring a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Obama was asked about the \nNetanyahu speech and, at first issued a diplomatic response, noting that it would be inappropriate to meet with any \nleader so soon ahead of an election.  He said, \"I think it's important for us to maintain these protocols \u2014-- because \nthe U.S.-Israeli relationship is not about a particular party.\"  But he added that as much as he loved the German \nleader, his White House would not have extended an invitation to her ahead of a general election in Germany, and \nhe added, \"And I am sure she would not have asked for one.\"  Chancellor Merkel responded with an emphatic \"no\" \nheadshake, making clear that she tacitly agreed that such a move would be a break in proper protocol.\n\nThe Obama White House also delivered its own more direct message to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the \ngovernment of Israel when it announced that Vice President Joe Biden -- typically a guaranteed presence at events \ninvolving foreign leaders -- would not be in attendance.  The Obama White House said that Vice President Biden \nwould be traveling on the day set for the Netanyahu address; the news could only be regarded as a snub by the \nadministration to the current Israeli government.\n\nA CNN poll released in February 2015, indicated that the vast majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- did not approve \nof House Speaker Boehner's move to sidestep President Obama  and invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to \nspeak before Congress, by-passing normal protocol. For his part, Netanyahu appeared to be undeterred by \ncriticisms of his speech, perhaps calculating that whatever ill will he was building in the United States would be \nvitiated by his political and nationalist gains at home just ahead of elections in Israel.\n\nThe rift between the United States and Israel deepened as February 2015 came to a close, reaching a new nadir \njust as Netanyahu was set to address to Congress in the first week of March 2015.\n\n\n\nOf note was Israeli Prime Minister Netanhayu's claim that the United States and other world powers had abandoned \ntheir vow to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb.  Speaking from Israel, Netanhayu accused the multilateral \nbloc, including the United States, of \"accepting that Iran will gradually, within a few years, will develop capabilities to \nproduce material for many nuclear weapons.\"  Netanyahu continued, saying, \"I respect the White House and the \npresident of the United States but on such a fateful matter, that can determine whether or not we survive, I must do \neverything to prevent such a great danger for Israel.\"\n\nKey members of the United States government hit back against Netanyahu forcefully and aggressively. United \nStates  Secretary of State John Kerry responded to the accusation from the Israeli leader by questioning \nNetanyahu's judgement on the issue.  Indeed, Secretary of State Kerry issued a rebuke of Netanyahu, saying, \"He \nmay have a judgment that just may not be correct here.\"  Expanding on his point after the latest round of \nnegotiations in Europe, the United States' top diplomat said, \"The president has made clear -- I can't state this more \nfirmly -- the policy is Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nSecretary of State Kerry went further by reminding the world of Netanyahu's questionable geopolitical acumen and  \nstrategic perspicacity when he noted that the Israeli leader \"was profoundly forward-leaning and outspoken about \nthe importance of invading Iraq under (President) George W. Bush, and we all know what happened with that \ndecision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another official in the United States government -- this time,  National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- \ncast the impending visit to the United States by Netanyahu as \"destructive to the fabric of the [bilateral] \nrelationship.\"  In an interview with Charlie Rose on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), National Security \nAdviser Rice said, \"We want the relationship between the United States and Israel to be unquestionably strong, \nimmutable... regardless of which party may be in charge in either country.\"  Her implication was that Netayahu's \nspeech, imbued now with political elements, could not be understood as anything other than partisan, and as such, \nwould have a negative impact on the bilateral ties between the United States and Israel.\n\nThe White House itself highlighted the problem in reducing the bilateral relationship to partisanship when \nspokesperson, Josh Ernest, said: \"The president has said the relationship between the United States  and Israel \ncan't just be reduced to a relationship between the Republican party and the Likud party.\"\n\nMeanwhile, for Netanyahu, it was apparent that he was making the calculation that deteriorating ties with the leader \nof the free world might be worth the risk if he saw gains at the polls at home in mid-March 2015.  But on the issue of \na pending deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, it was difficult to see what achievement Netanyahu hoped \nto make.  Even  if he were to deliver a tour de force of a speech on Capitol Hill, replete with repeated standing \novations from Republicans in Congress anxious to show their solidarity with the hardline conservative Israeli prime \nminister, the multilateral talks in Europe on the Iranian nuclear deal were still going to move forward. Even if some \nsort of legislation was advanced in the United States Congress aimed at sabotaging such a deal (for example via \nfresh sanctions against Iran), the president of the United States would have the power of the veto to counteract \nsuch a move.\n\nNetanyahu himself appeared cognizant of this reality as he said, \"Can I guarantee that my speech in Congress will \nprevent a dangerous deal with Iran from being signed? Honestly, I don't know. But I do know this -\u2014 it's my sacred \nduty as prime minister of Israel to make Israel's case.\"\n\nTo that end, the Israeli leader went to Capitol Hill on March 3, 2015, to give his address to Congress. In that \nspeech, he warned that the nuclear deal being negotiated by global powers and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, would \n\n\n\nactually herald a nuclearized Iran.  To this end, he said, \"This deal doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb, it paves \nIran's path to the bomb.\" Disparaging the efforts being carried out by United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nand his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China,  Netanyahu said: \"We've been \ntold that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal.\"\n\nOf course, the Israeli leader had harsh words regarding Iran, reminding the chamber -- and the worlds -- that \"Iran's \nregime is as radical as ever, the ideology is deeply rooted in militant Islam... it will always be an enemy of U.S.\"  He \nalso noted that the Iranian imprint was growing in the Middle East, as it meddled in the affairs of countries such as \nIraq and Yemen, while backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  To this end, Nentanyahu said that Iran was on a \"march \nof conquest, subjugation and terror.\"\n\nNetanyahu's speech, despite the boycott by as many as 60 Democrats, was well-received by the Republican-\ndominated Congress.  Indeed, Republicans in Congress made a point to giving the Israeli leader a far warmer \nreception, with more boisterous applause than had been conveyed to President Barack Obama at the State of the \nUnion less than two months earlier.\n\nFor its part, the White House blasted the Israeli prime minister's address as being filled by rhetoric and short of \ngood ideas. As noted by President Obama himself after the Netanyahu visit to Capitol Hill, \"On the core issue, \nwhich is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the prime \nminister [Netanyahu] did not offer any viable alternatives.\"\n\nNevertheless, the fact of the matter was that Netanyahu's address was a political success that would likely help him \nwith hardline voters at home, while currying favor with hardliners across party lines in the United States.  Of course, \nit was harder to say if the Netanyahu speech was necessarily in the best interests of the United States.\n\nThe reality was that without an agreement of some sort, Iran would likely move forward with the pursuit of its \nnuclear program, which could potentially involve bomb production. Indeed, it was only the interim nuclear deal (set \nto expire in mid-2015), which created the space for nuclear negotiations to take place, that had brought any halt to \nIranian nuclear acitivites.  Before the interim agreement was forged, despite the imposition of harsh sanctions, Iran \nwas producing centrifuges and fissile material. Without a nuclear accord going forward, Iran would be free to \nresume unfettered nuclear activities.\n\nOf note was the fact that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have viewed the Iranian nuclear problem \ndifferently.  For President Obama, the imperative has always been the same: To prevent Iran from producing a \nnuclear bomb.  But for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the objective has been to prevent Iran from having nuclear \ncapability.  While the two respective goals overlap, they must be understood distinctly.\n\nA good deal for President Obama would be one in which Iran's nuclear program is curtailed, regulated, and \nmonitored to the extent that its breakout time for creating a bomb would be lengthy and difficult.  No deal would \nlikely be acceptable to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was determined to see Iran's nuclear capability ended in \ntotality, and all of its nuclearfacilities dismantled.  Short of military action, it was difficult to see how Netanyahu's \ngoals would be accomplished.  But even military strikes would  be risky since multiple sites -- from the uranium \nenrichment plants at Natanz and Fordo, to the heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak, not to mention an array of \nlaboratories and mines at stake.\n\nOf significance was the fact  that the very case by Israel (at least, as conveyed by Netanyahu) was being tarred by \nquestions of credibility.  At issue was the release of a cache of confidential intelligence documents that appeared to \ncontradict Netanyahu's claims about Iran being imminently positioned to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Leaked \ncables -- reportedly from South African intelligence. but which were shared with certain news outlets -- indicated \n\n\n\nthat in an address before the United Nations in 2012, the Israeli leader misrepresented Iran's progress on nuclear \ndevelopment, and even contradicted Israel's own Mossad secret service to make that claim.\n\nGoing back to 2012, Netanyahu famously stood before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon \ndepiction of a bomb with a red line and declared that Iran would be positioned to build a nuclear weapons the \nfollowing year.  As such, he demanded global action to prevent Iran from achieving that end.  Now, however, in \n2015, the leaked documents, whch were shared with Al-Jazeera and published by The Guardian newspaper,  \nincluded conclusions from Israel's own Mossad intelligence agency that Iran was \"not performing the activity \nnecessary to produce weapons.\"  The Mossad briefing did note that Iran appeared to be moving in a direction \n\"which will reduce the time required to produce weapons.\"  However, the Mossad briefing also asserted that Iran \n\"does not appear to be ready\" to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons.  (The \nmanufacture of a nuclear bomb would require enrichment of 90 percent.)\n\nIt should be noted that in response to the revelations ensconced in these leaked documents, the Israeli government \nsaid there was little difference in Netanyahu's claims as compared with Mossad's findings.  Both agreed  that Iran \nwas indeedseeking to manufacture a nuclear bomb.\n\nRegardless of Iran's actual intent or the actual timeline at stake, the difficult diplomatic work of trying to forge an \nagreement that would prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon was ongoing.\n\nIt should be noted that in the aftermath of the Netanyahu speech, United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nwarned that simply demanding Iran's capitulation was unlikely to compel that country to voluntarily halt its nuclear \ndevelopment program.  Kerry's remarks intimated criticism for the muscular language emitted by the Israeli leader, \nwhich were heavy on rhetoric but unlikely to achieve actual results. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry noted that the \ndiplomatic path presented a serious path forward.  He said,  \"No one has presented a more viable, lasting \nalternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. So folks, simply demanding that Iran \ncapitulate is not a plan. And nor would any of our P5+1 partners support us in that position.\" At the same time, \nSecretary of State Kerry made clear that the while the hard work of diplomacy was yielding results, there remained \n\"significant gaps and important choices that need to be made\" by Iran.\n\nIn Iran, President Hassan Rouhani emphasized his country's position. Rouhani indicated that Iran was prepared to \nsubject itself to greater scrutiny, in order to satisfy the international community's concerns about nuclear weapons \nproduction.  But at the same time, he reiterated Iran's long-standing stance that it was entitled to nuclear \ndevelopment.  Rouhani said, \"If the basis of these negotiations is for increased transparency, we will accept greater \ntransparency. But if the negotiations are trying to prevent the people of Iran from their inalienable right, in other \nwords advancement in science and technology, it is very natural that Iran will not accept such an understanding or \nagreement.\"\n\nOf course, concerns about Iranian nuclear development, and a potential nuclear deal, extended not only to Israel \nbut also to the Sunni Arab world.  Of note was the ever-increasing sectarian divide between Shi'ites and Sunnis in \nthe Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring in 2011. With this schism only deepening, \nSunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia, were increasingly concerned about an ascendant Shi'ite Iran.  Indeed, Iran \nalready had its imprint in the Syria-Lebanon area due to tacit support of Hezbollah, and had tightened its alliance \nwith Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era, and was now believed to be clandestinely backing the Shi'ite Zaidi \nrebellion (known as the Houthi rebellion) in Yemen.  The notion of a nuclearized Iran, already with its tentacles \nstretching across the region, was not regarded positively by several Arab countries. Accordingly, Secretary of State \nKerry traveled to Saudi Arabia to calm the anxieties of several Sunni Arab countries, including  Bahrain, Kuwait, \nOman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia itself, regarding a potential Iranian nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to this issue, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"For all the objections that any country has to Iranian activities \nin the region, and believe me, we have objections and others in the world have objections, the first step is to \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\"  At stake was the goal of reaching the \"right deal,\" which Kerry said \nwould  \"close off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon.\"\n\nTo that end, the diplomatic track was continuing and the latest round of multilateral talks -- involving the United \nStates, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany,  Russia, and China -- appeared to be making progress, with all \neyes on late March 2015 as a possible timeline for a deal, with the details ironed out and solidified by a mid-2015 \ndeadline.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the negotiations were productive, saying to the media: \n\"We made progress.\"  His Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,  said they were forging \"a \nbetter understanding\" at the negotiating table.\n\nThe comprehensive pact appeared to be geared towards constraining Iran's nuclear breakout capability, and \nrestricting Iran's nuclear activities for a 10-year period, with an easing of restrictions on nuclear development after \nthat time. Under consideration was a plan to deal with most of Iran's enriched uranium externally, or to convert it to \na form that would not be easily used in weapons development.  Overall, there would be strict curbs on Iranian \nnuclear development for a decade, particularly with regard to the handling of enriched uranium and the number of \ncentrifuges at stake.  But there would also be \"rewards\" of sorts  for Iranian compliance and cooperation in the form \nof gradually eased restrictions and the lifting of sanctions.  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, would play a central role in any proposed deal, and  would have the primary \nresponsibility of monitoring Iran's compliance and cooperation.\n\nIn the second week of March 2015, in the wake of the controversial Netanyahu address to Congress, 47 Republican \nsenators published an open letter to Iran.  The  signatories to that document sought to instruct the Iranian \ngoverment about United States constitutional law, which they suggested the Iranians might not \"fully understand.\" \nThe letter, which was spearheaded by freshman Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, made the claim that  \nany nuclear deal that might emerge from the negotiations in Switzerland would be \"nothing more than an executive \nagreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,\" and thus require congressional approval while \nbeing subject to revocation by a future president.  To this end, the letter included the following sentence: \"The next \npresident could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify \nthe terms of the agreement at any time.\"\n\nIt was difficult to interpret the missive as anything other than a transparent attempt to undermine President Barack \nObama's leadership in the realm of foreign policy. Indeed, editorials from more than 22 cities across the country \nexcoriated the 47 Republican senators for their action, which they characterized as a reckless and partisan stunt. \nSome newspaper boards even argued that by dispatching that missive, te 47 Republican senators were marching \nthe country down the road of war.  Almost all the editorials vociferously criticized the 47 Republican senators for \nbetraying the national interests of the United States, whose constitution, accords broad authority to the president to \nconduct foreign policy.\n\nFrom the Senate,  Minority Leader Harry Reid -- the top Democrat in the upper chamber -- minced no words as he \ndeclared: \"Let's be clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.\" \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in \n2016, entered the fray, saying that the letter's signatories could only be motivated by one of the following two \nrationales. She said, \"There appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the \nIranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer \ndoes discredit to the letter's signatories.\" White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said the letter was intended to \nundermine diplomacy and could spur a \"rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option.\"\n\n\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama responded to the infamous letter by accusing the 47 Republican senators of \n\"interfering\" in nuclear negotiations -- an arena typically reserved for the executive branch of government.  He also  \nsardonically noted that the 47 signatories constituted an \"unusual coalition\" with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, \nwho have also opposed the nuclear negotiations.  As noted by President Obama: \"I think it's somewhat ironic to see \nsome members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It's an unusual coalition.\"  \nVice President Joe Biden -- a former Senator himself and the official president of the upper chamber -- was more \nvituperative in his condemnation. Vice President Biden said that the letter from the 47 Republicans was \"beneath \nthe dignity of an institution I revere.\" He added, \"In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another \ninstance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that \nthe president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,\"\n\nOf significance was the reaction by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif, who dismissed the letter as a \n\"propaganda ploy.\" Zarif said, \"In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.  It is very \ninteresting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political \npressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, \nunprecedented in diplomatic history.  This indicates that like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential \nthreat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.\"\n\nEducated in the United States himself, the Iranian foreign minister did not shy away from showing his own \nconstitutional chops, intimating that the Republican Senators who signed onto the letter may not been fully \nconversant with the United States Constitution. To this end, Zarif said, \"A change of administration does not in any \nway relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible \nagreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.\"  Zarif also noted that a move by a future president to dismantle \na yet-to-be-achieved nuclear agreement would be in contravention to international jurisprudence, saying, \"I wish to \nenlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, \nit will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"\n\nTo be sure, the letter from the 47 Republican senators emphasized the view that any deal would have to be ratified \nby the upper house of the Congress.  However, both Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry pointed out that the vast majority of international agreements forged in recent decades have been  \nexecutive measures and not treaties requiring ratification by the Senate.\n\nMoreover, any deal emerging from the nuclear talk would be neither a bilateral agreement nor a conventional treaty \nbetween nation state.  Instead, it would be a multilateral accord, forged by the P5+1 countries, including all \npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The accord would likely activated as a Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, then sealed under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council, and thus would \nin fact not be subject to modification by Congress. In this regard, it would be follow on the heels of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, and 1929 that have also dealt with Iran's nuclear \nprogram.  Neither a Republican-controlled Senate  nor a future president would be positioned to unilaterally  \nreverse the terms of a potential accord of this sort.\n\nCongress, with its power of the purse, could certainly  place certain limits on President Obama or any future \npresident as regards sanctions to be levied upon Iran (or any other country).  However, Congress cannot summarily \noverride international obligations forged in a multilateral frame, and which would be structured as an international \nmeasure, without  being in  flagrant breach of international law.\n\nBeyond the legal perils at stake, there were political perils to consider. The fact of the matter was that any post-\nObama president would be placed in a precarious position within the world community for violating an agreement \nreached and understood as a matter of international consensus.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there were rumblings in regards to violations of domestic law when some observers noted that the letter \nto Iran could be regarded as a violation of the 18th century Logan Act.\n\nTo be precise, the Logan Act prohibits any \"Private correspondence with foreign governments\" and reads; \"Any \ncitizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly \ncommences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent \nthereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent \nthereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United \nStates, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\"  In truth, it was unlikely that \na law dating back to 1799 would be used to prosecute the 47 senators; however, its discussion has only added to \nthe level of scandal and drama surrounding a potential landmark multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nReturning to the issue of the prevailing nuclear negotiations -- the fact of the matter was that nuclear talks continued \nin Switzerland in the third week of March 2015. The principal parties acknowledged that progress was being made, \nparticularly with regard to technical provisions.  Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, \nexpressed delight over his productive meetings with United States Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz, saying, \"We \nhave made progress on technical issues. One or two issues remain and need to be discussed.\"  For his part, \nSecretary of State Kerry said, \"We're pushing some tough issues but we made progress.\"\n\nHowever, other Western representatives had a different view. A State Department official told Reuters News, \"We \nare pretty far away. There are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. The Iranians must make substantial \nconcessions.\"  Moreover, as reported by Reuters News, an anonymous European negotiator said: \"Contrary to \nwhat the Iranians are saying with regard to 90 percent of an accord being done, that's not correct.  We are not close \nto an agreement.\"\n\nClearly, another round of talks was anticipated to resolve a slate of remaining issues.  Of note was the West's \ninsistence that Iran's nuclear activities be curtailed and its nuclear breakout time be circumscribed to one year.  \nStated differently, an arrangement had to be made whereby Iran would need a full year to garner enough fissile \nmaterial (either high enriched uranium or plutonium before it could produce a nuclear weapon.  On the agenda for \ndiscussion was a plan to limit the  number of enrichment centrifuges Iran would be allowed to keep; other \nconsiderations included limits of the size of uranium stockpiles.\n\nNote that on March 21, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated that progress was being made in nuclear \ntalks, setting the stage for a final deal.  He was quoted by Iranian state media as saying. \"There is nothing that \ncannot be resolved.\"  Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, emitted a very different tone from that of Iran's more \nmoderate president, Rouhani. In reference to President Obama's Persian Nowruz message to the Iranian people, in \nwhich the United State leader said a deal on Iran's nuclear program presented \"an historic opportunity to resolve \nthis issue peacefully,\"  Ayatollah  Khamenei  said that his country should not submit to the demands of the global \npowers. Khamenei noted, \"Basically, what he [Obama]  says in his message is that you must accept the terms we \ndictate in the nuclear talks so that jobs, investment, and economic activities will blossom in your country... this view \nwill never lead to any conclusions for us.\"  In many senses, Obama and Rouhani were in similar positions -- both \nwere pragmatic presidents, both were eager to improve bilateral relations between their countries, while meeting \nglobal security goals, yet both men were also politically at odds with the conservative and hardline elements in their \nown countries.\n\nDays later, the landscape for negotiations could only be understood as uncertain.  The various sides appeared to \nbe deadlocked over certain sticking points. France was looking for more stringent restrictions on the Iranians -- a \nposition by France that was at odds with the other P5+1 countries.  Also at issue was the fact that France was not \nkeen on the notion of a quick suspension to United Nations sanctions against Iran -- a demand being made by the \nIranians.  Meanwhile, the United States was advocating that restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place \nfor at least 10 years, while France was looking for a 15 year timeline, along with 10 years of rigorous IAEA \n\n\n\nmonitoring. Other contentions centered on Iran's demand that it be allowed unfettered research and development of \nadvanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors, and ultimately are linked with \nweapons production.\n\nThe fact of the matter was that  significant issues remained unresolved with Iran and the P5+1 countries far apart in \nsome regards.  Still, the consequences of not reaching a deal would likely destablize the world; as such, the \nimpetus for forging an agreement was strong and all expectations were that the March 2015 deadline would be \nextended again.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations aside, relations between the United States and Israel continued to be poor in the \naftermath of the Israeli election, which were decisively won by Netanyahu's Likud party.  Netanyahu's victory was at \nleast partially attributed to his controversial remarks warning Jewish voters that Arab Israelis would be \"turning out \nin droves\" at the polls, and asserting that there would be no Palestinian state under his watch.  In the wake of that \nlatter statement, the Obama administration in the United States warned Israel that it would be \"reassessing\" its \nrelationship and its stance on Middle East diplomacy.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu attempted to reverse the clear political damage made by these two statements. First, he \napologized publicly to Arab Israelis for the divisive rhetoric. Then, he insisted to the United States that he still \nsupported a \"two-state solution\" (i.e. an independent Palestinian state living side by side the Jewish state of Israel \nin peace and security), but claimed that he intended to simply point out that the conditions for the peace process \nwere not optimal. As stated by Netanyahu in an interview with MSNBC News: \"I haven't changed my policy. I never \nretracted my speech in Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes \nthe Jewish state. What has changed is the reality.\"\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States made clear it was not prepared to accept Netanahu's \nprevarication.  JOsh Earnest, the White House spokesperson, warned of \"consequences\" for Israel.  In his \nconference with the White House press corps, Earnest said, \"He [Netanyahu]  walked back from commitments that \nIsrael had previously made to a two-state solution.  It is ... cause for the United States to evaluate what our path is \nforward.\"\n\nOn the radar could be the United States' stance at the United Nations.  To date, it has only been the United States' \nveto at the Security Council that has prevented Palestinians from successfully garnering official recognition as a \nnation state.  The United States has insisted that Palestinian statehood should be arrived at diplomatically, and via \nthe established peace process, predicated on a two state solution.  But with Netanyahu making the bold claim that \nthere would be no Palestinian state so long as he remained prime minister, the entire foundation of the two state \nsolution was now damanged.  Thus, the door was now open for the United States to change its calculus -- and \naccordingly, its behavior at the Security Council.  White House spokesperson Earnest addressed this very issue, \nsaying, \"Steps that the United States has taken at the United Nations had been predicated on this idea that the two-\nstate solution is the best outcome. Now our ally in these talks has said that they are no longer committed to that \nsolution.\"\n\nNote: On April 2, 2015, after marathon talks in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran issued a joint statement \nannouncing that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a historic framework \nagreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached.  As stated by the European Union foreign policy chief, \nFederica Mogherini,  \"We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.\"  A \nrigorous program of verification would remain in place  to  corroborate Iran's adherence to the terms of the \nagreement  and to ensure that Iran meets its obligations.  Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\n\n\nconcluded that the deal  needed additional measures included, such as  a \"clear and unambiguous Iranian \nrecognition of Israel's right to exist.\"\n\nHowever, United States President Obama himself entered the equation, insisted that  the framework agreement \nwould be good for global security, as it would \"cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear \nweapon.\"\n\nNote: It was yet to be determined if the nuclear negotiations would actually end in a viable and enduring deal.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nPrimer on snap parliamentary elections in 2015 --\n\nParliamentary elections were set to be held in Israel on March 17, 2015.  At stake would be the composition of the \nunicameral \"Knesset\" (Parliament), where the 120 members are popularly elected by one district proportional \nrepresentation to serve four-year terms.\n\nThe main political parties contesting the elections were expected to be Netanyahu's right-wing Likud, Avignor \nLieberman's nationalist  Yisrael Beiteinu, Naphtali Bennett's hard-right Habayit Hayehudi, two ultra-Orthodox parties \n-- United Torah Judaism and Shas, Moshe Kahlon's newly-formed center-right Kulanu party, Yair Lapid's centrist \nYesh Atid Party,  Issac Herzog's left-leaning Labor Party -- joined in an alliance called \"Zionist Union\"  by centrist \nTzipi Livni's\n\nHatnuah, Zehava Gal-on's lefist Meretz party,  United Arab List, among others.\n\nIt would be seen if Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu, the head of the right-wing Likud party, would see re-\nelection or if the center-left Herzog-Livni alliance would see success at the polls. Netanyahu  was certainly looking \nfor a clear mandate for the right-wing, freeing him to no longer be reliant on partners from other parties to lead the \ngovernment.\n\nDetails of the election landscape leading up to voting were as follow:\n\nOn Dec. 2, 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu fired two of his cabinet ministers, blasting them for \ndaring to criticize him.  He also said he would dissolve parliament and schedule snap elections.\n\nThe two cabinet ministers who were sacked were actually the leaders of rival parties who joined his coalition \ngovernment following the last elections.  In the crosshairs were Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister \nTzipi Livni with whom Netanyahu has frequently  sparred over both political and economic disagreements.\n\nSuch acrimony and dissonance should have been anticipated given the fact that Lapid and Livni both come from \nmore centrist parties whose policies do not always easily coincide with the hardline conservative agenda of \nNetanyahu's Likud party. Indeed, Lapid's Yesh Atid Party has held a more secular orientation and has focused on \nthe economic needs of the middle class, while Livni leads the liberal Hatnuah party, which was formed  by \nprogressive dissidents of the centrist Kadima party  seeking serious peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nRather than address the organic breakdown of these ideological alliances, Netanyahu condemned Lapid and Livni \nfor \"harshly\" criticizing the coalition government, as he declared: \"I will not tolerate an opposition within the \ngovernment anymore.\" He added, \"I will not tolerate ministers attacking government policy from within the \ngovernment, attacking its leader, motivated by political interests, and being irresponsible at a national level.\"\n\n\n\nInstead, Netanyahu was looking to dispense with unreliable governing coalitions and gain a clear majority of \nhardline conservatives in parliament. Rhetorically, however, rather than argue for an outright governing majority to \nadvance his agenda, Netanyahu indicated that his call for the dissolution of parliament and fresh elections were \naimed winning \"a clear mandate to lead Israel\" and \"regaining the people's trust.\"\n\nLapid's party, Yesh Atid, characterized  Netanyahu's decision to fire its leader and Livni as  \"an act of cowardice \nand loss of control\"  and added, \"We are sad to see that the prime minister has chosen to act without consideration \nfor the national interest and to drag Israel to unnecessary elections.\" Meanwhile,  Livni said that Netanyahu was \nmired by \"extremism, provocativeness, and paranoia.\"\n\nFor the leaders of other parties now exiting the government -- Lapid and Livni -- the elections likely augured a relief \nas they were now released from continued participation in a coalition that was never a comfortable fit for them in the \nfirst place.\n\nRegardless of these reactions from Netanyahu's former centrist partners, Israeli voters were headed to the polls on \nMarch 17, 2015 -- two years ahead of schedule. For Netanyahu, he was seeking unfettered leeway to move forward \nwith his party's expansionist settlement policies  and hardline crackdown on Palestinian extremists.  Also on the \nagenda would be controversial legislation aimed at officially making Israel a Jewish nation state -- a stance \nopposed even by Israel's right-leaning President Reuven Rivlin,  who warned that the bill was contrary to the notion \nof equality for Arab citizens envisioned by Israel's founders.\n\nPolling Data and Political Landscape\n\nPolling data indicated that  Likud could very well expand its plurality in parliament in 2015, thus ensuring that \nNetanyahu would continue on as prime minister in a new coalition government.  The new coalition was likely to be \nreliant on support from the far-right, nationalist and religious parties, thus paving the way for the most conservative \nIsraeli government in years.  Palestinians warned that such an election outcome would put a period to peace \nnegotiations.\n\nNote that at the start of 2015, Netanyahu was confirmed as the head of Likud, paving the way for him to continue on \nas prime minister, should his party win the most votes -- as expected -- in the elections set for March 2015.\n\nA powerful address before the United States Congress on the subject of a possible Iranian nuclear deal could boost \nthe chances for Netanyahu and Likud to hold onto power, by consolidating the hard-line conservative and \nnationalist voting constituencies.  However, the concomitant negative impact on relations with the White House in \nthe United States over the irregular speech, which did not comport with proper rules of protocol, could hurt \nNetanyahu with undecided voters wary of damaging ties with Israel's closest ally.\n\nNevertheless, there remained some unpredictability about those forthcoming elections, with some polls indicating a \ncloser-than expected race and with the center-left Labor alliance, known as Zionist Union, led by Isaac Herzog and \nformer Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, posing a serious challenge.  It should be noted that under the terms of the \nHerzog-Livni alliance, should  Zionist Union win the 2015 elections, the two leaders would rotate in the role of prime \nminister.\n\nMeanwhile, in a bid to ensure that they did not split their anti-Likud/right-wing vote, four Arab minority parties -- \nRaam (United Arab List), Taal (Arab Movement for Renewal), Balad (National Democratic Assembly) and Arab-\n\n\n\nJewish party Hadash (Democratic Front for Peace and Equality) -- decided to close ranks and contest the elections \non a joint ticket.\n\nIn a close election, some of the other \"alternative\" parties could play \"kingmaker.\" Of these, the parties to watch \nwere as follows: Naphtali Bennett's hard-right Habayit Hayehudi, Avigdor Lieberman's nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, \nthe two ultra-Orthodox parties -- United Torah Judaism and Shas, Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid, Moshe Kahlon's \nnewly-formed center-right Kulanu party, and Zehava Gal-on's lefist Meretz party.\n\nSince no one party was expected to capture an outright majority, the contest was for the plurality of the vote share, \nand thus, the right to form a government in partnership with other parties.  Because there were more right and right-\nleaning parties in Israel, the conventional wisdom was that Netanyahu's hardline stances would yield results for \nLikud,  and with the support of other right-wing and hardline parties, he would be positioned to carry on as prime \nminister after the election.  In fact, even if Likud did not win a clear plurality of seats, Netanyahu could argue that \nwith a conservative coalition of parties, he was best positioned form a stable right-wing government.\n\nIn the first week of March 2015, the political landscape appeared to be emering as Netanyahu-favorable terrain.  \nSeveral days after Netanyahu's controversial speech in the United States, polling data showed Likud opening up a \nlead over Zionist Union.  It seemed that the scenario outlined above could conceivably become a reality and \nNetanyahu would be able to hold onto power.\n\nBy the second week of March 2015, that boost in the polls for Netanyahu and Likud had dissipated and, instead, the \nmomentum had shifted significantly towards Herzog/Livni's Zionist Union. Various polls showed that  if the elections \nwere immediately held, Zionist Union would win 24-25 seats, while Likud would secure 21 seats.  Of the other \nparties,  the Joint Arab List was on track to win 14 seats, Lapid's Yesh Atid was set to acquire 13 seats, Jewish \nHome party would get 12 seats,  Kulanu  would win nine seats, Shas party would take seven seats, United Torah \nJudaism would secure six seats, Yisrael Beiteinu and  Meretz parties would carry five seats respectively, with the \nrest of the seats going elsewhere.\n\nIn mid-March 2015, the final pre-election polls were released and showed that Zionist Union was maintaining its \nlead and set to capture between 24 and 26 seats, with Likud poised to take 20-22 seats.  The rest of the parties \nwere roughly in line with the polling projections delineated just above.  It was to be seen if, on election day, Zionist \nUnion would be able to transpose polling data in to actual results,  and post an impressive performance.\n\nOf course, winning the most seats would not necessarily position the Herzog-Livni alliance to form the next \ngovernment.  To do so, they would have to form a coalition and partners to that end were more limited.  Even if \nZionist Union  could persuade key parties from the center and the left to join a coalition, it still might not be enough \nto command control over a parliamentary majority.\n\nIn fact, analysts calculating plausible coalitions to be formed have concluded that the  parties of the right flank and \nthe parties of the center-left  bloc could respectively end up in something of a tie. Should such an outcome ensue, \nthe president would have to choose the leader with the best chance of forming a stable government to become the \nnew prime minister.\n\nWith only days to go until Israelis cast their ballots, the incumbent prime minister was clearly rattled by the new \npolling data. Netanyahu warned Israelis that there was a \"huge, worldwide effort\" to topple him from the helm of \ngovernment in Israel.  He said, \"It is a very tight race. Nothing is guaranteed because there is a huge, worldwide \neffort to topple the Likud government.\" Netanyahu warned of the \"read danger\" posed by a prospective Herzog-\nLivni government, which he said would \"completely prostrate themselves to any pressure,\" be persuaded to trade \n\n\n\nland for peace with the Palestinians, ultimately accept an Iranian nuclear deal. As such, Netanyahu rallied right-\nwing voters to cast their ballots for Likud.\n\nOn the other side of the equation,  opposition leader and national scion, Herzog, argued that Israelis were in the \nmood for change.  At a market in Tel Avivi, flanked by his alliance partner, Livni, Herzog said, \"Israelis want \nchange... There are many, many issues (that have shaped the campaign). That's why this is a great democracy.\"\n\nThose \"many\" issues were on display in a pre-election debate featuring all the leaders of the main parties.  While \ninternational media has tended to focus on security issues and the Palestinian conflict in their coverage of Israel, \nthe main topics discussed in this televised national debate included the economy and social issues. Indeed, \nconcerns such as the high cost of living, including the price of housting, factored highly in the debate.  The peace \nprocess with the Palestinians emerged only occasionally.\n\nElection Alert:\n\nGoing into the election, Netanyahu accelerated his push for hard-right votes, declaring that he was no longer \nsupportive of a Palestinian state.\n\nIndeed, the prime minister reversed course on his long-standing stance in support of a two-state solution to the \nMiddle East peace process, suddenly announcing that so long as he remained the Israeli head of government, a \nPalestinian state would not be established.  His ultra-hawkish shift in stance was being regarded as a transparent \nattempt to secure votes that would normally go to the smaller hard-right parties.  Nevertheless, for Netanyahu the \ngoal was clear -- to secure as many right-wing and hard-right votes as possible.\n\nApparently willing to make clear his hard-right credentials, Netanyahu also warned Jewish Israeli voters that Arab \nIsraeli voters were poised to come out to the polls \"in droves.\"  Via the social media outlet, Facebook, he wrote,  \n\"The right-wing government is in danger. Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls. Left-wing organizations \nare busing them out.\"  Critics blasted Netanyahu for what could only be interpreted as a divisive and racist \napproach.  However, he was backed by foreign minister and the head of the allied  Yisrael Beitenu party, Avignor \nLieberman, who issued the following warning:  \"Netanyahu also knows that if the Arabs are voting in droves, only a \nstrong Lieberman can stop them.\"  Lieberman, known for his virulently anti-Arab rhetoric, suggested that \"disloyal\" \nIsraeli Arabs should be beheaded.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Livni suggested she would reliquish her role as a rotating leader if it would help \nHerzog form a coalition government.  Livni made clear that the objective should be to form a government that \nbreaks from Netanyahu leadership.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, Israeli voters went to the polls to cast their ballots in early elections.  Voter turnout was said to \nbe strong. After  the polls closed in Israel, early exit poll data showed the parliamentary race \"too close to call.\"  It \nwas apparent that Netanyahu's hawkish rhetoric had resulted in a surge in the last days before the election, \neffectively closing the gap with Herzog's Zionist Union.\n\nIsraeli President Rivlin was intimating that he would favor a national unity government, given the closeness of the \nelection and the fact that no outright winner had been produced.  Rivlin, the Israeli head of state (to be distinguished \nfrom the prime minister who is head of government),  said: \"I am convinced that only a unity government can \nprevent the rapid disintegration of Israel's democracy and new elections in the near future.\"\n\n\n\nHowever,  Prime Minister Netanyahu was not about to wait for the official results to be declared and quickly \ndeclared victory.  At a Likud victory party, he said: \"Against  all odds, a great victory for Likud, a great victory for the \nnationalist camp headed by Likud!\"  Netanyau was also reported to have immediately commenced negotations with \nNaftali Bennet of Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) and Avignor Lieberman of Yisrael Beitunu to form a hard-right \ncoalition government.\n\nAs regards the formation of a potential Zionist Union-led coalition, Herzog issued a more measured message, \nsaying, \"No decision will be made tonight. We have formed a negotiating team.\"  Herzog, however, did take credit \nfor rehabilitating the Labor Party (one of the two parties in Zionist Union) and leading it to its strongest election \nperformance in decades. He  said, \"\"This is a big victory for the Labor Party, which hasn't done this well since \nYitzhak Rabin won in 1992.\"  He added, \"These results will bring Labor back into power.\" To that end, Herzog \ncalled for the \"social parties\" to unite under him to form \"a real reconciliation government.\"\n\nBut in the early hours of March 18, 2015, it was apparent that Likud was actually augmenting its advantage.  With \nclose to all the votes counted, Likud had won 30 seats -- significantly out-performing the last pre-election polls, and \nmaking it clear that Netanyahu's nationalist platform had yielded electoral dividends.  Zionist Union secured \nprecisely the predicted number of seats -- 24.  Meanwhile, the Joint Arab List -- the joint ticket of minor Arab parties \n-- had made history; it was on track to become the third largest party in parliament with 13 seats.  Lapid's centrist \nYesh Atid party was set to secure 11 seats. The newly-formed  Kulanu partybroke into the Israeli political scene \nwinning 10 seats.  Habayit Hayehudi  (Jewish Home) seemed to have paid the price for the Likud surge and won \nonly eight seats. Both Shas and United Torah Judaism respectively won seven seats.  Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu \nparty also saw a weak showing with six seats. Meretz garnered five seats. It was to be determined if  Yahad has not \ncrossed the electoral threshold.\n\nGovernment Formation:\n\nWith his clear lead,  Netanyahu was likely positioned to form a government.  However,  even with the right wing \nparties Jewish Home, Shas, United Torah Judaism and Yisrael Beteniu, he would be short a few seats of a \nparliamentary majority (61 seats).  As such,  Netanyahu would have a difficult task of forming a right-wing coalition.  \nIn reality, he would either have to convince  one or both of the two centrist parties -- Yesh Atid and Kulanu - to join \nhis fold.  It was possible that Kulanu would consider that option since it was a breakaway party from Likud, thus \nsharing some political philosophies.  Yesh Atid's secularist stance, as well as its leader Lapid's interest in the Middle \nEast peace process, would likely foreclose a partnership with Likud.  That being said, with the right-wing parties and \nKulanu, there would be enough seats for Netanyahu to form a right-wing government.\n\nThere remained the possibility of a broad coalition that included Zionist Union in the national unity government \nfavored by President Rivlin.  However, neither the right wing parties nor the left wing parties were enthused about \nthat prospect. There remained a small possibility that Moshe Kahlon, the head of Kulanu, could opt out of a coalition \nwith Netanyahu. As such, it was not beyond the realm of possibility that Herzog could put together a coalition of his \nown.  But that coalition would require Zionist Union to secure support from Arab List, Tesh Atid, Kulanu and Meretz.\n\nWhile the possibilities for coalition building were being analyzed, Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, expressed \nsatisfaction over his party's performance and its impending vital role in coalition negotiations as he said, \"We are \nthe biggest centrist party, and will remain a political force for many years to come.\"  As expected, Moshe Kahlon's \nnewly-formed Kulanu party saw an impressive first-time showing and would likely play a kingmaker role in any \nfuture government led by either Netanyahu or Herzog.  Kahlon expressed delight over his party's strong \nperformance but noted that he would not entertain supporting any future coalition until the official elections were \nknown.\n\n\n\nFor its part, Arab List would have a choice of either backing a potential Zionist Union-led government,  or in the \ncase of a national unity government including both the right and the left, Arab List could conceivably become \nIsrael's official oposition party with all the perks associated with that role -- including security briefings.  Of course, \nthe most likely outcome was  a right-wing Netanyahu government, which would relegate Arab List to one more \npolitical opposition force on the sidelines, albeit with somewhat greater influence in parliament.\n\nDays after the election it was apparent that Netanyahu would be asked to form the new government. That new \ngovernment, at the time, was expected to be a hard-right entity, with Likud as the major partner, while including the \nfar-right parties, Jewish Home and Yisrael Beitenu, as well as the religious parties, Shas and United Torah \nJudaism.  But even with this far-right coalition, Netayahu would be short a parliamentary majority.  As such, he was \nexpected to prevail upon Kulanu.  It was possible that Kulanu's leader, Moshe Kahlon,  would sign onto an alliance \ndeal if he were given the highly desirous post of finance minister in Netanyahu's government.\n\nMeanwhile, Herzog, the leader of Labor and the Zionist Union, conceded defeat and made clear that his job would \nbe to offer an alternative view. In an interview with Army Radio, he said, \"The reality is clear, the reality dictates that \nwe will be in opposition and will be an alternative on each issue.\"\n\nGeopolitical Consequences\n\nThe process of government formation aside, the Israeli election also yielded geopolitical consequences.  Likud's \ndecisive victory was at least partially attributed to Netanyahu's controversial remarks warning Jewish voters that \nArab Israelis would be \"turning out in droves\" at the polls, and asserting that there would be no Palestinian state \nunder his watch.  In the wake of that latter statement particularly, the Obama administration in the United States \nwarned Israel that it would be \"reassessing\" its relationship and its stance on Middle East diplomacy.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu attempted to reverse the clear political damage made by these two statements. First, he \napologized publicly to Arab Israelis for the divisive rhetoric. Then, he insisted to the United States that he still \nsupported a \"two state solution\" to the peace process, but claimed that he intended to simply point out that the \nconditions for the peace process were not optimal. As stated by Netanyahu in an interview with MSNBC News: \"I \nhaven't changed my policy. I never retracted my speech in Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a \ndemilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality.\"\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States made clear it was not prepared to accept Netanahu's \nprevarication.  JOsh Earnest, the White House spokesperson, warned of \"consequences\" for Israel.  In his \nconference with the White House press corps, Earnest said, \"He [Netanyahu]  walked back from commitments that \nIsrael had previously made to a two-state solution.  It is ... cause for the United States to evaluate what our path is \nforward.\"\n\nOn the radar could be the United States' stance at the United Nations.  To date, it has only been the United States' \nveto at the Security Council that has prevented Palestinians from successfully garnering official recognition as a \nnation state.  The United States has insisted that Palestinian statehood should be arrived at diplomatically, and via \nthe established peace process, predicated on a two state solution.  But with Netanyahu making the bold claim that \nthere would be no Palestinian state so long as he remained prime minister, the entire foundation of the two state \nsolution was now damanged, thus opening the door for the United States to change its calculus -- and thus, its \nprotective behavior at the Security Council.\n\nWhite House spokesperson, Earnest, addressed this very issue, saying, \"Steps that the United States has taken at \nthe United Nations had been predicated on this idea that the two-state solution is the best outcome. Now our ally in \nthese talks has said that they are no longer committed to that solution.\"\n\n\n\nUpdate on Government Formation\n\nGiven the geopolitical fallout discussed above, in April 2015, there were suggestions that rather than forming a \nhard-line government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might instead form a national unity government \nwith center-left rivals, particularly Zionist Union.  For example, a national unity government, might include Zionist \nUnion leader Isaac Herzog in a future Israeli government, quite possibly as foreign minister.  Herzog in that post \nthat could help heal the breach between Israel and the Obama administration in the United States.  By contrast, it \nwas highly unlikely that someone in a hard-right coalition could  hold the post of foreign minister and successfully \nease the bilateral animosity.\n\nThat all being said, a national unity government remained in the sphere of theory and not actuality in April 2015.  In \nfact, in the third week of April 2015, government formation negotiations involved only Likud, the hard-right parties, \nand the centrist Kulanu party.  Meanwhile, Herzog repeated his stance that he was eager to embrace his role as \nopposition leader.\n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin granted Prime Minister Netanyahu  a two-week extension to form a government.  \nNetanyahu said, \"We made progress and we are on the way to forming a government, but I need additional time for \nit to be stable and to reach agreements on important issues that will help us meet all the challenges facing Israel.\"\n\nNote that as that extension deadline loomed, Netanyahu was being challenged to form his right-wing coalition.  At \nissue was the decision by his former ally, Avigdor Lieberman, to have his Yisrael Beitenu party remain outside of \ngovernment.  Lieberman's complaint was the emerging government  was insufficiently \"nationalist\" in nature.\n\nNetayahu was able to gain the support of the two ultra-Orthodox parties, United Torah Judaism  and Shas, as well \nas the centrist Kulanu party. With his own Likud party, that would give him support over 53 seats in the 120 seat \nKnesset; however, he would need 61 seats to command a majority and form a government.  With Yisrael Beitenu  \nout of the equation, Netanyahu was reportedly looking to the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party led \nby his nemesis of the right, Naftali Bennett, to reach that 61-seat threshold. Reports from Israel suggested that \nBennett was seeking the coveted role of Justice Minister in a future government.\n\nFinally, late on May 6, 2015, before the expiration of the deadline, Netanyahu appeared with Bennett to announce \nthat a majority coalition had been formed.  As expected, that coalition government would include Netanyahu's Likud \nparty,  the two ultra-Orthodox parties, United Torah Judaism  and Shas,  the centrist Kulanu party, and  the right-\nwing Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party led by Bennett, who would oversee the justice arena.  Indeed, in \naddition to holding the  deputy defense minister position, Bennett's party would hold both the justice portfolio and \nthe chairmanship of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.  It was fair to say that the forthcoming \ngovernment of Israel would be of the hard-right variety.\n\nTensions escalate between Israel and Palestinians and spark fears of another Intifada\n\nOctober 2015 was marked by a significant escalation of tensions between Israel and Palestinians.\n\nThe already-dismal relations between to two sides turned grim due to a series of violent incidences.  Of note was \nthe fact that an Israeli couple was shot to death in the West Bank at the start of October 2015; but on the other side \nof the divide, Palestinians were frustrated by the failure of Israeli authorities to secure justice for a Palestinian family \nwho were attacks by Jewish assailants two months prior.  Since that time, there has been no shortage of violent \n\n\n\naltercations as Palestinians carried out a flurry of  stabbing attacks on Israeli victims, prompting Israeli mayors to \nurge Israeli residents to protect themselves with guns and other weapons.  Along a similar vein, Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu told security forces that they were empowered to shoot  any Palestinian hurling \nstones or rocks, if they believed an Israeli life was threatened.  Given these directives, the cycle of violence was \nsure to go on.\n\nIn the background of these escalating hostilities are Palestinians' fears that the current protocol for the Temple \nMount (known as the al-Aqsa mosque to Muslims) might change.  For some time, Israel's Jewish population has \nbeen calling for  prayer rights at the holy Dome of the Rock located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of \nJerusalem.  The venue is of religious, cultural, and historic significance to Jews,  but also stands as the location of \nthe al-Aqsa mosque, which is of religious import to Muslims.\n\nDespite the Israeli government's insistence that there would be no change to the security regulations allowing Jews \nto visit but not worship at the Temple Mount, Palestinian leaders have suggested otherwise, fueling tensions ever \nfurther.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' incendiary claim that Israel was starting a \"religious war\" and his call for \nPalestinians to \"protect\" the Temple Mount in 2014, was now yielding unfortunate consequences a year later.\n\nMeanwhile, with extremists firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel, the Israeli authorities retaliated by carrying \nout air strikes on Hamas weapon manufacturing facilities in Gaza.  Those strikes resulted in civilian casualties and \nwere sure to further fuel the sense of rage boiling on the Palestinian side of the equation.\n\nThe situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has spurred concerns internationally that the region might be \nslipping into a third Palestinian Intifada (i.e. \"uprising\" in colloquial English),  although conditions -- such as they \nwere in October 2015 -- still were not at the level seen in the two previous Intifadas of 1987 to 1993, and  2000 to \n2005 respectively.\n\nSince 2014 when the tensions revolving around the Temple Mount were sparked, and as the violence and \nbloodshed has increased, there have been references to a \"Silent Intifada.\"  That being said, in 2015, the attention \nwas on the prospect of a third full-blown Intifada.\n\nFor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who staked his political legacy on the basis of his hardline positions, \nand by eschewing the United States' call to return to the peace process, his path forward was clear.  Netanyahu \nwas urging Israelis to protect themselves from angry knife-wielding Palestinian youth, while promising retribution \nagainst Hamas and other Palestinian extremists for any attacks they might attempt to carry out.  His accusations \nalso extended to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whom he accused of  complicity.\n\nFor Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who was less popular among Palestinians than the terror group, \nHamas, which was calling for a fresh Intifada, the choices were more complicated.  Indeed, to openly\n\noppose the violence was to alienate wide swaths of Palestinians, while for Abbas to  openly endorse the violence \nwas to align himself expressly with terrorists.\n\nEither path would result in weakened political power for the already-politically imperiled Abbas.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the only viable option for Abbas could theoretically come in the form of international engagement and the \nrevitalization of the peace process.  However, as intimated above, this was -- for now -- a pathway that Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu had closed off.  \n\nIsraeli PM Netanyahu signs coalition deal and names ultra-right Lieberman defense chief\n\nOn May 23, 2016, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud party signed a coalition deal with the far-right \nnationalist  Yisrael Beitenu party, prompting a leading member of Likud, Moshe Yaalon, to resign from his post as \ndefense minister in protest. On May 25, 2016,  Netanyahu then named that party's leader,\n\nultra-right Avigdor Lieberman, as Israel's new defense minister -- the very portfolio held by Yaalon who resigned \ndays before.\n\nThe addition of Yisrael Beitenu to the prime minister's ruling coalition meant that he would have control over 66 \nseats in the 120-member parliament. It also evoked declarations that the Israeli government was moving in a hard \nright direction with peace with the Palestinians ever more elusive, given Lieberman's known antipathy towards the \npeace process.\n\nAttempting to tamp down criticism of his selection, Netanyahu said, \"My government remains committed to pursuing \npeace with the Palestinians, pursuing peace with all our neighbors. My policy has not changed. We will continue to \npursue every avenue for peace, while ensuring the safety and security of our citizens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lieberman said that at the helm of defense, he would hold to  a \"responsible and reasonable\" policy.\n\nMeanwhile, the exit of Yaalon spurred speculation that the former defense minister could emerge as a significant \npolitical rival to Netanyahu moving forward .\n\nAttack on Israeli embassy in Jordan leaves fatalities; installation of metal detectors at Temple Mount spurs \nbloodshed\n\nIn July 2017, an attack at the Israeli embassy in Jordan left at least two fatalities.  The shooting incident took place \noutside the embassy, located in the affluent residential Rabiyeh neighborhood of Jordan's capital of Amman. \n According to reports from Amman, two Jordanians working for a furniture business entered the building housing the \nembassy and were shot inside; one Israeli was wounded.  Few details were made available with the Israeli \nauthorities evacuating staff, sealing off the premises, and imposting reporting restrictions on the matter.\n\nThe incident at the Israeli embassy occurred around the same period when thousands of Jordanians in Amman \nwere protesting the installation of metal detectors at an East Jerusalem site sacred to both Muslims and Jews in \nEast Jerusalem.  Indeed, the installation of metal detectors at the entrance of the Old City's holy site, which is \nknown to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif,  was sparking the worst bloodshed in \nyears.  \n\nIn one case, three members of an Israeli family were stabbed to death by a Palestinian man.  In another case, three \nPalestinians were shot and killed by Israeli forces during clashes. But the actual decision to install metal detectors \noccurred in response to a terror attack whereby Israeli-Arabs with concealed weapons killed two Israeli policemen.  \n\nIsrael's decision to take additional security measures appeared to have ignited an angry and violent backlash -- \ndespite the fact that non-Muslim tourists have had to enter the compound through metal detector gates for years.\n\n\n\nIsraelis, for their part, have pointed out that they have to go through metal detectors to access the Western Wall, \nand so they view the Palestinians' complaint as unreasonable. \n\nPalestinians argued that they were not informed about the decision to install metal detectors; however, Israel said \nthat Jordan, which is the custodian of the holy compound, was, indeed, told of the plan.  For some Palestinians, this \nexplanation was not acceptable because they simply do no accept Israeli jurisdiction over East Jerusalem in the \nfirst place, perhaps because it dates back to the 1967 war.  Palestinians have been particularly enraged by \nattempts of nationalist Jews who visit the Temple Mount and attempt to pray there -- a move only permitted to \nMuslim devotees visiting the Noble Sanctuary.  Although Israeli police remove such individuals, the increased \nnumber of incidences in recent times has heightened tensions.  \n\nRegardless of the fact that the matter has now become a flashpoint of sorts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu has insisted that security is key and made clear that the metal detectors will remain in place.  On the \nother side of the equation, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who recently broke off security coordination with \nIsrael, declared: \"Sovereignty over the blessed mosque is for us. We are the ones who should be monitoring and \nstanding at its gates.\"\n\nTrump recognizes Jerusalem as capital of Israel; Netanyahu says Palestinians must face reality\n\nIn December 2017, there were suggestions that United States President Donald Trump would break with his \npredecessors and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The move would likely be a flashpoint since the \nstatus of Jerusalem has long been regarded as one of the toughest \"final status\" issues to be resolved in Middle \nEast peace negotiations across multiple administrations.  \n\nWhile Israel claims Jerusalem unequivocally as its capital, Palestinians have claimed East Jerusalem as their \ncapital in a future state.  As such, United States presidents in modern times have generally sidestepped the \nsensitive issue, and indeed, the United States embassy has been located in Tel Aviv and not Jerusalem.  \n\nBy completely sidelining the status of Jerusalem and, effectively, rewarding it in uncontested fashion via \nrecognition, Trump was likely to set off a diplomatic firestorm in the Middle East.  \n\nPerhaps with this in mind, Jordan's  foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, warned of \"dangerous consequences\" if the \nUnited States went down this road and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nVia the social media outlet, Twitter, Safadi said: \"Spoke with #US Secretary of State Tillerson on dangerous \nconsequences of recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Israel. Such a decision would trigger anger across #Arab \n#Muslim worlds, fuel tension & jeopardize peace efforts.\"\n\nFor Trump, however, the move would function as the fulfillment of a campaign promise.  As such, he conceivably \ncould be more concerned about his domestic political support base and less about the geopolitical consequences.  \n\nTrump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, tried to calm the brewing dissonance over the matter by saying that no decision \nhad yet been made.  Kushner said, \"The president is going to make his decision and he's still looking at a lot of \ndifferent facts. When he makes his decision he'll be the one to want to tell you, not me.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the Palestinian leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, was attempting to foreclose an \nannouncement by Trump.  To this end, he was lobbying the international community to amplify the risks involved in \nthe United States' open recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Among the most obvious would be a \nthreat to the two-state solution, which remained the only viable pathway to Middle East peace in the long term.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2017, President Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  \"I have determined that \nit is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" Trump said from the White House. He added, \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am \ndelivering.\"\n\nThe move reversed decades of  United State policy on what had long been regarded as the most contentious \"final \nstatus\" issue in the effort to forge lasting  Middle East peace. \n\nThe move also effectively ended any suggestion of the United States being an impartial arbiter of the Middle East \nconflict.  As noted by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Trump's decision made clear that the United States \nwas abdicating from its role as balanced peace mediator.  United States Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer, \nstruck a similar note, saying, \"He cannot expect to side entirely with Israel on the most sensitive and complex \nissues in the process, and yet expect the Palestinians to see the United States as an honest broker.\"\n\nMoreover, the move was so controversial that United States allies, such as the United Kingdom and France.  United \nKingdom Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"We disagree with the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem \nand recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement. We believe it is unhelpful in terms of \nprospects for peace in the region. The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move \nit.\"  French President Emmanuel Macron cast Trump's announcement as \"regrettable.\" \n\nAt the United Nations, the Secretary General warned that there was no alternative to lasting peace in the Middle \nEast other than a two-state solution involving both Israel and the Palestinians.  He warned, \"There is no Plan B.\"\n\nTrump dismissed criticisms of his decision, saying, \"There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this \nannouncement but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a \nplace of greater understanding and cooperation.\"\n\nBut despite this blithe assertion by the United States president, there were intense fears that the recognition of \nJerusalem as Israel's capital would serve only to light a flame on Israeli-Palestinian tensions.  There were fears that \nthis recognition by the United States could even flare a third Intifada.  To that end, Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the \nmilitant Palestinian group. Hamas, declared that very result.  He said that Trump's decision was a \"declaration of \nwar,\" and added, \"Jerusalem is being kidnapped and ripped from us.\"  \n\nIndeed, violence was already breaking out in Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza.  Protests were also \nerupting in Jordan's capital of Amman, which was home to Palestinian refugees.  United States embassies in \nvarious countries, such as Turkey, were also being subject to protests. \n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was triumphant, as he lauded Trump's announcement as a \n\"historic landmark.\"  The Israeli prime minister said Palestinians must \"get to grips with\" the reality that Jerusalem is \nIsrael's capital. Netanyahu declared that Jerusalem had been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years and had \"never \nbeen the capital of any other people.\"  The factual veracity of the statement aside, it was likely to be viewed as \nincendiary by many critics. \n\n\n\nIt should be noted that there would not be any immediate move of the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to \nJerusalem.  As with his predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump also ordered a \ndelay.  However, it was unclear that decision would calm tensions. \n\nOf concern was the fact that 128 countries voted in favor of a non-binding United Nations General Assembly \nresolution calling for the United States to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Seven countries \n-- Guatemala, Honduras, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Nauru, and Togo along with the United States and \nIsrael voted against the resolution;  35 countries abstained from voting; 21  did not cast a vote.  It was a clear and \nembarrassing rebuke from the international community to Trump's decision. \n\nTrump retaliated by threatening to cut off financial aid to all countries that voted in favor of that resolution. \n Meanwhile, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warned the international community that \nconsequences would be in the offing as she declared, \"The United States will remember this day in which it was \nsingled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation.\" She \ncontinued, \"We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world's largest contribution to the \nUnited Nations, and so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our \ninfluence for their benefit.\"\n\nIn mid-January 2018, during a meeting of Palestinian leaders, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned \nUnited States President Donald Trump's Middle East peace efforts.  Abbas made clear that he would not be a party \nto any peace proposal from the United States, given Trump's decision to expressly recognize Jerusalem as Israel's \ncapital. The Palestinian leader characterized the move as the \"slap of the century.\"\n\nAbbas noted that Trump's moves made clear that the United States was no longer a trustworthy and fair peace \nbroker. Speaking from Ramallah in the West Bank, he said, \"The deal of the century is the slap of the century and \nwe will not accept it.\" The Palestinian leader also made clear that the development made clear that the Oslo Accord \n-- the foundation for Middle East peace -- was now defunct.  Abbas declared, \"I am saying that Oslo, there is no \nOslo,\" he added. \"Israel ended Oslo.\"\n\nIn the background of these developments was an impending move by the Trump administration to withhold tens of \nmillions of funds from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency -- the entity responsible for providing health \ncare, education, and social services to Palestinian refugees.  Because the United State has provided up to 30 \npercent of the funding for the agency, this decision to significantly reduce contributions was expected to have a \ndeleterious effect. \n\nThe Trump administration has indicated that further funding from the United States for the agency would be \ndependent on the Palestinians returning to peace talks with Israel. This idea has been championed by United \nStates Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Hayley, as a means to pressure the Palestinians back into \nnegotiations that have been frozen for years.  But this type of pressure could also be regarded as a sign that the \nUnited States was not really functioning as an honest and impartial arbiter of peace. Moreover, there were fears \nthat the withholding of finds could spur further instability in the Middle East region, particularly in an allied country \nlike Jordan that has born the brunt of hosting Palestinian refugees for decades.  Warnings were additionally coming \nfrom Israel, which noted reducing the United States contribution would curtail the work of the United Nations Relief \nand Works Agency, and could hit Gaza particularly hard. Such a scenario could thus spark further extremism from \nthat Palestinian territory. \n\nPresident Trump appeared to be undeterred by that characterization or such warnings. Via Twitter, he said: \"We \npay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. But with \n\n\n\nthe Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to \nthem?\" In the third week of January 2018, during a visit to the Middle East, Jordan's King Abdullah admonished the \nvice president of the United States, Mike Pence, for Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of \nIsrael.  King Abdullah told Vice President Pence that Trump had damaged  the chances of a resumption of Arab-\nIsraeli peace talks,  and said  that the United States would have to rebuild \"trust and confidence.\"  The Jordanian \nmonarch made the comment in the larger context of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he \nsaw as a \"potential major source of instability.\" He warned against the Jerusalem decision, given that there was no \ncomprehensive settlement for the Middle East or provision for a future Palestinian state.  King Abdullah also warned \nthat Trump's decision could spur violence in the Palestinian territories, which could  very well affect  Jordan \u2014 a key \nally of the United States in the Middle East and Arab world. For his part, Pence said he \"agreed to disagree\" with \nKing Abdullah on the effects of Trump's Jerusalem decision.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agree to truce after weeks of conflict\n\nAccording to Palestinian officials, Israel and Hamas agreed to a truce on Aug. 9, 2018, in an agreement meant to \nde-escalate fighting between both factions. An Israeli official who spoke anonymously to Reuters denied that a \nceasefire had been reached, although Israel rarely acknowledges ceasefires reached with Hamas given Israel's \ndesignation of the group as terrorist organization. According to Palestinian officials, the ceasefire agreement was \nfacilitated by international efforts and the involvement of the Egyptian government.\n\nThis purported agreement followed weeks of increased Israeli air strikes and rocket attacks on Israeli soil, and more \nimminently followed the Israeli military conducting 150 air strikes on alleged Hamas targets while 180 Palestinian \nmortars and rockets hit southern Israeli soil. Gaza officials said that a pregnant Palestinian woman and her 18-\nmonth old child were killed in the air strikes, and Israeli military officials stated that seven people were wounded by \nthe Palestinian rockets and mortars.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred with his security cabinet late into the night, and prior to reports \nof a ceasefire being reached, he urged via a statement for the military to \"keep acting with force against the \nterrorists.\" The United States State Department denounced the rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli soil and \nreasserted its unequivocal support for Israel's \"right to defend itself.\"\n\nSenior Hamas militant killed due to clash between Hamas and Israeli forces\n\nA senior Hamas militant named Sheikh Nur Barakeh was killed in clashes in the southern part of the Gaza strip \nbetween Israeli special forces and Hamas militants in early November 2018.\n\nSubsequently, Hamas fired 17 rockets into Israel with three of those being shot down according to the Israeli \nmilitary. Palestinian officials said that six additional Palestinians were killed in the clash. After initially stating that all \nspecial forces returned, the Isreali Defense Forces (IDF) released a revised statement which indicated that one IDF \nsoldier was killed and another wounded.\n\nIsraeli President Benjamin Netanyahu was in Paris where a gathering of world leaders were marking the 100th \nanniversary of the end of World War I at the time of incident.  Citing the security situation in the southern parts of \nthe Gaza Strip, he cut his trip short and returned to Israel.\n\nMore than 200 Palestinian civilians have been killed since March 2018, most during protests at the border between \nthe Gaza Strip and Israel. Over the same period, one Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper. Rocket \nattacks on Israel and Israeli airstrikes against Hamas militants have been a repeated occurrence.\n\n2019 parliamentary elections in Israel\n\nParliamentary elections were set to take place in Israel on April 9, 2019.\n\n\n\nTraditional parties expected to contest the election included: Likud, Shas, Yisrael Beytenu and Bayit Yehudi on the \nright, and a number of center to left parties, including the left leaning Labor Party and a newly-formed center-left \nparty, Hosen L'Yisrael (resilience for Israel), led by Israeli army chief Benny Gantz.\n\nWhile  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud was looking to extend his tenure as head of government, his \nprospects of leading a right-wing coalition could be hurt by a fracture in the right leaning faction of parties.  Of \nsignificance was the entry of the new Hayemin Hehadash party onto the scene.  The party  was founded by Justice \nMinister Ayelet Shaked and Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who broke away from  Habayit Yehudi to form the \nnew Hayemin Hehadash. The fracture could offer the left -- not lately a force in Israeli politics - to make a play for \nvictory. \n\n-- December 2018\n\nWritten by Dr. Denise Coleman, Editor in Chief, www.countrywatch.com .\n\nGeneral research sources listed in Bibliography.
