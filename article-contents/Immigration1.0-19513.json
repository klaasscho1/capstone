{"title": "The H-1B Visa Program: Its Contradictory Perception And Why the U.S. Must Increase The Visa Cap", "body": "\nOct 26, 2013 (National Law Review:http://www.natlawreview.com Delivered by Newstex)\n\n Elizabeth Ann Geddes[1] \n\n Since its inception under the Immigration Act of 1990, the H-1B visa has been a controversial program. The H-1B \nvisa is a temporary work visa for non-immigrant workers in a specialty occupation and requires a higher degree or \nits equivalent.[1][2]#_edn1 This visa program is arguably the most important temporary work visa, and has been \nsimultaneously portrayed as both as the means to a more competitive American workforce,[2][3]#_edn2 and as a \ndevice for usurping high-skill jobs and competitive pay from 'native-born' American workers.[3][4]#_edn3\n\n This paper aims to address these two contradicting perceptions in order to ultimately show that the H-1B visa is a \npositive and necessary program that needs to be fully understood and promoted. \n\nPart II of this paper will be an overview of the H-1B visa program, discussing the program's background and history \nin order to put the program into context. Part III will discuss the current effects and benefits of the H-1B visa \nprogram. It will also outline the persistent, increasing shortage of high-skilled workers in the information technology \nindustry and how the H-1B can alleviate this need. Part IV will discuss ways in which employees and employers are \ncircumventing the current H-1B system, for reasons ranging from exploitation by consulting firms, to innovative \nstrategies by international entrepreneurs to hurdle obstacles the program creates for startups. Part VI will discuss \nproposed legislation to improve the H-1B program and prevent its exploitation. It will also support the argument for \nincreasing the number of new H-1Bs issued each fiscal year. Finally, Part V will be a short conclusion, reaffirming \nthe economic demand for an H-1B cap increase and the essential need for program reform.\n\n History and Overview of the H-1B Program\n\nThe H-1 temporary worker visa program was established under the Immigration and Nationality Act of \n1952.[4][5]#_edn4 Under this Act the H-1 visa allowed nonimmigrant[5][6]#_edn5 workers of 'distinguished merit \nand ability' to fill temporary positions.[6][7]#_edn6 Nonimmigrants on an H-1 had to maintain a foreign residence, \nand the H-1 required that both the worker and the job be temporary.[7][8]#_edn7 The Immigration Act of 1990 \ndivided the H-1 visa into two different types of visas: the H-1A, which was designated to bring foreign-educated \nnurses in to fill a nursing shortage in the U.S., which was eliminated when it expired in 1995;[8][9]#_edn8 and the \nH-1B, the nonimmigrant work visa which remains in effect today. The Immigration Act of 1990 established the main \nfeatures of the current H-1B nonimmigrant worker visa, and replaced the description for workers of 'distinguished \nmerit and ability' with the term 'specialty occupation.'[9][10]#_edn9 A 'specialty occupation' is a theoretical and \npractical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge. [10][11]#_edn10 The Act of 1990 also removed the \nforeign residency requirement. The H-1B visa also allows an individual on this status to have 'dual intent,' meaning \nthey can have both nonimmigrant and immigrant intent. This allows an H-1B visa holder to lawfully pursue U.S. \nPermanent Residence (a green card) while in the United States. [11][12]#_edn11\n\n\n The H-1B visa is valid for three years and is renewable once, for an additional three years.[12][13]#_edn12 To \nobtain an H-1B visa, a foreign national's potential employer must file a Labor Condition Application form (LCA) with \nthe Department of Labor.[13][14]#_edn13 On the LCA, the employer must state that they pay the nonimmigrant \nworker local prevailing wage or the employer's actual wage for the position, whichever is higher, and offer them \nbenefits on the same basis as for U.S. workers. They must provide the H-1B working conditions that will not \nadversely affect the conditions of workers similarly employed, not employ an H-1B worker where a strike is \noccurring, and provide verbal, electronic or written notice of the employer's intent to hire H-1B workers within 30 \ndays of filing the LCA.[14][15]#_edn14 Additionally, if the employer's H-1B workers compromise more than 15 \npercent of their workforce, they are considered an H-1B dependent employer. H-1B dependent employers and \nwillful violators of the H-1B rules[15][16]#_edn15 must attest to three elements addressing U.S. workers. First, that \nthe employer will not displace any similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after applying for H-1B \nstatus. Second, that before hiring an H-1B worker from another employer, the new employer must make a bona fide \ninquiry as to whether that employer displaced any similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the \nplacement of the H-1B worker. And finally, that before applying for an H-1B worker, the employer took good faith \nsteps to recruit U.S. workers at wages equal to the H-1B worker's.[16][17]#_edn16\n\n Once the LCA is approved, the employer must then file an I-129 petition for a non-immigrant worker on behalf of \nthe foreign national seeking a temporary work visa.[17][18]#_edn17 This petition must be filed before the April 1 \ndeadline of the H-1B visa 'cap season.'[18][19]#_edn18 The current H-1B visa cap is set at 65,000 for the general \nH-1B category of special occupation,[19][20]#_edn19 and 20,000 for the advanced degree exemption, which are \nprovided to the first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of a beneficiary who has obtained a U.S. master's degree or \nhigher.[20][21]#_edn20 Exemptions are available under the annual cap, due to the American Competitiveness in \nthe Twenty-First Century Act (AC21), which was signed into the Immigration and Naturalization Act in \n2000.[21][22]#_edn21 This Act provides exemptions for beneficiaries if they prove that they will work at an \ninstitution of higher education or related nonprofit entity, or at a nonprofit or government research \norganization.[22][23]#_edn22 The H-1B petitions for the 65,000 general category cap are chosen through a \ncomputer-generated, random selection lottery system. This year, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS) received nearly twice as many applications as the cap provided for, with approximately 124,000 \napplications being filed for the 2014 fiscal year.[23][24]#_edn23 The USCIS filing period lasted for only 5 \ndays.[24][25]#_edn24\n\n When the H-1B program was first introduced in 1990, long before the surge in demand for IT workers the U.S. \nlabor market is currently experiencing,[25][26]#_edn25 the visa cap was at 65,000 - the same as it is today. In \n1998 the cap was raised to 115,000.[26][27]#_edn26 In 2001 it was raised to 195,000 by the AC21 Act, which also \nprovided exemptions for beneficiaries working in research and development.[27][28]#_edn27 However, in 2004, the \ncap reverted back to its 1990 levels of 65,000, where it remains today.[28][29]#_edn28\n\n Why Do We Care?\n\nThe inability to fill high-skilled, technical jobs in the United States has been a concern for well over a decade, with a \n2000 report from the United States General Accounting Office stating that:\n\n The information technology (IT) industry, in particular, is a driving force behind current and future U.S. economic \ngrowth, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the demand for workers with certain IT skills will double \nover the next 10 years. Employers in the IT industry have expressed concerns about not being able to fill their many \nvacancies. To help U.S. employers in IT and other industries fill their needs for highly skilled workers, the H-1B visa \nprogram allows employers to temporarily (for up to 6 years) fill needs in specialty occupations with foreign \nworkers.[29][30]#_edn29\n\n In his numerous testimonies to Congress on immigration reform, business owner and senior academic Vivek \nWadhwa has stated that we live in a 'knowledge economy.'[30][31]#_edn30 With over 200 of the current Fortune \n500 businesses, including: eBay, Google, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Apple, Boeing, ATT and General \nElectric,[31][32]#_edn31 being founded by immigrants or their children,[32][33]#_edn32 high-skilled immigrant \nworkers and entrepreneurs have proven to be a time-tested capstone of the U.S. economy's leading role in the \nglobal marketplace. Many studies have been conducted on this phenomenon, and several indicate that immigrant \n\n\n\nworkers and entrepreneurs are likely to be more ambitious and averse to risk-taking than the rest of the general \npopulation.[33][34]#_edn33 This enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit is particularly evident in the IT field. In a study \nconducted by Wadhwa through his research teams at Duke and UC-Berkeley, Wadhwa found that between 1995 \nand 2005, 52 percent of Silicon Valley's companies were started by immigrant entrepreneurs who originally came to \nthe U.S. to study and work.[34][35]#_edn34 Since 2005 that number has gone down to 44 percent - a historically \nunprecedented drop.[35][36]#_edn35 As the limits of the H-1B visa program continue to prevent high-skilled \nworkers from entering the U.S., technology projects remain at a standstill as crucial technical positions remain \nvacant. Microsoft, the largest employer of H-1Bs in the U.S., currently has over 6,000 unfilled jobs.[36][37]#_edn36 \nA recent survey of over 1,100 manufacturing executives by the National Association of Manufacturers' \nManufacturing Institute and Deloitte shows that 67 percent of manufacturing companies face a 'moderate to severe' \nshortage of qualified workers.[37][38]#_edn37 This March, over 100 leaders of U.S. technology companies wrote a \nletter to President Obama, begging him to raise the H-1B cap in order to help fill thousands of open positions \nrequiring highly skilled individuals.[38][39]#_edn38 Between IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm alone, \nthere are currently a combined 10,000 openings in the United States.[39][40]#_edn39 The cap on the H-1B general \ncategory needs to be increased in order to ensure that the U.S. does not fall behind in a global economy driven by \nan IT dominated workforce.\n\n Furthermore, by restricting the cap of advanced degree H-1Bs to 20,000, we are effectively forcing the world's best \nand brightest out of the United States as soon as they have graduated from our top institutions.[40][41]#_edn40 \nSince most students do not have graduation dates until June, they never even have a chance to file for an H-1B \npetition by the April 1st deadline.[41][42]#_edn41 As Senator Amy Klobuchar stated, 'under the current system we \nhave been training our competition,' because many skilled immigrants were forced to return home after studying \nand working in the United States.[42][43]#_edn42 The total number of H-1Bs given - including both new visas and \nextensions given in both the general and advanced degree categories - peaked at slightly more than 330,000 H-1B \nvisas in 2001.[43][44]#_edn43 As of 2010, even with an increase in student visas and an increase in H-1B visa \npetitions, the total dropped to roughly 193,000.'[44][45]#_edn44 By restricting legal status opportunities for foreign \nstudents and high-skill workers, the U.S. is undermining its position in a global knowledge economy, where \ncompetitors such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada each select over 60 percent of their immigrants on \nthe basis of skills and education.[45][46]#_edn45\n\n With so many high-skill jobs remaining vacant, misconceptions about the effects of H-1B workers may play a \nsignificant role in the policy decisions to restrict the visa cap.[46][47]#_edn46 Evidence indicates that the general \npopulous, as well as several special interest groups, hold the mistaken belief that high-skill H-1B visa workers are \na cause of the high unemployment rate because they receive lower wages than U.S. born workers.[47][48]#_edn47 \nIn reality, the opposite is true. On average, H-1B workers earn more, cost their employers, and are more highly \neducated, than U.S. born workers.[48][49]#_edn48 Several studies have found that, contrary to popular belief, \nforeign IT professionals - those without U.S. citizenship and who are on an H-1B or other work visa - earn a salary \npremium when compared to IT professionals with U.S. citizenship.[49][50] #_edn49In fact, a recent study shows \nthat each H-1B visa holder helps create 1.8 American jobs, and that each U.S.-educated advanced degree green \ncard holder creates 2.6 American jobs.[50][51]#_edn50 Both academics and business leaders, such as Bill \nGates,[51][52]#_edn51 have addressed these misconceptions in order to inform Congress and the American public \nabout the economic peril the U.S. exposes itself to by maintaining an inadequate cap on the H-1B visa program. \nWithout significant increases and adjustments to this cap, we will continue to fall behind in the global knowledge \neconomy.\n\n Circumventing the System\n\nSince the H-1B visa program's foundation, employers and employees alike have devised increasingly creative and \neffective ways to circumvent the requirements and restrictions of the H-1B visa program. Enormous international \ninformation technology consulting firms such as Tata Consulting, Infosys and Cognizant have found ways to \nmanipulate H-1B LCAs and petitions in order to obtain a disproportionate amount of visas for on-site placement in \nthe U.S. The biggest user of H-1B last year was Cognizant, an IT consulting firm based in New Jersey. They \nreceived 9,000 of the 65,000 new visas.[52][53]#_edn52 These firms are able to manipulate loopholes in this \nsystem because they are working the H-1B petition forms to show that the H-1B worker will have a direct employee-\n\n\n\nemployer relationship with the consulting firm, meaning that they will be working on projects directly for the \nconsulting firm itself.[53][54]#_edn53 In reality, these firms are obtaining H-1B visas for these foreign national \nworkers and then are sourcing them out to other companies, such as banks, insurance firms, and health care \ncompanies at a premium rate.[54][55]#_edn54 They are then taking their own margin off of this rate and paying the \nactual H-1B worker after having taken their cut.[55][56] Sometimes there are several layers of firms taking a margin \noff of the original, premium rate that is billed to the client, before the remaining wage is paid to the actual \nworker.[56][57]#_edn56\n\n This system is a form of 'body shopping,'[57][58]#_edn57 and runs against everything the H-1B visa is set up to \nprotect. The purpose of the petition for an H-1B visa is to prove a true employee-employer relationship for the \nduration of the H-1B visa.[58][59]#_edn58 For example, an H-1B computer programmer would have a bank petition \nfor their visa and then work directly for them throughout the three to possible six-year duration of their visa. The \nbank could help the worker apply for permanent residence, due to the dual intent capabilities of the H-1B, or the \nworker could have another employer petition to transfer their visa if they found another job at another \ncompany.[59][60]#_edn59 This apparent ability for the worker to be mobile and to change jobs, ostensibly an \nexcellent quality in a visa, coupled with the loopholes that can be found in the petition for an H-1B[60][61]#_edn60, \nmake it easy for consulting firms of all sizes to create the appearance of a direct employer-employee \nrelationship.[61][62]#_edn61 This is one of the greatest disadvantages of the H-1B visa. Since high-skill workers \nunder the H-1B visa have to be sponsored by an employer, they are often more or less indentured, tied to their job \nand vulnerable to abuse and exploitation from that employer.[62][63]#_edn62\n\n The reality for the H-1B worker in these project based, questionable employer-employee situations, is that they will \nwork on projects for different companies without the full rights and benefits the visa is meant to \nprovide.[63][64]#_edn63 It also means that these workers will likely experience 'bench time'[64][65]#_edn64 when \nthere is no project for their consulting firm to place them on. During 'bench time,' an H-1B worker is generally paid a \nfraction of what their petition claimed they would be paid, or they are not paid at all.[65][66]#_edn65 Because the \nconsulting firm controls their visa and therefore their status in the United States, the firm is often able to manipulate \nthe worker into working longer hours, for lower wages. Firms can also convince an H-1B worker that they are \nunable to transfer their visas or to go against the firm's decisions by exploiting the worker's vulnerability and fear of \nlosing their visa.[66][67]#_edn66 Legislative steps have been taken, as early as 2010,[67][68]#_edn67 to restrict \nloopholes in the H-1B petitions but exploitation continues.[68][69]#_edn68 Tata Consulting employees in California \nrecently took the global firm to court in a class action lawsuit and won,[69][70]#_edn69 but the struggle to protect \nthe rights of H-1B workers continues.\n\n Critics have the concept of body shopping as an argument to keep the H-1B cap lowered. The argument has been \nmade that if body shopping were eliminated, it would free up more H-1Bs for correct use, therefore filling high-level \njob vacancies and removing any need to increase the cap.[70][71]#_edn70 Others argue that even with body \nshopping gone, high-skilled H-1Bs who are eager to work in the U.S. are filling the lowest-paid, systems analyst \npositions in order entry to the country,[71][72]#_edn71 and that this manipulation of the system still proves that \nthere is no need to raise the H-1B visa cap. While both sides can agree that the practice of body shopping must be \neliminated from the use of the work visa program, there is no clear evidence to support the claim that the removal \nof body shopping would be enough to end the shortage of high skilled workers in this country.[72][73]#_edn72\n\n International entrepreneurs are another group who is circumventing the system created by the H-1B visa program. \nTheir frustration with the immigration system became the impetus for a recently created startup called Blue Seed. \nThe concept behind Blue Seed is to allow international technologists and entrepreneurs to create a collaborative, \ninnovative environment onboard a large cruise ship, set 12 nautical miles off of the coast of San Francisco, in \ninternational waters. The location allows startup entrepreneurs from anywhere in the world to 'launch or grow their \ncompanies near Silicon Valley, without the need for a U.S. work visa.'[73][74]#_edn73 Blue Seed's entrepreneurial, \nlegal gymnastics have attracted attention from around the world. Already 1455 entrepreneurs, from 472 startups in \n70 countries have signed up to live onboard the ship,[74][75]#_edn74 with the majority of foreign interest coming \nfrom India.[75][76]#_edn75 This kind of talent, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit could be thriving inside U.S. \nborders right now, helping to create intellectually fertile and economically supportive conditions that helped to build \n\n\n\ncompanies such as Google, Apple, and Intel. Instead, investors are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a \nyear[76][77]#_edn76 to support the growth of their startup in a sea vessel floating somewhere in the Pacific.\n\n With the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs only increasing, a change \nmust be made to allow the world's future technology leaders to feel at home in the U.S. once again. Every STEM \njob that is filled in the U.S. creates, on average, 2.6 other jobs in the labor market.[77][78] Directly and indirectly, \nstudies have show there is only positive growth when more STEM workers, both foreign and U.S., take positions in \nthe U.S. economy.[78][79]#_edn78 Bipartisan legislation, such as the Immigration Innovation Act of 2013 and the \nSKILLS Visa Act, has recently been introduced to Congress to address this urgent need. Additionally, bi-partisan \nlegislation focused on addressing the immigration needs of entrepreneurs and start-ups such as the Startup Visa \nAct and Startup Act 3.0 is also pending.[79][80]#_edn79 This legislation will encourage innovation in the U.S. by \nallowing American companies and entrepreneurs to have access to the talented workers that they need through the \nH-1B visa program, while simultaneously investing in STEM education in the U.S. [80][81]#_edn80\n\n Reform: I-Squared and the SKILLS Visa Act\n\nMounting concerns from the technology sector[81][82]#_edn81 and select economists[82][83]#_edn82 have \nbecome catalysts for congressional debate on H-1B visa reform. The introduction of far-reaching bipartisan \nlegislation, such as the 'Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013', has \nhelped to open the door to these discussions. This legislation represents the most significant opportunity for \ncomprehensive immigration reform in the last 30 years,[83][84]#_edn83 and compelling legislation for H-1B reform \nis being introduced along with it.\n\n In both the Senate and the House of Representatives, legislation has been introduced addressing the need for an \nincrease in the H-1B cap. The 'Immigration Innovation (or I-Squared Act) Act of 2013,' which was introduced to the \nSenate in January of 2013, addresses the shortage of high-skilled STEM on one of immigration's most important \nissues: the hard H-1B cap.[84][85]#_edn84 It proposes to replace the hard cap with a market based 'H-1B \nescalator' that automatically adjusts the number of available visas depending on demand.[85][86]#_edn85 This \nwould mean that instead of a hard H-1B visa cap of 65,000 per year, the newly proposed cap of 115,000 would \nincrease by an additional 20,000 visas if the cap were met within the first 45 days.[86][87]#_edn86 If it takes longer \nto reach the cap, the number of additional visas is scaled down -15,000 more visas are released if the cap is hit on \nthe 60th day, 10,000 if on the 90th, or 5,000 if on the 275th.[87][88]#_edn87 Conversely, if the initial cap of 115,000 \nis not met by the end of the fiscal year, then the number of visas left unused from the previous year lowers the next \nyear's cap.[88][89]#_edn88\n\n This proposal is a definite improvement to the current hard visa cap but, as the Brookings Institute points out, it \nonly satisfies the issue of employer demand.[89][90]#_edn89 Brookings recommends the creation of an \nindependent panel of experts in a 'Standing Commission on Labor and Immigration' to make real-time \nrecommendations to Congress on H-1B cap levels based on local employment data, job projections, and insights \nfrom the business community.[90][91]#_edn90 This would be a more equitable and holistic solution, allowing H-1B \nvisa cap levels to adjust to local labor market needs,[91][92]#_edn91 rather than allowing the proposed H-1B \nescalator to create potential loopholes for employers to manipulate in order to craft an artificial race to the cap.\n\n In the House of Representatives, the 'Supplying Knowledge Based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visa \nAct,' also known as the SKILLS Visa Act, was recently passed by the House Judiciary Committee. This Act would \nincrease the H-1B visa cap for high-skilled workers from 65,000 to 155,000 and increase the special pool of visas \nfor foreign graduates of U.S. universities to 40,000.[92][93]#_edn92 It would strengthen the H-1B visa by adding \nenhancing anti-fraud provisions to the program, and it would eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based \ngreen cards, allowing American employers to have access to the best talent.[93][94] Additionally, it would provide a \nmajor boon to the visa program by allowing H-1B spouses, many of which are high-skilled STEM graduates \nthemselves, to work.[94][95]#_edn94 This would bring relief to many spouses of temporary immigrants, since many \nof them are educated women whose careers languished when their spouses came to work in the \nU.S.[95][96]#_edn95\n\n Conclusion\n\n\n\nAs a nation whose success has been built on diversity and innovation, there is no question that we must ensure that \nour immigration policies remain accessible and welcoming to the rest of the world. As an economy, we cannot \nafford to fall behind our competitors in high-skill workers and STEM leaders. Nor can we afford to hemorrhage \ninternational talent that has been educated in our very own university systems. It is imperative to our future as both \na nation and an economy to pass legislation to increase the H-1B visa cap. We cannot wait for this need to become \neven more critical.\n\n[1][97]Department of State, Temporary Worker Visas, http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1271.html\n\n [2]Washington Post, 'How to Keep America Competitive,' Bill Gates http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-\ndyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301697.html\n\n [3][98]Economic Policy Institute - 'Guestworkers in the High Skill U.S. Labor Market: Analysis of Supply and IT \nTrends of the IT Workforce,' http://www.epi.org/files/2013/Guestworkers-in-the-US-media-presentation-print.pdf\n\n [4][99]H-1B Visas: Legislative History, Trends Over Time, and Pathways to Permanent Residence, March 20, \n2006, http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=18974\n\n [5][100]A 'non-immigrant' is defined as an alien who must have a permanent residence abroad who seeks \ntemporary entry to the United States for a specific purpose, Department of Homeland Security, Definitions, \nhttp://www.dhs.gov/definition-terms#13\n\n [6][101]Id, at page 1.\n\n [7][102]Id.\n\n [8][103]Magnus Lofstrom, Joseph Hayes, H-1Bs: How do they Stack up to US Born Workers? \nhttp://ftp.iza.org/dp6259.pdf\n\n [9][104]Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-649), http://www.justice.gov/eoir/IMMACT1990.pdf\n\n [10][105]8 U.S.C. 1184 (i)(1)(a) - Admission of nonimmigrants\n\n [11][106]Id.\n\n [12][107]http://www.rosecarson.com/clientinfo/PDF/H1B.pdf[108]\n\n [13][109]Employment Law Guided, Department of Labor, http://www.dol.gov/compliance/guide/h1b.htm\n\n [14][110]Id.\n\n [15][111]'Fact Sheet #62S: What is a willful violator employer?'
