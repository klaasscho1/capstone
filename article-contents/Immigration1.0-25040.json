{"title": "LETTERS Immigrant Cabdrivers", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  Rewarding cabdrivers who can prove their identity and aptitude behind the wheel with driver's licenses is not only \npolitically correct, but also morally sound. ''New York's Immigrant Drivers'' (editorial, Sept. 22) supports a claim that \nshould be accepted nationwide, not only in nine states.\n\n Safe drivers who continue to help pedestrians in New York should be rewarded for their achievements, not \nquestioned because of their immigration status.\n\n  Gov. Eliot Spitzer was correct in supporting this disputed decision, and I believe that only positive things will occur \nbecause of his choice. \n\n  Anyhow, who wouldn't want to know that his or her life is in good hands when stepping into a cab?\n\n  Meredith Meyer Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Sept. 22, 2007\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
