{"title": "Legal Tangle Puts 24 Malaysians in Boston Jails", "body": "\nThey came as tourists, but they ended up in jail. Twenty-four Malaysians in the middle of a world tour have been \ndetained for 11 days here in a painful and perplexing legal tangle, held as witnesses while the Federal Government \nprosecutes their tour leader on charges of trying to smuggle two of them into the country.\n\nMalaysian Government officials and lawyers for the tourists -- 18 men and 6 women -- have expressed outrage at \nthe detentions. They say a number of the tourists have been threatened by agents for the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and kept from speaking to Malaysian consular officials.\n\nThe detentions are being defended by American officials. All the tourists are ethnic Chinese, and in recent years the \nGovernment has been concerned by an influx of illegal Chinese immigrants.\n\nVerne Jervis, the chief spokesman for the immigration service, said on Saturday that Federal law allowed the \nauthorities to detain material witnesses in an immigration case indefinitely.\n\nIn an interview in The Boston Globe today, A. John Pappalardo, the United States Attorney in Boston, was quoted \nas saying, \"I have reviewed this case, and I am entirely comfortable with the current posture of it.\" He did not return \ncalls to his office today.\n\n \n\n'If They Were White . . .'\n\n But Charles W. Rankin, a court-appointed lawyer for one tourist, said the Malaysians had been \"treated in a racist \nmanner\" by the immigration service. \"If they were white Europeans, they would have been released immediately,\" \nhe said.\n\nMichael Altman, a lawyer for Chee Kheong Choong, the 39-year-old tour leader, said, \"If this happened to a group \nof 25 Americans in Malaysia, there would probably be a plan to send in the Marines.\"\n\nLawyers for the witnesses said their clients had not even had legal representation for eight days, until they were \nbrought into court and lawyers were appointed for them.\n\nThe incident began Oct. 21, when the group arrived in Boston on a flight from Paris. It was their first stop on the \nAmerican leg of a $2,400 eight-city tour that was to have ended this week with a visit to Washington.\n\n\nAccording to Mr. Altman, an immigration inspector noticed that one of the tourists had been in the United States \nbefore and might have overstayed her six-month tourist visa. The inspector then decided to question the entire \ngroup, holding the visitors in a jail in the Coast Guard station in Boston, Mr. Altman said. They are now being held \nin county jails.\n\n \n\nHandcuffs in the Courtroom\n\n The Government has asked that seven members of the tour group be held as witnesses against Mr. Choong, an \nemployee of Chan Brothers, a travel agency in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Altman has asked in United States District Court \nhere that the other members of the group be held so he can question them.\n\nHe told Magistrate-Judge Marianne B. Bowler on Friday that he had no objection to their being released from jail, \nsince the Immigration Service has confiscated their passports. But late Friday afternoon Judge Bowler ordered that \nall 24 be held over the weekend, pending a further hearing on Tuesday.\n\nAt a hearing before Judge Bowler on Thursday, the tourists were brought into the courtroom in plastic handcuffs, \ntheir lawyers said. Asked to take an oath, they were unable to raise their right hands, and although it was hot in the \ncourtroom, the marshals refused to cut off the handcuffs so they could take off their overcoats.\n\nSeveral immigration lawyers said today that when the immigration services suspects that a visa has been \noverstayed, it normally simply deports the visitor. But in this case, immigration agents questioned the tourists and \nMr. Choong.\n\n \n\nTourists Who Stayed\n\n Two of the women, Lee Ling Ng and Chee Men Lee, told the agents they had been in the country before and had \nstayed several years beyond the six-month limit, according to testimony by an immigration service agent, Kevin \nJarvis. He said Miss Ng and Miss Lee told Mr. Choong they wanted to stay in the United States to work.\n\nLawyers say the detained tourists, who include a pregnant woman and a couple on their honeymoon, all have valid \nvisas.\n\nThe Malaysian Ambassador, Abdul Majid, said in a telephone interview from Washington that his only information \nabout the case had come from reporters. He called the incident \"quite serious\" but added that he would not take \nany further action until he knew more about it.\n"}
