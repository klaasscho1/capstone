{"title": "Regulatory update: FCC has submitted Public Draft: Business Data Services in an Internet Protocol Environment", "body": "\n Washington: Federal Communications Commission, The Government of USA has published the following \ndocument:\n\n \n\n March 30, 2017\n\n FACT SHEET*\n\n Business Data Services in an Internet Protocol Environment et al.\n\n Report and Order \u2013 WC Docket No. 16-143 et al.\n\n Background: Business data service (also known as special access) refers to the dedicated point-to-point\n\n transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections.\n\n Businesses, non-profits, and government institutions use business data services to enable secure and\n\n reliable transfer of data, as a means of connecting to the Internet or the cloud, and to create private or\n\n virtual private networks. The FCC has historically subjected the provision of business data services by\n\n incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) to price regulations.\n\n The Chairman of the FCC has circulated a draft Report and Order (Order) that, based on an extensive\n\n\n record, recognizes the presence of strong competition in the business data services market, and therefore\n\n eases the regulatory burdens on providers of these services. By modernizing our rules, the draft Order\n\n will allow market forces to continue working to spur entry, innovation and competition in the vibrant\n\n business data services market.\n\n What the Report and Order Would Do:\n\n \u201a Find that competition is robust and vigorous in the markets for packet-based business data\n\n services, certain other high-capacity business data services, and transport services so that\n\n continued legacy regulation is more likely to impede the introduction of new services and raise\n\n prices than to benefit consumers.\n\n \u201a Confirm that certain competitive offerings constitute private carriage.\n\n \u201a Find that competition for lower-speed services (DS1s and DS3s) is robust in some, but not all,\n\n counties, and apply a competitive market test to determine where actual and potential competition\n\n is likely to constrain prices and lead additional investment.\n\n \u201a In areas with sufficient competition, modernize rules to facilitate additional infrastructure\n\n investment and next-generation services by ending tariffing and other legacy pricing regulations.\n\n \u201a In areas without sufficient competition, maintain price caps with a prospective productivity-based\n\n X factor of 2% to ensure small businesses and other customers are not subject to price increases\n\n and share in productivity gains.\n\n o Grant carriers additional flexibility to offer discounts in such areas to schools, libraries,\n\n rural healthcare clinics, and other special access customers.\n\n o Ensure continued Commission oversight by prohibiting the use of agreements that would\n\n bar disclosure of contract terms to the FCC going forward.\n\n\n\n * This document is being released as part of a \u201cpermit-but-disclose\u201d proceeding. Any presentations or views on the\n\n subject expressed to the Commission or its staff, including by email, must be filed in WC Docket No. 16-143, which\n\n may be accessed via the Electronic Comment Filing System (https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n *This document has been circulated for tentative consideration by the Commission at its April open meeting. The\n\n issues referenced in this document and the Commission\u2019s ultimate resolution of those issues remain under\n\n consideration and subject to change.

INTRODUCTION\n\n 1. After more than ten years of studying the business data services (also referred to as BDS) market, numerous \nrequests for comment, and a massive data collection, we at long last recognize the intense competition present in \nthis market and adjust our regulatory structure accordingly. The record in this proceeding demonstrates substantial \nand growing competition in the provision of business data services in areas served by incumbent local exchange \n\n\n\ncarriers (LECs) subject to price cap regulation. By adopting a framework which accounts for these dynamic \ncompetitive realities, we will create a regulatory environment that promotes long-term innovation and investment by \nincumbent and competitive providers alike which well-serves business data services customers.\n\n 2. The record indicates the market for business data services is dynamic with a large number of firms building fiber \nand competing for this business. The 2015 Collection1 identified 491 facilities-based companies providing business \ndata services in the enterprise market.2 Competitive LECs such as Zayo, U.S. Telepacific and Birch continue to \ninvest and expand their competitive fiber networks with very successful results.3 Competitive LECs, not including \ncable providers, earned $23 billion of the $45 billion in business data services revenue in 2013.4 Cable providers \nhave also emerged as formidable competitors in this market. Cable business data services are reported to have \ngrown at approximately 20 percent annually for the past several years and, increasingly, they have emphasized \nInternet access and managed services, which directly compete with the products being offered by the incumbent \nand other competitive LECs.5\n\n 3. Although incumbent LECs once dominated the business data services market selling circuit-based DS1s and \nDS3s, such technology is becoming obsolete. Significant increases in bandwidth demand are being driven by \nbandwidth-hungry applications, mainly video services (teleconferencing, training, etc.) as well as by web and \ncloud-based services. These rapidly increasing bandwidth demands will place an ever increasing demand for \nservices such as Ethernet, especially over fiber, which can scale bandwidth to meet these requirements more \neffectively than can the old legacy services.6 Packet-based\n\n 1 The 2015 Collection refers to the data collected from business data services providers and purchasers in the \nCommission\u2019s Business Data Services/Special Access rulemaking. See Special Access for Price Cap Local \nExchange Carriers; AT&T Corp. Petition for Rulemaking to Reform Regulation of Incumbent Local Exchange \nCarrier Rates for Interstate Special Access Services, WC Docket No. 05-25, RM-10593, Order, 29 FCC Rcd \n14346 (WCB 2014).\n\n 2 Dr. Marc Rysman, Empirics of Business Data Services at tbl. 5 (Apr. 2016),            \n 3 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4748, para. 58.\n\n 4 AT&T Comments at 13.\n\n 5 See Craig Moffett, Business Services Critical to Cable Growth, LightReading (Dec. 3, 2015),            \nhttp://www.lightreading.com /cable/cable-business-services/moffett-business-services-critical-to-cable-growth/d/d-\nid/719612.\n\n 6 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4756-59, paras 77-80.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n\n 4\n\n services, which include Ethernet, already make up a large part of the business data services marketplace. In \n2013, more than 40 percent of the approximately $45 billion in dedicated service revenues were for packet-based \nservices.7 Based on provider and analyst forecasts, we expect this shift from circuit-based to packet-based \nservices to continue at a rapid pace.8\n\n 4. Against this competitive backdrop, we now move away from the traditional model of intrusive pricing regulation \nfor incumbent LECs, recognizing that ex ante pricing regulation is of limited use\u2014and often harmful\u2014in a dynamic \nand increasingly competitive marketplace. Indeed, there is a significant likelihood ex ante pricing regulation will \ninhibit growth and investment in many cases. 9 In such circumstances, we should not continue unnecessary \nregulations, much less extend them to new services or providers. Instead, we adopt a framework based on our \nmarket analysis and a careful balancing of the costs and benefits of ex ante pricing regulation that deregulates \ncounties where the provision of price cap incumbent LECs\u2019 business data services is deemed sufficiently \ncompetitive.\n\n 5. This Report and Order (Order), therefore, provides a new framework for business data services that minimizes \nunnecessary government intervention and allows market forces to continue working to spur entry, innovation, and \ncompetition.10 Our decisions stem from careful consideration of the data submitted in the proceeding and the \nthoughtful comments and ex parte communications submitted into the record. Our thinking on how to evaluate \ncompetition and design pricing regulation evolved as we engaged with economists, advocates, and others to \ndevelop an administrable approach to de-regulate in areas where competitive forces are able to ensure just and \nreasonable rates. To a large extent in the business data services market, the competition envisioned in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act)11 has been realized, and this order is an important step in updating \nour rules to adequately reflect such market developments.\n\n II. BACKGROUND\n\n 6. Business data services refers to the dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds \nand service levels using high-capacity connections. Henceforth, we refer to special access services as a subset of \nbusiness data services that we continue in some circumstances to subject to ex ante pricing regulation. \nSpecifically, special access services include DS1 and DS3 interoffice facilities and channel terminations between \nan incumbent LEC\u2019s serving wire center and an interexchange carrier (IXC), and end user channel terminations, \nalthough ex ante pricing regulation would only apply to certain end user channel terminations.12 Businesses, non-\nprofits, and government institutions use business data services to enable secure and reliable transfer of data, for \nexample, as a means of connecting to the Internet or the cloud, and to create private or virtual private networks. \nBusiness data services support applications that require symmetrical bandwidth, substantial reliability, security, \nand connected service to more than one location. Business data services are significant to our\n\n 7 Id. at 4759-60, para. 81.\n\n 8 Id.\n\n 9 For discussion of this point see Mark Jamison, The cost of regulating special access: A 55 percent investment \ndecrease, TechPolicyDaily.com  (Apr. 12, 2016),            http://www.techpolicydaily.com /internet/the-cost-of-\nregulating-special-access-a-55-percent-investment-decrease/; Tech Knowledge Reply Comments at 5; Hal Singer, \n\nhttp://www.techpolicydaily.com/\n\n\nAssessing the Consequences of Additional FCC Regulation of Business Broadband: An Empirical Analysis, \nEconomists Incorporated (Apr. 7, 2016).\n\n 10 See Further Notice.\n\n 11 Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub.

The 1996\n\n Act amended the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.\n\n 12 DS1s and DS3s have symmetrical bandwidths of about 1.5 Mbps and 45 Mbps, respectively.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 5\n\n nation\u2019s economy\u2014revenues reported by providers in response to the 2015 Collection total almost $45 billion for \n2013,13 and revenues for the broader market for enterprise services, which include voice, Internet, private \nnetwork, web-security, cloud connection, and other digital services, could exceed $75 billion annually.14 Moreover, \nthese numbers do not capture the indirect contribution of business data services to the nation\u2019s economy as \nbusiness customers rely on these services for their commercial operations.\n\n 7. The Commission has historically subjected the provision of business data services by incumbent LECs to \ndominant carrier safeguards.15 The focus of this proceeding is on areas where incumbent LECs are subject to price \ncap regulation in setting their business data services rates. Beginning in 1999, through a series of Commission \nactions, the Commission: (1) began granting price cap incumbent LECs pricing flexibility by establishing both \nPhase I relief (which permitted the provision of volume and term agreements and contract tariffs) and Phase II relief \n(which relieved the carrier of price cap regulation) through \u201ctriggers\u201d using collocation as a proxy for competition; 16 \n(2) adopted the \u201cCALLS plan, which separated business data services into its own basket and applied separate \u201cX-\nfactors;\u201d 17 (3) initiated a rulemaking to examine a number of aspects of the business data services market, \nincluding whether to apply and how to calculate a productivity-based X-factor and whether to maintain or modify the \npricing flexibility rules; 18 and (4) granted a number of price cap incumbent LECs forbearance\n\n 13 Based on aggregate revenue totals reported in responses to questions II.A.15-16 and II.B.8-9 in the 2015 \nCollection.\n\n 14 See Rysman Paper at Tbl. 3 (Apr. 2016); see also Dr. Marc Rysman, Empirics of Business Data Services, \nWhite Paper, at 9, tbl. 3 (Apr. 2016, rev.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESS DATA SERVICES\n\n 10. In this section we consider competition among traditional and non-traditional providers of end-to-end business \ndata services and the circumstances under which market conditions warrant a deregulatory approach for certain \nbusiness data services consistent with our obligation to ensure that the rates for services offered by common \ncarriers are just and reasonable.26 In the present rulemaking, the Commission has already determined that \nsignificant aspects of the pricing flexibility regulatory regime have failed.27 Thus, we must now decide whether to \nallow that failure to continue or to implement changes. As is often the case with complex problems, there is no ideal \ndataset available or which we could collect in a reasonable timeframe or expense, which would answer all doubts. \nInstead, we must carefully parse the available evidence and apply reasoned judgment to decide the questions \nbefore us.28\n\n 11. The Commission is charged with ensuring that the rates, terms, and conditions for services offered by \ncommon carriers are just and reasonable and that services are not offered on an unreasonably discriminatory \nbasis pursuant to sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Communications Act.29 We \u201cmay prescribe such rules and \nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this Act.\u201d30 We also have an \nobligation under section 706(a) of the 1996 Act to: (Continued from previous page)\n\n 25, RM-10593, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 27 FCC Rcd 16318, 16346, para. \n68 (2012) (Data Collection Order or Data Collection FNPRM).\n\n 22 See Special Access for Price Cap Local Exchange Carriers; AT&T Corporation Petition for Rulemaking to \nReform Regulation of Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Rates for Interstate Special Access Services, WC \nDocket No. 05-25, RM-10593, Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 13189, 13192, para. 5 (WCB 2013) (Data Collection \nImplementation Order).\n\n 23 See Data Collection Implementation Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 13192, para. 7.

Our public interest evaluation \u201cnecessarily encompasses . . . among other things, a deeply rooted preference \nfor preserving and enhancing competition in relevant markets [and] accelerat[ing] private sector deployment of \nadvanced services.\u201d32 A competition analysis is critical to our public interest evaluation and is informed by, but not \nlimited to, traditional antitrust principles designed to protect competition.33 The Commission, in conducting an \nanalysis, may \u201cconsider technological and market changes as well as trends within the communications industry, \nincluding the nature and rate of change.\u201d34 Analyzing the competitive nature of the market for business data \nservices, will allow us to make a determination about the appropriate way to balance the costs and benefits of \napplying ongoing regulation to particular business data services.\n\n 13. For business data services provided over DS1s and DS3s supplied by the incumbent LEC we find that a \nnearby potential business data services supplier, in the form of a wired communication network provider, generally \ntempers prices in the short term and results in reasonably competitive outcomes over three to five years (the \nmedium term). For example, a cable company that has fiber nodes nearby, and hence the ability to provide both \nEthernet-over-fiber and, even more readily Ethernet-over-Hybrid Fiber Coax (EoHFC), if a profitable opportunity \narises, is particularly relevant to pricing decisions of a business data services provider wishing to retain a \ncustomer.\n\n 14. Our conclusion is based in part on record evidence indicating a cost structure for business data services that \nincentivizes suppliers with existing networks to compete vigorously for customers. We also base our conclusion on \nfindings that the impact of the first entrant on price will be substantially higher than the impact of subsequent \nentrants and business data services pricing is often determined by a\n\n (Continued from previous page)\n\n goal throughout this rulemaking proceeding has been to establish a set of criteria to enable us to determine \nwhether there are certain firms which could not rationally engage in the activities proscribed by the operative \nprovisions of Title II of the Communications Act, viz.

Together the evidence demonstrates how even a single competitor exerts competitive pressure which results in \njust and reasonable rates. This evidence demonstrates that the significant network investment required to provide \nbusiness data services to end users is increasingly being leveraged in ways that prevent substantial abuses of \nmarket power. Given such incentives, the presence of two current competitors or providers with their own fiber \nnodes within a half mile, hereafter referred to as medium-term entrants, or that will serve over the medium term, are \nsufficient to provide competitive pressure to adequately discipline prices. Our finding is also based on evidence of \ncompetition that is currently in place or likely to arise over the medium term.\n\n 16. In addition, we find that business data services with bandwidths in excess of the level of a DS3 generally \nexperience reasonably competitive outcomes, and to the extent they do not today, will do so over the medium term \neven where a facility-based competitor has no nearby facilities. We come to this conclusion based on a record that \nshows almost no evidence of competitive problems in the supply of these higher bandwidth services, and which \nshows higher bandwidth opportunities are particularly attractive to competitive LECs. We make a similar finding for \ntransport services, where the record presents little evidence of competitive problems, and where low bandwidth \ndemand is quickly turning into high bandwidth demand. We make a similar finding for lower bandwidth packet-\nbased services. We reach these conclusions because, compared with time division multiplex (TDM) services, \ncompetitive LECs are considerably more active in the supply of packet-based services, are on a considerably more \n\n\n\nlevel playing field in supplying these new services against incumbent LECs, and have better incentives to supply \nsuch future-proof services where demand is growing rapidly.\n\n A. Introduction\n\n 17. We analyze the 2015 Collection, and look to analyses and other evidence submitted in this proceeding, to \nreach findings concerning competiveness in the business data services industry. In conducting our analysis, we \nconsider market concentration as highly relevant, but do not find it determinative absent consideration of market \ndynamics.37 We also look at specific market-based circumstances when considering actual and potential sources \nof competition.\n\n 18. In this section, we review the competitiveness of business data services, in general, as well as issues raised \nby commenters. We reach findings as to the degree of competitiveness in the business data services industry and \nconsider industry trends on competitive entry.38 We look to see if\n\n 35 By uncommitted here we mean an entrant without a connection to a business location but with significant \ninvestment in the area.\n\n 36 Supracompetitive prices are those above what a competitive market can sustain. See George S. Ford, How \n(and How Not) to Measure Market Power over Business Data Services, Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & \nEconomic Public Policy Studies (Sept. 2016) (discussion of the \u201ccompetitive price\u201d in the telecommunications \nmarket where fixed costs are substantial).\n\n 37 U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, \u00a7 5 (Aug. 19, 2010) \n(stating \u201cthe Agencies evaluate market shares and concentration in conjunction with other reasonably available and \nreliable evidence\u201d) (2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines).\n\n 38 See Applications of NYNEX Corp., Transferor, and Bell Atlantic Corp., Transferee, Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder, 12 FCC Rcd 19985, 20003-04, para. 32 (1997) (\u201c[U]nder the public interest standard, the Commission may \n(continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 10\n\n services are reasonably substitutable to determine an appropriate product market, and, in the case of geographic \nmarkets, we look to areas \u201cin which the seller operates and to which the purchaser can practically turn for \nsupplies.\u201d39 As part of that analysis we observe high barriers to entry, but also observe a significant penetration of \ncompetitive business data services facilities being deployed and upgraded with a number of technologies \nthroughout the country, particularly in areas with significant customer demand. Moreover, we observe a strong \nwillingness on the part of providers to extend their networks half a mile to meet demand, especially over the \nmedium term.\n\n 19. Consistent with antitrust principles, we distinguish product markets by generally looking at whether various \nservices are reasonably interchangeable, with differences in price, quality, and service capability being relevant.40 \nIn the case of geographic markets, we look at both supply and demand substitution.41 For both product and \ngeographic markets, it is conventional to undertake a hypothetical monopolist test to determine market definitions. \n\n\n\nThat approach begins with the smallest plausible market definition and considers likely consumer substitution if a \nhypothetical monopolist in that market imposed a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price \n(SSNIP).42 We do not have data that would enable a more formal application of such a test, but our market \nanalysis considers purchasers\u2019 willingness and ability to substitute services, suppliers, and geographies. The \nextent to which supply is broadly competitive wherever the incumbent LEC also faces a facility-based rival is \nstrengthened by our findings as to specific product markets, and refined by our analysis of geographic markets.\n\n B. Product Market\n\n 20. When defining a product market, to ensure our action affects an appropriate group of services, we look to \nwhich services are sufficiently similar to reasonably be considered substitutes.43 We consider a number of factors, \nincluding the \u201cpractical indicia\u201d identified by the Supreme Court, such as \u201cindustry or public recognition of the \nsubmarket as a separate economic entity, the product\u2019s peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production \nfacilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.\u201d44 Not all of these \nfactors must be present to define the relevant product market.45 Perfect substitutability is not required as part of our \nbroad review of business data services markets and our narrow consideration of certain special access service \ninputs that comprise a full business data services customer circuit.46 (Continued from previous page)\n\n consider the trends within and needs of the industry, the factors that influenced Congress to enact specific \nprovisions for a particular industry, and the complexity and rapidity of change in the industry.\u201d).\n\n 39 Tampa Elec.

A product that substitutes for another demonstrates a possibility that consumers will purchase the competing \nservice of a competitor, including a potential entrant. Consequently, we consider providers with facilities used to \n\n\n\nsupply one service that could be used to provide another.47 For example, we see not only substitution between \ncircuit- and packet-based business data services, but the capacity to supply both services over the same \nunderlying facilities, indicating the two services are likely in the same market, and more importantly, that suppliers \nof either service are in the same market, as they could readily provide the other service over their facilities.48 \nSimilarly, while best-efforts services do not generally appear to be a good substitute for business data services \n(and vice versa), legacy hybrid-fiber-coaxial (HFC) and copper (in fact, generally hybrid-fiber-copper) facilities are \ncommercially used to provide low bandwidth business data services (if not always at the highest commercially \navailable quality standards). Unbundled network elements (UNEs), dark fiber, and fixed wireless services and \nfacilities used to provision business data services also play competitive roles in business data services markets.\n\n 1. Circuit- and Packet-Based Business Data Services\n\n 22. The legacy technology for providing business data services is circuit-based using TDM. Incumbent LECs are \nthe primary facilities-based suppliers of TDM-based services, including DS1s and DS3s with symmetrical \ncapacities of 1.5 Mbps and 45 Mbps, respectively. For decades, these workhorses were the only options available \nto meet the high-capacity needs of users.49 TDM circuits provide dedicated, secure, reliable and low-delay \ntransmission service for moving voice, data, and video traffic,50 but do not effectively scale for data intensive \napplications.51 To increase bandwidth for DS1s/DS3s, providers must bond multiple circuits together. For example, \nproviders can bond up to eight DS1s to achieve a maximum bandwidth of 12 Mbps.52 DS3s are rarely bonded, \nhowever, because with the increased cost, the more logical option is to use a newer technology, such as a packet-\nbased service.53 In\n\n 47 See 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines \u00a7 5.1.\n\n 48 See Letter from Matthew A. Brill, Counsel for Comcast Corp., to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC \nDocket No. 05-25, at 2 (filed Mar. 13, 2017) (Comcast Mar. 13, 2017 Ex Parte) (\u201cexplain[ing] that the existence of \nHFC facilities can facilitate Comcast\u2019s ability to construct new fiber connections to customer locations more rapidly \nand at lower cost than if Comcast lacked nearby HFC facilities\u201d).\n\n 49 USTelecom Comments at 7.\n\n 50 Circuit-based TDM services, typically provided over copper, and sometimes over fiber links, do not suffer from \nthe routing issues that can affect packet-based services, such as packet loss, jitter or latency.

Because packet-based networks move packets over a shared transport channel, they are more efficient than a \ncircuit-based network where transmission capacity is reserved even when not used. The routing and reassembling \nof data packets, however, can lead to packet loss, jitter, and latency, affecting the quality of service needed to \nsupport certain applications desired by users, e.g., real-time and mission critical applications. Providers can mitigate \nthese delays through packet prioritization and setting performance parameters, like assigning different classes of \nservice and quality of service levels (with, for example, Service Level Agreements (SLAs)).55 In this way, \nproviders can shape and differentiate networks to improve performance to meet the specific needs of users.56 \nBacked by performance guarantees, packet-based business data services can provide the same, if not better, level \nof security, reliability, and symmetrical speeds as a DS1 or DS3 service. Packet-based business data services can \nalso accomplish this with greater efficiency and scalability to satisfy a user\u2019s growing bandwidth demands.\n\n 24. Functionally, TDM and packet-based services are broadly interchangeable in the business data services \nrealm as both are used to provide connectivity for data network and point-to-point transmissions and both services \ncan be delivered over the same network infrastructure.57 Incumbent and competitive LEC providers offer both \ntypes of services to similar types of customers and their marketing materials juxtapose these two technologies \nagainst each other.58 Customers of TDM-based services are also switching to packet-based services.59 And \ncommenters representing suppliers agree, with limited exception, the services, whether circuit-based or packet-\nbased, are substitutes and in the same product market.60\n\n 54 See Baker Decl. at 5; Ralph Santitoro, Metro Ethernet Services \u2013 Technical Overview, Metro Ethernet Forum at \n7-11,            https://www.mef.net/Assets/WhitePapers/Metro-Ethernet-Services.pdf (last visited Mar. 28, 2017) \n(MEF Overview).\n\n 55 Baker Decl. at 5; MEF Overview at 1; Juniper Networks, Understanding Class of Service (CoS) Profiles,            \n 56 MEF Overview at 18; Juniper Networks, Understanding Class of Service (CoS) Profiles,            \nhttp://www.juniper.net/documentation/enUS/junos-space-apps/network-director3.0/topics/concept/cos-profile-\nunderstanding.html (last updated Sept. 29, 2016).\n\n 57 Ad Hoc Jan. 28, 2016 Comments at 15; Birch et al.

Substitution between these two services, however, is generally one directional. New customers, more likely \nthan not, are choosing to purchase Ethernet services, subject to their availability and pricing,61 and existing \ncustomers of TDM-based service are switching to Ethernet.62 There is no evidence suggesting Ethernet \ncustomers are switching to DS1s and DS3s.63 Nor as a policy matter would we want that to occur as the \ntechnology transition is moving towards the eventual termination of TDM service offerings altogether. The \nCommission wants to encourage that migration, while mitigating disruptions to existing customers, to help unleash \nthe benefits of network innovation for American businesses and consumers.64\n\n 26. We find circuit- and packet-switched business data services that offer similar speed, functionality, and quality \nof service characteristics fall within the same product markets for the purposes of action taken here, even though \nthere is evidence suggesting the two technologies have important distinctions. Indeed, the Commission has long \nconsidered TDM and packet-based business data services as functionally interchangeable at comparable \ncapacities and has consistently included both types of business data services in its orders and forbearance \ndecisions.65 Courts, in turn, have upheld the Commission\u2019s view. 66 Although commenters have pointed out some \ndifferences between these technologies, there is considerable evidence in the record indicating that the \nCommission\u2019s view on\n\n 61 See, e.g., ACA Comments at 31; XO Jan. 27, 2016 Comments at 24; Sprint Comments, Ex. B, Frentrup Decl. at \npara. 6 (Sprint Frentrup Decl.).\n\n 62 At the same time, customers may choose to stay with TDM services despite availability of packet-based \nservices due to higher prices or costs associated with replacing equipment that uses legacy TDM services. See, \ne.g., XO Jan. 27, 2016 Comments at 24-25 (\u201cThat said, because existing TDM customers have investment in TDM \nequipment, they are more reluctant to move to the \u2018next level\u2019 Ethernet service even where Ethernet prices are \ndropping and bandwidth is increasing.\u201d).\n\n\n 63 See, e.g., XO Jan. 27, 2016 Comments at 25 (\u201cXO does not see customers, even with low speed requirements, \nmoving from Ethernet to TDM services.\u201d).\n\n 64 As explained in the Technology Transitions Order, \u201c[m]odernizing communications networks can dramatically \nreduce network costs, allowing providers to serve customers with increased efficiencies that can lead to improved \nand innovative product offerings and lower prices.

Accordingly, the Commission strives \n\u201cto position all the players \u2014 innovators (including those in existing lines of business), legacy service providers and \nmanufacturers, government regulators and the general public \u2014 to prepare for, maintain, and facilitate the \nmomentum of technological advances that are already occurring.\u201d Id.\n\n 65 See, e.g., Petition of Qwest Corp. for Forbearance Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(C) in the Phoenix, Arizona \nMetropolitan Statistical Area, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 8622, 8657, paras. 68-69 (2010) \n(Qwest Phoenix Order); United States v.

We believe that legacy TDM \nbusiness data services suppliers would be constrained by the threat of potential customer loss to packet-based \nbusiness data services suppliers.\n\n 2. Ethernet over Hybrid-Fiber Coax\n\n 27. Packet-based business data services over fiber are the gold standard for the industry because they provide \nthe greatest flexibility to efficiently scale bandwidth to the highest speeds at the highest performance levels. There \nis debate in the record, however, on whether we should include the packet-based Ethernet services provided by \ncable companies using their HFC networks in the product market for business data services.67 Our review of the \nrecord now confirms that competitive pressure on low bandwidth packet-based services carried on fiber and legacy \nTDM services is significant.\n\n\n\n 28. In many ways, EoHFC is much like other modes of business data services. Ethernet-over-HFC technology \nprovides point-to-point wireline connection at symmetrical speeds, albeit limited to 10 Mbps.68 Although EoHFC is \nnot as reliable as circuit-switched or fiber connections, some cable companies are able to guarantee 99.9 percent \navailability (as compared to fiber\u2019s 99.99 percent).69 In addition to availability, some cable companies offer further \nperformance guarantees, addressing jitter, latency, packet loss, availability, and mean time to repair their Ethernet \nover DOCSIS service.70 Comcast targets its EoHFC service to \u201c[c]ustomers with low to medium bandwidth \nrequirements that need enterprise features.\u201d71 Wholesalers, for instance, are increasingly leaning on the cable \nindustry\u2019s vast EoHFC network to address the needs of their multi-regional customers.72 [BEGIN HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL] [END HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] \u201chas certified both fiber-based and HFC-based Ethernet offering \nfrom cable companies for use in [its business data] services, as well as for use in [its] backhaul services.\u201d73 \nSimilarly, Sprint has announced that it now provides business data services over cable company facilities, \nincluding EoHFC.74\n\n 29.

Best-efforts Internet access services describe basic Internet access as generally marketed to residential and \nsmall business subscribers. At the most-basic level, best-efforts and dedicated business data services appear to \nbe interchangeable: end users can use both services to access the Internet or create virtual private networks. \nHowever, best-efforts Internet access is provided with asymmetrical speeds and without service performance \nguarantees.78 Whereas dedicated packet-based business data services allow for packet prioritization and quality \nof service priority tiers, best-efforts services do not.79 Also, while dedicated business data services commonly \nprovide at least 99.9 percent network reliability, with higher guarantees being available for fiber services, and \nguarantees for latency and jitter,80 best-efforts services generally do not offer any reliability guarantees, although \nsome cable providers offer some non-binding performance \u201cassurances.\u201d81\n\n 31.

For example, AT&T explains that its sales team has discovered that \u201cfor the thirteen-\nmonth period from November 2014 through November 2015, a very substantial portion of AT&T\u2019s competitive \nlosses were to cable companies and a significant portion of those losses were to best efforts cable services.\u201d88 \nWe, therefore, observe substitution and best-efforts networks supporting business data services for certain \ncustomers, but we do not observe broad substitution or substantial performance similarities with fiber-based \nbusiness data services sufficient to determine that best-efforts service and its underlying facilities are in the same \nproduct market. In that manner, best-efforts services can be distinguished from other business data services. \nDespite this, the underlying facilities used to provision best-efforts services, even over legacy media such as HFC, \ncan be and are being repurposed to provide business data services.89\n\n 4.

Incumbent LECs are required by section 251(c)(3) of the Act and section 51.319 of the Commission\u2019s rules to \nprovide requesting common carriers with DS1s, DS3s, and bare copper loops as UNEs.91 UNE rates, as \ndetermined by the state public utility commissions, are based on forward-looking costs not on the incumbent LECs\u2019 \nhistorical costs, and are thus typically lower than the incumbent LEC rates for regulated DS1 and DS3 services.92 \nUNEs are intended to facilitate competition by lowering barriers to stimulate facilities-based entry into local markets, \nand the Commission has imposed unbundling obligations \u201cin those situations where [it] finds that carriers genuinely \nare impaired without access to particular network elements and where unbundling does not frustrate sustainable, \nfacilities-based competition.\u201d93\n\n 34. The availability of UNEs from incumbent LECs is limited based on the \u201cimpair\u201d standard.94 DS1 and DS3 UNE \nloops are allowed only in those buildings located within the service area of an incumbent LEC wire center that falls \nbelow a certain business density line and fiber collocation threshold.95 As a practical matter, competitive LECs \ncannot rely on UNEs at a wire center in which the competitive LEC is not collocated.96 Moreover, with incumbent \nLECs increasingly retiring their copper-based infrastructure, the question also arises as to the extent to which UNEs \nremain available in the future.\n\n 5. Dark Fiber\n\n 35. Dark fiber is a physical connection with no transmission functionality. As the Commission explained in the \nFurther Notice, \u201cthe supply of BDS over dark fiber takes on significant aspects of facility-based competition\u201d and \u201cis \nparticularly attractive for competitive LECs seeking to expand their network reach and mobile carriers needing cell \nsite backhaul.\u201d97 Also, the record indicates that mobile wireless service providers are purchasing and then self-\nequipping dark fiber as a substitute for a fiber-based Ethernet service.98 Accordingly, we find dark fiber is a \nsubstitute for special access services (Continued from previous page)\n\n\n\n 12501, at 12516-17 para. 30 (XO Verizon Order) (\u201cThe record confirms that the copper UNEs and other inputs, \nincluding collocation and off-the shelf electronics, used by XO to provide EoC service are readily available to other \nproviders today and would continue to be available to other competitors in the future.\u201d).\n\n 91 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(3); 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319.\n\n 92 See U.S. Telecom v.

Answers varied, but these sorts of distances \nappeared consistently in the narrative responses.\u201d).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 21\n\n 41.The nature of the customer\u2019s demand is particularly relevant to competitors\u2019 builddecisions. As the Commission \nrecognized recently when considering the likelihood of a competitor entering a building to provide business data \nservices, \u201c[t]he lower the demand in the building, the closer another competitive fiber provider must be to that \nbuilding for entry to be profitable and thus likely.\u201d121 Nevertheless, even when demand is too low to justify the \nbuildout, competitive providers often consider whether there are any potential customers nearby and may even take \na more circuitous route in anticipation of additional demand from businesses along the route.122 The 2015 \nCollection indicates that in many areas of the country competitive facilities are sufficiently close to make deployment \nto buildings with low demand justifiable. In 2013, there was at least one competitive provider in \u201cmore than 95 \npercent of MSA census blocks with BDS demand, and . . . those census blocks represented about 97 percent of the \ntotal BDS connections and 99 percent of business establishments.\u201d123 The average distance between buildings \nwith incumbent LEC business data services customers and competitive fiber was just 364 feet.124 About half of \nthese buildings were within 88 feet of competitive fiber facilities and 75 percent were within 456 feet.125\n\n 42.We tested the sensitivity of our finding that a location currently faces or likely will facecompetitive choices over \nthe medium term if it is within a half mile of a location served over the facilities of at least one competitive provider. \nFor example, based on the 2015 Collection, 64.1 percent of all locations with business data services demand in \nprice cap areas were within a quarter mile of at least one competitive provider, as compared to 79.5 percent that \nwere within a half mile, and 89.4 percent that were within a mile.126 Thus, our approach lies somewhat above the \nmiddle of these two extremes, each of which had limited record support. We also found 45.8 percent of locations \nwith business data services demand to be within a half mile of at least two competitive providers, and 64.6 percent \nof all locations with business data services demand to be within a mile of at least two competitive providers. In \naddition, as discussed, cable competition is considerably more developed than it was in 2013. Given the nature of \ncable networks, we expect the percent of locations within range of a quarter mile of at least one facilities-based \ncompetitor, to be more similar to the percent of locations within a half mile of one such competitor today.\n\n\n\n 43.As we detail more fully below, there is strong evidence of rapid growth in competitiveinvestment. Because of \nthis ongoing investment, the average building with business data services demand over time will find itself closer \nand closer to a competing facilities-based competitor\u2019s network. The declining distances between buildings with \nbusiness data services demand and the fiber networks of competitive providers in general, and those of cable \nproviders with near ubiquitous fiber in particular, create a cycle of investment and benefits within an area outside of \nany particular building. Because even small businesses\u2019 bandwidth needs are constantly growing, the effect of this \nvirtuous cycle of investment\n\n 121 XO Verizon Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 12512, para. 22.\n\n 122 Kuzmanovski Decl. at paras. 20, 26; Narrative Responses to Data Collection Questions II.A.8 of Bay Springs \nCommunications Inc.

As costs continue to drop through further fiber deployments, \nand potential revenues for each building served increase with growing demand for high bandwidth services, these \ncompetitive providers with significant legacy (in the case of cable) and newer networks have powerful economic \nincentives to enter and price their services aggressively. This effect will provide a strong disciplining force to the \nincumbent service providers of surrounding locations, and will grow over time. Importantly, all else equal, we \nexpect competitors will be particularly likely to build out to locations where incumbents have priced \nsupracompetitively, to the extent these are the most profitable locations. In this manner, over time, abuses of \nmarket power can be addressed through localized competitive pressures.\n\n 44.The record demonstrates that most business data services providers are willing and ableto profitably invest and \ndeploy facilities within a half mile of existing competitive facilities, and often have the ability to build out after winning \na customer\u2019s bid for business, depending upon the scale of investment required to reach the customer.128 \nAccordingly, we conclude that the relevant geographic market for purposes of this market analysis is the region \nwithin a half mile of a location with business data services demand. We make this determination by focusing on the \nfactors that influence suppliers of business data services, as opposed to customers, because in most instances a \ncustomer is unlikely to impact service pricing by moving its physical location in response to a material increase in \nprice.129 This point is true for both single- and multi-location customers that seek dedicated connections to each \nlocation.\n\n\n\n 45.We also find that business data services providers commonly sell their service in biddingmarkets, and this is \nespecially so for multi-site contracts. Winning bidders then build out to the customer within an agreed-upon \nprovisioning timeframe.130 Consequently, competitors outside of the customer\u2019s location can affect pricing because \nthe winning bid represents the competitive offer that others must beat, even if that competitor does not already have \nfacilities in the customer\u2019s building. That competitor is increasingly relevant the closer the competitor\u2019s network \nfacilities, actual or potential fiber splice points, are to the customer (because its costs likely fall with proximity, \nmaking its bid more likely to constrain the winning bid).131 Thus, the geographic range of the competition posed by \na business data services provider is not limited to the specific locations of active circuits sold at a particular point in \ntime.\n\n D.

We then conclude that, while there can be high \nbarriers to business data services entry, evidence shows that firms frequently choose to enter this market with \nsignificant investments, particularly in areas of significant demand, indicating sufficient competitive conditions that \ndo not warrant direct regulatory intervention.\n\n 47.Current Prices at Cap. In the Further Notice, the Commission suggested that \u201cthe factthat the price capped \nincumbent LECs have kept their prices at the top of the cap is additional evidence of market power.\u201d132 \nCommenters were at odds over whether the lack of or minimal headroom between prices and the caps indicated \nthe possession of market power.133 However, we disagree that prices at the cap demonstrate that incumbent LECs \ngenerally would have set materially higher prices wherever their prices were capped. Given our finding of \n\n\n\ncompetition in the business data services DS1, DS3, and transport markets we also find these concerns \nunwarranted. We expect these competitive markets to function so as to continue to keep prices in check.\n\n 1.Barriers to Entry\n\n 48.Market analysis is incomplete without an evaluation of entry barriers. As antitrustprinciples explain, \u201c[t]he \nprospect of entry into the relevant market will alleviate concerns about adverse competitive effects only if such entry \nwill deter or counteract any competitive effects of concern.\u201d134 In evaluating the prospect of entry, agencies \n\u201cexamine the timeliness, likelihood, and sufficiency of the entry efforts an entrant might practically employ.\u201d135\n\n 49.Timeliness. Entry must be rapid enough to make an attempt by an incumbent to set aprice above competitive \nlevels unprofitable.136 Depending on the distance, buildout does not appear to take very long, about three to four \nmonths,137 relative to the typical multi-year contracts used in selling these services. Thus, in cases where demand \nis prospective and not urgent, and where a competitive LEC has existing facilities nearby, for example, within a half \nmile, buildout or even its threat would be timely enough to restrain a dominant provider in the relevant market. \nInstances in which business data services are sold as part of a bidding or similar process also allow for timely \nentry, as providers are typically afforded an opportunity to provision a customer after a bid is accepted and before \nservice must begin. Moreover, even if a competitor with a nearby wireline network (for example, perhaps a cable \ncompany) is not presently capable of entry over the short term, we expect it will become so over the medium term.\n\n 50.Likelihood. \u201cEntry is likely if it would be profitable,\u201d138 and profitability is preciselywhat competitive LECs \nconsider when deciding whether to deploy fiber to a customer\u2019s location.139\n\n 132 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4830-31, para. 239.\n\n 133 See Level 3 Reply at 25 (\u201cIncumbent LECs\u2019 lack of headroom under the Commission\u2019s price caps provides \nfurther evidence of market power because it demonstrates that incumbent LECs charge prices at the highest level \npermitted by regulation.\u201d); Sprint Reply at 42-43; Windstream Comments at 61.

We found earlier that the presence of a second competitor in this industry issufficient to place an \neffective competitive constraint on business data services supply. Given the likelihood of entry wherever a \ncompetitive wireline network is nearby, this will also ensure a similar effect over the medium term.\n\n 53.This evidence demonstrates that providers find ways to enter nearby geographic marketsand win customers. \nThey consider nearby demand and build circuitous routes, they lengthen the terms of their contracts to recover the \ncost of buildout, and they place spare splice points along their network routes to accommodate future demand. \nThese facts show that once providers have sunk substantial costs into a network, it is in their interest to build \nlaterals to as many customers as possible because the relative cost of a lateral is much lower than the cost of other \nnetwork facilities. And this conclusion is corroborated by evidence of extensive competitive entry into the business \ndata services marketplace.\n\n 2.Entry and Investment in Business Data Services Markets\n\n 54.Evidence of Competitive Entry by Cable.

Cable companies now offer over fiber carrier-grade reliability, scalability, and quality of service \nfunctionality to compete for the largest enterprise customers across the country and also offer Carrier Ethernet \nservices with symmetrical speeds up to 10 Mbps over their within-footprint near ubiquitous DOCSIS 3.0 EoHFC \nnetworks. As a result, incumbent LECs increasingly find themselves competing with cable for business data \nservices customers. CenturyLink, for example, \u201cviews cable providers to be its primary special access competitors, \ngiven their expansive networks and rapid growth in business markets.\u201d145\n\n 55. The growth in consumer broadband demand has also lowered the costs to cable companies of deploying fiber \nto business locations. As consumer bandwidth demand grew exponentially over the past decade, cable providers \nwere required to invest billions of dollars pushing fiber deeper into their networks as they needed to continually split \nnodes to keep pace with the demand.146 Compared to just ten years ago, fiber within the franchise areas of cable \nproviders that offer high-speed DOCSIS services has dramatically lowered the cost of building out fiber to the \nsurrounding business locations due to the shorter distances required to reach any location.147 For example, as a \nresult of network expansion, in March of 2015, \u201capproximately [BEGIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] [END HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL] percent of business locations [were] within 500 feet of Comcast\u2019s EoHFC facilities, an increase \nfrom [BEGIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] [END HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] percent in 2013.148\n\n 56. Like other competing providers, cable companies have focused investment on building fiber networks for \nhigher-bandwidth Ethernet services, which is enabling them to overcome limitations of traditional coaxial-based \ncable systems that cannot meet higher bandwidth demands.149 For example, after first entering the marketplace in \n2009, Comcast \u201crolled out Metro Ethernet services to 20 of the top 25 metropolitan areas entirely over fiber, with \nplans ranging from 1 Mbps to 10 Gbps in 2011.\u201d150 Comcast has invested \u201cmore than $5 billion since 2010\u201d on \nnetwork infrastructure to provide business data services.151 Comcast had connections, largely using fiber, to \napproximately [BEGIN HIGHLY\n\n 145 CenturyLink Brown/Williams Declaration at para. 7.\n\n 146 See Comcast Mar. 13, 2017 Ex Parte Letter (describing how fiber nodes installed to supply best-efforts \nbroadband can be used to supply business data services); K.

Industry Concentration. In the Further Notice, the Commission considered several measures of concentration in \nvarying geographies, indicating \u201cuniformly high levels of concentration.\u201d183 On a national level, concentration \namong incumbent LECs was observed, based on 2013 reported business data services revenues.184 Degrees of \nincumbent LEC concentration also were observed at geographies of unique building locations, census blocks, and \nzip codes.185 The measures were difficult to determine precisely by geography due to certain biases.186 Putting \nthe concentration measures in context, the Commission explained that it \u201cd[id] not yet know how much competitive \npressure different forms of supply place on other suppliers, or how many suppliers, accounting for their differences, \nare sufficient to make prices effectively competitive (matters we have sought comment on above).\u201d187 We find the \nconcentration measures alone are largely poor indicators of whether market conditions exist that will constrain \nbusiness data services prices, and overstate the competitive effects of concentration.188\n\n 65. Traditional and non-traditional providers of business data services constrain an incumbent\u2019s pricing outside of \nimmediate geographies used to describe market concentration in the Further Notice in three ways. First, with \nnearby facilities, a business data services provider is able to expand its presence to timely reach a customer.189 \nSecond, a business data services competitor does not need to be already offering service in a given building to \nconstrain a supplier at that location. A nearby business data services competitor constrains pricing by responding \nto RFPs and participating in similar customer service bidding requests, which creates a pricing floor without any \nphysical presence of the potential competitor in the nearby geography.190 Third, concentration is greater for the \ndeclining legacy DS1 and DS3 channel termination services, in which incumbent LECs have a historical \nadvantage, compared to newer, and in-demand, Ethernet business data services, which are largely \ncompetitive.191 We\n\n 183 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4816, para. 216.\n\n 184 Id. at 4818-19, paras. 216-17; see Sprint Comments at 42 (explaining National Regulatory Research Institute \n\u201cexamined both market share and market concentration and concluded that \u2018ILECs maintain strongly dominant \nmarket shares for DS-1 channel terminations\u2019\u201d); Zarakas and Gately at 9-17 (\u201cMarket Share and Market \nConcentration Analysis and Results\u201d).\n\nhttp://www.fiercetelecom.com/\nhttp://www.lightower.com/\nhttp://www.lightower.com/\n\n\n 185 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4820-22, paras. 219-23.

Other Examples of Competitive Effects in the Business Data Services Market\n\n 66. Increasing Ethernet Revenue. Comments show that, as a result of more substitutes in the market, incumbent \nLECs face declining sales in TDM services, notably DS1s and DS3s, including customer loss to cable operators \nand other providers. A recent report by Frost and Sullivan found that the migration from TDM to Ethernet business \ndata services is fueling double-digit revenue growth for Ethernet business data services, and that this growth rate \nis expected to increase as Ethernet networks expand.192 In particular, Ethernet-based services accounted for \nmore than 40 percent of total dedicated service revenues in 2013, and Ethernet business data services revenues \nhave been growing by over 20 percent a year since then.193 The Ethernet bandwidth of ILECs grew by only 5.3 \npercent in 2013, while the bandwidth of competitive providers grew by 31.6 percent.194 Incumbent LEC business \ndata services revenues also declined from 2013 to 2015, while competitive LEC and cable competitor revenue \ngrew rapidly.195 Level 3 revenues increased 66 percent, Comcast revenues grew by 46 percent, and Time Warner \n\n\n\ncable revenues increased by 73 percent over the same time period.196 For cable overall, business revenues have \ngrown at a 20 percent compound annual growth rate.197 Notably, this revenue growth came in spite of falling \nprices, which likely indicates expansion of market output and/or demand shifts to higher bandwidth and thus more \ncompetitive services. Vertical Systems Group found that Carrier Ethernet pricing fell by double-digit rates for all \nservices and speed segments from 2010 to 2015.198\n\n 67. Some of the growth in cable\u2019s competitive position has come at the expense of incumbent and competitive \nLECs.

Furthermore, as recognized by Dr. Rysman, and noted by peer reviewers and other commenters in the record, \ndata and modeling limitations did not allow for a definitive conclusion that incumbent LECs were not pricing \ncompetitively.221 Despite Dr. Rysman\u2019s detailed analysis, a causal relationship could not be ascribed to his \nestimates due to the possibility that some factor not observed in the data (e.g., lower costs of serving a given \ncustomer) could be simultaneously producing both a greater number of facilities-based competitors and lower \nprices.222 Further, while some (disputed) evidence was presented of incumbent LEC prices being lower where \nthere was competition, other evidence was presented of dramatic increases in competitive entry, rapid price \ndeclines, and service growth.223 Moreover, analysts and forecasters expect strong competitive growth over the \nnext decade in business data services, and we find that, all else equal, competitive growth will occur exactly where \nsupracompetitive pricing is most prevalent.224\n\nhttp://investors.zayo.com/\n\n 74.

Given \nour finding of competition in the business data services DS1, DS3, and transport markets we also find these \nconcerns unwarranted. We expect these competitive markets to function so as to continue to keep prices in check.\n\n\n G. Competition in the Transport Market\n\n 75. Transport services are typically higher volume services between points of traffic aggregation which can more \neasily justify competitive investment and deployment. The Commission has traditionally regulated TDM-based \nspecial access services in two distinct segments: end user channel terminations and dedicated transport; and \nother special access services.227 The provision and sale of TDM-based special access services has reflected, \nand continues to reflect, the different competitive dynamics that characterize the two sets of services. When the \nCommission adopted the Pricing Flexibility Order, it distinguished between these two sets of TDM special access \nservices and required price cap LECs to make different levels of competitive showings to obtain pricing flexibility \nfor each.228 The Commission\u2019s pricing flexibility rules also reflect this distinction. Section 69.709 of the \nCommission\u2019s rules governs the grant of pricing flexibility for special access services other than the channel \ntermination between the LEC end offices and customer premises, which includes interoffice facilities and channel \nterminations between an incumbent LEC\u2019s serving wire center and an IXC.229 Section 69.711 of the Commission\u2019s \nrules govern the grant of pricing flexibility for channel terminations between LEC end offices and customer \npremises.230 All of these elements comprise the service provided to the end user. The Further Notice followed the \nCommission\u2019s precedent by defining dedicated service as a service that \u201ctransports data between two or more \ndesignated points\u201d231 and aspired to create a \u201cframework [that] reflect[s] how the market operates today.\u201d232\n\n 76. Commenters, including competitive providers, support maintaining this distinction.233 Dr. Rysman also \nacknowledged the relevance of this distinction in his paper.234 This distinction is rooted\n\n 225 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4830-31, para. 239.\n\n 226 See Level 3 Reply at 25 (\u201cIncumbent LECs\u2019 lack of headroom under the Commission\u2019s price caps provides \nfurther evidence of market power because it demonstrates that incumbent LECs charge prices at the highest level \npermitted by regulation.\u201d); Sprint Reply at 42-43; Windstream Comments at 61.

In analyzing the competitiveness of TDM transport services,236 based upon the 2015 Collection and the \nrecord, we find strong evidence of substantial competition, as well as market conditions that suggest regulation of \nTDM transport and other non-end user channel termination services is not justified.237 Indeed competition for such \nservices has been robust since a large proportion of TDM transport services were deregulated. As Frontier \nexplains, a \u201csubstantial majority of transport revenue has been covered by Phase II pricing flexibility since the early \n2000s.\u201d238 AT&T further states that \u201cthe data collection strongly supports nationwide Phase II relief for \ntransport.\u201d239 It cites data showing the widespread deployment of competitive transport networks, including the fact \nthat \u201cas of 2013, competitive providers have deployed competing transport networks in more than 95% of census \nblocks with special access demand (and about 99% of business establishments are in these MSAs).\u201d240 Although \nINCOMPAS asserts that Commission rules requiring certain incumbent LECs to provide unbundled transport \nservices is evidence of underlying market power, the record overall reflects a competitive landscape where \ncustomers often combine competitive transport with channel terminations supplied by incumbents.241 According to \nCenturyLink, it uses non-incumbent LEC transport facilities for \u201cless than half\u201d of the end user channel terminations \nit purchases as a competitive provider outside of its incumbent footprint.242 Moreover, data from the 2015 \nCollection show that \u201cthe vast majority of locations with special access demand have competitive fiber\u201d within close \nproximity.243 AT&T identified a number of (Continued from previous page)\n\n 234 Rysman Paper at 204 (\u201cPhysically, a service is made up of several elements, such as the connection to the \nedge of the provider\u2019s network (sometimes referred to as the \u2018last mile\u2019) and the transport from this edge to the \nInternet backbone or to another location owned by the customer.\u201d); id. at 233 (\u201c[T]he cost structure behind providing \ntransport is likely to be substantially different from providing service to end-user premises. . . .\u201d).\n\n 235 Pricing Flexibility Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 14227, para. 10.\n\n 236 The term \u201ctransport\u201d or \u201cother transport services\u201d as used hereinafter collectively refers to interoffice facilities \nand channel terminations between an ILEC\u2019s serving wire center and an IXC, services covered by section \n69.709(a)(4) of the Commission\u2019s rules.

Competitive providers are split on the question of whether the transport market is competitive. XO, before \nbecoming part of Verizon, found \u201cconsiderable competition for transport\u201d and that \u201cnumerous CLECs frequently are \ncollocated in the offices where XO is located.\u201d246 Other competitive providers dispute the competitive nature of \ntransport services and assert that incumbent LECs are able to charge supracompetitive rates for TDM transport \nservices and should therefore be price regulated.247 For example, Sprint alleges that \u201calong many routes, \ncompetitive providers are simply unavailable\u201d and asserts that competition for transport service is the exception \nrather than the rule.248 However, Sprint provides no data or anecdotal evidence to support its assertion and to \nrebut the evidence from the 2015 Collection and from incumbent LEC commenters that show that competitive \ntransport is available in the vast majority of census blocks in MSAs. As AT&T states, \u201c[n]o party to this proceeding \nhas attempted specifically to make a case that there is a lack of competition for transport, and certainly not on a \nnational basis.\u201d249\n\n 79. Evidence of competitive providers investing in transport services, rather than purchasing from incumbent \ncarriers, reinforces our observations.250 While business data services providers may choose to purchase transport \n\u2013 either as a long-term solution to reach a customer or a temporary cost while implementing self-provisioning plans \n\u2013 many have deployed transport instead of buying the service.\n\n 80. More broadly, we understand that transport service represents the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of the business data \nservices circuit, which makes it particularly attractive to new entrants.251 In the Pricing Flexibility Order, the \nCommission noted that competitors often enter the transport market before the channel termination market,252 and \nwe continue to adhere to that view.

Conclusions\n\n 81. Packet-based Services. Packet-based services represent the future of business data services. We believe \nthe higher bandwidth capabilities of these services will lead to greater returns on investment and in turn, greater \nincentives for facilities-based entry into the business data services market. In contrast, DS1s and DS3s are legacy \nservices that now compete against packet-based broadband services such as EoHFC services in the same \ngeographic market. We find this competition, or potential competition between legacy and packet-based services, \nsufficient enough to discipline pricing. In many instances, incumbent LECs are now on similar footing to entrants \n(even if they may still on average be advantaged), as they often also deploy new facilities to meet customer \ndemand (because even a relatively low demand customer today may not be a low demand customer tomorrow, and \n\nhttp://www.fiercetelecom.com/\n\n\ncopper loop generally is incapable of meeting higher demands). As a result, we find the marketplace for packet-\nbased business data services is competitive.\n\n 82. TDM-based DS1s and DS3s. Within the broader record, we acknowledge that, by the nature of legacy \nservices, incumbent LECs have a degree of concentration in certain geographies for DS1 and DS3 services. We \nalso recognize a changing industry with increasingly competitive options, particularly at higher bandwidths, and a \ndecreasing demand for these legacy services. Our analysis suggests that any prior advantage an incumbent might \nhave enjoyed at lower bandwidths is now less competitively relevant in light of customer demand that attracts a \nnumber of traditional and non-traditional competitors that are improving legacy cable networks and expanding with \nnew facilities to meet demand.254 This is further supported by the degree of sunk investment made by traditional \nand non-traditional providers of business data services to compete.255 We conclude that incumbent LEC market \npower has been in many cases largely eliminated, and elsewhere is declining thanks to increased competition in \nbusiness data services markets.256\n\n 83.

We intend to apply ex ante rate regulation only where competition is expected to materially fail to ensure just \nand reasonable rates. As a matter of policy we prefer reliance on competition rather than regulation, wherever \npurchasers can realistically turn to a supplier beyond the incumbent LEC. Based on these principles and our market \n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/\n\n\nanalysis, we find regulation is unnecessary for packet-based services.

We also conclude that we should refrain from ex \nante pricing regulation for TDM end-user channel terminations in areas deemed competitive. We then outline a \nbright-line competitive market test for initially determining whether a given price cap area will be treated as \ncompetitive in the provision of DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations by the incumbent LEC. This test will \ntreat as competitive a particular county if 50 percent of the locations with BDS demand in that county are within a \nhalf mile of a location served by a competitive provider based on the 2015 Collection or 75 percent of the census \nblocks in that county have a cable provider present based on the Commission\u2019s Form 477 data. Any price cap \nincumbent LEC serving special access customers within that county will be relieved of ex ante pricing regulation. \nFurthermore, we adopt a process for regularly updating the list of competitive counties in a way that accounts for \nchanging competitive conditions but also avoids the need to undergo burdensome data collections.\n\n A. Regulatory Framework Applicable to Packet-Based Business Data Services and to TDM-Based Services \nProviding Bandwidths in Excess of a DS3\n\n 85. After reviewing the record and considering the Commission\u2019s goals to ensure that rates for business data \nservices are just and reasonable, while also encouraging facilities-based competition and facilitating technology \ntransitions, we decline to re-impose any form of price cap or benchmark regulation on packet-based business data \nservices or on TDM-based services providing bandwidths in excess of the level of a DS3, and we eliminate that \nregulation to the extent it exists today.257 Our market analysis does not show compelling evidence of market power \nin incumbent LEC provision of these services, particularly for higher bandwidth services. Moreover, even if the \nrecord demonstrated insufficiently robust competition, proposals to apply price cap regulation to packet-based \nservices were complex and not easily administrable258 and did not reflect the fact that costs to serve individual \ncustomers vary.259 Likewise, we decline to impose benchmark pricing regulation on incumbent LEC packet-based \nbusiness data services or on TDM-based services of bandwidths in excess of the level of a DS3. Because our \nmarket analysis shows that such services are subject to competition, anchor or benchmark pricing is unnecessary \nand could in fact inhibit investment in this dynamic market by preventing providers from being able to obtain \nadequate returns on capital. Additionally, the benchmark pricing proposals in the record were administratively \ncomplex and unlikely to reliably result in just and reasonable rates.\n\n 86. We further find that packet-based services are best not subjected to tariffing and price cap regulation, even in \nthe absence of a nearby competitor. Packet-based services represent the future of business data services and are \nreadily scalable, so competitive LECs are generally very willing to deploy\n\n 257 We note that these include optical capacity services.\n\n 258 See, e.g., Letter from Thomas Jones, Counsel for Level 3 Communications, LLC, to Marlene H. Dortch, \nSecretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 05-25 et al., at 8 (Jul. 25, 2016) (Level 3 July 25, 2016 Ex Parte).\n\n 259 Letter from Steven F. Morris, Vice President and Associate General Counsel, NCTA, to Marlene H. Dortch, \nSecretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 05-25 et al., at 7 (filed Sept. 27, 2016) (NCTA Sept. 27, 2016 Ex Parte).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 39\n\n\n\n such services beyond their footprints because they can expect to earn increasing revenues from their initial \ninvestment with few additional costs. In contrast, the record shows that competitive LECs are generally unwilling to \nextend their legacy TDM networks, especially beyond a half mile to provide DSn services.260 Consequently, \nentrants are better placed to win customers in packet-based markets than in those for TDM services. Packet-based \nservices are new services, experiencing both rapid growth, and rapid change in standards, throughput and usage, \nand so regulation is more likely to impose long-term costs by dissuading providers of packet-based services from \nentering.\n\n 87.We do, however, remind stakeholders that packet-based telecommunications servicesremain subject to the \nCommission\u2019s regulatory authority under sections 201, 202, and 208 of the Act.261 These statutory provisions allow \nthe Commission to determine whether rates, terms, and conditions are just, reasonable, and not unreasonably \ndiscriminatory in the context of a section 208 complaint proceeding.262\n\n B. Regulatory Framework Applicable to TDM Transport Services\n\n 88.We eliminate all ex ante pricing regulation of price cap incumbent LEC provision ofTDM transport and other \ntransport (i.e., non-end user channel termination) special access services.263 The 2015 Collection and the record \ndemonstrate widespread competition in the market for these services and generally support using a deregulatory \napproach for TDM transport and other non-end user channel termination services.\n\n 89.We conclude that competition for TDM transport services is sufficiently pervasive at thelocal level to justify \nrelief from pricing regulation nationwide. Commission staff analysis of competitive provider responses to question \nII.A.5. of the 2015 Collection shows that in all price cap territories, 92.1 percent of buildings served were within a \nhalf mile of competitive fiber transport facilities. Additionally, for all census blocks with business data services \ndemand, 89.6 percent have at least one served building within a half mile of competitive LEC fiber. As we \nconcluded in the foregoing market analysis, the presence or reasonable proximity of a single competitor\u2019s facilities \nrepresents competition given the high sunk cost nature of the business data services market. Our data are \nconservative given the fact that the 2015 Collection includes only a subset of all hybrid fiber coax facilities deployed \nby cable providers (i.e., only Metro-Ethernet headend-connected fiber feeder plant) and given that the 2015 \nCollection data are from 2013 and therefore necessarily understate the level of actual competition for transport \nservices by not including competitive facilities that have since been deployed.264 We find that the high percentage \nof locations within a half mile of competitive fiber and the high percentage of census blocks with at least one \nbuilding within a half mile of competitive fiber justify our refraining from applying pricing regulation\n\n 260 See Birch et al. Comments at 21-25 (explaining that Level 3 \u201ccannot economically deploy new connections at \ncapacities of 100 Mbps or less to most locations\u201d); TDS Comments at 11; Windstream Comments at 18-19.\n\n 261 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202, 208.\n\n 262 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 208.\n\n 263 The term \u201ctransport\u201d or \u201cother transport services\u201d as used hereinafter collectively refers to interoffice facilities \nand channel terminations between an incumbent LEC\u2019s serving wire center and an IXC, services covered by \nsection 69.709(a)(4) of the Commission\u2019s rules. It excludes the elements of that rule that cover switched access \nservices, such as entrance facilities, dedicated transport facilities between the serving wire center and the tandem \nswitching office, and direct-trunked transport. 47 CFR \u00a7 69.709(a)(4). We use terms \u201ctransport\u201d and \u201cmileage\u201d \ninterchangeably, as do commenters. See, e.g., Birch et al. Jan. 27, 2016 Comments, Decl. of Jonathan B. Baker at \n\n\n\npara. 14 (\u201cLocal transport facilities [are] . . . also termed dedicated transport, inter-office transport, or channel \nmileage . . . .\u201d).\n\n 264 See, e.g., ACA Comments at 7-8; FTTH Comments at 12-17; NCTA Comments at 6-8; Zayo Comments at 2; \nCharter Reply at 2-3.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 40\n\n across all price cap areas to TDM transport services.\n\n 90. We recognize that our decision in all likelihood will leave a relatively small percentage of census blocks (with an \neven smaller percentage of overall demand) price deregulated and without the immediate prospect of competitive \ntransport options. However, greater harm\u2014primarily manifested in the discouragement of competitive entry over \ntime\u2014would result if we were to attempt to regulate these cases than is expected under our deregulatory approach. \nIn contrast, lower entry barriers for deploying transport services than for end user channel termination services \nand increasing demand for transport means that regulatory relief will provide incentives for competitive providers to \ndeploy additional transport facilities to compete for this demand. While competition may not be universal, it is \nsufficiently widespread for us to have confidence that a combination of these factors will broadly protect against the \nrisk of supracompetitive rates being charged by price cap LECs over the short- to medium-term. To the extent there \nare points of aggregation that are not served by competitors, the relatively high demand at these points makes it \nlikely that a competitor could justify investing in competitive transport facilities to serve that demand.\n\n 91. Moreover, our goal is not absolute mathematical precision but an administratively feasible approach that avoids \nimposing undue regulatory burdens on this highly competitive segment of the market. Refraining from pricing \nregulation for transport services nationally achieves the proper balance between precision and administrability. It \nalso avoids unnecessary disruption of existing special access transport sales arrangements. The alternative would \nbe to impose significant regulatory burdens on all participants in the market with an additional layer of regulatory \ncomplexity that would undermine predictability and ultimately hinder investment, including in entry, and growth. \nInstead, we believe that providing regulatory relief in this market segment will foster conditions that will continue to \nencourage competitive entry and provide incentive for further investment in fiber transport facilities. Finally, our \nsection 208 complaint process represents a continuing safeguard against unjust and unreasonable rates.\n\n C. Competitive Market Test Criteria for DS1 and DS3 End User Channel Terminations\n\n 92. The competitive market test we adopt today assesses the availability of actual and likely competitive options in \nthe provision of last mile services and subjects to ex ante pricing regulation only circuit-based DS1 and DS3 end \nuser channel terminations provided by price cap incumbent LECs in areas the test finds lack a competitive \npresence. We base the competitive market test on the geographic unit of a county or county-equivalent265 \n(hereinafter, county) which significantly reduces the over- and under-inclusivity issue posed by MSAs which the \nCommission highlighted in the Suspension Order and avoids the administrability issues posed by smaller \ngeographic units of measure.266 The test uses data demonstrating the presence of competitive facilities from the \n2015 Collection in combination with the most recent data on cable deployment from the Form 477 data collection to \ndetermine which counties to regulate.\n\n 93. While there is no clear consensus in the record on the right approach to the competitive market test, we do see \na few points of general agreement. The various proposals use bandwidth\n\n\n\n 265 County-equivalents include parishes, boroughs, independent cities, census areas and the District of \nColumbia. U.S. Census Bureau, About Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas,            \n 266 There are 3,233 counties in the United States as opposed to 389 MSAs. See            \n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 41\n\n demarcation points and competition test criteria based on counting providers in or near a geographic area using \nthe 2015 Collection data. Beyond those few high-level points of agreement, there are vast differences of opinion \namong commenters on the current state of competition in the marketplace, on the need for a competitive market \ntest, and on what a competitive market test should entail. Generally, competitive LECs needing to purchase \nbusiness data services as inputs at wholesale, mobile wireless providers not affiliated with an incumbent LEC, \nWindstream and Verizon (both net buyers), and end-user representatives, such as the Ad Hoc, interpret the 2015 \nCollection as largely showing a non-competitive market, requiring regulatory intervention at all but the highest \nservice bandwidth levels, i.e., in excess of 1 Gbps.267 On the other side, cable companies and competitive fiber \nproviders that do not typically purchase business data services at wholesale, AT&T, and other incumbent LECs \n(net sellers) see a highly competitive marketplace with no need of regulatory intervention.268\n\n 94.The test we adopt utilizes certain core attributes of a test on which there was consensus inthe record, including \nestablishing a threshold number of providers to find competition, employing a defined geographic area of \nmeasurement, and basing the test on data from the 2015 Collection and updating the results of the test to ensure \nthey continue to reflect the extent of competition in the market. That said, it also represents a departure from some \nof the proposals in the Further Notice in that rather than focus on burdensome pricing regulation, it takes a dynamic \nand forward-looking approach to evaluating the benefits and costs of regulation.269 The test will be updated \nperiodically by relying on data the Commission routinely collects, so it does not require additional and potentially \nburdensome data collections. We find this approach strikes a reasonable balance between precision and \nadministrability, will encourage continued investment in and deployment of business data services, and will foster a \nmarket-driven transition from legacy circuit-based services to newer packet-based services and other \ntechnologies.\n\n 95.We take a pragmatic approach to formulating a competitive market test by consideringwhat data are available to \nus to evaluate competitive conditions both at present and in the future. We then determine what geographic unit is \nsufficiently granular and at the same time administrable for the Commission as well as the industry. Finally, we \nconsider which criteria best reflect competitive conditions in the market while still furthering the Commission\u2019s policy \nobjectives. The ultimate goal of the test, however, is not to definitively determine competitive market conditions but \nrather to determine on balance which areas are best positioned to benefit from price deregulation and which areas \nwill benefit more from continued price cap regulation.\n\n\n 96.In determining where we can appropriately avoid applying ex ante price regulations forcertain special access \nservices, we balance the benefits and costs of such regulation. We recognize that in counties where there currently \nappears to be few competitive alternatives for consumers of DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations that the \nbenefits of ex ante price regulation likely outweigh the costs since this likely indicates broad entry in such regions \nmay not occur. However, in counties where the competitive pressures are able to discipline prices for a large \nfraction of customers, as discussed in our market analysis, we see the opposite to likely be the case. Ex ante \npricing regulation can have negative\n\n 267 Other comment groups generally aligned with this position are public interest groups, mobile wireless providers \nthat are not affiliated with an incumbent LEC, and one commenter, Ad Hoc, representing the interests of business \npurchasers.\n\n 268 See AT&T Oct. 25, 2016 Letter at 1-2; Letter from Russell P. Hanser & Brian W. Murray, Counsel to \nCenturyLink, to Marelene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 16-143 et al., at 4-8 (filed Oct. 28, 2016) \n(CenturyLink Oct. 28, 2016 Letter).\n\n 269 In particular, the competitive market test does not focus on some proposed criteria, namely, customer classes, \nbusiness density and bandwidth capacity because they are largely unnecessary to achieve our policy goals and, \nimportantly, because including them in a competitive market test would make it administratively unwieldy.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 42\n\n features. For example, in a county where entry is relatively widespread, the absence of entry in specific areas may \nbe due to regulated prices inadvertently being set below competitive levels. Such prices make entry unprofitable, \nare harmful to long run incentives to invest, can lead to inefficient short run levels of production and consumption, \nand can prevent entry indefinitely. This counsels toward being especially wary of imposing price caps except where \ncompetitive service seems most unlikely to be available within a reasonable time horizon. This perspective of \nbalancing the benefits and costs of regulating prices, as well as the importance of having an administrable system, \nleads us to adopt the framework discussed below.270 In our judgment, we expect this framework to appropriately \nbalance our desire for fostering a dynamic and competitive marketplace with the need to ensure rates that are just \nand reasonable.\n\n 1.Availability of Data to Measure Competition\n\n 97.2015 Collection. The most intuitively relevant dataset in our toolbox is the one collectedin response to the Data \nCollection Order.271 That data collection covered circuit- and packet-based business data services and required \nresponses from providers of both dedicated and best-efforts last-mile access services (albeit exempting small \nproviders of best-efforts services), as well as purchasers of business data services.272 In short, the data \ncollection came as close as practicable at the time to providing a \u201cclear picture of all competition in the \nmarketplace.\u201d273 Despite this, some commenters question the continued relevance of the data, citing cable \nproviders\u2019 aggressive expansion into business data services since the data collection.274 These criticisms \noverstate the limitations of the 2015 Collection. It is unprecedented in scope and remains a useful and appropriate \nbasis for our new regulatory framework. That said, we acknowledge that while the 2015 Collection is well suited for \nthe initial evaluation of competition, it is unsuitable for measuring competition going forward. We also acknowledge \nthat the 2015 Collection does not fully capture the extent of cable deployment to date.\n\n 98.Although some commenters propose refreshing the data with periodic data collections,most commenters \nstrongly oppose the idea as being too burdensome and even \u201can obstacle to competition.\u201d275 To comply with the \n\n\n\n2015 Collection, for example, some carriers were \u201cforced to pull data manually from numerous billing and data \nsystems, diverting limited time and resources from other critical projects.\u201d276 For an uncertain number of years, \nproviders would be required \u201cto continuously track and maintain . . . all company documents that may be responsive \n. . . requiring business employees and counsel to devote significant resources to conduct broad searches for such \ndocuments and evaluate their responsiveness.\u201d277 We believe the costs of further data collections would not justify \nthe benefits obtained from having updated data. Below we find that an alternative dataset can be used to update \nour\n\n 270 For a discussion of the need to balance the costs and benefits while also accounting for administrative \nburdens, see T.

We therefore decline extend the 2015 Collection.278\n\n 99. Form 477 Data. In 2013, as the National Broadband Map data collection279 was nearing its completion, the \nCommission issued the Modernizing Form 477 Order,280 which redesigned and updated the requirements first \nspelled out in the 2000 Data Gathering Order.281 To comply with the Form 477 data collection requirements, all \nfacilities-based fixed broadband providers, including cable operators, are required to report data on all census \nblocks where they make fixed broadband services available to residential and business customers at bandwidth \nspeeds exceeding 200 kbps in at least one direction.282 Among other things, providers also report \u201cthe maximum \nadvertised speed for each technology used to offer service in each census block.\u201d283 The Commission collects \nthese data semi-annually and makes the data available to the public.284\n\n\n\n 100. We find the Form 477 data well suited for supplementing the 2015 Collection in the initial analysis of market \nconditions and a conservative proxy for competitive deployment going forward. Form 477 broadband service \navailability data necessarily imply the presence of broadband-capable cable network facilities, which makes it an \nideal dataset to ensure the competitive market test accounts for competition from cable operators. We recognize, \nhowever, that the Form 477 data do not measure the presence of other competitive providers. That being said, \ngiven the long-term sunk cost nature of competitive provision, it is unlikely that locations that were previously \ncompetitive (as evidenced in the 2015 Collection) would become noncompetitive. The key question thus becomes \nwhether the Form 477 data can be used as an updating mechanism, not merely for the extension of cable supply, \nbut as a proxy for the extension of competitive end user channel terminations more generally. While the measure is \nunlikely to be perfect, we conclude the Form 477 portion of the competitive market test is a good match for the 2015 \nCollection as a means of capturing future changes. Moreover, given cable operators\u2019 ongoing aggressive \ndeployment of end user channel terminations, which dwarfs that of non-cable\n\n 278 As determined in prior orders, the Commission does not consider third-party data a reliable alternative to the \ndata collected by the Commission. Third-party data is not as comprehensive (providers participate on a voluntary \nbasis and use different standards in reporting their data), consistent, and may be subject to potential bias or \nmanipulation. Furthermore, private parties often impose restrictions on reuse and publication of their data, which \nwould impede the Commission\u2019s and third parties\u2019 ability to use the data. See, e.g., Modernizing the FCC Form 477 \nData Program, Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 9887, 9900, para. 27 (2013) (Modernizing Form 477 Order).\n\n 279 The National Broadband Map data was developed in cooperation with the National Telecommunications & \nInformation Administration (NTIA). See FCC, The National Broadband Map,            https://wwwfcc.gov/news-\nevents/blog/2011/02/17/national-broadband-map (Feb. 17, 2011).\n\n 280 See generally Modernizing Form 477 Order.\n\n 281 See generally Local Competition and Broadband Reporting, CC Docket No. 99-301, Report and Order, 15 \nFCC Rcd 7717 (2000) (2000 Data Gathering Order).\n\n 282 Modernizing Form 477 Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 9902-03, paras. 32-35; see also FCC, Fixed Broadband \nDeployment Data from FCC Form 477,            https://wwwfcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-\n477. The relevant question in the form reads as follows: \u201cFor purposes of this form, fixed broadband connections \nare available in a census block if the provider does, or could, within a service interval that is typical for that type of \nconnection\u2014that is, without an extraordinary commitment of resources\u2014provision two-way data transmission to \nand from the Internet with advertised speeds exceeding 200 kbps in at least one direction to end-user premises in \nthe census block.\u201d FCC, FCC Form 477 Local Telephone Competition and Broadband Reporting Instructions at 17 \nsec. 5.3 (Dec. 5, 2016), https//transition.fcc.gov/form477/477inst.pdf.\n\n 283 Modernizing Form 477 Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 9905, para. 36.\n\n 284 47 CFR \u00a7 1.7002; Modernizing Form 477 Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 9920, para. 78.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 44\n\n suppliers, it is highly likely the cable-only measure found in the Form 477 data will capture the vast bulk of \nadditional deployments because it is likely that most non-cable competitive extension of business data services \nnetworks will occur where cable is also deploying or has already deployed. Importantly, these data are updated on \n\n\na semiannual basis and, therefore, any periodic re-evaluation of competition in specific markets will always be \nrelatively current. Moreover, because these data are collected by the Commission, we are confident in their \nintegrity.\n\n 101. In fact, some commenters used Form 477 data to supplement the data from the 2015 Collection in their \nanalyses and proposed that we use it going forward.285 Other commenters, while advocating using Form 477 data, \nalso suggested modifying Form 477 to replicate the 2015 Collection going forward.286 We are reluctant, however, \nto impose additional reporting burdens on providers for the same reasons we rejected proposals to refresh the 2015 \nCollection, and therefore decline to amend Form 477 to mirror the data gathered by the 2015 Collection. We believe \nthe data currently collected by the Form 477 is already well suited to the needs of the competitive market test. \nFurther, we will implement sufficient safeguards to allow us to use Form 477 in its present state.\n\n 2.Appropriate Geographic Measure\n\n 102. In terms of granularity, our goal through the years of regulating the business data services market has been \n\u201cto define . . . geographic areas narrowly enough so that the competitive conditions within each area are reasonably \nsimilar, yet broadly enough to be administratively workable.\u201d287 After considering various possible geographic \nareas to use for the competitive market test, we conclude that basing the competitive market test at the county level \nstrikes the best balance between being sufficiently granular and administratively feasible. We reject other proposals \nraised in the record, including use of MSAs, census blocks, census tracts, and ZIP codes.\n\n 103. Counties. As suggested by various commenters in the record, we agree that the geographic area we use for \nthe competitive market test should be larger than census blocks or census tracks, but smaller than MSAs.288 We \nfind that counties are granular enough to capture reasonably similar competitive conditions yet large enough to be \nadministratively feasible and are supported in the record. Counties are significantly more granular geographic units \nthan MSAs and thus reduce the risk of misidentifying competitive or noncompetitive geographic areas. Counties are \nsubdivided into census blocks.289 Presently, there are 3,233 counties in the U.S.,290 as compared to 389 MSAs, \nof which 204 had been granted pricing flexibility relief.291 Counties have another advantage over MSAs, in that \nMSAs do\n\n 285 See, e.g., US Telecom Jan. 28, 2016 Comments, Appx. at 1.\n\n 286 See, e.g., Birch et al.

With those hurdles out of the way, it is in the cable operator\u2019s \ninterest to build out an extensive network in the jurisdiction. Indeed, a cable operator\u2019s franchised cable system is \noften near ubiquitous throughout the franchised county.\n\n 107. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). We conclude that MSAs are not well suited to be used as the \ngeographic area for determining competitive effects. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed \nMSAs for purposes of compiling statistics for a set of certain geographic areas, defining MSAs as \u201cgeographic \nentities that contain a core urban area of 50,000 or more population, and often includes adjacent counties that have \na high degree of social and economic integration with the urban core, as measured by commuting to work.\u201d299 \nFurthermore, \u201cOMB may add counties or principal cities to an MSA, remove them, or even create new MSAs.\u201d300 \nAlthough OMB periodically updates its list of MSAs to reflect changes in social and economic integration between \nurban centers and outlying areas,301 the Commission \u201cadopted a list of 306 MSAs based largely on data compiled \nfrom the 1980 census, and froze that list for use in all pricing flexibility petitions.\u201d302 Thus, even if MSAs were an \nappropriate geographic area for competitive analysis and regulation, the Commission\u2019s list of MSAs does not reflect \nthe current state of population and business conditions. This circumstance has caused confusion among providers \nthat have submitted petitions to the Commission containing data calculated using different MSA definitions.303\n\n 108. In addition, MSAs are too large to reflect the scope of competition. Competitive LECs have consistently \nargued throughout this proceeding that the Commission\u2019s previous MSA analysis \u201cignored the wide variability of \ncompetitive conditions across a large geographic area.\u201d304 The Commission agreed in the Suspension Order, \nanalyzing business density in six MSAs and finding\n\n 296 The process to franchise cable operators differs significantly from locality to locality. In most states, franchising \nis conducted at the local level, affording counties and municipalities broad discretion in deciding whether and under \nwhat circumstances to grant a franchise.

Buildings and Census Blocks. Some commenters express a strong preference for regulation focused on \nindividual buildings with special access demand and, as a compromise, propose to regulate on a census block \nlevel.308 While this level of granularity might be more precise, it creates a range of other problems. For one, \nbuildings with demand is a constantly changing statistic as businesses expand or downsize. Census blocks are also \nsubject to change as the Census Bureau revises its measurements. Another issue is the administrative burden \nmetrics like these are likely to impose on providers and the Commission: there were 658,485 census blocks309 and \n1,216,977 buildings with last-mile access demand reported in our data collection.310 Regulation at such a granular \nlevel \u201cwould inevitably lead to a patchwork of differing regulations from census block to census block (or from \nbuilding-to-building)\u201d making it exceptionally difficult for regulated carriers to set prices subject to regulation in some \nareas and not in others.311 We therefore conclude that the geographic scope of the competitive market test must \nbe larger than buildings and census blocks.\n\n 110. Census Tracts and ZIP Codes. Others suggest the Commission use census tracts or, alternatively, ZIP codes \nto analyze markets in the competitive market test.312 Census tracts are statistical subdivisions of a county updated \neach decennial census.313 Based on the 2015 Collection data, the median census tract had a land area of 1.71 \nsquare miles.314 U.S. Postal Service ZIP codes identify the individual post office or metropolitan area delivery \nstation associated with mailing addresses.315 ZIP codes are also subject to periodic updates, and zip code \nboundaries can be difficult to obtain.316 Census tracts are less\n\n 305 Suspension Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 10578, para. 40.\n\n\n 306 See AT&T Jan. 27, 2016 Comments at 4-5.\n\n 307 Second IRW White Paper at 31 (proposing a competitive market test based on census tracts).

However, we take into account not only \nindividual commenters\u2019 burdens but also other factors, such as whether the regulatory geographic units adequately \nreflect competitive entry.\n\n 308 See, e.g., Birch et al.

Appropriate Level of Competition\n\n\n 111. Upon examining the structure of the business data services industry and the record before us, we find that a \ncombination of either one competitive provider with a network within a half mile from a location served by an \nincumbent LEC or a cable operator\u2019s facilities in the same census block as a location with demand will provide \ncompetitive restraint on the incumbent LEC that will be more effective than our legacy regulatory regime in ensuring \nrates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable.319 Our conclusion that a \u201cnearby BDS competitor\u201d provides \nsufficient competition to forgo regulation of an incumbent LEC\u2019s provision of BDS is based on three findings: (1) a \ndetermination of the geographic scope within which a likely BDS provider can realistically compete with an \nincumbent LEC; (2) a finding that one such competitor in addition to the incumbent LEC provides a reasonable \ndegree of competition in BDS supply; and (3) a finding that the benefits of such competition outweigh the potential \nunintended costs of regulation.\n\n a. Effect of a Nearby BDS Competitor\n\n 112. The record in this proceeding indicates that providers actively compete for customers located within about a \nhalf mile from their networks by bidding on requests for proposals and sending their sales personnel to offer their \nservices.320 When bidding on a contract, providers often \u201chave no way of knowing with any reasonable degree of \ncertainty which other providers are capable of serving that customer over their own facilities\u201d and, therefore, when \nbidding on an RFP they \u201cmake much rougher assessments of the possibility of facing competitive bids\u201d\u2014a dynamic \nthat \u201censure[s] that the benefits of competition redound to all customers in an area where competitive facilities have \nbeen deployed, not just\n\n 317 See U.S. Census Bureau, Geography, 2010 Census Tallies of Census Tracts, Block Groups & Blocks,           \n 318 U.S. Census Bureau, Geography \u2013 2016 U.S. Gazetteer Files, Zip Code Tabulation Areas, \n 319 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b), 202(a); Access Change Reform, Price Cap Performance Review for Local \nExchange Carriers, Transport Rate Structure and Pricing, End User Common Line Charges, CC Docket Nos. 96-\n262, 94-1, 91-213, 95-72, First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 15982, 16095, para. 264 (1997); Regulatory \nTreatment of LEC Provision of Interexchange Services Originating in the LEC\u2019s Local Exchange Area, Policy and \nRules Concerning the Interstate, Interexchange Marketplace, CC Docket Nos. 96-149, 96-61, Second and Third \nReport and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 15756, 15758-62, paras. 1-5 (1997) (adopting a framework for market power \nanalysis, finding it \u201cnecessary to achieve the pro-competitive, deregulatory goals of the 1996 Act\u201d).\n\n 320 See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 9-10, 17 (\u201cHaving a proactive sales force is critical for a new entrant such as \nComcast to overcome business customers\u2019 predisposition to use incumbent providers\u2019 BDS services.\u201d); Cox Bye \nand Steelman Decl. at para. 26. Wholesalers typically obtain not only \u201con-net\u201d lists of buildings from providers but \nalso \u201cnear-net\u201d lists and seek bids from nearby providers. See, e.g., XO Jan. 28, 2016 Comments, Decl. of Michael \nChambless at paras. 24, 27.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 49\n\n\n those who are located within a certain distance of a network, or that offer a certain level of revenues.\u201d321 \nAccordingly, we determine nearby competitive network facilities exert competitive pressure on incumbent LECs \nwhether or not their network is within a half mile of a customer\u2019s location.\n\n 113. We further find that wireline providers of BDS are commonly willing to extend their existing network out \napproximately a half mile, and in some instances further, to meet demand.322 That is, the cost of meeting demand \nwithin one-half mile, including the costs of network extension and customer connection, is usually less than the \npresent value of expected net revenues that buildout to that location will entail. This is true for cable companies who \ntoday are major and aggressive business data services suppliers.323 For example, in 2013 cable already supplied \nBDS, largely over fiber facilities, to more than one in ten locations with BDS demand, and may well reach 23.5 \npercent of locations today.324 We additionally assume as a reasonable approximation that a cable company \ncompetes for any BDS demand, or will do so within a few years, wherever it is supplying mass market broadband \nservices over its own network, or will do so sometime over the next few years.325 We find this is so even for \nlocations with BDS demand that are not currently connected to the cable company\u2019s network, and which may be \nmore than a half mile from a fiber-node (because cable companies are actively driving fiber closer to all end users, \nand so extending fiber to a new location beyond that distance may be economic given broader network \nobjectives).326 In sum, we find a wireline supplier is an effective competitor in meeting BDS demand at a location if \nit either delivers BDS to a location or has a network within one half mile of the location with BDS demand, and/or is \na cable company with a near ubiquitous HFC network that surrounds the location with BDS demand. We hereafter \nrefer to such competitors as nearby competitors, and to their networks as nearby networks.\n\n b. Effect of a Single BDS Competitor\n\n 114. We find that, in the market for business data services, there is a substantial competitive effect when a \nwireline competitor is present to discipline rates, terms, and conditions to just and reasonable levels.327 We arrive \nat this conclusion because there is a general expectation that the largest\n\n 321 Verizon Jan. 28, 2016 Comments at 22-23.

If this share grew for \nthree years at the previously noted rate of 20 percent, then cable would serve 23.5 percent of locations today.\n\n 325 See, e.g., Letter from Matthew A. Brill, Counsel to Comcast, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC docket \nNo. 05-25 et al, at 2-3 (filed March 13, 2017) (explaining \u201cthe fiber component of Comcast\u2019s existing HFC plant can \nposition the company to provide dedicated, fiber-based BDS in many markets, even if Comcast is not currently \nproviding fiber-based BDS to particular locations in those markets\u201d). This presumption is consistent with the \nCommission precedent where, in the context of cable franchising rules, the Commission found the \u201cubiquitous\u201d \npresence of direct broadcasting satellite providers \u201cpresumptively satisfies the requirement that the franchise area \nbe served by two unaffiliated PVPDs each of which offers comparable programming to at least 50 percent of the \nhouseholds in the franchise area.\u201d Amendment to the Commission\u2019s Rules Concerning Effective Competition; \nImplementation of Section 111 of STELA Reauthorization Act, Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 6574, 6580 at para. \n8 (2015); see also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(l)(1) (definition of \u201ceffective competition\u201d).\n\n\n\n 326 See supra, Part III.D.2.\n\n 327 We do not claim that a second wireline provider within a half mile is a rapid entrant as described in the 2010 \nHorizontal Merger Guidelines. See 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines \u00a7 5.1. We only assert that over a period of \nseveral years, such a provider will in most cases place reasonably effective competitive pressure on the incumbent.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 50\n\n benefits from competition come from the presence of a second provider, with added benefits of additional providers \nfalling thereafter,328 in part because, consistent with other industries with large sunk costs, the impact of a second \nprovider is likely to be particularly profound in the case of wireline network providers.329 A wireline provider is \nwilling to cut prices to as low as the incremental cost of supplying a new customer, requiring minimal contribution to \nits sunk costs.330 In addition, we find that the presence of a nearby competitor is likely to prevent substantial abuse \nof market power, whether through high prices, or lack of innovation, and equally that a lack of actual supply by a \nnearby competitor likely arises when existing suppliers\u2019 offerings are reasonable in both price service \ncharacteristics. That is, active supply occurs most rapidly in locations where the most profits are likely to be \nobtained, including where, for example, the transition to packet-based services is most valued, or put another way, \nactive supply is most likely to occur where the costs of missing competition are greatest. Equally, active supply is \nmost likely to be postponed where the benefits of additional competition are small, because the potential profit \ngained from extending supply is small.\n\n 115. We reject some commenters\u2019 characterization of the Qwest Phoenix Order as a blanket finding by the \nCommission that two competitors are insufficient to constrain incumbent LEC pricing.331 Although the Commission \nraised concerns about the competitive nature of a duopoly in that order, it did\n\n 328 On the impact of one or two firms in telecommunications, see Howard A. Shelanski, Adjusting Regulation to \nCompetition: Toward a New Model for U.S. Telecommunications Policy, 24 Yale J. on Reg. 24 (2007) (hereinafter \nShelanski); Second IRW White Paper at 39-40. Empirical evidence also suggests once a market reaches three \nfirms, an additional entrant has little effect on per customer profits. See Timothy F. Bresnahan & Peter C. Reiss, \nEntry and Competition in Concentrated Markets, 99 J. of Pol. Reporter 977 (1991). Additionally, a recent study of \nthe U.S. residential broadband market finds that entry of a fourth competitor in a zip code has almost no effect on \nprice. See Mo Xiao & Peter F. Orazem, Does the Fourth Entrant Make Any Difference? Entry and Competition in \nthe Early U.S. Broadband Market, 29 Int\u2019l J. of Indus. Org. 547-561 (2011). The disproportionate effect of the entry \nof a first competitor and the declining impact of subsequent entrants is also evident in the record.

To the contrary, it specifically recognized that \u201cunder certain \nconditions duopoly will yield a competitive outcome.\u201d332 We find that the high sunk cost nature of the BDS market \ngives providers the incentive to extend their network facilities to new locations with demand even when those \nlocations contribute revenue only marginally above the incremental cost of the network extension. In their \ncomments, incumbent LECs substantiate this conclusion by citing substantial losses they have recently incurred, \nprimarily to new entrant cable operators.333 They also provide examples of their responses to cable competition \ninvolving both price reductions and new service offerings.334 Reports by cable providers of significant year-over-\nyear growth in their BDS revenues corroborate this story, and show a shift in demand to higher (and more \ncompetitive) bandwidths.335\n\n 116. We also distinguish our analysis here from that which the Commission employed in the Qwest Phoenix Order. \nAlthough our competitive market test takes into account competition only from providers of copper, fiber, and coax \nlast-mile facilities, in many locations there are likely more competitors present than the two captured by the test, \nsuch as providers of fixed wireless last-mile services, including providers of emerging 5G last-mile transmission \ntechnology, which promises to be near-ubiquitous.336 Thus, technological changes that have occurred or are likely \nto occur in the near future make the Commission\u2019s reasoning in the Qwest Phoenix decision inapposite.\n\n 117. Some competitive LECs urge us to deregulate only locations with four providers (one incumbent LEC and \nthree competitors) with last-mile connections in the building or in the census block.337 We find that such an \napproach would result in substantial overregulation of the business data services market and therefore we decline \nto adopt it. The primary driver of the number of connections at any location is the nature of demand in the \nlocation.338 We fully expect locations with a single customer to typically have only one provider.339 Even those \nlocations with multiple customers may only have a single provider\u2014the provider that won the bidding process to \nsupply the location. However, as we explain above, the high sunk network cost nature of this industry indicates \neven as few as two nearby\n\n 332 Qwest Phoenix Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 8637, para. 30, aff\u2019d, Qwest Corp. v.

Accordingly, requiring even two, let alone three or four \nproviders to be already supplying a given location as the rule for deregulation would result in overregulation in \nnumerous locations that have competitive choice. This issue would become even more pronounced as wireline \nnetwork providers compete for more locations. On the basis of the 2015 Collection, deregulating locations with at \nleast three (an incumbent LEC plus two other facilities-based providers) or four (an incumbent LEC plus three other \nfacilities-based providers) suppliers would mean less than one percent of locations would be price deregulated and \nwould re-impose price regulation on the vast majority of locations. Such a radical change would impose substantial \nregulatory costs on incumbent LECs\u2014and consequently on small businesses, wireless carriers, and other \nconsumers\u2014and would dramatically reduce incentives for all carriers to build out next-generation infrastructure, \nwhich directly contravenes our goal of encouraging investment and innovation.\n\n 118. Though we believe the record is convincing on the impact of one nearby competitor ensuring reasonably \ncompetitive outcomes in the medium term (i.e., over several years), even if it were not, the inability to draw firm \nconclusions from the data permits the Commission to make a predictive judgment regarding the impact of regulation \non the market. Notwithstanding whether one nearby competitor is sufficient for a market to realize the substantive \nbenefits of competition, we note that the 2015 Collection analysis did not permit a definitive conclusion of incumbent \nLEC market power.340 In addition, as demonstrated by the market analysis in this Order, the evidence in the record \nsuggests significant competition for these business data services. We conclude the best policy to encourage \ncompetition is to refrain from ex ante pricing regulation when the competitive market test adopted in this order is \n\nhttp://www.lightreading.com/\n\n\nsatisfied. We find this policy to be sound even if our market analysis does not does result in the perfect regulation of \nevery building in the country\u2014for any administrable rule will necessarily be overinclusive in some cases and \nunderinclusive in others. Consistent with our precedent, we conclude that competition is the preferred method of \nensuring just and reasonable rates, terms and conditions and preventing unreasonable discrimination.341 \nRefraining from ex ante pricing regulation in these instances where we see active and likely near-term competition \ndeveloping is the most effective means of ensuring continued development of actual and robust competitive \noutcomes.\n\n c. Potential Unintended Costs of Regulation\n\n 119. Finally, we find that there are substantial costs of regulating the supply of BDS and these likely outweigh \ngreatly any costs due to the residual exercise of market power that may occur in the absence of regulation. As a \nbaseline, the presumption, \u201c[c]ompetition is best. . . because competition is the single best way of ensuring that \ncustomers benefit\u201d342 and the promotion of the same guides us. The question is not whether today nearby \ncompetition is everywhere fully effective, or even whether it will become so over the next few years. The question is \nwhether the costs of the lack of fully effective competition, even as these decline over time, are likely smaller than \nthe net costs of regulation.\n\n 120. Here we explain why we find that the net costs of regulation in the business data services industry are likely \nto be large, most especially because regulation is likely to undermine entry, potentially postponing the gains from \ncompetition for many years. Even well-crafted regulations have unintended consequences, inhibiting competition, \nreducing investment, and end user benefits.343 This is especially\n\n 340 See Revised Rysman Paper at 20-21; Sweeting Report at 3, para. 7; Valletti Report at 6.\n\n 341 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b), 202(a).\n\n 342 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4725, para. 5.\n\n 343 See, e.g., Dennis W.

First, it is very difficult for firms to set efficient prices when they must tariff and for a regulator to estimate the \nefficient price level in a business with the following characteristics: high uncertainty due to frequent and often large \nunforeseen changes in both customer demand for services and network technologies that are hard to anticipate \nand hedge against in contracts with customers;347 a complex set of products and services, which are tailored to \nindividual buyers;348 costs of provision that vary substantially across different customer-provider combinations;349 \n\n\n\nand large irreversible sunk-cost investments that a provider is required to make before offering service.350 In these \ncircumstances,\n\n (Continued from previous page)\n\n 2016),            http://www.techpolicydaily.com /internet/the-cost-of-regulating-special-access-a-55-percent-\ninvestment-decrease/.\n\n 344 See Thomas O.

This does not apply to DS1 and DS3 end user \nchannel terminations, and to a lesser extent to packet-based channel terminations. That is, one DS1 channel \ntermination to given location is much like another, and similarly for a DS3. However, complexity quickly increases \nwhen channel terminations are sold as part of a bundle of locations or as part of a bundle of other services, or \nboth, such as transport. Moreover, where complex bundling is allowed, that is, in areas granted Phase I or Phase II \npricing flexibility, or for services where we forbear from tariff regulation, most purchases of such services occur \nwithin complex bundles, evidencing market preferences for such contracts.\n\n 349 Various cost analyses submitted into the record all imply costs vary by location. See, e.g., ACA Comments, \nAppx. A (Marius Schwartz, Federico Mini, Economic Basis for Not Regulating Competitive Providers of Business \nData Services at 15 (dated June 24, 2016).\n\n 350 A sunk cost is an investment that has no value in an alternative use and no scrap value. 2010 Horizontal \nMerger Guidelines \u00a7 5.1 (\u201cSunk costs are entry or exit costs that cannot be recovered outside the relevant \nmarket.\u201d). For example, a fiber cable strung or buried connecting a premise to a carrier\u2019s network node rarely has \n\nhttp://www.techpolicydaily.com/\n\nany value beyond providing the connection. Consequently, all the costs of installing such connection are sunk. They \ncannot be recovered if the carrier decides not to service that location.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 54\n\n efficient prices are often tailored to individual purchasers, and are often subject to renegotiations that account for \nchanging circumstances.351 Moreover, in these circumstances, the efficient price level, which must be reflected in \nthe price cap, is extremely difficult to determine, not least because it must reflect the option value of sinking network \ninvestments in a rapidly-changing environment.352 Both of these sources of regulatory error, especially failure in \nsetting a price cap, can lead to prices that are too low which prevent entry (or alternatively prices that are too high \nwhich encourage excessive entry).353 For example, an inability to quickly adjust a tariff, means prices can be too \nlow where they otherwise would be changed, while the restraints of tariffing can force a provider to set prices that \nare too low for some customers and too high for others, simply because of barriers to filing separate tariffs that \nallow such different customers to self-select into the option that suits them best. Similarly, price caps can force, \nthrough required averaging (such as the geographic average required in our price caps), prices that are too low in \nsome locations and too high in others. The effect is to rule out entry in the former case, and to sometimes \nencourage inefficient entry in the latter. Moreover, price caps that are overall too low somewhere discourage entry \n(as well as long-run network reinvestment) which can have substantive knock-on effects on entry decisions given \nthat supply in BDS is about recovering more than the incremental cost of each customer to pay for total network \ncosts. Such negative effects accumulate over the life of the cap.\n\n 122. Second, given most wireline network costs must be sunk for periods of between 20 years and sometimes two \nor more times that length of time,354 entrants and incumbents looking to reinvest are extremely sensitive to any \nincreases in costs that might reduce their capacity to recover these costs. In particular, a small rise in cost that \nremains in place over a long time period can have a substantial impact on whether a particular investment \nopportunity is viewed positively. That is exactly what regulation does. It directly raises incumbent\u2019s costs, making \nthem unwilling to invest, and hence less effective competitors, and it creates an additional source of uncertainty that \nentrants must contend with when evaluating entry.355 If there is a small probability that future regulation will harm \nthe entrant\u2019s projected income streams, then this can materially discourage entry (because over the course of the \ndecades the expected present value of the accumulated harm can be large).\n\n 351 See, e.g., ACA Comments, Appx. B (ACA Operator Member Activities in the Market for Business Data \nServices, (dated June 2016)) at paras. 4.1.1 - 4.1.8.; CenturyLink et al. Comments, Exh.

Lastly, we reiterate that \u201cthe Commission should construct regulation to meet not only today\u2019s marketplace, \nbut tomorrow\u2019s as well.\u201d356 Available metrics show the BDS market to be dynamic, evolving rapidly, and becoming \nincreasingly competitive across all service offerings. When a market is changing and growing, it offers tremendous \nopportunities to new entrants, and hence creates less regulatory concerns. Rather than only having the option of \ntaking customers from existing suppliers by offering them very similar services, new entrants can seek as yet \nunaffiliated customers, or tempt customers away by offering new services that incumbents either do not offer, or if \nthey do, are no more experts in it than the entrant (in fact, incumbents may be hampered by fears of cannibalizing \ntheir legacy services, or by their cultures, etc. that suited the legacy world).357 In short, competition is better \nplaced in dynamic growing markets to be effective than in a static, or declining market. In addition, a high degree of \nflux greatly increases the chances that regulatory error will stifle competition and reduce welfare, because it is \napplied to a circumstance that, without the regulation, may have quickly been overtaken innovation and/or \ncompetition.358 Thus, regulation of such markets is generally considered to be counterproductive.\n\n 4.Competitive Market Test Methodology\n\n 124. In this section, we adopt the competitive market test methodology that we will use to determine which local \nmarkets are sufficiently competitive to warrant deregulation of price cap incumbent LEC provision of DS1 and DS3 \nend user channel terminations. As we note above, we take a pragmatic approach to structuring the competitive \nmarket test, with the goal of promoting innovation and investment and recognizing recent trends and developments \nin the BDS marketplace. Furthermore, as also discussed above, we take a network-centric approach which takes \ninto account the high sunk cost nature of BDS networks that gives nearby competitors a significant incentive to \ncompete for potential clients within an economically buildable distance from their networks. This is the case for \ntraditional competitive LECs and for newer entrants such as cable providers with near-ubiquitous networks.\n\n 125. For the competitive market test to most closely approximate the realities of competition in the business data \nservices market, it ideally should deregulate where there is competition and regulate where there is not. \nAccordingly, we can use the 2015 Collection to measure the relative effectiveness of different competitive market \ntests at that point in time by assessing their respective error rates \u2013 i.e., how often they fail to deregulate locations \nor census blocks that are competitive and how often they fail to regulate locations or census blocks that are not. A \ncompetitive market test with an appropriately weighted combination of such error rates will tend toward maximizing \ncompetitive effects and minimizing regulatory failure. However, we also consider the importance of minimizing \nregulatory disruption. In particular, we seek to be conservative in deregulation and reregulation, and we specifically \ndecline to re-regulate counties that were previously granted Phase II pricing flexibility.\n\n\n 126. Data. Our first step in establishing a competitive market test is to use data from the 2015 Collection to identify \nareas that are competitive. First, we use the location data in the 2015 Collection to\n\n 356 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4726, para. 8.\n\n 357 See, e.g., ACA Comments, Appx. B at paras. 3.3.1-3.3.4, 5.1.1; see also 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines, \u00a7 \n7.2.\n\n 358 See, e.g., Nancy L. Rose, Learning from the Past: Insights for the Regulation of Economic Activity, at 6 (a \ngeneral statement) & 7 (on cable television), and Jerry Hausman and J. Gregory Sidak, Telecommunications \nRegulation: Current Approaches with the End in Sight, at 347 (on telecommunications) in Economic Regulation and \nIts Reform: What Have We Learned? (Nancy L. Rose, ed., 2005); Shelanski at 93, 102 & 104 (also on \ntelecommunications). In the context of the Internet, see Johannes M. Bauer & Michael Latzer, The Economics of \nthe Internet: An Overview, in Handbook on the Economics of the Internet, at 47-48, 49 (Johannes M. Bauer & \nMichael Latzer, eds. 2016.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 56\n\n determine which buildings or locations with last-mile access demand are within a half mile of a location served by \na competitor. We use a half mile distance based on our analysis of the record, discussed above, that determined \nthat competitive providers are actively competing for customers located within that distance and are generally \nwilling to build out that distance in response to business data services demand. We previously determined that two \nproviders in the relevant market are sufficient to ensure competitive prices.359 Thus, all business locations with \ndemand for last-mile access in a county that are within a half mile of a competitive provider\u2019s facilities are deemed \ncompetitive.360\n\n 127. We supplement the 2015 Collection data with additional and more current data from the Form 477 on \nbroadband availability by cable providers which offers the best available and most current data on the sale of \nbroadband services by cable providers and which is closely correlated with physical presence of cable networks. \nData based on census blocks are very granular and therefore provide an appropriate measure on which to base our \ncalculations for cable networks. Census blocks can be very small. If the median census block \u201cwere a circle, then it \nwould be approximately 0.2 miles across\u201d361\u2014an area that can easily fit (and often does fit) a single building.362 \nIndeed, \u201chalf [of all census] blocks are smaller than a tenth of a square mile (6.4 acres).\u201d363 Given the high sunk \ncost nature of cable broadband networks, we find when a cable provider is capable of providing Internet broadband \nservice within any census block, then generally they have the incentive to make the incremental investment \nnecessary to serve locations with BDS demand in that census block, especially over the medium term. Accordingly, \nwe treat as competitive census blocks in price cap incumbent LEC study areas that the Form 477 data show have a \ncable presence\u2014whether serving business or residential clients.\n\n 128. We conclude that it is necessary to base the competitive market test on data from both the 2015 Collection \nand the Form 477 data collections since neither collection captures the full extent of competition. The 2015 \nCollection includes data on traditional competitive LECs but only includes a portion of cable competitive facilities \nboth because of the nature of the data reported and the fact that it does not capture cable competition that has \nemerged since the collection. The Form 477 data includes reasonably comprehensive data from which we can infer \nthe presence of cable network facilities but does not provide comprehensive data on traditional competitive LECs. \nBecause competitive LECs do not typically have locally ubiquitous networks, a report of supply by such a provider \nin a census block is less likely to mean they can extend their network to cover demand anywhere in the census \n\n\n\nblock, so a traditional competitive LEC\u2019s Form 477 report of presence in a census block often is not a good \nindication whether it can readily extend service to other locations in that census block. Additionally, such providers \nmay offer business data services in a block, but not supply broadband service as defined in the Form 477 data \ncollection and not report that service for Form 477 purposes. Basing our test on both datasets will most closely \napproximate the full spectrum of competition in the business data services market, including competition from \nmedium-term entrants. As we explain above, recent buildout by cable companies dwarfs that of traditional \ncompetitive LECs and, therefore, the 2015 Collection is likely\n\n 359 See, e.g., SBC/AT&T, 20 FCC Rcd at 18308, para. 32 (2005); AT&T/BellSouth Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 5682-83, \nparas. 41-42.\n\n 360 Our analysis of competitive provider facilities does not include UNEs because the availability of UNEs is both \nrestricted by our rules (see, e.g., 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319(a)(4), (5)(ii)) and is declining in the market as incumbent LECs \ntransition their circuit-switched to packet-based business data services. Consequently, a CMT based on the \npresence of UNE availability today may overstate competition in the future. See Further Notice at 4748, para. 57; \nLevel 3 Reply at 2.\n\n 361 Further Notice at 4818, para. 214.\n\n 362 Third IRW White Paper at 3.\n\n 363 FCC Form 477, More About Census Blocks, at 1            \n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 57\n\n to closely reflect the state of traditional competitive LEC deployment as of 2013. To the extent the test does not \ncapture some recent deployment by traditional competitive LECs, providers have recourse through a section 208 \ncomplaint process.\n\n 129. Setting Appropriate Thresholds. The next step in formulating the competitive market test is to use the highly \ngranular data from both datasets to assess the accuracy of different combinations of thresholds we might adopt for \nthe test. These datasets measure competition at very local levels \u2013 individual locations and census blocks. \nHowever, for administrative purposes we have chosen to use counties to apply regulation. Thus, we use these \nmore granular data to assess competition at the county level. This entails a higher degree of imprecision than if we \nwere to base the test on locations or census blocks (which would entail more burden and administrative cost). In \nparticular, we do not require a county to be 100 percent competitive to deregulate it. Were we to require this, few \ncounties, if any, would qualify. For similar reasons, we do not require a county to completely lack competition in \norder to regulate it. We acknowledge that by setting the percentage threshold at something less than 100 percent \nnecessarily leaves a portion of businesses at non-competitive locations within a county deemed competitive without \nthe near-term potential for competition. However, for the reasons discussed above, it is important not to \noverregulate, and thereby reduce incentives for competitive entry. Indeed, competitors, and particularly near-\nubiquitous competitors like cable providers, have an incentive to build to locations even beyond a half mile from \ntheir facilities, depending on cost and revenue opportunity. Conversely, setting a percentage threshold too low \nwould also distort the results of the competitive market test by deregulating counties with only a relatively minor \ncompetitive presence, leaving a higher percentage of locations with business data services demand without the \n\n\nlikelihood of a competitive option. Consequently, we apply our judgement to strike a balance in light of the data at \nour disposal.\n\n 130. We set percentage thresholds that result in a test that more accurately approximates competitive conditions in \nthe county broadly. We set a separate threshold for each of the two datasets we use and note that, given the \ndifferences in the two datasets, the percentage thresholds will not be identical. Given the interdependency of the \ndatasets, we analyze combinations of thresholds to assess their impact on the accuracy of our test and to \ndetermine which combination yields results with the lowest weighted error rates.\n\n 131. Utilizing the data from the 2015 Collection and Form 477, we tested a variety of thresholds for both datasets. \nAny pair of thresholds regulates certain price cap counties and deregulates all others. This leads to two types of \nregulatory error that we can approximately measure using the 2015 Collection: the first type of error occurs in \nregulated counties where there will be locations as of 2013 that were within a half mile of a location supplied over \nthe facilities of a competitor (i.e., wrongly regulated), while the second type of error occurs in deregulated counties \nwhere there will be locations that were not within such a distance (i.e., wrongly deregulated). We measure these \ntwo types of errors by the number of locations in each category. Given the preceding, a natural way to proceed \nwould be to seek a pair of thresholds that minimize some weighted sum of these two error counts.\n\n 132. Following our competitive analysis that revealed the high costs of regulating this industry, we could, for \nexample, assign twice as much weight to the first type of error of regulating where we should deregulate (i.e., \nwrongly regulating) as to the second type of error of deregulating where we should regulate (i.e., wrongly \nderegulating). Such a measure would overstate the first type of error, regulating locations that should be \nderegulated. This would reflect the scenario where one thought that the burdens and costs of inappropriately \nregulating were twice those of inappropriately deregulating. For example, in Figure 2 a weight of 2/3 is assigned to \na competitive building that is regulated and a weight of 1/3 is assigned to a noncompetitive building that is \nderegulated. The darkest blue area shows the range in which the weighted sum of errors takes its lowest values, \nwhile the darkest red area shows the range in which the weighted sum of errors takes its highest values. Taking this \napproach allows us identify the thresholds that minimize the weighted sum of these two errors. In particular, the \nappropriate thresholds given these weights would deregulate a county where 32 percent of buildings with BDS \ndemand are\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 61\n\n that 89.5 percent of locations with special access demand would be appropriately regulated, with 77,900 locations \npotentially over regulated and 48,045 potentially under regulated.365\n\n 136. Our analysis suggests that setting a threshold of 3 to 23 percent would be one reasonable means of setting \nthe trigger threshold for the Form 477 data. Nonetheless, we believe a more cautious approach is warranted for \nthree reasons. First, we recognize that all but 8.9 percent of locations with special access demand are already \nderegulated by the half mile test\u2014and any test using the Form 477 data will likely overlap substantially with the \nlocations already targeted by that test. So any additional deregulation using Form 477 must be justified at the \nmargin. Second, we recognize that deployment in any marginal counties targeted alone by the cable census block \n\n\n\ntest is likely to be more sparse than in those targeted by the half mile test, and so the facility of cable deployment to \nany given location is likely to be somewhat less than in more concentrated areas. Third, we want to ensure that \ncounties we deregulate\u2014now and in future competitive market test updates\u2014will be predominantly competitive in \nnature. Accordingly, we choose a more conservative approach and adopt a 75 percent threshold for the Form 477 \ndata. With that threshold, an additional 17 or 0.5 percent of all counties and county equivalents would be treated as \ncompetitive, resulting in the deregulation of an additional 0.8 percent of locations with special access demand. We \nestimate that adding that threshold increases the percentage of locations appropriately regulated to 90.2 percent, \nwith 8,367 locations more appropriately regulated. We note also that because Form 477 data encompasses cable\u2019s \nbest-efforts business data services, and this source of cable competition is growing rapidly, we expect setting even \na conservative threshold such as this one will result in further deregulation going forward.\n\n 137. We acknowledge that this competitive market test does not as perfectly delineate areas as we would like; yet \nwe believe it strikes the right balance. It balances the need for precision against the need for a test that is feasible \nto administer, and also balances the benefits of appropriate regulation of competitive and non-competitive areas \nwhile seeking to avoid the costs of inappropriate regulation. It does not require additional data collections and yet \nclosely approximates the results such data collections are likely to yield. It ensures that we adopt competitive \nthresholds that most closely approximate actual competitive market conditions and minimize regulatory error. It \nderegulates areas with sufficient (Continued from previous page)\n\n start with a list of all census blocks in the country, and remove blocks reported as being wholly, or nearly wholly, \nserved by rate-of-return carriers according to the study-area-boundary data collection (where rate-of-return study \nareas cover, in total, more than 99.4% of the area of a block). Rate-of-return and price cap providers are required to \nsubmit and certify the geospatial data representing the areas they serve. See FCC, Study Area Boundary Data,       \n     https://www.fcc.gov/wireline-competition/industry-analysis-and-technology-division/general/study-area-boundary-\ndata. Thus, census blocks that are split between price cap and rate-of-return carriers will be included among the list \nof price cap census blocks. Blocks that have no provider, or are only partly served by rate-of-return carriers, \naccording to the study-area-boundary data collection, will also be included in this analysis of price cap blocks. This \napproach is necessary to ensure that all census blocks that could possibly contain price cap service areas will in \nfact be included in the test.\n\n 365 That is, locations are appropriately regulated if they are not within half a mile of a competitor\u2019s facilities \naccording to the 2015 Collection and if they are not in a cable-served census block according to Form 477. We \nrecognize that the 2015 Collection does not reflect the recent merger between Verizon and XO, however we believe \nthat merger does not affect our competitive market test outcome. In order for a county to be treated as non-\ncompetitive, the number of locations once served by the acquired competitive LEC in the purchasing incumbent \nLEC\u2019s study areas would have to be sufficient to change whether the county meets the deregulatory threshold. To \nthe extent this is possible, the petition process to will provide a venue for affected providers and customers to voice \ntheir concerns. (These mergers will not impact the second part of our test that measures the extent of competition \nfrom cable companies.) And in the event there are any future mergers that may impact the outcome of the \ncompetitive market test, we believe our merger review and the petition process are the appropriate venues in which \nto raise any such concerns.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 62\n\n potential for competitive entry in response to significant profit opportunities and retains ex ante pricing regulation in \nareas where competitors are less likely to be able to enter and therefore creates appropriate incentives for just and \nreasonable rates and continued growth, innovation, investment, and deployment in the dynamic business data \n\n\nservices market. Lastly, it is conservative in deregulating, reflecting a desire to not move too quickly and \nrecognizing the nascent nature of cable competition not captured in the 2015 Collection.\n\n 138. We find that it is not necessary to create a special process or mechanism for challenging the results of the \ncompetitive market test. For administrability purposes, any such process would need to be limited to a single \ncriterion, for example, the accuracy of the Form 477 data. The Commission has designed the competitive market \ntest in a manner that reduces the need for, and the significance of, any post-decision challenge process because it \nhas established very clear standards based on data that is readily accessible. In addition, we believe that parties \ncan rely on the accuracy of the Form 477 data because it is certified to by company officials, compliance is subject \nto enforcement actions, and filers are required to submit revised data upon discovery of a significant error. \nFurthermore, commenters generally agree that the Commission should avoid establishing a separate process that \nis burdensome on the parties and the Commission.366 For example, NCTA urges the Commission to forego any \nextensive and involved challenge process such as in the Connect American Phase II universal program that \nincluded more than 140 parties challenging the classification of nearly 180,000 census blocks and that took the \nCommission nine months to resolve.367 Finally, we note that our rules already establish procedures for seeking \nreview of the Commission\u2019s decisions.368 Accordingly, consistent with our goals of eliminating unnecessary \nadministrative burdens, we conclude, based on the substantial administrative costs and apparently only minor \nbenefit, there is no reason to implement a challenge process here.\n\n D. Updating Competitive Market Test Results\n\n 139. To ensure the results of the competitive market test continue to reflect competitive conditions in the business \ndata services marketplace, we adopt a process for updating those results every three years using Form 477 data \nacross all areas served by price cap carriers.\n\n 140. The results of the competitive market test offer a static snapshot of a dynamic and constantly changing \nbusiness data services market. Most commenters that support the use of a competitive market test also support \nupdating the test periodically.369 We therefore adopt an administratively efficient process that will periodically \nupdate the results of the test to govern the transition of a county from non-competitive to competitive status.\n\n 141. We base our initial application of the competitive market test on the two principle data sources we currently \nhave at our disposal, the 2015 Collection and Form 477. The Form 477 data are updated on a semi-annual basis \nand will therefore continue to be useful in measuring competition in subsequent updates to the test. The data in the \n2015 Collection, however, will become increasingly stale and therefore less relevant to actual market conditions in \nsubsequent updates of the test. We agree with commenters that express concerns about the burdens such new \ndata collections would entail.370 At this point, we find that the costs of such collections outweigh the benefits. The \n2015 Collection was the most\n\n 366 See, e.g., Birch et al. Comments at 54 (warning against \u201cthe potentially burdensome nature of a challenge \nprocess\u201d); NTCA Comments at 79-80.\n\n 367 See NTCA Comments at 79-80 (\u201cApproximately 50 cable operators made or were named in challenges and \nthey were compelled to provide data regarding more than 25,000 disputed census blocks.\u201d)\n\n 368 47 CFR \u00a7 1.429 (petitions for reconsideration).\n\n 369 See, e.g., CenturyLink et al. Comments at 81; INCOMPAS Comments at 9; Sprint Comments at 36.\n\n 370 See, e.g., NCTA Reply at 51.\n\n\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 63\n\n comprehensive data collection the Commission has conducted, and the burden of conducting additional such \ncollections, even if streamlined, would likely be considerable.\n\n 142. Moreover, we agree with commenters that the Commission \u201cdoes not need to issue a request for a broad, \nlarge-scale data collection as it did in 2012\u201d in order to obtain updated market data.371 We can instead use the \nexisting Form 477 data collection, which would provide continuity with the initial test that also relies on these data. \nThe Form 477 data on broadband availability are well suited to identify increases in competitive broadband \ndeployment, particularly by cable providers which are the most likely sources of competitive growth. We conclude it \nis not necessary, as some commenters suggest, to modify Form 477 to request additional information.372 The \ncurrent Form 477 data are sufficiently precise to capture the changes in competitive deployment that are likely to \noccur in a three-year timeframe. Thus we are able to achieve our goals of updating the competitive market test \nresults using accurate data and at the same time avoid imposing any additional burdens on providers or the \nCommission.\n\n 143. We agree with commenters that support the suggestion in the Further Notice that the Commission reapply the \ntest every three years.373 We find that the three-year period strikes the right balance between ensuring the \ncompetitive market test remains reasonably accurate and avoiding unnecessary disruption of sales arrangements \nand administrative burdens by overly frequent updates.\n\n 144. As Sprint explains, \u201c[three years] permits the Commission to evaluate whether markets are changing to \nbecome more competitive and will ensure that the regulatory framework reflects accurate information about the \nBDS marketplace.\u201d374 We disagree with commenters arguing for more or less frequent updates.375 More frequent \nupdates are likely to be unnecessarily disruptive of longer-term business data services sales arrangements, while \nless frequent updates will be insufficient for the Commission to properly assess changes in the marketplace and to \nensure the test remains current.\n\n 145. We direct the Wireline Competition Bureau to review Form 477 data on a regular three-year basis and \ndetermine whether any additional regulated counties meet the 75 percent threshold. The Bureau shall release a \nPublic Notice that lists newly competitive counties and shall also provide this information on the Commission \nwebsite. Parties desiring to challenge these results may file petitions for reconsideration or seek full Commission \nreview through an application for review.\n\n 146. While commenters may disagree with how to update the initial competitive market test results, commenters \nwidely note that the Commission should select administrative processes that are efficient. We note there are more \nthan 3,100 counties in the U.S. that are included in our initial competitive market test computations. About 37 \npercent of these are treated as non-competitive and about 63 percent as competitive. We have previously noted \nthat, given the sunk and irreversible cost nature of business data services provision, it is unlikely that locations that \nwere competitive, as evidenced in the 2015 Collection and Form 477 data, would become noncompetitive. Sunk \ncosts represent the biggest barrier to entry, and these data demonstrate that this barrier has been overcome. On \nthe other hand, given the recent pace of technology, innovation, and the rollout of more efficient products in the \nbusiness data services market, we are confident that competition will continue to grow in competitive\n\n 371 Sprint Comments at 36-37; see also CCA Reply at 21 n. 83; GCI Reply at 13; TDS Metrocom Reply at 3, 9-10, \n12;\n\n 372 See, e.g., Birch et al.

As a result, we find that the cost of reapplying the competitive market test for nearly 2,000 counties \nalready treated as competitive would outweigh the benefit, if any. We thus decide we can achieve our objectives of \nadopting an administratively efficient process to update the competitive market test by reducing the number of \ncounties subject to retesting. We shall update our test calculations only for the non-competitive counties to \ndetermine whether customers in these locations are benefitting from competition. Consistent with this approach, \nonce a county is treated as competitive, it will not be retested.\n\n E. Altering Business Data Services Forbearance\n\n 147. Prior forbearance actions and deemed grants have created a situation in which the statutory provisions and \nrules that apply to a price cap incumbent LEC or a competitive LEC in its provision of business data services vary \ndepending on the provider\u2019s identity and the specific services being provided. We expand upon and adjust these \nprior actions and deemed grants to the extent necessary to level the regulatory playing field for all of these business \ndata services providers. We also amend our rules as appropriate to implement our light-touch regulatory \nframework for business data services. These actions flow from\u2014and are consistent with\u2014our findings above on \nthe intense and growing competition in business data services.\n\n 148. Our actions expanding forbearance are taken pursuant to section 10 of the Communications Act. That \nprovision, enacted as an integral part of the \u201cpro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework\u201d established \nin the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act),376 requires that the Commission forbear from applying any \nprovision of the Act, or any of the Commission\u2019s regulations, if the Commission makes certain findings with respect \nto such provisions or regulations.377 Under section 10(a), the Commission is required to forbear from any such \nprovision or regulation if it determines that (1) enforcement of the provision or regulation is not necessary to ensure \nthe telecommunications carrier\u2019s charges, practices, classifications, or regulations are just, reasonable, and not \nunjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; (2) enforcement of the provision or regulation is not necessary to protect \nconsumers; and (3) forbearance is consistent with the public interest.378 In making this public interest \ndetermination, the Commission must also consider, pursuant to section 10(b), \u201cwhether forbearance from enforcing \nthe provision or regulation will promote competitive market conditions.\u201d379\n\n 1. Detariffing of Packet-based Services and Circuit-based Services Above the DS3 Bandwidth Level\n\n 149. We forbear from the application of section 203 of the Communications Act to each price cap LEC in its \nprovision of any packet-based business data services or circuit-based business data services above the DS3 \n\n\n\nbandwidth level.380 This action expands upon prior forbearance grants and deemed grants applicable only to \ncertain carriers and certain packet-based and circuit-based business data services.\n\n 376 Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference, S.

In 2006, Verizon\u2019s Broadband Forbearance Petition was deemed granted by operation of law after the \nCommission did not act on it within the statutory time limit.381 That petition had sought forbearance from the \napplication of Title II common carrier and Computer Inquiry requirements to \u201call broadband services\u201d that Verizon \n\u201cdoes or may offer . . . .\u201d382 But Verizon had subsequently narrowed the scope of its forbearance request to \nexclude DS1 and DS3 services.383 Following this deemed grant, AT&T, legacy Embarq, legacy Frontier, Qwest, \nand ACS filed petitions requesting similar forbearance relief.384 The Commission granted these petitions in part, \nfinding that forbearance from the application of dominant carrier regulation, including tariffing under section 203, to \nthe petitioning incumbent LECs\u2019 then existing packet-based and optical transmission broadband data services met \nthe statutory forbearance criteria.385 These partial grants reflected the Commission\u2019s predictive judgment that, in \ncomparison to traditional dominant carrier regulation and for the carriers\u2019 and services being addressed, \n\u201celiminating the extra layer\u201d of regulation provided by tariffing and the Commission\u2019s ex ante pricing rules, \u201cwhile \nleaving in place basic Title II common-carrier regulation\u201d under sections 201, 202, and 208, \u201cwill better promote \ncompetition and the public interest.\u201d386 The record here confirms this predictive judgment and supports expanding \nthe prior forbearance to include additional carriers and services.\n\n 151. Currently the vast majority of business data services providers are not subject to section 203 in their \nprovision of business data services\u2014non-incumbent LECs are not required to comply with tariffing requirements, \nnor are the price cap incumbent LECs that have received forbearance to the extent they provide services within the \nscope of the forbearance grants and deemed grants.387 We find that the lack of regulatory parity that stems from \nthe prior applications of forbearance is preventing competition and holding back our efforts to \u2018\u201cencourage the \ndeployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans.\u2019\u201d388 \nThus, our determination is based on \u2018\u201cwhat the\n\n 381 See Verizon News Release.\n\n 382 Verizon Forbearance Petition at 1-2.\n\n 383 Letter from Edward Shakin, Vice President and Associate General Counsel, Verizon, to Marlene H.

FCC, 462 F.3d 1, 8-9 (D.C.

Extending forbearance from \ntariffing will lead to regulatory parity, and a more level playing field among packet-based and optical transmission \nbusiness data services providers.\n\n 152. We further conclude that disparate forbearance treatment of carriers providing the same or similar services is \nnot in the public interest as it creates distortions in the marketplace that may harm consumers.391 Allowing such \ndisparate application of our tariffing requirements undermines, rather that promotes, competition among \ntelecommunications services providers within the meaning of section 10(b).\n\n 153. We predict that competition in the business data services market, along with the statutory and regulatory \nrequirements that remain, is sufficient to ensure just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory \n\n\n\nrates, terms, and conditions by business data services providers and to protect business data services \nconsumers. We therefore find that application of section 203 is not necessary within the meaning of sections \n10(a)(1) and 10(a)(2).392 Those same considerations, plus our desire to promote competition and broadband \ndeployment, likewise persuade us that such forbearance is in the public interest. Therefore, consistent with the \nCommission\u2019s prior findings, we find that forbearing from these regulations in an equal manner is consistent with the \npublic interest within the meaning of section 10(a)(3).393\n\n 2. Detariffing of Other Special Access Services\n\n 154. We also forbear from the application of section 203 to each price cap incumbent LEC in its provision of \nbusiness data services elements that comprise transport pursuant to section 69.709(4) of the Commission\u2019s rules, \nand to DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations services and any other special access services currently \ntariffed in competitive counties or in non-competitive counties previously subject to Phase II pricing flexibility.\n\n 155. The Commission has previously recognized that \u201ctariffs originally were required to protect consumers from \nunjust, unreasonable, and discriminatory rates in a virtually monopolistic market,\n\n 389 Petition of AT&T Inc.

Where a price cap LEC provides these services in competitive markets, application of section \n203, including its tariffing requirement, is not necessary to ensure that the LEC\u2019s charges, practices, classifications, \n\n\n\nor regulations are just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Nor is application of section \n203 necessary to protect consumers.\n\n 156. We recognize that in some discrete geographic areas, including portions of non-competitive counties \npreviously subject to Phase II pricing flexibility, some customers may not have access to competitive transport \nservices during the near-term. Similarly, in some portions of the counties that we classify as competitive, some end \nusers may not have viable alternatives to the incumbent LEC\u2019s DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations \nservices and other special access services within that time frame. But even in these areas, we believe tariffing \nmay reduce incentives for competitive entry and ultimately inhibit growth in the market and competition over the \nlonger term. Additionally, price cap LECs will remain subject to sections 201 and 202, and to our enforcement of \nthose provisions through the section 208 complaint process. In these circumstances, we find that the additional \ncontribution that tariffing\u2014and other ex ante regulation\u2014of price cap LECs\u2019 special access services provides to \nprotection against unjust, unreasonable, and unreasonably discriminatory rates, terms, and conditions is not \nnecessary within the meaning of sections 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(2).\n\n 157. Those same considerations, plus our desire to promote competition and business data services deployment, \nlikewise persuade us that forbearance is in the public interest. In competitive markets, tariffing has several adverse \nconsequences, including reducing a carrier\u2019s incentives to offer price discounts and ability to respond quickly to \nchanges in demand or costs, delaying and increasing the costs of innovation, and preventing a carrier from tailoring \nservice arrangements to meet its customers\u2019 specific needs.395 Tariffing also imposes significant administrative \ncosts on carriers and the Commission, and ultimately inhibits competitive entry in discrete areas where a price cap \nLEC currently may be the only provider. Given these costs, we find that forbearance from the application of section \n203 to price cap LECs\u2019 business data services elements that comprise transport pursuant to section 69.709(4), and \nto DS1 and DS3 end user channel termination and any other tariffed special access services in competitive \ncounties, is consistent with the public interest within the meaning of section 10(a)(3). We note that the record was \nsupportive of detariffing services in competitive markets.396\n\n 158. A small number of counties that had been regulated under Phase II pricing are now deemed non-competitive \npursuant to our competitive market test. Incumbent LECs in these counties have been providing DS1 and DS3 end \nuser channel termination and other special access services free of price cap, but not tariffing, regulation. Like we \ndo for other services, we conclude that tariffing\u2019s costs generally outweigh its benefits to consumers, and that \nforbearance from the application of section 203 to DS1 and DS3 end user channel termination and other tariffed \nspecial access services in these counties is consistent with the public interest.\n\n 394 AT&T Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 18724, n.124\n\n 395 See, e.g., Policy and Rules Concerning the Interstate, Interexchange Marketplace, CC Docket No. 96-61, \nSecond Report and Order, 11 FCC Rcd 20730, 20671, para. 53 (1996).\n\n 396 See, e.g., NCTA Reply at 9; CenturyLink Reply at 51. But see NASUCA Comments at 10 (arguing that the \nconditions found to justify the prior forbearance for business data services \u201cno longer obtain (if they ever actually \ndid).\u201d); see also NASUCA Comments at 7 (urging the Commission to use caution in further forbearance, \u201cexcept for \nforbearance from tariffing,\u201d as long as public disclosures are mandated; NASUCA Reply at 17.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 68\n\n\n\n 159. In contrast, we conclude it is not practical to detariff carriers that are now subject to\u2014and will remain subject \nto\u2014price cap regulation, where the tariff is the tool the Commission has used\u2014and will continue to use\u2014to enforce \nthat regulation.397 This is not a concern with the counties now subject to Phase II pricing where the incumbent LEC \nhas not been subject to price cap regulation and, as we decide below, will not be subject to such regulation going-\nforward.\n\n 3. Detariffing Will Be Mandatory After a Transition\n\n 160. Our detariffing actions in this Order will be mandatory after a transition that will provide price cap incumbent \nLECs sufficient time to adapt their business data services operations to a detariffing regime. We also require that \ncompetitive LECs, which are currently subject to a permissive detariffing regime,398 detariff their business data \nservices by the end of this transition.\n\n 161. The transition will begin on the date of Federal Register publication of notice of this Order and will end \neighteen months thereafter, a period that we find sufficient for carriers to adapt to a detariffing regime. During this \ntransition, tariffing for these services will be permissive\u2014the Commission will accept new tariffs and revisions to \nexisting tariffs for the affected services. This will allow carriers to respond to competitive pressures and introduce \nnew business data services as they adapt to detariffing. Incumbent LECs will be subject to the rules adopted in the \nOrder to the extent they tariff affected business data services during the transition.\n\n 162. Carriers, including non-incumbent LECs, may remove the relevant portions of their tariffs for the affected \nservices at any time during the transition. Once the transition ends, no price cap incumbent LEC or competitive \nLEC may file or maintain any interstate tariffs for affected business data services. This will prevent carriers from \nobtaining \u201cdeemed lawful\u201d status for tariff filings that are not accompanied by cost support and invoking the filed-\nrate doctrine in contractual disputes with customers.399 Business data services providers will also be prevented \nfrom picking and choosing when they are able to invoke the protections of tariffs.400\n\n 163. We recognize that our detariffing actions will change the legal framework for existing service arrangements \nfor business data services, many of which assume a tariffing environment and may not expire until after the end of \nthe transition to mandatory detariffing. We do not intend our actions to disturb existing contractual or other long-\nterm arrangements\u2014a contract tariff remains a contract even if it is no longer tariffed.\n\n 4. Verizon Deemed Grant\n\n 164. In this section of the Order, we conform the forbearance provided to Verizon and its successors in interest, \nHawaiian Telcom, and the legacy Verizon portions of FairPoint and Frontier (together the Verizon Legacy \nCompanies), to the forbearance provided other price cap carriers.

REGULATION IN NON-COMPETITIVE COUNTIES\n\n 171. We now turn to the question of what ex ante regulation, if any, we should apply to special access services in \ncounties that are classified as non-competitive pursuant to our competitive market test. To ensure affordability of \nDS1 and DS3 services without unnecessarily constraining incumbent LECs\u2019 incentives to invest and innovate, we \nwill apply price cap regulation in the form of Phase I pricing flexibility (Phase I pricing) to DS1 and DS3 end user \nchannel terminations provided by incumbent LECs in counties that we determine are non-competitive. Allowing \nPhase I pricing will enable incumbent LECs to timely and effectively respond to any competition that develops in \nthese markets though contract tariffs and volume and term discounts. We also prohibit the use of overly restrictive \nnon-disclosure agreements in contract tariffs for business data services sold in non-competitive areas.\n\n 425 See, e.g., AT&T Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 18739, para. 72; Embarq/Frontier Forbearance Order, 22 \nFCC Rcd at 19509-510, para. 64; Qwest Forbearance Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 12293, para. 69; see also 2011 \nReverse Forbearance Petition at 3.\n\n 426 AT&T Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 18741, para. 75; Embarq/Frontier Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd \nat 19511, para. 67; Qwest Forbearance Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 12294, para. 72.\n\n 427 See, e.g., AT&T Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 18738, para. 68; Qwest Forbearance Order, 23 FCC Rcd \nat 12292, para. 65; see also Sprint WC Docket No. 11-188 Reply at 13; 2011 Reverse Forbearance Petition at 23.\n\n 428 See AT&T Forbearance Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 18738-39, paras. 68, 70; Embarq/Frontier Forbearance Order, \n22 FCC Rcd at 19508-09, paras. 60, 62; Qwest Forbearance Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 12292-93, paras. 65, 67.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 73\n\n A. Retaining Price Cap Regulation in Non-Competitive Counties\n\n 172. We conclude that, subject to the exception discussed below, we should continue to apply price cap regulation, \nas modified in this Order, to price cap LECs\u2019 DS1 and DS3 end user-channel terminations in non-competitive \ncounties to ensure the rates, terms and conditions for such services are just and reasonable.429 We agree with \nthe commenters\u2014including Verizon, INCOMPAS, Sprint, Windstream, Ad Hoc, Birch et al., NASUCA, and Public \nKnowledge\u2014that argue that price cap regulation is the most effective regime for ensuring that rates for non-\ncompetitive services are just and reasonable.430 The price cap system, as modified by the measures we adopt in \nthis proceeding, will limit the extent to which price cap LECs can exercise their market power over the rates for \nTDM-based end user channel terminations in non-competitive counties.\n\n 173. When properly applied, price cap regulation replicates some of the beneficial incentives of competition in the \nprovision of business data services while balancing ratepayer and stockholder interests.431 Price caps encourage \nLECs to become more productive and innovative by permitting them to retain reasonably higher earnings while \ndiscouraging wasteful investment.432 At the same time, price cap regulation offers regulated firms flexibility in \n\n\n\nsetting relative prices, instead of relying on uniformed regulatory direction.433 In sum, price cap regulation helps \nensure just and reasonable prices for customers in non-competitive markets while affording providers good \nincentives to reduce costs and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments.434\n\n 174. We do not, however, require incumbent LECs to reinstitute price caps in non-competitive counties that are \nwithin former Phase II pricing areas because we find that the costs of doing so exceed the benefits as described \nabove. Incumbent LECs in these counties have been providing DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations free of \nprice cap regulation for a number of years and have adapted their internal systems accordingly. Bringing these \nservices back into price caps would require that incumbent LECs revamp their billing, information technology, and \nthird-party management systems, at significant cost.435 Additionally, reinstituting price cap regulation would require \nthe carrier to recreate what the price cap would be had it never received pricing flexibility, which would involve \nburdensome and complicated calculations. According to the 2015 Collection, only 98 counties in former Phase II \npricing areas are deemed non-competitive pursuant to our competitive market test, and these counties collectively \nhave only [BEGIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] [END HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL] buildings\n\n 429 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201.\n\n 430 See, e.g., Birch et al.

We find that the costs \nof reinstituting price caps in these counties outweigh the potential benefits.436\n\n 175. To encourage competitive entry into the counties we have identified as non-competitive, we will not apply \nprice cap regulation to DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations provided by non-incumbent LECs. When a \n\n\n\nnon-incumbent LEC provides DS1 or DS3 services in a non-competitive market, it typically does so in competition \nwith an incumbent LEC that enjoys marketplace advantages, including a ubiquitous network and significant \neconomies of scale. Extending price cap regulation to non-incumbent LECs would impose significant costs while \ngenerating few, if any, benefits.437 These costs would include administrative compliance costs that, by their very \nnature, would reduce the amount of capital available for the non-incumbent to upgrade its network and expand its \nbusiness data services footprint to additional locations within the non-competitive county.438 Of greater concern, \nsuch regulation would reduce the non-incumbent\u2019s capacity to efficiently set prices and increase its exposure to \nregulatory risk, further leading to less competitive entry and investment. And, any benefits would be minimal since \nthe incumbent LEC\u2019s price cap rates typically will set a ceiling on the rates the non-incumbent can charge for its \nDS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations.\n\n B. Expanding Pricing Flexibility in Non-Competitive Counties\n\n 176. In 1999, the Commission established a process for granting price cap LECs pricing flexibility for special \naccess services when specified regulatory triggers were satisfied.439 The pricing flexibility framework separates \nspecial access services into two segments, end user channel terminations and dedicated transport and special \naccess services other than end user channel terminations, and provides two levels of pricing flexibility relief for \neach segment.440 Phase I relief gives price cap LECs the ability to lower their rates through contract tariffs and \nvolume and term discounts, but requires that price cap LECs maintain their generally available price cap-\nconstrained tariff rates to \u201cprotect[ ] those customers that lack competitive alternatives.\u201d441 Phase II relief permits a \nprice cap LEC to raise or lower its rates throughout an area, unconstrained by price cap regulations.442\n\n 177. Business data services remaining within price caps after this Order will consist largely of incumbent LECs\u2019 \nDS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations in non-competitive counties, but will also include various other price \ncap services that carriers decide to keep regulated pursuant to price caps during the transition to mandatory \ndetariffing. Consistent with the proposal the Commission made in the Further Notice, we transition all business data \nservices that remain subject to price caps into Phase I pricing. This will provide price cap LECs with flexibility while \nprecluding them from charging above-cap rates in non-competitive counties.443 Price cap LECs in non-competitive \nareas will be able to\n\n 436 See CenturyLink Sept. 28, 2016 Ex Parte (arguing that the Commission has often underestimated how long \nimplementation of complicated regulatory transformations actually take, using the example of the Universal Service \nFund to Connect America Fund transition).\n\n 437 NCTA Reply, Reply Declaration of Michael L.

The record is clear that contract tariffs benefit both customers and price cap LECs.445 As Ad Hoc observes, \nPhase I pricing flexibility allows price cap LECs to respond to competition by negotiating lower contract rates.446 \nThis flexibility, when coupled with our requirement that price cap LECs choosing to exercise Phase I pricing \nflexibility remove contract revenues from the relevant price caps basket for purposes of determining their price cap \nindices and actual price indices, will protect customers that do not negotiate contract tariffs from cross-subsidizing \nthose that do.447 And the requirement that carriers maintain generally available price cap-constrained tariff rates \nwill \u201cprotect those customers that lack competitive alternatives\u201d against unreasonably high rates.448 We therefore \namend our price cap rules to allow all price cap LECs in non-competitive counties to lower their rates through \ncontract tariffs and volume and term discounts in a manner consistent with the Commission\u2019s current Phase I \npricing flexibility rules. Accordingly, these incumbent LECs will be required to maintain generally available tariffs \noffering price cap regulated rates available to all subscribers.\n\n 179. These requirements will not apply to counties within former Phase II pricing areas that are deemed non-\ncompetitive pursuant to our competitive market test. Instead, price cap LECs in these counties will be required to \ncontinue offering generally available rates for end user DS1 and DS3 channel terminations, and for the other \nspecial access services will remain subject to price cap regulation in other non-competitive counties, as long as \nthose services remain under tariff. This requirement will cease once the services are detariffed.\n\n C. Prohibiting Nondisclosure Agreements in Non-Competitive Areas\n\n 180. In order to ensure that purchasers of business data services can fully participate in Commission proceedings \nand that the Commission can conduct appropriate oversight of business data services, we adopt a rule prohibiting \nthe use of non-disclosure agreements in tariffs, contract tariffs, and commercial agreements for business data \nservices provided in non-competitive areas that forbid or restrict disclosure of information to the Commission. In the \ninterest of protecting sensitive information, a provider may require that information related to its business data \nservices be submitted to the Commission subject to a Commission protective order or, if there is none, with a \nrequest for confidential treatment pursuant to the Commission\u2019s rules.\n\n 181. We agree with commenters that argue that non-disclosure agreements affecting the\n\n 444 Contract tariffs may be filed on one day\u2019s notice. 47 CFR \u00a7 61.58(c).\n\n 445 See, e.g., Verizon Reply at 11 (arguing that Phase I pricing has benefited consumers and competition through \ncontract tariffs which lower prices and bring other benefits to consumers); Hawaiian Telcom Reply at 4 (contending \nthat pricing flexibility, including contract tariffs, has been \u201cenormously favorable to business and carrier customers\u201d).\n\n\n\n 446 Ad Hoc Comments at 15; see ACS Comments at 13-14 (arguing that pricing flexibility has helped the business \ndata services market in Alaska to flourish); Hawaiian Telcom Comments at 5 (asserting that volume and term \ndiscounts, contract tariffs, elimination of price cap rate structures, and short-notice tariff filings have benefitted \nbusiness and carrier customers); Sprint Comments at 62 (recognizing that customers benefit from individually-\nnegotiated contracts).\n\n 447 Ad Hoc Comments at 15.\n\n 448 See Letter from Thomas Jones, Counsel to Level 3 Communications, to Marlene H.

We find misplaced AT&T\u2019s assertion that the Commission fails \u201cto identify a single instance where it has \nactually requested a contract pertaining to BDS and the parties refused to provide it.\u201d453 To the contrary, the record \ndemonstrates that the risks of inhibiting the flow of information about the business data services market to the \nCommission are real and have at times impacted the conduct of this proceeding.454 Indeed, as the Commission \nobserved in the Further Notice, non-disclosure agreements likely precluded some parties from responding fully to \nthe voluntary data requests issued by the Bureau in 2010 and 2011, contributing to delay in analyzing and resolving \nthe questions at issue in this proceeding.455 Parties acknowledged that non-disclosure agreements had this \neffect.456 Moreover, it is not the instances where the Commission has sought information and been denied that are \nour chief concern, but rather the instances where the Commission has been unaware of potentially important \ninformation about the business data services market and stakeholders have been precluded by non-disclosure \nagreements from sharing that information in the first place.\n\n 183. AT&T also expresses concern that public release of information subject to a non-disclosure agreement will \nresult in \u201csignificant competitive harm.\u201d457 Disclosure to the Commission, however, is clearly distinguishable from \ndisclosure to the public generally. We routinely adopt protective orders to protect parties\u2019 interests in maintaining \nthe confidential nature of information submitted.458 As\n\n 449 See, e.g., Birch et al.

We agree with commenters that recognize that the solution for concerns about inappropriate disclosure of \nsensitive information submitted to the Commission is to ensure such information is submitted subject to a protective \norder or to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to the Commission\u2019s rules.460 We conclude that because \nthe information in question will not be made generally available to the public, our action here does not undermine \nparties\u2019 interest in insulating confidential or commercially sensitive information from the public. We therefore require \nthat parties submitting to the Commission confidential information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement \nseek confidential treatment of that information under the relevant protective orders, or otherwise pursuant to the \nCommission\u2019s rules.\n\n 185. We address two types of restrictions non-disclosure agreements impose and determine that both are \nprecluded by the action we take here. First, we find that there is no justification for non-disclosure agreements that \ncontain provisions that prohibit outright the disclosure of confidential information to the Commission. Such \nagreements are expressly intended to obstruct parties\u2019 ability to disclose information to the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s ability to access information necessary to oversee and evaluate the business data services market. \n\n\n\nThey undermine our ability to render fact-based decisions informed by a complete record, and are generally \ncontrary to the public interest.\n\n 186. We also find that non-disclosure agreements that require a direct request or legal compulsion prior to allowing \ndisclosure also inhibit the Commission\u2019s conduct of its core regulatory and oversight functions and are therefore \ncontrary to the public interest. By precluding the voluntary disclosure of information, such agreements render it \nimpossible for the Commission to be aware of information in business data services sales agreements or even the \nexistence of such sales agreements, and effectively preclude the Commission\u2019s ability to seek that information or \nthose sales agreements.\n\n 187. Allowing voluntary disclosure to the Commission, subject to the Commission\u2019s protections for confidential \ninformation where necessary, will allow parties to disclose relevant information in a more timely fashion, which will \nin turn make the Commission\u2019s oversight and regulatory work more timely and efficient. The Commission\u2019s \nprotective orders and confidentiality regulations will effectively insulate against the risk of inappropriate disclosure \nby ensuring confidential treatment of such information.\n\n 188. We agree with commenters that argue that restrictions on non-disclosure agreements for business data \nservices are unnecessary in markets treated as competitive under the competitive market test. In these areas, \nmarket forces should be sufficient to protect purchasers of business data services from unreasonable \npractices.461 NASUCA asserts, however, that prohibiting overly restrictive non-disclosure agreements is necessary \nto facilitate competitive conditions in the BDS marketplace generally.462 We agree that imposing a prohibition on \nsuch non-disclosure agreements will foster\n\n 459 Level 3 Reply at 10-11.\n\n 460 TDS Metrocom Comments at 25; Windstream Comments at 79; Sprint Comments at 85.\n\n 461 See USTelecom Comments at 27; see also AT&T Comments at 81.\n\n 462 See, e.g., NASUCA Comments at 30 (\u201cEssentially by definition, services in competitive markets do not require \nregulatory control over pricing: The competition itself is assumed to ensure that rates are just and reasonable. As\n\n (continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 78\n\n competitive conditions in areas that our data show are not yet competitive. We do not, however, see a need to \nimpose this prohibition in competitive areas. In those areas, the Commission will still have access to relevant \nindustry data through mandatory requests or data collections if needed. We therefore limit our restrictions on \nbusiness data services-related non-disclosure agreements to those that apply to non-competitive areas as we \ndefine them in this Order. This reasoning applies to all non-disclosure agreements that govern business data \nservices sales \u2013 whether they are contained in tariffs, contract tariffs, or commercial agreements. The presumption \nshould be that competitive market dynamics would characterize the majority of sales in any arrangements that \ngoverned sales in both types of areas. Additionally, the bulk of sales of TDM based business data services in non-\ncompetitive areas would presumably be effected through TDM-only tariffs and contract tariffs. Parties are of course \n\n\n\nfree to structure their sales arrangements in such a manner as to avoid including sales of services for both types of \nareas in a single agreement.\n\n 189. Accordingly, we adopt a general rule prohibiting the use of non-disclosure agreements in or related to tariffs or \ncontract tariffs for the sale of business data services in areas treated as non-competitive by our competitive market \ntest to the extent they forbid or impose any restriction on a party\u2019s ability to voluntarily disclose information to the \nCommission pursuant to appropriate safeguards for confidential information. No provider of business data services \nin areas treated as non-competitive may enter into or enforce a non-disclosure agreement that in any way forbids or \nprevents any party to that agreement from disclosing any information relevant to the Commission\u2019s business data \nservices proceedings to the Commission. The rule we adopt today applies to all forms of agreements for the sale of \nTDM-based business data services, including price cap tariffs and contract tariffs in non-competitive areas. Parties \nsubmitting confidential information to the Commission that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement must either \nsubmit such information subject to the relevant protective orders governing this proceeding or, in the absence of a \nrelevant protective order, seek confidential treatment for such information pursuant to sections 0.457 and 0.459 of \nthe Commission\u2019s rules.463\n\n D. Adjustments to Price Cap Levels\n\n 190. Pursuant to the framework adopted in this Order, the primary services that will remain under price cap \nregulation will be the DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations that incumbent LECs provide in non-competitive \ncounties. To help ensure just and reasonable rates for these services, we adopt an X-factor of 2.0 percent that \nreflects our best estimate of the productivity growth that incumbent LECs will experience in the provision of these \nservices relative to productivity growth in the overall economy.464 We retain Gross Domestic Product-Price Index \n(GDP-PI) as the measure of inflation that incumbent LECs will use in their price cap index calculations, continue to \nmake a low-end adjustment available to price cap LECs in certain circumstances, and decline to adopt other \nchanges that would affect price cap rates. In particular, we find that that no catch-up adjustment to the price cap \nindices is warranted.

The core component of the Commission\u2019s price cap system is the price cap index, which is designed to limit \nthe prices that a price cap LEC may charge for services.465 Each price cap LEC\u2019s price cap index historically has \nbeen adjusted annually based primarily on a productivity factor or \u201cX-factor\u201d and a measure of inflation (GDP-PI). \nThe X-factor initially represented the amount by which LECs could be expected to outperform economy-wide \n\n\n\nproductivity gains.466 The X-factor serves as an adjustment to the price cap indices to account for these \nproductivity gains, and is subtracted from GDP-PI in the Commission\u2019s price cap formula.467\n\n 192. The Commission last set X-factors for special access services in the 2000 CALLS Order.468 These X-\nfactors, unlike prior X-factors, were not productivity-based but collectively acted as \u201ca transitional mechanism . . . to \nlower rates for a specified time period\u201d based on an industry agreement.469 The CALLS X-factor for special access \nservices increased from 3.0 percent in 2000 to 6.5 percent for 2001 through 2003 but was set equal to inflation \nbeginning in 2004.470 This frozen X-factor was intended to be an interim measure, lasting only until the expiration \nof the CALLS plan on June 30, 2005, yet the Commission has not acted to replace it with a productivity-based \nmeasure. As a result, price cap LECs\u2019 special access rates have remained frozen at 2003 levels, excluding any \nnecessary exogenous cost adjustments.471\n\n 2. Adopting a Productivity-based X-factor\n\n 193. The Commission\u2019s price cap system has been running on autopilot since June 30, 2005, with no analysis as \nto why rate levels from 2003 might have remained reasonable despite widespread changes in the business data \nservices marketplace. We end this freeze by replacing the CALLS era frozen X-factor with a productivity-based X-\nfactor.\n\n 194. Our analysis includes several steps. We begin by deciding to use a total factor productivity (TFP) \nmethodology in calculating business data services productivity gains or losses relative to growth in the general \neconomy. We then decide to use the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Capital, Labor, Energy, Materials, and \nServices data for the broadcasting and telecommunications industries (KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications)) in applying our methodology. We use KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data \nto establish a zone of reasonable X-factor estimates.

The Commission hoped that, by the end of the five-year CALLS plan, competition would exist to such a \ndegree that deregulation of access charges (switched and special) for price cap LECs would be the next logical \nstep. CALLS Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 12977, para. 35.\n\n\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 80\n\n that zone, we select an X-factor of 2.0 percent. Price cap LECs will apply this X-factor annually to help ensure that \ntheir price cap indices incorporate future productivity growth.472\n\n a. Selecting a Methodology for Calculating Productivity Gains or Losses\n\n 195. A price cap is intended to mimic competitive-market outcomes. One aspect of a competitive market is that \noutput price growth over time matches the difference between industry input price growth and industry productivity \ngrowth. Another aspect of a competitive market is strong cost-reduction and investment incentives. A price cap that \ngrows at a rate equal to the difference between the growth rate of input prices and industry productivity growth \nmight, at least initially, hold prices to competitive levels, but if it were frequently updated on the basis of the \nregulated firms\u2019 behavior, quickly taking away any additional profits obtained either by implementing productivity \nincreases or by negotiating lower input prices, the regulated firms would have little incentive to invest in cost and \ninput price reduction. Consequently, in the Further Notice, the Commission proposed to use a proxy for the \ndifference between the growth rate of input prices and industry productivity growth in setting allowed price growth \nunder the cap.473 That proxy is a measure of the economy-wide rate of inflation, based on a national price index \n(i.e., GDP-PI), that is adjusted, through an infrequently updated X-factor chosen to account for systematic \ndifferences between the growth rates of national prices and the difference between telecommunications industry \ninput price growth and industry productivity growth. This proxy approach provides regulated firms with good \nincentives to reduce costs.\n\n 196. Under the approach outlined above, steps that a firm takes to lower its costs will not immediately affect the \nprice cap. To see why, note that the price cap is adjusted based on two quantities: the national rate of inflation \n(GDP-PI) and the X-factor. The firm\u2019s cost-lowering actions will have, at most, a negligible effect on the national \ninflation rate. As for the X-factor, while the regulator periodically will assess the extent to which the regulated firms \nhave lowered their costs (and thus might adjust the X-factor and price cap accordingly), this process typically \noccurs with substantial delays. Between X-factor adjustments, firms can keep any additional profits that they \nachieve through cost reductions; hence, the price-cap regime provides material incentives for firms to reduce their \ncosts.474\n\n 197. In summary, our proposed approach is to estimate an X-factor to be subtracted from the annual change in the \nGDP-PI to determine the annual change, c, in the price cap index:\n\n (1)\n\n 472 In adopting an X-factor, we reject NASUCA\u2019s argument that the Commission should reinitialize price levels to \nlevels that would prevail in a competitive market \u201cbecause rates set under the existing \u2018frozen\u2019 price cap plan likely \nexceed those that would prevail in competitive markets. NASUCA Comments at 24-25; see also Ad Hoc Comments \nat 16; CFA et al. Reply at 12 n.20 (supporting reinitialization and contending that it will require cost studies). Not \nonly would reinitialization be incredibly burdensome, but as the Commission has previously observed, calls for \nreinitialization are a \u201cquarrel\u2026fundamentally with price cap regulation.\u201d See 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 FCC Rcd at \n6813, para. 221; Hawaiian Telcom Comments at 14 & nn.60-61 (citing Access Charge Reform et al., CC Docket \nNo. 96-262 et al., First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 15982, 16107, para. 291 (1997); 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 \nFCC Rcd at 6813, para. 221)).\n\n\n\n 473 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4872, para. 386 (proposing to continue to use GDP-PI as the inflation measure \nfor the price cap index formula).\n\n 474 Id. at 4876-77, paras. 404-05.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 81\n\n where\n\n is the economy-wide rate of inflation (i.e., the GDP-PI),\n\n is the projected difference between the economy-wide rate of inflation and the growth rate of industry input prices, \nand\n\n is the projected growth rate of the industry\u2019s productivity level.475 The X-factor, which is the sum of\n\n and\n\n , may be interpreted as a correction term by which the projected growth rates of economy-wide prices are adjusted \nto account for systematic differences between the broader economy and the regulated industry. Several \ncommenters agree that this approach is sound, no commenters oppose it, and we adopt it.476\n\n 198. In the past, the Commission has relied on staff studies of the historical total factor productivity (or TFP) growth \nrate of incumbent LECs to estimate future productivity growth.477 TFP is the relationship between the output of \ngoods and services to inputs,478 and is commonly used to measure productivity in the economy as a whole.479 \nTFP studies typically measure productivity using the ratio of an index of the outputs of a firm, industry, or group of \nindustries to an index of corresponding inputs. Productivity growth is measured by changes in this ratio over \ntime.480 In a TFP model, output is typically measured in terms of physical units (e.g., minutes or calls) of the good \nor service produced. In a case in which more than one good or service is supplied (i.e., there are multiple outputs), \na standard practice is to create an index (e.g., an average that weights by output revenue shares) that aggregates \nthe output levels.481 The resulting output index shows changes in the level of output over time; in other words, it \nprovides the growth rate of the measured output. Similarly, the growth rate of the aggregate input index depends on \nthe combined growth rates of the individual input indices\u2014such as indices for capital, labor, energy, materials and \nservices\u2014weighted, for example, by input expenditure shares.482\n\n 199. In the Further Notice, the Commission proposed to calculate the X-factor by subtracting from the historical \nrate of change in GDP-PI the historical rate of change in industry input prices and adding to it the historical rate of \nchange in industry TFP.483 The calculation can be expressed by the following formula:\n\n X = % \u0394 GDP-PI \u2013 % \u0394 Industry Input Prices + % \u0394 Industry TFP\n\n (2)\n\n 475 Id.; see infra Appx.

Having settled on a methodology for calculating the X-factor, we need to identify an appropriate data source. \nUpon review of the record, we find that KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) is the only reliable and \ninternally consistent dataset in the record for measuring incumbent LEC productivity and input prices.485 We select \nthat dataset for our X-factor calculations.\n\n (i) Available Data Sources\n\n 201. The KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) database was one of three datasets on which the \nCommission invited comment.486 The other two consist of: (a) data from the peer review process in connection \nwith the development of the Connect America Cost Model (CACM);487 and (b) those data in combination with cost \ndata that TDS Metrocom (TDS) submitted in this proceeding (CACM-TDS). All three datasets are described more \n\n\n\nfully in Appendix B. The Commission asked whether these datasets would provide a reasonable basis for \nestimating business data services productivity growth relative to growth in the general economy.488\n\n 202. The Commission also asked the parties to suggest adjustments to these datasets that might improve their \nutility as a measure of business data services productivity growth and requested that the parties suggest additional \ndatasets that might better balance precision with administrative feasibility.489 Only one party, Sprint, suggests an \nadditional dataset\u2014a version of KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) that purportedly is restricted to \ndata from the telecommunications industry (KLEMS (Telecommunications)).490 Sprint also suggests refinements to \nthe CACM dataset that, in Sprint\u2019s view, improve it.491 We discuss these datasets in turn.\n\n 484 See AT&T June 28, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 3-5; Letter from Russell P.

KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications). This dataset provides yearly industry-level measures of \ninput prices and total factor productivity. This dataset has many merits because, as commenters point out, it relies \non \u201cpublicly available, annual industry-level data on industry-level measures of input prices and total factor \nproductivity\u201d and was \u201cdeveloped using rigorous total factor productivity principles and is a valid source of \nmeasuring total factor productivity and input price trends for various industries.\u201d492 It also is \u201creliable and internally \nconsistent,\u201d493 and based on \u201cwell-accepted economic theory and publicly available data.\u201d494 But instead of being \nrestricted to business data services or wireline telecommunications, this dataset provides data for the broadcasting \nand telecommunications sectors, which collectively have annual revenues approximately twelve times those for \nbusiness data services.495 These sectors include broadcasting, cable television, and satellite television \ndistribution services, wireless telecommunications, mass market Internet access services, and the Voice-over-\nInternet Protocol (VoIP) industries, each of which has a cost structure and produces outputs different from the \nbusiness data services industry.496\n\n 204. The parties dispute the effect of this broad scope on BDS productivity growth estimates that are derived from \nthe KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) dataset. Ad Hoc and Sprint contend that this broad scope \ncreates a downward bias in those estimates.497 AT&T and CenturyLink maintain, however, that any bias would \noverstate BDS productivity growth relative to productivity growth in the overall economy.498 AT&T argues that \n\u201cwireless services, broadband Ethernet services, and cable and wireline Internet access services\u201d supply are \nmore productive than legacy DSn and that the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) dataset therefore \nmay overstate productivity growth for the TDM-based services to which the X-factor will apply.499 CenturyLink \nasserts that growth in labor (Continued from previous page)\n\n Letter); Letter from Dr. Chris Frentrup, Senior Economist, Sprint, to Marlene H.

CACM and CACM-TDS. The CACM and CACM-TDS datasets, even with the refinements suggested by \nSprint, are less than ideal. As explained more fully in Appendix B, the CACM dataset combines CostQuest cost \nshare data from the CACM peer review process with labor cost data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and \nreal estate price data from Moody\u2019s Investor Service and Real Capital Analytics. While this dataset provides a more \ndirect focus on business data services than KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) provides,501 we find \nit neither reliable nor internally consistent. 502 Sprint\u2019s refinements to this database do not cure these fundamental \nproblems.503 Both of these datasets rely in part on data from the CACM peer review process that was developed \nto determine the forward-looking economic costs of providing broadband Internet access services. Those data \nprovide at best a clumsy tool for determining historical total factor productivity growth for business data \nservices.504 In addition, as refined by Sprint,505 the CACM dataset includes company-specific data that we and \nthe parties to this proceeding are unable to fully evaluate and, therefore, may be unreliable.506 We therefore reject \nthe CACM dataset as well as that dataset as refined by Sprint as potential data sources for our X-factor \ncalculations.\n\n 206.

KLEMS (Telecommunications). To address, in part, the alleged overbreadth of the KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) dataset, Sprint proposes a dataset that purportedly excludes broadcasting industry data and \ntherefore, as asserted by Sprint, is preferable to KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) as a tool for \nmeasuring business data services productivity growth.509 The KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset, however, \nsuffers from many of the scope problems of the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) dataset with \nseveral additional problems. As an initial matter, excluding broadcasting data from the KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) dataset would reduce, but not eliminate, any overbreadth problem. And we are unable to \nverify Sprint\u2019s assertion that the KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset excludes broadcasting industry data.510 \nIndeed, AT&T and CenturyLink et al. make credible arguments that the KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset \n\u201ccomingle[s] broadcasting and telecommunications data.\u201d511 This uncertainty over which industries are reflected in \nthe KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset precludes any finding that it provides a more narrow focus on business \ndata services productivity growth than that provided by the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) \ndataset.512 We are unable to determine what methodology the European Union used to translate KLEMS \n(Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data into KLEMS (Telecommunications) data and whether that data \nsource is indeed restricted to telecommunications data.\n\n 208. Even if it does exclude broadcasting, the KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset is problematic for at least two \nadditional reasons. First, the KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset omits critical energy, non-energy materials, and \n\n\n\npurchased services inputs, which means that it provides only an incomplete picture of the industries within its \nscope. This incompleteness means that the dataset fails to capture historical total factor productivity growth.513 \nThe KLEMS (Telecommunications) dataset also provides a value-added, rather than a gross output measure of \nproductivity growth, which precludes an\n\n 507 See infra Appx.

We therefore reject this dataset as a \npotential data source for those calculations.515\n\n (ii) Selection of Data Source\n\n 209. None of the datasets before us allow us to estimate with precision business data services productivity growth \nrelative to growth in the general economy, and indeed of those datasets only KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) is reliable and internally consistent. In these circumstances, we conclude that the better \ncourse is for us to use that dataset to determine business data services productivity and input price growth, relative \nto economy-wide productivity and input price growth, rather than postponing that determination pending a search \nfor a better option. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, the Commission endeavors to find the best solutions but, at \ntimes, must settle for solutions that are \u201creasonable under difficult circumstances.\u201d516 The D.C. Circuit has noted:\n\nhttp://www.euklemsnet/data/nace2/USAsources12i.pdf);\n\n\n [W]hen an agency makes rational choices from among alternatives all of which are to some extent infirm because \nof a lack of concrete data, and has gone to great lengths to assemble the available facts, reveal its own doubts, \nrefine its approach, and reach a temporary conclusion, it has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously.517\n\n Here, where our X-factor decision provides only our \u201c\u2018tentative opinion\u2019 about the dividing line between reasonable \nand unreasonable rates for the limited purpose of exercising [our] suspension power\u201d under section 204 of the \nAct,518 we believe that we may properly rely on the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) dataset in our \nX-factor calculations. We now turn to those calculations.\n\n c. X-factor Calculations\n\n 210. We determine the productivity-based X-factor as follows. First, we use KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) data to develop a range of X-factors for four periods: 1987 to 2014; 1997 to 2014; 2005 to \n2014; and 2009 to 2014. Second, from this range of X-factors we develop a zone of reasonableness from which it \nwould be appropriate to select an X-factor. Third, we decide not to adjust that zone to compensate for KLEMS \n(Broadcasting and Telecommunications)\u2019s overbreadth. Finally, we select the X-factor from within this zone.\n\n 211. Data Periods. We use four different data periods to calculate four different X-factors to gauge the sensitivity of \nKLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications)-based calculations to different data periods and because there is \nno single, correct data period that we might use for this purpose. The\n\n 514 See AT&T Aug. 9, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 4-5.\n\n 515 See CenturyLink Aug. 9, 2016 Letter, Schankerman & R\u00e9gibeau Decl. at 8.\n\n 516 NARUC v.

We note that Sprint supports \nusing 1997 to 2014,519 and AT&T supports using 2009 to 2014.520\n\n 212. 1987 to 2014. This is the longest period for which KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data are \navailable. As the longest timeframe, this data period has the most observations and therefore collectively these \nobservations contain the most information. In particular, this period includes two complete business cycles.521 This \nis an advantage because productivity increases when the economy expands and decreases when the economy \n\n\n\ncontracts. Measuring productivity over at least one complete business cycle increases the likelihood that the results \nrepresent the future state of the economy. Two complete cycles might be preferred to one because no two business \ncycles are alike. One business cycle may not represent the future any better than the other.522\n\n 213. This period also includes a significant amount of time before and after the two business cycles. Using a \ntimeframe that includes the maximum period for which data are available minimizes the likelihood of an arbitrary \nchoice among many possible shorter periods within the longer period, given that there is no obviously correct \nchoice. The disadvantage of this time period is that the data from the earliest years in the period may be stale or \notherwise reflect economic conditions that are unlikely to persist into the future. The value of the most recent and \nmost relevant data within this time period might not be apparent if combined with older data that are stale and \nirrelevant.\n\n 214. 1997 to 2014. This period includes one complete business cycle.523 As discussed above, at least one \ncomplete business cycle should be included in the data on which a productivity study is based because productivity \nis procyclical. Sprint supports using 1997 to 2014 data instead of 2005 to 2014 data because the latter period \nlargely reflects the longest and deepest recession the U.S. has experienced since 1945.524 Sprint concludes that a \nlonger time period is therefore likely to provide a better estimate of future productivity growth.525 An additional \nreason to use this period, or one longer, is that the current economic expansion is 93-months-old, which is \nsignificantly longer than the 58-month average length of prior expansions going back to 1945. A shorter period may \ngive too much weight to a relatively long-period of expansion.

On the one hand, several \nparties argue that price cap LECs are realizing decreasing BDS per unit costs from the growth in packet-switched \nservices, such as Ethernet, as customers transition from TDM to packet-switched services.531 Other parties \nmaintain that price cap LECs have achieved little productivity growth relative to that in the overall economy and that \nthe DS1 and DS3 services that will be subject to price caps have not shared in any decrease in per unit costs.532\n\n 220. Cost-reducing growth is clearly occurring in price cap LECs\u2019 overall BDS operations. A significant portion of \nthe assets, particularly outside plant, used to provide DS1s and DS3s, are also used to provide higher bandwidth \ncircuit-based services or packet-based services, and vice versa. The more such sharing occurs (i.e., the more \ndemand density increases), the lower both the incremental and average cost of any service, and total factor \nproductivity increases. These cost reducing effects occur and apply to remaining DS1 and DS3 services, even \nwhen higher bandwidth circuit-based services or packet-switched services are substituted for them, so long as the \ntwo sets of services share costs.\n\n 221. Growth in providing higher bandwidth circuit-based services and packet-based services is outpacing \ndeclining DS1 and DS3 services, a trend that strongly suggests that overall unit costs will continue decreasing into \nthe foreseeable future. Price cap LECs are investing aggressively in modern packet-based telecommunications \nnetworks and services. AT&T, for example, announced that by the year 2020, 75 percent of its network will be \ncontrolled by software.533 AT&T disclosed in an annual report that it was \u201cfocused on building a modern network \narchitecture that will provide the highest efficiency and productivity in the industry\u201d and \u201c[t]o make that happen\u201d the \n\u201cbiggest [front] by far is transforming [AT&T\u2019s] network from hardware to software-centric\u201d which allows AT&T to \n\u201cdeliver the most network traffic at the lowest marginal cost in the industry.\u201d534 Verizon announced a software-\ndefined networking-based strategy \u201cto introduce new operational efficiencies and allow for the enablement of rapid \nand flexible service delivery to Verizon\u2019s customers.\u201d535\n\n 222.

Nor does the record make clear whether any overall trend in DS1 and DS3 productivity growth extends to the \nareas that will remain under price caps. These non-competitive areas have significantly less demand density than \nthe competitive areas that will no longer be subject to the price cap regime.541 The price cap LECs therefore may \nbe less likely to achieve the same gains in economies of scale in non-competitive areas than in competitive areas. \nWhether these gains would be higher or lower than elsewhere cannot be determined from the record. The price cap \nLECs\u2019 initial price cap indices (and consequently all changes to those indices) reflected the costs of serving all \nareas within those LECs\u2019 service territories.

The price cap LECs have not submitted the \ncompany-specific input price and output data that we would need to quantify this overstatement (and adjust the \nzone of reasonableness downward). We therefore make no such adjustment.\n\n 225. We reject Sprint\u2019s argument that we should adjust the zone of reasonableness upward to bring it into line with \nprior X-factor prescriptions, which were based on relatively narrow sets of data related almost exclusively to price \ncap LEC operations rather than broad datasets such as KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications). Sprint \npoints out that in the 1999 Price Cap Performance Review proceeding, Commission staff computed X-factors for \neach of the years 1986 through 1998 using price cap LEC-specific data that were significantly higher than the X-\nfactors that would have been computed using KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data.543 We find \nthat this comparison fails to account for differences between the task before the Commission in the 1999 Price Cap \nPerformance Review proceeding, which was to determine an X-factor for all special and switched access services \nto be provided by price cap LECs, and our task here of determining an X-factor only for those business data \nservices that price cap LECs will provide in non-competitive areas. 544\n\n e. Selection of X-factor\n\n\n\n 226. We conclude that we should select an X-factor below the top of the zone of reasonableness, 2.3 percent, in \norder to recognize the diminishing share DS1 and DS3 services have had, and will continue to have, of the overall \nbusiness data services market. Indeed, over the longer term, these services will be replaced by Ethernet services \nor other more advanced business data services made possible by the transition to IP-based services transmitted \nover fiber. As demand for DS1 and DS3 services continues to fall, the costs directly attributable to (in contrast to \nthe costs for assets shared between those services and packet-based services) maintaining this legacy \ntechnology, will begin to rise. For example, over time the volume of TDM equipment sales will fall to levels that \ndeny manufacturers economies of scale.545 Similarly, there will likely be additional costs associated with \nwarehousing, work programs, and maintaining expertise in TDM technology, while moving aggressively toward the \nwidespread deployment of Ethernet and other advanced technologies.\n\n 227. Requiring DS1 and DS3 rates to be reduced by percentages that ignore the transition from a legacy, TDM \ntechnology to an advanced technology could require the incumbent LECs to supply DS1s and DS3s at rates that do \nnot recover their costs, and that inefficiently incentivize businesses to rely on DS1 and DS3 services, rather than \nmore advanced business data services. Presumably, there are customers that will wish to continue to rely on a \nlegacy technology at least for a period of time even though a new technology is readily available because it is less \nexpensive on a net present basis for them to do so. In a competitive market, customers that continued to rely on a \nlegacy technology as a new technology begins to dominate the market would be charged higher prices if costs \ndirectly attributable to the old technology were rising. Our X-factor decision should incorporate this aspect of \ncompetitive markets.\n\n 543 See Sprint Oct. 20, 2016 Letter at 1-3 (comparing X-factors derived from price cap LEC-specific data with X-\nfactors derived from KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data, with the factors in the first group \nranging from 5.31 to 6.14 percent and the factors in the second group ranging from 1.20 to 1.81 percent depending \non the time period from which the underlying data are drawn); see 1999 Price Cap Performance Review FNPRM, \n14 FCC Rcd at 19748-83, Appx.

The lower-bound of the zone of reasonableness is 1.7 percent, a percentage based on data from 2009 to \n2014. While this percentage provides insight into the most-recent trends in productivity and input prices, it reflects \nonly a period of unusual macroeconomic expansion, as explained above. We find this period too short and too \nunrepresentative by itself to provide reliable insight into future business data services productivity growth. No party \nhas submitted an X-factor study or similar data-based analysis purporting to show that the X-factor should be lower \nthan 2.0 percent. AT&T\u2019s proposed X-factor, like our X-factors, reflect KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) data. AT&T used data for 2005 to 2014 in calculating its X-factor, a period for which the X-\nfactor is 2.0 percent. In these circumstances, we find that the X-factor we select should be above the lower bound \nof reasonableness.\n\n\n\n 229. As mentioned, the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data on which this zone of \nreasonableness is based is overly broad; and, although we think an upward bias more likely, we are unable to \nresolve the dispute among the parties as to whether this broad scope creates a downward or upward bias. Our \ninability on the record before us to quantify either the magnitude or the direction of this bias supports selection of \nthe average or the mid-point of the four X-factors, both of which are 2.0 percent. Taking all of these factors into \naccount, we prescribe an X-factor of 2.0 percent. This X-factor reasonably assigns weight to the four different X-\nfactors and accounts to the extent possible for the uncertain effects of bias in the overly-broad data.\n\n 3. Methodology for Setting Inflation Measure\n\n 230. We retain the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s (BEA\u2019s) chain-weighted GDP-\nPI as the measure of inflation that price cap LECs will use in their price cap index calculations. As a chain-weighted \nindex, GDP-PI captures economy-wide inflation over the medium-term and long-term comprehensively and \n\u201csignificantly more accurate[ly]\u201d than fixed-weighted indexes, which become unrepresentative after a few years of \nchange.546 We find no alternative measure of inflation that is as accurate as GDP-PI in the medium and long-term \nand that is not susceptible to carrier influence or manipulation. Accordingly, we retain GDP-PI as the inflation \nmeasure in our price cap formula.\n\n 4. No Catch-Up Adjustment Is Warranted\n\n 231. The price cap indices have been effectively frozen since the CALLS plan expired on June 30, 2005. We \nconclude that no catch-up adjustment to those indices is warranted.\n\n 232. We use KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data for 2005 to 2014 to determine whether a catch-\nup adjustment is warranted. Calculations based on those data will identify, to the extent possible on the record \nbefore us, changes not otherwise reflected in incumbent LEC industry productivity and input price growth, relative to \neconomy-wide productivity and input price growth, since the day after the CALLS plan expired (July 1, 2005).547 \nFirst, we use KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data to calculate compound annual rates of growth \nin broadcasting and telecommunications productivity and input prices, and then calculate the difference between \nthese two rates. Second, we grow the value of this annual difference over a 12-year, five-month period at the \ncompound annual rate of growth represented by the value itself to calculate the total difference between incumbent \nLEC productivity and input price growth over the period. This final number is the percentage\n\n 546 See CALLS Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 1038, para. 183; AT&T Reply at 81 (\u201cGDP-PI is the measure that the \nCommission has used since the inception of price caps. GDP-PI is preferable: \u2018because GDPPI comprehensively \namalgamates national productivity and input price growth, [and] there is no need to separately determine economy-\nwide total input price growth and economy-wide total factor productivity growth in the X factor calibration.\u2019\u201d) (quoting \nAT&T Aug. 9, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 6).\n\n 547 We decline to adopt any catch-up adjustment for the period prior to the expiration of the CALLS plan, as AT&T \nsuggests. See AT&T Comments at 64. Any such adjustment would reopen matters resolved in the CALLS Order. \nSee CALLS Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 13035, para. 175.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 93\n\n by which the baseline price cap levels would be adjusted, upward or downward, to accurately reflect\n\n\n\n productivity changes during the period since the CALLS plan expired. Finally, we evaluate whether we\n\n should adjust price cap levels by this catch-up factor.\n\n 233. We use KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data for 2005 to 2014 to\n\n estimate historical changes in levels of productivity and input prices for purposes of the catch-up\n\n calculation. The year 2014 is the most recent year for which KLEMS (Broadcasting and\n\n Telecommunications) data are available, and data are published only for calendar years. As we explain\n\n below, we adopt December 1, 2017 as the effective date for the going-forward X-factor. As we have no\n\n data for 2015 to November 2017, we extrapolate annual growth rates based on 2005 to 2014 data for an\n\n additional 35 months beyond the end of the data (i.e., for 2015, 2016, and 11 months of 2017), because\n\n mathematically it is simple, the period of extrapolation is relatively short, and there is no obviously\n\n superior method. We also assume that productivity and input price growth rates over the second half of\n\n 2005 were the same as over the entire year, again for simplicity and the lack of any obviously superior\n\n way to exclude the first six months of that year or reconcile the use of calendar-year data with an\n\n estimation period that reflects tariff years that begin on July 1.\n\n 234. KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) compound annual rates of growth in\n\n productivity and input prices for 2005 to 2014, and the difference (the potential catch-up factor) between\n\n these two rates of growth are set forth in Table 6 below. To calculate the potential catch-up factor, we\n\n grow the annual difference in the compound rates of growth over a 12-year, five-month period.\n\n Table 6. Potential Catch-up Adjustment for the Period from July 1, 2005 to November 30, 2017\n\n A B C = A - B (1 + C) ^ 12.417 - 1\n\n Data Period Industry Price index Industry Productivity Annual Difference Catch-up Adjustment\n\n 2005 - 2014 1.49% 1.60% -0.11% -1.40%\n\n Compound Annual Growth Rates\n\n\n\n Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis & Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n 235. We decline to require price cap LECs to implement a catch-up adjustment to baseline\n\n price cap levels. First, the annual difference between the KLEMS (Broadcasting and\n\n Telecommunications) industry price index and productivity is only -0.11 percent annually, which when\n\n compounded over a 12-year, five-month period results in only a -1.40 percent potential reduction in\n\n baseline price cap levels. This suggests that historical BDS productivity gains for the period 2005 to\n\n 2017 were almost exactly offset by inflation, which is what the X-factor has been set to since the\n\n expiration of the CALLS plan on June 30, 2005.548 Indeed, the annual and 12-year, five-month\n\n differences of -0.11 percent and -1.40 percent, respectively, are so small as to be well within the margin\n\n of error for our calculations. Any catch-up adjustment would apply only to lower bandwidth business\n\n data services, such as DS1s and DS3s, and only to the extent price cap LECs provide them within noncompetitive\n\n areas. We find it likely that productivity growth for these services in these areas lagged\n\n productivity growth for price cap LECs\u2019 business data services generally by at least 0.11 percent annually\n\n and 1.40 percent cumulatively between 2005 and 2017.549\n\n 548 See AT&T Oct. 25, 2016 Letter at 16-17.\n\n 549 See, e.g., AT&T Comments at 19 (citing Second IRW Paper at 7-17) (noting that \u201ccompetitors tend to enter in\n\n areas where prices will naturally be lower due to other conditions, such as favorable economic conditions (e.g.,\n\n lower costs and higher revenue opportunities\u201d); CenturyLink et al.

Two additional factors drive our determination not to adopt a potential catch-up adjustment. First, and most \nimportantly, the X-factors used during the CALLS plan itself were not productivity-based and the X-factors adopted \nbefore that were struck down by the D.C. Circuit. In other words, if we were going to adjust price caps to \u201ccatch up\u201d \nto productivity changes, there are compelling arguments that we could not stop at 2005 but might instead need to \nreturn to 2000 or even 1997\u2014with price caps increasing appreciably. Rather than seeking to determine the exact \npath of productivity over the past 20 years, we believe it more prudent to rely on existing price caps levels, which at \nleast have the benefit of minimizing potential rate shock to consumers. Second, we recognize that carriers have \nentered price-cap regulation at different points over the last 25 years, and so any catch-up adjustments would need \nto reflect that fact. It would make no sense, for example, to impose a catch-up adjustment calculated to reflect \nproductivity over the last 12 or 20 years to a carrier that converted to price cap regulation just five years ago. And \nweighing the uncertain benefit of such adjustments to consumers against the cost to carriers (and ultimately \nconsumers) of applying these differing adjustments as well as the cost to the Commission to monitor compliance, \nwe conclude that not imposing a catch-up adjustment serves the public interest.\n\n a. Additional Price Cap Adjustment Mechanisms\n\n 237. We consider several potential features of the price cap regime whose implementation could affect price cap \nrates.550 We retain the low-end adjustment mechanism for price cap LECs that meet certain conditions. We, \nhowever, decline to incorporate into our price cap regime three mechanisms that would affect the X-factor\u2014a \nconsumer productivity dividend, a growth or \u201cg\u201d factor, and earnings sharing between ratepayers and carriers, or to \nsubdivide the special access price cap basket into different categories or subcategories.551\n\n 238. Low-End Adjustment. We retain a low-end adjustment mechanism because we find it provides an appropriate \nbackstop to ensure that carriers are not subject to protracted periods of low earnings that impair their ability to \nattract capital and provide service. This adjustment will only be available to price cap LECs to the extent they \nprovide business data services in non-competitive areas. Carriers that obtained pricing flexibility under the \nCommission\u2019s prior rules, exercise downward pricing flexibility pursuant to this Order (for example, by entering into \na contract tariff with a customer), or elect the option to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) \nrather than the Part 32 Uniform System of Accounts as set forth in our recent Part 32 Accounting Order will be \nineligible for a low-end adjustment.552 We find that, consistent with past practice, setting the low-end adjustment \nmark at 8.75 percent, 100 basis points below the authorized rate of return for rate of return carriers, will continue to \nensure that price cap LECs have the opportunity to attract sufficient capital.\n\n 239. Historically, the low-end adjustment permitted price cap LECs that earn a rate of return 100 basis points or \nmore below the prescribed rate of return for rate-of-return carriers to temporarily (Continued from previous page)\n\n offsetting savings from wireless, long-distance and CLEC operations that purchase BDS services\u201d) (Cincinnati Bell \nNov. 4, 2016 Ex Parte).\n\n 550 See Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4872-75, paras. 387-400.\n\n\n\n 551 Id.\n\n 552 See Comprehensive Review of the Part 32 Uniform System of Accounts, Jurisdictional Separations and \nReferral to the Federal-State Joint Board, WC Docket No. 14-130, CC Docket No. 80-286, Report and Order, FCC \n17-15, para. 29 (rel. Feb. 24, 2017) (Part 32 Accounting Order) (allowing price cap LECs to use certain targeted \naccounting rules in lieu of the Part 32 Uniform System of Accounts rules). In view of this condition, we find moot \nSprint\u2019s argument that we will have no reliable basis for determining whether a low-end adjustment is warranted. \nSee Sprint Comments at 60. On the contrary, any price cap LEC seeking a low-end adjustment will have present \nPart 32 accounting data supporting its request.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 95\n\n increase their price cap indices in the next year to a level that would allow them to earn 100 basis points below the \nprescribed rate of return.553 Unusually low earnings may be attributable to an error in the productivity factor, the \napplication of an industry-wide factor to a particular LEC, or unforeseen circumstances in a particular area of the \ncountry. Failure to include any adjustment for such circumstances could harm customers as well as stockholders of \nsuch a LEC, as a below-normal rate of return over a prolonged period could threaten the LEC\u2019s ability to raise the \ncapital necessary to provide modern, efficient services to customers.554 We therefore retain the low-end \nadjustment mechanism.\n\n 240. The low-end adjustment mechanism permits a one-time PCI adjustment to a single year\u2019s rates to avoid back-\nto-back earnings below a benchmark.555 If a price cap LECs\u2019 earnings fall below the low-end adjustment mark in a \nbase year period, it is entitled to adjust its rates upward to target earnings to an amount not to exceed the low-end \nmark, using the period as a baseline.556 In the past, the Commission used 100 basis points below the authorized \nrate of return for rate-of-return carriers as the low-end adjustment mark.557 The authorized rate of return for rate-of-\nreturn carriers is presently 9.75 percent, and 8.75 percent is 100 basis points below that percentage.558 The latter \npercentage is above the embedded cost of debt the Commission determined for each price cap LEC in March 2016. \nAn 8.75 percent rate of return should provide each eligible price cap LEC with the opportunity to meet its existing \nobligations to debtholders and attract sufficient capital while continuing to provide services.\n\n 241. We reject Sprint\u2019s argument that we should not base our low-end mark on the authorized rate of return for \nrate-of-return carriers because that rate does not reflect the large price cap LECs\u2019 cost of capital.559 The rate \nreflects a weighted average cost of capital that was calculated using data from a proxy group that included large \nprice cap LECs (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink), mid-sized price cap LECs (e.g., FairPoint, Frontier, \nHawaiian Telcom, and Windstream), as well as publically traded rate-of-return LECs.560 Accordingly we set the \nlow-end adjustment mark at 8.75 percent.\n\n 242. Consumer Productivity Dividend. We decline to incorporate a consumer productivity dividend (CPD) \nadjustment into the X-factor adopted in this Order.561 In instituting price caps in 1990, the Commission expected \nthat incentive regulation would result in greater productivity gains than LECs had historically achieved under rate of \nreturn regulation.562 The CPD was designed to ensure that\n\n 553 47 CFR \u00a7 61.45(d)(1)(vii) (including within the exogenous cost changes adjustments to the price cap indices, \nretargeting the price cap indices to the level specified by the Commission for carriers whose base year earnings are \nbelow the level of the lower adjustment mark); 2005 Special Access NRPM, 20 FCC Rcd at 2011, paras. 45-47.\n\n\n\n 554 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 FCC Rcd at 6804, para. 147; see Sprint Comments at 60.\n\n 555 1999 Pricing Flexibility Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 14307, para. 168.\n\n 556 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 FCC Rcd at 6802, para. 127.\n\n 557 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4873, para. 391.\n\n 558 Connect America Fund et al., WC Docket Nos. 10-90 et al., Report and Order, Order and Order on \nReconsideration, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 31 FCC Rcd 3087, 3171, para. 226 (2015) (2015 \nRate of Return Order).\n\n 559 See Sprint Comments at 60.\n\n 560 See 2015 Rate of Return Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 3322-23, Appx. J & K (listing price cap LECs as part of the \nproxy group used to calculate the WACC).\n\n 561 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4871, para. 384. The Commission has previously noted that in a competitive \nmarket cost reductions are passed to consumers in the form of lower prices. 1997 Price Cap Review Order, 12 FCC \nRcd at 16690-91, para. 124. The CPD was an effort to replicate the competitive market.\n\n 562 See 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 FCC Rcd at 6799, para. 124.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 96\n\n ratepayers would benefit from these additional gains.563 The 2.0 percent X-factor adopted in this Order reflects all \nanticipated future business data services productivity growth.564 There should be no additional gains beyond \nthose captured in this X-factor. We therefore do not include a CPD in the X-factor.\n\n 243. Growth Factor. We decline to adopt a growth or \u201cg\u201d factor adjustment to the price cap indices because we find \nthat our 2.0 percent X-factor already accounts for average cost decreases due to demand growth, which the \u201cg\u201d \nfactor was designed to capture.565 We find that a \u201cg\u201d factor is unnecessary because the 2.0 percent X-factor \nshould capture all of the productivity changes for business data services, including demand growth.566 If business \ndata services demand growth leads to the realization of scale economies, input prices fall, and productivity \nincreases, which our X-factor calculations should capture. Therefore, we do not include a growth factor similar to \nthe \u201cg\u201d factor in the price cap index formula for special access services.\n\n 244. Earnings Sharing. We decline to reinstate earnings sharing arrangements between ratepayers and carriers. In \nthe Further Notice, the Commission asked whether it should reinstate earnings sharing, which had been a feature of \nthe Commission\u2019s original price cap system.567 In 1997, the Commission eliminated earnings sharing, finding that it \nblunted price cap LECs\u2019 efficiency incentives and that eliminating it would remove vestiges of rate of return \nregulation from the price cap system.568 The only party directly addressing this area opposes reinstating earnings \nsharing.569 We find that the Commission\u2019s prior reasoning supporting eliminating earnings sharing persuasive, and \nthere is no record support to overturn the Commission\u2019s past finding and reinstate earnings sharing.\n\n\n\n 245. Baskets and Bands. We decline to subdivide the special access basket into different categories and \nsubcategories.570 The only party addressing this area, Inteliquent, asks that we create a service basket \nsubcategory for multiplexing services to ensure that any required TDM rate reductions flow through to these \nservices, which it asserts have unreasonably high rates.571 Simply creating a\n\n 563 See Id. at 6799, para. 100.\n\n 564 See, e.g., AT&T Comments at 61 (arguing that there is no \u201cconceivable justification\u201d for a CPD); AT&T June \n28, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 4 (claiming a CPD is not appropriate because \u201cthe current proposed \nprice cap plan for BDS represents neither a transition to a more incentivizing regulatory regime nor a relaxing of a \nregulatory constraint\u201d); Sprint Comments at 58 (asserting we can craft an appropriate price cap regime to protect \nconsumers without the CPD); CenturyLink Aug. 9, 2016 Letter, Schankerman & R\u00e9gibeau Decl. at 50 (stating that \nthere is no economic theory to determine what a sensible \u201cconsumer dividend\u201d should be, and there are no good \neconomic reasons to introduce a CPD).\n\n 565 See Sprint Comments at 54-58.\n\n 566 See Sprint Comments at 54-58; but see NASUCA et al.

Blau, Counsel for Inteliquent, Inc., to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC \nDocket Nos. 16-143 et al. at 1 (filed Aug. 5, 2016) (Inteliquent Aug. 5, 2016 Ex Parte); see Letter from Tamar E. \nFinn, Counsel for Inteliquent, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket Nos. 16-143 et al., at 2 (filed Sept. \n19, 2016) (Inteliquent Sept. 19, 2016 Ex Parte) (asserting that the \u201ccosts of multiplexing equipment have plummeted \nover the past 20 years due to improvements in technology, while [incumbent LEC] multiplexing rates have been \nessentially unchanged).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 97\n\n multiplexing subcategory within the special access basket, however, would not by itself result in lower multiplexing \nrates. Even if we were to accept Inteliquent\u2019s premise that multiplexing rates are unreasonably high, the record in \nthis proceeding would not enable us to determine a reasonable level.572\n\n 5. Implementation\n\n\n\n 246. Having adopted a new X-factor for use in the price cap index for price cap LECs in non-competitive areas, we \nnow set forth the path for implementing that new approach. We require revised tariff review plans (TRPs) \nimplementing the X-factor to be filed with the Commission to become effective on December 1, 2017.\n\n 247. Incumbent LECs that file tariffs under the price cap ratemaking methodology are required to file revised \nannual access charge tariffs every year, which become effective on July 1.573 The annual filings include \nsubmission of TRPs that are used to support revisions to the rates, including revisions that pertain to the X-\nfactor.574 To ease the burden on the industry, and because base period demand and the value of GDP-PI reflected \nin the price cap indices typically are not updated during a tariff year, we permit incumbent LECs to use the same \nbase period demand and value of GDP-PI in their December 1, 2017 filings as in their July 1, 2017 annual filings.\n\n 248. Consistent with that approach, each price cap incumbent LECs must file, for business data services, revised \nTRPs and rates to reflect the newly revised X-factor. In particular, the new X-factor should be reflected in the \ncalculation of the price cap index for the special access basket and the pricing bands for each service category \nand subcategory within this basket. Rates must be established at levels where the actual price index does not \nexceed the price cap index and the service band index for each service category and subcategory does not \nexceed its upper limit. For purposes of this filing, the price cap incumbent LECs must base the calculation of these \nindices on our rules for an annual filing, other than for the periods used to measure base period demand and the \nvalue of GDP-PI.575 Further specific direction on the material required to be filed in the TRPs will be provided in a \npublic notice or order preceding the December 1, 2017 effective date of the 2.0 percent X-factor, which will address \ncompliance with price cap tariff filing procedures (including required certifications).\n\n E. Wholesale Pricing\n\n 249. We decline to adopt ex ante rules governing the relationship between wholesale and retail rates for business \ndata services, or to otherwise intervene in the marketplace for wholesale business data services.\n\n 250. The Communications Act and Commission precedent provide ample guidance regarding the pricing of \nwholesale business data services. Section 201(b) of the Act requires that \u201c[a]ll charges . . . for and in connection \nwith [interstate or international telecommunications service] shall be just and\n\n 572 Inteliquent \u201cproposes to set pricing flexibility for the multiplexing category at --20% (negative twenty percent) \nfor the first five years only, which would have the effect of requiring rate reductions to adjust for existing pricing \ndisparities between multiplexing and other services.\u201d Inteliquent Sept. 19, 2016 Ex Parte at 2. Inteliquent, however, \nprovides no data or other support to demonstrate how it calculated the specific percentage reduction it proposes or \nhow that reduction would result in just and reasonable multiplexing rates if the Commission were to adopt their \nproposal.\n\n 573 See Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4880, at para. 417 (citing 47 CFR \u00a7 61.45(a)) (\u201c[P]rice cap carriers file \nadjustments to the price cap index for the business data services basket as part of their annual price cap tariff \nfiling.\u201d).\n\n 574 See, e.g., Material to be Filed in Support of 2016 Annual Access Tariff Filings, WC Docket No. 16-71, Order, \n31 FCC Rcd 3557, 3560, para. 17 (WCB 2016).\n\n\n\n 575 See 47 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 61.45-47.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 98\n\n reasonable . . . .\u201d576 Section 202(a) of the Act prohibits \u201cany unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges . . . \nfor or in connection with like communication service . . . .\u201d577 It has long been the Commission\u2019s policy that, under \nthese provisions, \u201cinterstate access services should be made available on a non-discriminatory basis and, as far \nas possible, without distinction between end user and . . . [wholesale] customers.\u201d578 But, as the D.C. Circuit has \nexplained, \u201c[b]y its nature, section 202(a) is not concerned with the price differentials between qualitatively different \nservices or service packages. In other words, as far as \u2018unreasonable discrimination\u2019 is concerned, an apple does \nnot have to be priced the same as an orange.\u201d579\n\n 251. In response to requests for comments on the issue in the Further Notice,580 some commenters offer \nanecdotal evidence that price caps LECs provide retail services at rates lower than the prices they charge \ncompetitive LECs for components of those services.581 They argue that charging retail rates that are lower than \nwholesale rates violates the Act\u2019s prohibitions on unjust and/or unreasonable discrimination in charges and that we \nshould adopt a rule prohibiting providers from charging more for resale than wholesale services.582 However, \ndespite competitive LEC assertions to the contrary, we find that there is little concrete evidence that incumbent \nLECs charge their wholesale customers higher rates\n\n 576 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b).\n\n 577 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a).\n\n 578 See Implementation of the Subscriber Carrier Selection Changes Provision of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 and Policies and Rules Concerning Unauthorized Changes of Consumers\u2019 Long Distance Carriers, CC Docket \n94-129, Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 14 FCC Rcd 1508, 1541, n.438 \n(1998) (Subscriber Carrier Selection Second Report) (quoting Petition of First Data Resources, Inc., Regarding the \nAvailability of Feature Group B Access Service to End Users, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 1986 WL2911786, \npara. 13 (Com.

At most, the record provides selective \ninformation regarding a handful of incidents where an incumbent LEC\u2019s wholesale pricing policies allegedly \nimpeded a competitive LEC\u2019s ability to compete. As such the record provides no basis for us to adopt generally \napplicable rules governing the application of section 201(b)\u2019s prohibition against unjust and unreasonable practices \nor section 202(a)\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable discrimination to alleged problems in the wholesale business \ndata services marketplace.\n\n 252. In reaching this conclusion, we also reject requests that we mandate that, as a general matter, wholesale \nbusiness data services rates must be lower than the retail rates for like services.583 Certain parties argue that \nbecause it costs business data services providers less to provide wholesale services than to provide like retail \nservices wholesale rates should reflect these lower costs.584 However, any such mandate could have the \nunintended effect of preventing providers from reducing retail rates to competitive levels, as the provider would then \nhave to reduce its wholesale rates to below those levels.\n\n 253. Three commenters suggest potential methods and amounts for an industry-wide discount.585 Advocates of \naction on wholesale pricing share an underlying premise, that wholesale services pricing should exclude avoided \nretail sales expenses. We do not find it necessary to make a finding concerning the accuracy of this premise and \ndecline to set an industry-wide wholesale discount. As stated above, incumbent LECs are not required to tailor \nprices based solely on costs, although rates must be just and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.586 \nWe expect that continued growth in competition as a result of this Order will have a positive effect on the \nmarketplace without the need for a wholesale discount. Additionally, our section 208 complaint procedures remain \navailable to remedy any claimed anticompetitive or discriminatory behavior.587\n\n 254. Sections 201(b) and 202(a) do not explicitly require rates to correspond to costs\u2014only that such rates be just \nand reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.588 Indeed, with any generally available offering, it is unlikely \nthat the costs to provide service to any two customers would be exactly\n\n 583 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 19 (claiming that costs associated with providing services that are part of the \nretail option but not part of the wholesale input should discount the wholesale prices below the retail prices); \nWindstream Comments at 39 (arguing that wholesale rates should be priced below similar retail offerings); Sprint \nComments at 73 (arguing that wholesale BDS rates offered by an incumbent LEC must be lower than its lowest \n\n\n\nretail rates); TDS Reply at 15 (asserting that, at a minimum, wholesale rates should be discounted compared to \nretail by the amount of sales and marketing costs that are avoided).\n\n 584 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 19 (identifying retail costs like sales commissions and compensation, \ndesigning a communications network, and middle mile facilities that are not incurred in providing wholesale \nservices). But see AT&T Reply at 64-65 (arguing that there are no avoided costs in selling wholesale and that any \navoided costs are offset by \u201cwholesale-specific\u201d costs); see also CenturyLink Comments at 80 (claiming there is no \nreason why wholesale rates must always be lower than retail because wholesale costs often are higher than retail).\n\n 585 See TDS Reply at 11-15 (proposing that wholesale rates be discounted by the costs a carrier avoids compared \nto retail and suggesting that wholesale rates be discounted by the commission rate TDS pays its third-party agents \nas a proxy); Windstream Comment at 39-44 (asserting that the Commission implement the \u201cParity Pricing Rule\u201d and \nestablish a safe harbor proxy for seller\u2019s retail costs not incurred offering wholesale services). Windstream says \nwholesale prices should be discounted between 17 to 25 percent. Id. at 43. See also Birch et al.

See \nAT&T Cost Assignment Forbearance Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 7304, para. 5 (the FCC\u2019s Part 69 rules help to ensure \nthat incumbent LECs access charges are just and reasonable).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 100\n\n the same, and we do not require carriers to price their offerings based on the myriad of different costs imposed by \nvarious customers. In fact, we prohibit carriers from discriminating against similarly-situated customers.589 The \nsame analysis is true in this situation.\n\n 255. Additionally, Sprint and Windstream ask that we \u201cconfirm that carriers cannot avoid [their] resale obligations \nmerely by bundling non-Internet telecommunications services with Internet access or with add-on information \nservices.\u201d590 We find that these practices do not lend themselves to blanket rules or detailed pricing \nmethodologies, and we therefore reject these requests.\n\n VI. ADDITIONAL MODERNIZING ACTIONS\n\n A. Certain Services Described In the Record Are Not Common Carrier Services\n\n 256. A number of commenters dispute the accuracy of a seemingly-categorical statement in the Further Notice \n\u201cnot[ing] that business data services are telecommunications services, regardless of the provider supplying the \nservice,\u201d and going on to assert that \u201cBDS providers are therefore common carriers . . . subject to Title II in the \n\n\n\nprovision of their services . . . .\u201d591 As we discuss below, that terse suggestion in the Further Notice does not \naccurately reflect the nuanced analysis required for such a classification decision. This proceeding is not the \nappropriate place to make any generalized or comprehensive classification decisions of that sort for business data \nservices. We do, however, discuss the services described in detail in the record by certain providers, which we \nfind to be private carriage offerings based on the facts provided here. In doing so, we reiterate the Commission\u2019s \nlongstanding approach to the associated classification issues, guarding against any lingering misunderstandings \nregarding classification flowing from statements in the Further Notice.\n\n 1. Background\n\n 257. Under the analytical framework for distinguishing between services offered on a common carriage or private \ncarriage basis\u2014commonly known as the \u2018NARUC analysis\u2019 (or the like) for the court cases from which it derives\u2014\ncommon carriage under the Act has two prerequisites: (1) an indifferent holding out of service to all potential users; \nand (2) the transmission by customers of \u201cintelligence of their own design and choosing.\u201d592 By contrast, \u201ca carrier \nwill not be a common carrier where its practice is to make individualized decisions, in particular cases, whether and \non what terms to deal.\u201d593 As the D.C. Circuit explained in NARUC I, \u201c[t]he original rationale for imposing a stricter \nduty of care on common carriers was that they had implicitly accepted a sort of public trust by availing themselves \nof the public at\n\n 589 It has long been the Commission\u2019s policy that, under these provisions, \u201cinterstate access services should be \nmade available on a non-discriminatory basis. . . .\u201d Subscriber Carrier Selection Second Report, 14 FCC Rcd at \n1541 n.438 (1998) (quoting Petition of First Data Resources, Inc., Regarding the Availability of Feature Group B \nAccess Service to End Users, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 1986 WL2911786, para. 13 (Com.

Affirmative Arguments for Private Carriage Classification of Certain Services. Comcast and Charter each \nsubmitted detailed information about certain categories of services sufficient to enable us to classify those as \nprivate carriage offerings based on the record here.606 With respect to its wholesale cellular backhaul service and \nE-Access service, Comcast explains that it makes individualized decisions whether it will, in fact, offer such \nservices in a given instance or to a given customer.607 Comcast describes its offering of retail Ethernet Dedicated \nInternet Access Service (EDI) and Ethernet transport similarly, explaining that it does not hold out such services \nto all interested buyers.608 For its part, Charter explains that particularly in the case of business data services \nprovided to enterprise customers, it makes individualized decisions whether to offer service to given customers.609 \nThe case-by-case decisions about whether to offer these services to a given customer described by Comcast and \nCharter stand in contrast to the \u201cquasi-public character\u201d that is a \u201ccritical\u201d premise of common carrier classification\u2014\nand the\n\n 601 See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 61-62, 66; NCTA Comments at 14; ACA Reply at 12-13.\n\n 602 See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 61, 66; NCTA Comments at 14; see also Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at \n4836-37, para. 257 n.671 (noting the limited discussion of the issue in the record).\n\n 603 There appears to be no dispute in the record that business data services enable the transmission by \ncustomers of \u201cintelligence of their own design and choosing and meet the telecommunications definition. See, e.g., \nPublic Knowledge et al. Reply at 6-7 n.24 (\u201cThere is no dispute that BDS qualifies as \u2018telecommunications,\u2019 see 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 153(50) . . . .\u201d). We thus focus on whether the offering of particular services involve an indifferent holding \nout of service to all potential users, or instead involve individualized decisions, in particular cases, whether and on \nwhat terms to deal.\n\n\n\n 604 The fact that we do not broadly classify business data services renders moot the concerns raised by some \ncommenters that we provided insufficient notice under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to take such an \naction. See, e.g., Charter Comments at 17; Comcast Comments at 66; NCTA Comments at 14.\n\n 605 Although not comprehensively classifying business data services here, the Commission will, of course, treat \nother business data services provided under materially similar facts similarly to its treatment of the services \naddressed in this Order.\n\n 606 Comcast and Charter also appear to reference the existence of some additional universe of offerings that they \nalso view as meeting the standard for private carriage. See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 15; Charter Comments at \n18-19. Comcast and Charter do not discuss those services in the record here to the same degree as the services \nwe address, however. We focus here just on those services for which Comcast and Charter provide more details \nregarding the manner in which they are offered.\n\n 607 See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 15-16, 63-64; Comcast Comments, Exh. E at para. 13 (Comcast Decl. of \nDavid Allen); Comcast Reply at 30-33; Letter from Matthew A. Brill, Counsel to Comcast, to Marlene H.

Circuit in NARUC I.610 The absence of this critical factor is \ncentral to our private carriage analysis of these services.611\n\n 261. Comcast and Charter each further explain that they make highly-individualized decisions regarding any rates \nand terms they do offer for the relevant categories of services in order to meet the particular needs of a given \ncustomer.612 The plausibility of these descriptions is reinforced by the fact that the customers for these services \ntypically include large wireless carriers, other large service providers, or enterprises.613 The record reveals that \nsuch entities are likely to have the size and sophistication to demand uniquely-tailored wholesale or retail offerings \nthat enable them to meet particularized needs.614 Although a few commenters dispute the private carriage claims \nin the record, for the reasons described below in our response to those arguments, we are not persuaded that they \nrequire a different conclusion with respect to the services we classify as private carriage here. Thus, considering \nthe totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the Comcast and Charter services identified above, when \noffered in the manner described in the record, constitute private carriage services\u2014not common carrier services \nor telecommunications services.\n\n 262. As other examples, Mediacom, ACS, and BT Americas also argue that services they each provide constitute \nprivate carriage. Although the information they submitted is not quite as detailed or\n\n\n\n 610 NARUC I, 525 F.2d at 641; see also Comcast Reply at 30 (\u201cwithout any indiscriminate \u2018holding out\u2019 to the \npublic . . . the central rationale for common carrier treatment\u2014the notion that the carrier \u2018ha[s] implicitly accepted a \nsort of public trust by availing themselves of the business of the public at large\u2019\u2014vanishes\u201d) (quoting NARUC I, 525 \nF.2d at 641-42).\n\n 611 Indeed, even in Orloff v. FCC\u2014a decision the D.C. Circuit has referred to as \u201cthe high water mark\u201d for common \ncarriage, Cellco P\u2019ship v. FCC, 700 F.3d 534, 546 (D.C. Cir. 2012)\u2014the court emphasized that although the \nprovider engaged in some negotiation with customers, it did not \u201crefuse \u2018to deal with any segment of the public \nwhose business is the \u2018type normally accepted.\u2019\u2019\u201d Orloff v. FCC, 352 F.3d 415, 420 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The court thus \naffirmed the Commission\u2019s decision that the provider had not violated its obligations as a common carrier. Orloff v. \nFCC, 700 F.3d at 419-21.\n\n 612 See, e.g., Charter Comments at 18-19; Charter Decl. of Phil Meeks at para. 7, 8; Comcast Comments at 15-\n17, 63-65; Comcast Decl. of John Guillaume at paras. 13, 14; Comcast Decl. of David Allen at para. 13; Comcast \nOct. 5, 2016 Letter at 2, 5; Letter from Samuel L.

The record reveals that \nthis individualization occurs across a wide range of key elements of the service offerings and is further supported \nby the influential role of potential customers in the process. See, e.g., Charter Comments at 18-19; Charter \nComments, Exh. A at para. 7 (Charter Decl. of Phil Meeks); Comcast Decl. of John Guillaume at paras. 4, 14; \nComcast Decl. of David Allen at paras. 11, 13; Comcast Comments, Exh. A at paras. 72-80 (Comcast Decl. of \nJoseph Farrell); Charter Reply at 8-9.\n\n 613 See, e.g., Charter Decl. of Phil Meeks at para. 7; Comcast Decl. of David Allen at paras. 3, 4; Charter Reply at \n8-9.\n\n 614 See, e.g., American Cable Association Comments, App. A at 14 (ACA Schwartz-Mini White Paper); Charter \nDecl. of Phil Meeks at para. 12; BT Americas Reply at 12; Charter Reply at 8-9; Letter from Glenn Woroch, Senior \nConsultant, Compass Lexecon and Adjunct Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, to \nMarlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 16-143 et al., Attach. at 39 (filed June 28, 2016) (Second IRW \nWhite Paper). Nothing in the Commission\u2019s longstanding classification approach categorically classifies wholesale \nservices as private carriage offerings. Nor does the mere fact that a service is offered on a wholesale, rather than \nretail, basis play a role in our analysis separate and apart from our consideration of customer sophistication as a \nrelevant corroboration of the plausibility of service providers\u2019 claims of individualization. We thus reject concerns \nthat our approach somehow undercuts the Commission\u2019s recognition that wholesale services can be offered on a \ncommon carrier basis as telecommunications services. See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 26; Verizon Reply at 33.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 104\n\n specific as that of Comcast and Charter, we nonetheless agree that, as described, these services reflect private \ncarriage offerings. Notably, each of these providers explains with respect to its relevant services that, rather than \noffering service to all potential customers and offering rates and terms indifferently, they instead make \nindividualized decisions about whether and on what terms to offer service.615 There also is little indication in the \nrecord of any disagreement that these particular providers are offering service on a private carriage basis, as they \n\n\n\ncontend.616 Building on our analysis for Comcast and Charter above,617 under our evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence here, we likewise conclude that the services described by Mediacom, ACS, and BT Americas are private \ncarriage when offered as these providers describe.618\n\n 263. Responses to Arguments Disputing that Those Services are Held Out on a Private Carriage Basis Under the \nNARUC Analysis. Some commenters purport to provide evidence that business data service providers generally, or \nComcast and Charter in particular, offer business data services in a manner that reflects an indifferent holding out \nof service to the public, and thus should be classified as common carrier telecommunications services. We reject \nsuch claims in the context of the specific providers\u2019 services addressed above for a number of reasons.\n\n 264. First, generalized statements about marketplace trends broadly, or Comcast\u2019s or Charter\u2019s networks or \nservices generally\u2014but which do not purport to address more specifically the particular services we discuss \nabove\u2014do not provide a basis to reject the evidence put forward by Comcast, Charter\n\n 615 See, e.g., ACS Comments, Attach. A at 2-3 (ACS Decl. of David C. Eisenberg); Mediacom Comments at 3 n.3; \nACS Reply at 9-10; BT Americas Reply at 11-13; Mediacom Reply at 14; Letter from Paul B. Hudson, Counsel for \nMediacom, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 16-143 et al., at 1-2 (filed Oct. 13, 2016) \n(Mediacom Oct. 13, 2016 Ex Parte). We note that ACS does not describe the intersection (if any) between the \nservices it discusses in its filings here and the listed telecommunications services for which ACS of Anchorage \npreviously sought, and received, forbearance from certain dominant carrier common carrier regulations. See \nPetition of ACS of Anchorage, Inc. Pursuant To Section 10 of the Communications Act Of 1934, As Amended (47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), For Forbearance From Certain Dominant Carrier Regulation of Its Interstate Access Services, \nand For Forbearance From Title II Regulation Of Its Broadband Services, In the Anchorage, Alaska, Incumbent \nLocal Exchange Carrier Study Area, WC Docket No. 06-109, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 22 FCC Rcd 16304, \n16316, para. 22 (2007) (ACS Forbearance Order) (listing certain business data services offered by ACS for which \nit requested forbearance). Given that ambiguity in the record, we make clear that the views offered in this Order \nregarding ACS\u2019s services do not encompass the ACS of Anchorage services identified in that prior forbearance \nproceeding, and we do not opine here on the present classification of any of those services.\n\n 616 Although some commenters make claims about general marketplace trends, we are not persuaded that those \nundercut more specific evaluations of the actions of particular providers for the reasons discussed below in our \nresponse to those arguments. Beyond that, there appears to be no meaningful evidence in the record regarding \nACS or BT Americas specifically that disputes those providers\u2019 characterizations of how they offer service and its \nstatus as private carriage. As to Mediacom, there likewise appears to be nothing in the record beyond illustrative \nexamples of Mediacom marketing materials included among the attachments to Verizon\u2019s reply comments. See \nVerizon Reply, App. C (examples of Mediacom retail Ethernet offerings). We explain below the limited weight we \ngive such marketing materials here as a general matter, and note also that no commenter subsequently raised any \nmeaningful objection to the specific characterization of Mediacom\u2019s service offerings reflected in its filings.\n\n 617 For example, beyond these other service providers\u2019 general characterizations of their offerings, they also \nclaim a broad scope of individualization in rates and terms and identify the role of sophisticated customers in \ntailoring the offering that appear reasonably similar to the characteristics described in greater detail by Comcast and \nCharter. See, e.g., ACS Reply at 9-10; BT Americas Reply at 12-13; Mediacom Oct. 13, 2016 Ex Parte at 1-2.\n\n 618 As is always the case, the Commission can revisit any classifications addressed in this order should a \nprovider\u2019s \u201cactual operation more closely resemble common carriage.\u201d Norlight Request for Declaratory Ruling, File \nNo. PRB-LMMD 86-07, Declaratory Ruling, 2 FCC Rcd 132, 134-35, para. 22 (1987) (Norlight Order).\n\n\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 105\n\n or the other providers addressed above that is specific to those providers\u2019 services.619 Even assuming arguendo \nthat certain characterizations of the marketplace as a whole or particular providers\u2019 networks or offerings might \ncommonly hold true in a general sense, we find no basis to assume that they hold true with respect to particular \nservice offerings sufficient to overcome more specific contrary evidence.620\n\n 265. Second, we are unpersuaded by arguments that particular aspects of how these providers offer service do \nnot inherently require a classification of private carriage as to the offering of the relevant services, or can be \nconsistent with common carriage.621 We do not base our decision on any single aspect of the manner in which \nComcast, Charter, Mediacom, ACS, or BT Americas offer the specified services. Rather, we confirm those \nproviders\u2019 claims of private carriage based on the totality of the evidence before us describing the manner in which \nthe relevant services are offered. Under that analysis we find sufficient evidence of individualized determinations \nwhether to offer service to given customers and, when services are offered, individualization on a sufficient range \nof key terms of the offering to warrant a finding of private carriage.622 Thus, whether any subset of actions taken by \nthose providers would or would not be sufficient to support a private carriage classification is not an issue we \nconfront or address here.623\n\n 619 See, e.g., INCOMPAS reply at 22-27; Public Knowledge et al.

FCC, 19 F.3d at 1481 (\u201cWhether an entity in a given case is to be considered a \ncommon carrier or a private carrier turns on the particular practice under surveillance.\u201d).\n\n 621 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 24-25, 27; Public Knowledge et al.

Given conduct can be \nconsistent with common carriage without constituting common carriage per se. See, e.g., Cellco P\u2019ship v. FCC, 700 \nF.3d 534, 547 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (evaluating whether conduct required by rule constitute common carriage per se). As \ndiscussed in more detail below, certain commenters raise policy arguments that appear focused primarily on \nadvocating compelled common carriage or on advocating statutory interpretation that makes it more likely that \nservice would be classified as common carrier telecommunications services. To the extent that those policy \narguments also are advanced as reasons to classify as common carrier telecommunications services the relevant \nbusiness data services of the providers discussed above within the \u201cgray area\u201d between private carriage and \ncomment carriage, see Cellco P\u2019ship v. FCC, 700 F.3d at 547, we are unpersuaded to impose the burdens of a \ncommon carriage classification under our longstanding classification analysis for the same reasons we reject such \narguments below.\n\n 622 As Verizon observes, \u201ca provider\u2019s self-characterization of its service offerings is not controlling.\u201d Verizon \nReply at 28. While not inherently dispositive, the Commission has, for example, relied on a provider\u2019s claims that it \n\n\n\nis holding itself out as a common carrier as a relevant factor supporting telecommunications carrier treatment \nnotwithstanding some other actions by the providers that could be viewed as consistent with private carriage. Bright \nHouse Networks, LLC v. Verizon California, Inc., File No. EB-08-MD-002, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 23 \nFCC Rcd 10704, 10718, para. 39 (2008) (Bright House Order), aff\u2019d, Verizon California, Inc. v. FCC, 555 F.3d 270 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009). Thus, while the claims of private carriage here are not themselves dispositive, they are relevant, \nand distinguish these circumstances from others where providers with some superficial similarities in operation\u2014but \nthat also purported to be acting as common carriers\u2014were ultimately confirmed to be common carriers. See, e.g., \nIowa Telecommunications Servs. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 563 F.3d 743, 749-50 (8th Cir. 2009).\n\n 623 As an illustrative example, commenters cite prior orders or other precedent indicating that the mere fact that a \nprovider engages in some negotiation does not itself preclude telecommunications service classification. See, e.g., \nINCOMPAS Reply at 27; Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 7-8; Sprint Reply at 67; Verizon Reply at 30. While the \nfact of some negotiation, in the abstract, does not inherently preclude a telecommunications service or common \n(continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 106\n\n 266. We also find a variety of those claims overstated, even on their own terms. For example, some commenters \ncite marketing materials or other statements from certain of the providers discussed above as undercutting these \nproviders\u2019 claims that, as to the relevant services, the providers make individualized decisions whether and on \nwhat terms to deal.624 In many cases, the cited materials or statements, while focused on particular services or \ncategories of services, nonetheless still are too high-level or generalized to provide meaningful insight into the \nmore granular details of how particular services are offered in practice.625 Even materials or statements purporting \nto speak to particular service offerings on a somewhat more granular basis do not lend themselves to simplistic \nanalysis.626 Where service is offered via a tariff, the analysis can be more straightforward not only because the \nfiled tariff doctrine requires the tariffed rates and terms to be controlling,627 but even more fundamentally because \nonly common carrier services may be offered on a tariffed basis.628 Outside the tariffing context, we\n\n (Continued from previous page)\n\n carriage classification, it also do not compel such classifications\u2014in other words, such actions are consistent with \nprivate carriage, as well. In our application of the NARUC framework, we consider such actions, where present, as \npart of our overall evaluation, including not merely their presence or absence but also any evidence regarding the \nscope, extent, and nature of any negotiations. We find here that the overall weight of the evidence cuts against a \nfinding that the providers identified above have the necessary \u201cquasi-public character\u201d when offering the relevant \nservices, and we thus classify the providers\u2019 offering of those services as private carriage on the record here. \nNARUC I, 525 F.2d at 641. By clarifying that the mere fact of some negotiation is not itself dispositive of a service\u2019s \nclassification, we also address INCOMPAS\u2019s concerns that a contrary holding would imperil interconnection under \nsection 251(a) of the Communications Act. See INCOMPAS Reply at 28. We note further in that regard that \nalthough section 251(a)(1) requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect with one another directly or \nindirectly, nothing in the text of that provision requires that such interconnection be accomplished via an \narrangement that is itself a common carrier service.

Even where negotiation has been permitted in the context of a tariffing \nregime, the analysis remains somewhat more straightforward given need to offer a negotiated result to any other \nsimilarly situated customers. See, e.g., Competition in the Interstate Interexchange Marketplace, CC Docket No. \n90\u2013132, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, 10 FCC Rcd 4562 (1995) (recognizing \u201cindividually \nnegotiated contracts could satisfy the nondiscrimination provisions\u201d for common carrier services under section 202 \n\u201cof the Act if the terms of the contract were made generally available to similarly situated customers\u201d); Orloff v.

The facts here do not fall within the scope of even that scenario, however. In addition to involving non-\ntariffed offerings, the record here gives no indication that the providers addressed above hold out any given \nnegotiated outcome as an offer to the other customers to which the service could be of use.\n\n 628 See, e.g., Electronic Tariff Filing System (ETFS), WC Docket No. 10-141, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 25 \nFCC Rcd 9513, 9520, para. 17 n.37 (2010) (The Commission\u2019s rules governing tariff filings \u201cbenefit the public by \n(continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 107\n\n agree with commenters that marketing materials or the like might well be used merely to make it known that a \ngiven company is a potential provider of particular services without representing a formal offer of service to all \ncustomers to which the service might legally and practicably be of use.629 On their face, we do not find the \nmarketing materials or other provider statements cited here to represent a formal holding out of the services \naddressed above to all potential users. Nor are we persuaded by the record that, in practice, Comcast, Charter, \nMediacom, ACS, or BT Americas treat those statements or marketing materials in such a manner. Insofar as the \nstatements and marketing materials thus are compatible with those providers\u2019 representations regarding whether \nand how they offer the relevant services, we are not persuaded to reject the providers\u2019 representations on the basis \nof such materials and statements.\n\n 267. Also overstated are commenters\u2019 claims regarding common technical characteristics or terms of agreements, \nwhether in marketing materials, \u201crate sheets,\u201d or from practical interactions with Comcast, Charter, Mediacom, ACS, \nor BT Americas. These claims do not dissuade us from the private carriage determination we make as to those \n\n\n\nproviders.630 Such considerations can be relevant to the classification analysis, but the evidence before us in that \nregard does not require a common carrier classification here. Even to the extent that such evidence here directly \napplies to the particular providers\u2019 services addressed above, we are persuaded that, in significant part, they do \nnot reflect a formal offer of service at particular rates and terms that these providers genuinely anticipate potential \ncustomers accepting, but merely serve a starting point for negotiations of relevant rates and terms.631 In addition, \nto the extent that Verizon identifies certain similarities in its interactions with a variety of different service providers \n(when acting as a customer) and with its own operation (when acting as a service provider), that is distinct from the \nrelevant question of whether a single provider treats all potential customers similarly (Continued from previous \npage)\n\n providing information on the rates, terms, and conditions for certain telecommunications services.\u201d) (quotation \nomitted); MTS and WATS Market Structure, CC Docket No. 78-72, Third Report and Order, 93 FCC 2d 241, 313-\n14, para. 244 (1982) (\u201cOnly common carrier services can be tariffed.\u201d).\n\n 629 See, e.g., Comcast Oct. 5, 2016 Letter at 5-7.\n\n 630 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 23-24; Public Knowledge et al.

Additionally, issues regarding the rates and terms of any offering are \ndistinct from the question of whether any offering (whatever the rates and terms) is made to all potential users of the \n\n\n\nservice\u2014a \u201ccritical\u201d issue under NARUC I\u2014and do not implicate our findings in that regard discussed above.633 \nThus, while relevant to consider as part of arguments about a providers\u2019 individualization in rates and terms, under \nthe totality of the circumstances here, we conclude that the alleged \u201cuniformity\u201d in service offerings cited by \ncommenters is limited and does not preclude our private carriage classification for Comcast, Charter, Mediacom, \nACS, and BT Americas.\n\n 268. Third, we reject common carriage claims based on asserted similarities between particular aspects of these \nproviders\u2019 offering of service and the manner in which incumbent LECs or others offer service.634 We are not \npersuaded that comparisons or analogies to how other providers such as incumbent LECs or others have offered \nservice necessarily are illuminating. Although there are a variety of prior decisions where the Commission has \nsuggested that business data services are telecommunications services, those decisions are best understood as \ndescriptive of the agency\u2019s general sense of how providers\u2014and particularly incumbent LECs\u2014were, in practice, \noffering such services at the time.635 They do not expressly claim (or justify) any formal, comprehensive \nclassification of business data services under our longstanding classification approaches.636 Those prior decisions \nthus also do not\n\n 632 See generally, e.g., Verizon Reply at 31-32; Verizon Decl. of Jerry Holland and Daniel Higgins; Verizon Decl. \nof Sam Giannini.

See, e.g., Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4863-64, para. 257 n.672. For the reasons \nexplained in this paragraph, we likewise reject commenters\u2019 proposed broader interpretations of those orders.

Responses to Arguments Advocating Compelled Common Carriage or a Different Classification Approach. \nWe also reject arguments for requiring that some or all business data services be offered on a common carriage \nbasis as telecommunications services even where providers otherwise have elected to offer them on a private \ncarriage basis.638 Although the traditional NARUC analysis recognizes the possibility that a service provider might \nbe under a legal compulsion to offer service on a common carrier basis, the record does not demonstrate grounds \nfor imposing such a requirement here.639 As a threshold matter, we agree with commenters that the Further Notice \ndid not provide adequate APA notice for the Commission to compel common carriage for business data services \ngenerally, or to do so for some segment of the industry, via the adoption of a legislative rule of general \napplicability.640 (Continued from previous page)\n\n (Embarq/Frontier Forbearance Order) (listing certain business data services offered by Embarq and Frontier for \nwhich they requested forbearance and noting that \u201cthe specified broadband services all appear to be transmission \nservices that the petitioners choose to offer on a common carrier basis today\u201d) (emphasis added); Petition of AT&T \nInc.

See, e.g., Competition in the Interstate Interexchange \nMarketplace, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 90-132, 5 FCC Rcd 2627 2645, para. 152 (seeking \ncomment on allowing interexchange carriers to provide services on a private carriage basis, and recognizing that to \neffectuate such a proposal \u201c[p]rivate carriage would be authorized only upon approval of a \u00a7 214 discontinuance \napplication\u201d). By contrast, that would not be the case with respect to a service that a provider introduces as a \n\n\n\nprivate carriage offering in the first instance. Because there is a \u201cgray area\u201d where conduct can be consistent with \neither a common carriage or private carriage classification, the outcome of a classification analysis in a particular \ncase thus can be informed by such historical regulatory considerations. See, e.g., Cellco P\u2019ship v. FCC, 700 F.3d at \n547. We note that the record here does not reveal that the providers whose services we find to be private carriage \nabove initially purported to introduce those services on a common carriage basis.\n\n 638 See, e.g., Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 10-14; BT Americas Reply at 10-11 (making this argument with \nrespect to a subset of providers).\n\n 639 See, e.g., NARUC I, 525 F.2d at 642 (\u201cIn making this [classification] determination, we must inquire, first, \nwhether there will be any legal compulsion thus to serve indifferently, and if not, second, whether there are reasons \nimplicit in the nature of SMR operations to expect an indifferent holding out to the eligible user public.\u201d).\n\n 640 See, e.g., Charter Comments at 19; Comcast Oct. 5, 2016 Letter at 6.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 110\n\n 270. In addition, we also find insufficient the policy grounds cited by commenters advocating compelled common \ncarriage here. As a number of commenters recognize, our precedent generally has identified market power as a \nprerequisite for potentially compelling common carriage,641 but the record here does not reveal that the specific \nproviders offering particular business data services on a private carriage basis have market power with respect to \nthose services.642 While arguing that the Commission also can compel common carriage based on other public \ninterest considerations, Public Knowledge et al. nonetheless acknowledge that even then the Commission must \nconsider \u201cwhether the public interest benefits outweigh the costs of applying regulation.\u201d643 Yet even that standard \nis not met on the record here. Although some commenters seek to minimize the perceived extent of regulatory \nburdens that would flow from compelled common carriage,644 the Commission itself has acknowledged that \nmeaningful burdens do, in fact, flow from common carrier treatment.645 Some service provider commenters also \nexplain that they have relied on their ability to operate on a private carriage basis, and the flexibility it provides, \nwhen electing to enter the marketplace with particular business data service offerings.646 Thus, we find it likely \nthat Commission action broadly treating as common carriage services that providers wish to offer as private \ncarriage would discourage investment in such services. At the same time, we find any\n\n 641 See, e.g., Comcast Comments at 67-68 (citing precedent); NCTA Comments at 14 (citing precedent); Charter \nReply at 9 (citing precedent).\n\n 642 For their part, the commenters advocating compelled common carriage make only generalized arguments in \nthis regard not specific to the specific offerings of the specific providers we classify above, nor as to any other \nuniverse of private carriage offerings from other providers in the marketplace today.

For similar reasons, we decline to adopt a new approach to classification here that departs from our \nlongstanding reliance on the NARUC analysis as some commenters propose.650 Commenters advocating that we \nclassify business data services solely through our own interpretation of the statutory \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d \ndefinition do not put forward a theory of interpretation that we find reasonable.651 Instead, these commenters focus \nto such a degree on the desired outcome of such a\n\n 647 See, e.g., BT Americas Reply at 10-11 (arguing that \u201cleading providers\u201d possess market power and compelled \ncommon carriage would benefit customers that might have difficulty \u201cobtain[ing] comparable services\u201d); Public \nKnowledge et al.

Although not raised in the context of \nadvocating compelled common carriage, some commenters do express concern about the actions of Comcast in \ndeclining to serve particular wholesale customers. See, e.g., Sprint Reply at 68; INCOMPAS Reply at 26; Verizon \nSept. 27, 2016 Letter at 2. Insofar as these commenters presume that Comcast is offering to serve all potential \nwholesale customers other than a single (or some de minimis number) of potential customers, we do not find that \ntheory borne out by the information in the current record here. To the extent that the Commission were presented \nwith evidence revealing such a scenario, it would need to revisit its analysis of the totality of the circumstances \nregarding whether that offering was being made on a private carriage or common carriage basis under the NARUC \nanalysis\u2014an issue we do not prejudge at this time. Under the analysis of the record here, however, where we find \ncertain Comcast services to be offered on a private carriage basis, we are not persuaded that the concerns raised \nby these commenters require that Comcast offer its service on a common carrier basis. The record reveals neither \nthe extent to which customers that Comcast elects not to offer to serve are unable to find adequate alternatives\u2014\nwhether self-provisioning or service from other providers\u2014nor does it reveal the extent to which any benefits from \ncommon carriage truly would be public benefits, rather than simply private benefits for particular customers.\n\n 648 Those generalized arguments likewise do not demonstrate the benefits (if any) of compelling common carriage \nby any universe of providers other than those we address above, insofar as those other providers also offer \nbusiness data services on a private carriage basis in the marketplace today.\n\n 649 As Public Knowledge et al. observe, the Commission\u2019s universal service contribution rules require certain \ncontributions from private carriers. See Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 14. Nothing in this order modifies those \nuniversal service contribution rules.\n\n 650 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 21-23, 28; Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 8-9; Verizon Reply at 37; Verizon \nSept. 27. 2016 Letter at 3, 4.\n\n 651 Some commenters overstate the USTelecom v. FCC decision as having held that the Commission reasonably \ncan interpret and implement the definition of \u2018telecommunications service\u2019 without reference to the NARUC \nanalysis. See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 28; Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 8-9. The D.C. Circuit there stated \nonly that \u201cUS Telecom cites no case, nor are we aware of one, holding that when the Commission invokes the \nstatutory test (continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 112\n\n classification approach that we are left unclear how the Commission could achieve that outcome without adopting \nsuch a sweeping interpretation of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d as to virtually eliminate any distinction between \nofferings \u201cto the public\u201d and private offerings.652 Thus, as a matter of statutory construction, the record does not \n\n\n\npersuade us to depart from our longstanding classification approach, which gave full meaning to the relevant \nstatutory language consistent with the legislative history.\n\n 272. Independently, we are not persuaded by policy arguments that we should depart from our longstanding \nclassification approach even if we could do so as a matter of statutory interpretation. The arguments in favor of \nsuch action are, like the arguments commenters raised in favor of compelled common carriage, generalized \nassertions about providing perceived benefits or remedying perceived risk of harms that are divorced from any \nspecific circumstances where application of our longstanding classification approach would yield private carriage \nclassifications.653 As we explained when rejecting proposals to compel common carriage, such arguments do not \ndemonstrate what public benefits would\n\n (Continued from previous page)\n\n for common carriage, it must also apply the NARUC test\u201d and found that, other than an argument already rejected \nby the court (and not relevant here), USTelecom never challenged the Commission\u2019s application of the statutory \ndefinition. USTelecom v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674, 710 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Given the court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of \nissues before it, the D.C. Circuit had no reason to opine broadly on the reasonableness of any particular alternative \napproach to interpreting the telecommunications service definition that did not rely on the NARUC analysis, and the \nlimits of its own statements reveal that the court did not, in fact, opine on that issue. Confronted with requests here \nto depart from the longstanding classification approach relying on the NARUC analysis where such requests \npresent serious concerns about the reasonableness of the new statutory interpretation that would be required and \nno justified need for any new approach in this context, we instead adhere to our longstanding classification \napproach that relies on the NARUC analysis. Furthermore, however the D.C. Circuit viewed the Commission\u2019s \nactions in the Title II Order as the issues were framed for the court on review, the Title II Order does not itself \nidentify a reasonable alternative interpretational approach that would adequately address our concerns here, \nparticularly given the Order\u2019s many citations to, and reliance on, NARUC I and the Commission\u2019s longstanding \napproach to \u2018telecommunications service\u2019 classification that relies on the NARUC framework. See, e.g., Title II \nOrder, 30 FCC Rcd at 5757, 5763-65, paras. 355 n.969, 363 nn. 1008, 1011, 364 nn. 1013, 1017, 1022. Given the \nconcerns we identify here, which were not addressed in USTelecom v. FCC or the Title II Order, we reject the view \nthat we can and should depart from our longstanding classification approach when evaluating business data \nservices.\n\n 652 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 22-23 (quoting language from the telecommunications service definition and \nasserting that certain providers satisfy that definition without indicating the interpretive framework or any outer \nlimits); Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 9 (similar); Verizon Reply at 37 (suggesting that the Commission can apply \nthe statutory definition without using the NARUC analysis without elaborating on the interpretive framework or any \nouter limits); Verizon Sept. 27, 2016 Letter at 4 (quoting language from the telecommunications service definition \nand asserting that certain providers satisfy that definition without indicating the interpretive framework or any outer \nlimits). Although Verizon suggests that \u201cproviders, including Verizon, still can . . . offer other services as private \ncarriage,\u201d it does not demonstrate how, or to what extent, that could be true in practice given an interpretive \napproach that would result in in \u201call business data services [being] common-carrier services.\u201d Verizon Sept. 27, \n2016 Letter at 5 (emphasis added).\n\n 653 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Reply at 26 (arguing that classifying some business data service offerings as private \ncarriage could allow \u201cstrategic denials\u201d); Verizon Reply at 26-27 (arguing that classifying some business data \nservice offerings as private carriage could undercut technology neutrality, make regulation of business data \nservices harder to administer, limit the ability to ensure just and reasonable rates for business data services, and \nbe at odds with the nature of the marketplace); id. at 35 (\u201ccable companies are key suppliers\u201d of certain wholesale \nservices for Verizon); Verizon Sept. 27, 2016 Letter at 2-3 (arguing that allowing private carriage could undermine \n\n\n\ncompetition and technology and competitive neutrality). While not entirely clear, it appears that Public Knowledge et \nal. raise the same arguments in support of a new, broader statutory interpretation that we described above in the \ncontext of their arguments for compelled common carriage. See Public Knowledge et al. Reply at 11-14. To the \nextent that providers raise in this context certain specific concerns about denial of service by Comcast already \ndiscussed above, we reject them here on those same grounds.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 113\n\n flow if the specific services of certain providers that we find to be offered on a private carriage basis\u2014or those of \nother providers not addressed here\u2014were instead classified as common carriage.654 That shortcoming is even \nmore problematic for any argument to revisit the Commission\u2019s classification approach, because absent some \ntheory for limiting the interpretation just to this context, increasing the reach of the telecommunications service \ndefinition would also result in regulatory burdens for providers of other communications services that would be \nclassified as common carrier telecommunication services under that interpretive approach. We thus find no \ngrounds for adopting an approach to service classification here that departs from our longstanding reliance on the \nNARUC analysis.\n\n 273. Given that we do not depart here from our longstanding approach to evaluating private carriage and common \ncarriage classification, we also continue to adhere to our precedent under which shared use arrangements typically \nwere classified as private carriage.655 Consequently, this addresses the concerns of some commenters that \nresearch and education (R&E) networks that historically had been treated as private carriage under that framework \nmight newly be classified as common carrier telecommunications services under a new approach to \nclassification.656\n\n B. Expiration of the Section 214 Interim Wholesale Access Rule\n\n 274. By this Order, the Commission \u201cidentifies a set of rules and/or policies that will ensure rates, terms, and \nconditions for special access services [BDS] are just and reasonable.\u201d657 As a result, the interim wholesale \naccess rule for discontinued TDM-based BDS and unbundled network element platform (UNE-P) replacement \nservices (also called commercial wholesale platform services) established\n\n 654 We also are not persuaded by a number of these policy arguments even on their own terms. Neither the \nconcept of technology neutrality nor of competitive neutrality requires the Commission to blindly treat all \ntechnologies or competitors identically, regardless of similarities or differences. Our classification approach based \non how services are held out to the public instead reasonably treats all technologies and competitors neutrally \nwhere they are similarly situated. When a provider holds out an offering on a common carrier basis the service is a \ncommon carrier telecommunications service regardless of the identity of the provider or the technology being used. \nLikewise, when the manner of a provider\u2019s offering satisfies the test for private carriage, the service will be \nclassified as private carriage regardless of the identity of the provider or the technology being used.\n\n 655 In the Resale and Shared Use Order, the Commission considered, among other things, various scenarios \nwhere entities have \u201ca communications need (other than a need to resell the service to others)\u201d and some group of \nthese entities \u201ccollectively use communications services and facilities obtained from an underlying carrier or a \nresale carrier\u201d to meet that need, apportioning among themselves \u201cthe communications related costs associated \n\n\n\nwith subscription to and collective use of the communications services and facilities.\u201d Regulatory Policies \nConcerning Resale and Shared Use of Common Carrier Services and Facilities, Docket No. 20097 et al., Report \nand Order, 60 FCC 2d 261, 316-17, paras. 120, 122 (1976) (Resale and Shared Use Order). The Commission \nanticipated that such a group would obtain the required services and facilities through the use of an intermediary \nthat obtained such services from a carrier in order to provide them to the group, or by one of the group members \nacting in that same basic role. Id. at 321, para. 129. In such scenarios, the Commission found it likely that the \nintermediary (or group member acting in such a role) would be acting as a private carrier, rather than as a common \ncarrier. Id. at 316-17, 319, paras. 120, 125; see also Universal Service First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd at \n9177, para. 784 (\u201c[W]e note that cost sharing for the construction and operation of private telecommunications \nnetworks does not render participants \u2018telecommunications carriers\u2019 because such arrangements do not involve \nservice \u2018directly to the public.\u2019\u201d).\n\n 656 See, e.g., Internet2 et al.

Background. UNE-P replacement services are wholesale voice services that consist of a DS0 loop, \nswitching, and shared transport, and allow competitive carriers to provide local exchange service without \nfacilities.659 In the 2015 Technology Transitions Order, the Commission concluded that, as a condition to receiving \nauthority to discontinue a legacy TDM-based service used as a wholesale input by competitive providers, an \nincumbent LEC must provide wholesale access to UNE-P replacement services and business data services at \nDS1 speed and above on reasonably comparable rates, terms, and conditions to any requesting \ntelecommunications carrier.660 This interim rule will expire when the requirements established in this Order are \npublished in the Federal Register and become effective.661 In the 2015 Technology Transitions Further Notice, the \nCommission asked whether it should extend the interim rule for UNE-P replacement services only for a further \ninterim period beyond completion of this proceeding, and if so, for how long.662 The Commission \u201crecognize[d] that \nincumbents are currently offering such commercial arrangements in TDM on a voluntary basis\u201d and further \n\u201crecognize[d] the benefits of agreements reached through market negotiations.\u201d663\n\n 276. Discussion. We return to the Commission\u2019s longstanding policy of \u201cencourag[ing] the innovation and \ninvestment that come from facilities-based competition.\u201d664 Thirteen years ago, the Commission found that \u201c[i]t is \nnow clear, as discussed below, that, in many areas, UNE-P has been a disincentive to competitive LECs\u2019 \ninfrastructure investment.\u201d665 We will no longer deter investment in next-generation facilities or distort the market \nby extending the interim rule.666\n\n 277. We find some merit to the argument that it did not make sense to tie the interim rule\u2019s termination as to UNE-P \nreplacement services to the end of this proceeding.667 However, unlike proponents of the interim rule, we find that \n\n\n\nthe appropriate remedy for this arguably erroneous decision is to permanently terminate the interim rule as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n\n 658 Technology Transitions et al., Docket 05-25 et al., Report and Order, Order on Reconsideration, and Further \nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 9372, 9443, para. 132 (2015) (2015 Technology Transitions Order or \n2015 Technology Transitions Further Notice).\n\n 659 2015 Technology Transitions Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 9453-54, para. 147.\n\n 660 Id. at 9443, para. 132.\n\n 661 Id. at 9443, para. 132. Specifically, pursuant to the 2015 Technology Transitions Order, as to both UNE-P \nreplacement services and business data services at DS1 speed or above the interim rule ends when (1) the \nCommission identifies a set of rules and/or policies that will ensure rates, terms, and conditions for special access \nservices are just and reasonable; (2) it provides notice such rules are effective in the Federal Register; and (3) \nsuch rules and/or policies become effective.

(stating that UNE-P \u201cwas designed as a tool to enable a transition to \nfacilities-based competition\u201d).\n\n 666 Since the interim rule\u2019s inception, no party has filed a discontinuance application that would trigger application \nof the interim rule.\n\n 667 See, e.g., INCOMPAS Oct. 26, 2015 Comments, GN Docket No. 13-5, at 14; Granite Oct. 26, 2015 \nComments, GN Docket No. 13-5, at 2-3; see also 2015 Technology Transitions Further Notice, 30 FCC Rcd at \n9496, para 242 (acknowledging that this proceeding does not address the status of UNE-P replacement services).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 115\n\n 278. We are not persuaded that competition will be harmed by the termination of the interim rule. Proponents of the \ninterim rule ask us to ensure that the specific wholesale inputs on which they depend are available at \u201creasonably \ncomparable\u201d rates, terms, and conditions if and when incumbent LECs transition those inputs fully to Internet \nProtocol (IP). But \u201c[o]ur statutory duty is to protect efficient competition, not competitors.\u201d668 Companies that offer \nmultilocation enterprise voice service\u2014such as Granite and the members of the Wholesale Voice Coalition\u2014\ncontend that their service is difficult to provide without access to regulated inputs due to the high cost of serving \nsome individual customer locations, the typically low number of lines per customer location, and the need to serve \n\n\n\nnumerous locations per customer.669 However, neither Granite nor any other party has linked these challenges to \ncompetitive impact. For instance, Granite has not quantified how many of its customers would become \nuneconomical to serve without the interim rule, shown how it would choose among constructing its own facilities, \nreselling cable, and reselling incumbent LEC services in the absence of the rule, nor shown how these issues \nwould affect overall competition in the market.670 Instead, supporters of extending the interim rule call for us to \nconduct a detailed examination of the marketplace for wholesale voice platform services and\u2014if we are unwilling to \ncement the rule permanently in place\u2014extend the interim rule until the study is complete.671 We decline to expend \npublic resources to further distort the market and introduce regulatory uncertainty.\n\n 279. We find the remainder of the arguments in the record in support of extending the condition similarly \nunpersuasive. Granite has argued that its overall costs would increase 159 percent if it were required to convert \nfrom purchasing UNE-P replacement services to resold incumbent LEC voice lines,672 but it has not demonstrated \nthat absent the interim rule such a conversion would be necessary, nor supported that assertion beyond submitting \na generalized declaration. We are equally unpersuaded by a June 2015 study that purports to find that loss of \nwholesale access to incumbents\u2019 voice services would result in customer harm of between $4.443 billion and \n$10.168 billion per year.673 This calculation is\n\n 668 Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems, Inc. and NYNEX Mobile Communications Company, Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder, 12 FCC Rcd 22280, 22288, para. 16 (1997).\n\n 669 See Letter from Thomas Jones, Counsel to Granite Telecommunications, LLC, to Marlene H.

Finally, we note that arguments in favor of extending the interim rule are premised on the expectation that \nwholesale voice arrangements will not occur absent regulatory action. We disagree. Incumbent LECs\u2014in particular, \nBOCs such as AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink\u2014offer UNE-P replacement services in TDM on a voluntary basis \nunder commercially negotiated terms.675 In the course of forbearing from local switching and shared transport \nunbundling obligations under section 271 in the 2015 USTelecom forbearance proceeding, the Commission \nconcluded that it did \u201cnot find persuasive Granite\u2019s argument that BOCs would never offer UNE-P replacement \nservices [in TDM] but for the section 271 \u2018backstop.\u2019\u201d676 Since that time, neither Granite nor others have shown \nthat prices or availability of TDM-based UNE-P replacement services have changed as a result of the forbearance. \nWe see no convincing reason in the record to assume that the market would operate differently in IP.677 Granite \nattempts to show otherwise by pointing to negotiations in which AT&T refused Granite\u2019s request to include a clause \nacknowledging the interim rule.678 However, the interim rule was a time-limited regulatory obligation independent \nof any contract. We fail to see how AT&T\u2019s refusal of Granite\u2019s requested belt-and-suspenders protection is \nprobative.\n\n VII. OTHER ISSUES\n\n A. Denying Applications for Review\n\n 281. The Commission delegated authority to the Bureau to implement the 2015 Collection. In carrying out this \nresponsibility, the Bureau released the Data Collection Implementation Order679 and the Data Collection \nReconsideration Order,680 making certain modifications and clarifications to the 2015 Collection requirements. \nCenturyLink and USTelecom each filed applications for review (AFR), seeking reversal of certain Bureau actions in \nthese orders. We deny these applications. We conclude that the CenturyLink AFR is moot in light of the reforms \nadopted in the Order, and we deny the USTelecom AFR because we find that the Bureau acted within its delegated \nauthority in limiting the data collection to one year.\n\n 674 Granite June 12, 2015 Ex Parte Letter Attach. at 4-5.\n\n 675 See AT&T Oct. 26, 2015 Comments, GN Docket No. 13-5, at 19; USTelecom Oct. 26, 2015 Comments, GN \nDocket No. 13-5, at 17-18; Frontier Nov. 24, 2015 Reply, GN Docket No. 13-5, at 10 (quoting USTelecom \nComments); see also USTelecom Comments, WC Docket No. 16-132 at 16 (filed Dec. 5, 2016).\n\n 676 Petition of USTelecom for Forbearance Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 160(c) from Enforcement of Obsolete ILEC \nLegacy Regulations That Inhibit Deployment of Next-Generation Networks, WC Docket No. 14-192 et al., \nMemorandum Opinion and Order, 31 FCC Rcd 6157, 6176-77 para. 34 (2015); cf.

On September 18, 2013, the Bureau released the Data Collection Implementation Order clarifying the scope \nof the collection, providing instructions on how to respond to the data collection questions, and providing a list of all \nmodifications and amendments to the data collection questions and definitions.681 These actions were based on \nfeedback received from potential respondents, including the Paper Reduction Act (PRA) comments filed with the \nCommission during the 60-day public comment period, and the Bureau\u2019s further internal review.682 The 2015 \nCollection required providers to report locations with connections. In the Data Collection Implementation Order, the \nBureau clarified that this meant the connections were considered capable of providing a dedicated service for the \npurposes of reporting locations.683 The Bureau further clarified that cable system operators in their local franchise \nareas were required \u201cto report those Locations with Connections owned or leased as an IRU (i.e., an indefeasible \nright of use) that are connected to a Node (i.e., headend) that has been upgraded or was built to provide Metro \nEthernet (or its equivalent) service, . . . regardless of the service provided over the Connection or whether the \nConnection is idle or in-service.\u201d 684 For connections not linked to a MetroE-capable node, cable system operators \nwere only required to report in-service connections used \u201cto provide a Dedicated Service or a service that \nincorporates a Dedicated Service within the offering as part of a managed solution or bundle of services sold to \nthe customer.\u201d685\n\n 283.

See Webster\u2019s New World Telecom Dictionary (2010); see also Ralph \nSantitoro, Metro Ethernet Forum White Paper, Metro Ethernet Services \u2013 A Technical Overview (2006),            \nhttp://metroethernetforum.org/Assets/WhitePapers /Metro-Ethernet-Services.pdf (providing a comprehensive \ntechnical overview of Ethernet services) (last visited Sept. 9, 2013).\n\n 685 Data Collection Implementation Order, 28 FCC Rcd 13201, para. 27.\n\n 686 CenturyLink Application for Review, WC Docket No. 05-25, RM-10593 (filed Oct. 22, 2013),            \n 687 Id. at 1, 6.\n\n 688 Opposition of ACA, WC Docket No. 05-25, RM-10593 (filed Nov. 6, 2013),            \n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 118\n\n OMB approved the collection subject to modifications on August 15, 2014.689 The most notable modifications to \nthe collection were: (1) collecting data for a single year, 2013, instead of data for two years, 2010 and 2012; (2) \nreducing the mapping requirements for cable companies to report only fiber routes making up the local transport \nnetwork and not reporting feeder routes to end user locations; (3) modifying the definition of purchasers required to \nrespond to exclude entities spending less than $5 million dollars on business data services in 2013; and (4) making \nmany of the questions directed at purchasers optional. On September 15, 2014, the Bureau released the Data \nCollection Reconsideration Order, which implemented these changes to the collection.690\n\n 285. On October 24, 2014, USTelecom filed an application seeking Commission review of the Bureau\u2019s \nmodification of the collection, in the Data Collection Reconsideration Order, to one year\u2019s worth of data as approved \nby OMB pursuant to the PRA. 691 USTelecom asserted this change \u201cexceeds the Bureau\u2019s delegated authority, \nand threatens to undermine the Commission\u2019s goals for the data collection effort.\u201d692 Oppositions to the \nUSTelecom AFR were filed by Sprint and a coalition of competitive LECs, urging the Commission to reject the \napplication as a meritless tactic to delay the proceeding.693\n\n 286. We first deny the CenturyLink AFR as moot in light of the reforms adopted in this Order. CenturyLink\u2019s \nconcern was that the Bureau\u2019s decision would result in the Commission\u2019s failing to take into account the growing \ncable competition present in the business data services market. By using Form 477 data in addition to the 2015 \nCollection data to craft the competitive market test, the Commission has ensured that the competitive market test \nfully takes cable competition into account, both in this initial test and in future updates.\n\nhttp://metroethernetforum.org/Assets/WhitePapers\n\n 287. We also deny the US Telecom AFR. In the Data Collection Order, the Commission directed the Bureau that \n\u201c[t]o the extent the Bureau cannot obtain Office of Management and Budget approval for some portion of the data \ncollection . . . to proceed with the remainder of the collection.\u201d694 The OMB approval restricted the data collection \nto one year. The Bureau thus properly proceeded pursuant to Commission delegation and continued with the data \ncollection as allowed by OMB.\n\n B. Addressing Motion to Strike\n\n 288. On June 17, 2016, CenturyLink et al. filed a motion seeking to strike from the record the analysis contained in \nthe Rysman Paper that was attached to the Further Notice and other analyses contained in the record and Further \nNotice that were based on the 2015 Collection.695 According to\n\n 689 See Information Collection(s) Being Submitted for Review and Approval to OMB, 78 Fed. Reg. 73861 (Dec. 9, \n2013); Notice of Office of Management and Budget Action, OMB Control No. 3060-1197 (Aug. 15, 2014),            \nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?refnbr=201311-3060-001#.\n\n 690 See Data Collection Reconsideration Order, 29 FCC Rcd 10899.\n\n 691 USTelecom Application for Review, WC Docket No. 05-25, RM-10593 (filed Oct. 24, 2014),            \n 692 Id. at 3.\n\n 693 Opposition of Sprint to the USTelecom AFR, WC Docket No. 05-25, RM-10593 at 1 (filed Nov. 10, 2014),            \n 694 Data Collection Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16340, para. 52, n.111.\n\n 695 CenturyLink et al. Motion to Strike, WC Docket Nos. 16-143, 15-247, 05-25 and RM-10593 (filed June 17, \n2016),            https://wwwfcc.gov/ecfs/filing/60002166255/document/60002367197 (Motion to Strike).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 119\n\n CenturyLink et al., the Rysman Paper and Further Notice were based on flawed data regarding cable entry and \ncapability in the market, which massively distorted the competitive landscape evaluated by Dr. Rysman. 696 \nUSTelecom filed comments supporting the motion.697 In light of the reforms adopted in the Order, which rely on \ncable entry as reported in the Form 477 data, we conclude that the motion to strike is moot.\n\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?refnbr=201311-3060-001#\n\n 289. CenturyLink et al.\u2019s motion to strike is in response to various cable reporting errors contained in the 2015 \nCollection. After release of the Further Notice, the Commission discovered that four cable companies \u2013 Comcast, \nCharter, Cox, and Legacy TWC \u2013 had failed to report all locations connected to Metro-E capable headends.698 \nThese companies did report in their original submissions each location to which they provided business data \nservices in 2013.699 Subsequent to this discovery, these companies supplemented their submissions, as \nnecessary, with information to indicate, or to allow the Commission to determine, those census blocks with non-\nresidential locations serviceable by Metro-E headends in 2013.700\n\n 290. Commission staff have already accounted for the supplemented cable information in the context of the \nrulemaking proceeding and updated its analysis accordingly. Moreover, the competitive market test relies heavily on \ndata from the Form 477 to determine where cable competition is present in the business data services market and \nhas based significant regulatory relief on the presence of a single cable provider located in 75 percent of the census \nblocks in a county. The arguments from CenturyLink et al. are based on the concern that the Commission would not \nhave the appropriate evidence of cable competition in evaluating the business data services market. Because we \nhave included the Form 477 data in our analysis and based significant regulatory relief on the presence of cable \ncompetition, we conclude that the motion to strike has been rendered moot and is therefore denied.\n\n C. Addressing Previously-Filed Motion Seeking Additional Information on Fiber Maps\n\n 291. The Bureau on September 18, 2015, released an order clarifying and modifying the Protective Order initially \nadopted for the 2015 Collection.701 In that order, the Bureau declined to make available to authorized parties fiber \nmapping files showing \u201cthe starting points for connections to end user locations,\u201d \u201cthe transmission paths,\u201d or \u201cthe \nconnections to end user locations\u201d in order to mitigate potential risks to critical communications infrastructure.702 \nThe Bureau as an alternative offered to\n\n 696 Motion to Strike at 3.\n\n 697 Comments of USTelecom in Support of the CenturyLink et al.\u2019s Motion to Strike, WC Docket Nos. 16-143, 15-\n247, 05-25, RM-10593 (filed June 23, 2016).\n\n 698 Letter from Michael Pryor, Counsel to Cox, to Marlene H.

Dortch, Secretary, FCC, \nWC Docket No. 05-25, at 1-2 (filed June 1, 2016).\n\n 701 Special Access for Price Cap Local Exchange Carriers; AT&T Corporation Petition for Rulemaking to Reform \nRegulation of Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Rates for Interstate Special Access Services, WC Docket No. \n05-25, RM-10593, Order and Modified Data Collection Protective Order, 30 FCC Rcd 10027 (WCB 2015) (Modified \nProtective Order).\n\n\n\n 702 Modified Protective Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 10038, para. 25.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 120\n\n \u201cprovide maps depicting the presence of fiber by listing all the providers with fiber facilities in a census block or by \nindicating a connected end-user location\u2019s distance to fiber without including information on the specific route of the \nfiber.\u201d703\n\n 292. On March 17, 2016, AT&T filed a motion seeking access to the highly confidential fiber route maps submitted \nby competitive providers in response to the 2015 Collection.704 Denying access, according to AT&T, would violate \nthe Administrative Procedure Act by not allowing it to refute claims by competitive LECs that competition only exists \nat the building level because AT&T could not \u201cshow where the CLECs have actually deployed fiber.\u201d705 \nSpecifically, AT&T asserted it could not refute arguments by showing \u201cprecisely how many locations with special \naccess demand are within the CLECs\u2019 own stated distances for lateral build-out from their fiber facilities\u201d or \n\u201ccalculate the full reach of each competitor\u2019s network.\u201d706\n\n 293. At the time AT&T had filed its motion, the Commission staff had only made available a data file identifying the \ncensus blocks in which fiber routes reported by competitive providers were present. On March 30, 2016, the Bureau \nmade available an additional data file providing the distances from each unique reported location to each \ncompetitive provider\u2019s fiber network. AT&T, its economists, and other commenters have relied on this information in \nadvocating their positions in this proceeding.707 We find the alternative data file that Commission staff provided \naddresses AT&T\u2019s identified concerns, and we therefore deny the motion.\n\n D. Severability\n\n 294. All of the rules and policies that are adopted in this Order are designed to work in unison to ensure that rates \nfor business data services are just and reasonable while also encouraging facilities-based competition and \nfacilitating technology transitions. However, each of the separate reforms we undertake in this Order serves a \nparticular function toward these goals. Therefore, it is our intent that each of the rules and policies adopted herein \nshall be severable. If any of the rules or policies is declared invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it is our intent \nthat the remaining rules shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n E. Delegation of Authority to Bureau to Correct Errors and Omissions\n\n 295. Given the complexities associated with modifying existing rules as well as other reforms adopted in this Order, \nwe delegate authority to the Wireline Competition Bureau to make any further rule revisions extending only to \ntechnical and conforming edits to ensure that the reforms adopted in this Order are properly reflected in the rules. If \nany such rule changes are warranted, the Bureau shall be responsible for such changes. We note that any entity \nthat disagrees with a rule change made on delegated authority will have the opportunity to file an Application for \nReview by the full Commission.708\n\n 296. In addition, we take this opportunity to make several non-substantive rule amendments as reflected in \nAppendix A. We find that notice and comment is unnecessary for rule amendments to ensure\n\n 703 Id.\n\n\n\n 704 Motion of AT&T Inc. to Make Fiber Maps Available, WC Docket No. 05-25 and RM-10593 (filed Mar. 17, 2016),       \n     https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/60001535923.pdf (AT&T Motion).\n\n 705 AT&T Motion at 2.\n\n 706 Id. at 7.\n\n 707 See, e.g., Second IRW Paper at 41 (discussing reliance on \u201cFCC-generated fiber and fiber node distance to \nbuilding resources\u201d).\n\n 708 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 155(c)(1), (4).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 121\n\n consistency in terminology and cross references across various rules, correct inadvertent failures to make \nconforming changes when prior rule amendments occurred, and to delete references to rules governing past time \nperiods that no longer are applicable.\n\n VIII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS\n\n A. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis\n\n 297. This document contains new information collection requirements subject to the PRA. It will be submitted to \nOMB for review under section 3507(d) of the PRA. OMB, the general public, and other Federal agencies are invited \nto comment on the new information collection requirements contained in this proceeding. In addition, we note that \npursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002,709 we previously sought specific comment on how \nthe Commission might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than \n25 employees. We describe impacts that might affect small businesses, which includes most businesses with fewer \nthan 25 employees, in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in Appendix C.\n\n B. Congressional Review Act\n\n 298. The Commission will send a copy of this Report and Order to Congress and the Government Accountability \nOffice pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.710\n\n C.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),711 an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was \nincorporated into the Further Notice.712 The Commission sought written public comment on the possible significant \neconomic impact on small entities regarding the proposals addressed in the Further Notice, including comments on \nthe IRFA. Pursuant to the RFA, a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is set forth in Appendix C.\n\n D. Data Quality Act\n\n\n 300.

In the Business Data Services Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on, among other matters, \nwhether it should incorporate a productivity-based X-factor into its price cap formula for business data services on \na going-forward basis.\n\n 2. 1 The Commission also asked whether business data services (BDS) productivity gains had outpaced those in \nthe general economy and, if so, whether it \u201cshould adjust baseline price cap levels to capture those gains for \nratepayers.\u201d2 The Further Notice also invited comment on the methodology and datasets that the Commission \nmight use to calculate an X-factor and catch-up adjustment to price cap indexes.3 This Appendix provides \nadditional information on that methodology and those datasets, and describes the parties\u2019 responses to these \nportions of the Further Notice.\n\n II. PRICE CAP REGULATION\n\n 3. The core component of the Commission\u2019s price cap system is the price cap index, which is designed to limit the \nprices that certain incumbent local exchange carriers (incumbent LECs) charge for services.4 The price cap index \nhistorically has had three basic components: (a) a measure of inflation (currently the Gross Domestic Product Price \nIndex (GDP-PI));5 (b) a productivity factor or \u201cX-factor,\u201d that represented the amount by which incumbent LECs \ncould be expected to outperform the general economy;6 and (c) adjustments to account for \u201cexogenous\u201d cost \nchanges outside the price cap LEC\u2019s\n\n 1 Business Data Services in an Internet Protocol Environment; Investigation of Certain Price Cap Local Exchange \nCarrier Business Data Services Tariff Pricing Plans; Special Access for Price Cap Local Exchange Carriers; AT&T \nCorporation Petition for Rulemaking to Reform Regulation of Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Rates for Interstate \nSpecial Access Services, WC Docket Nos. 05-25, 15-247, and 05-25, RM-10593, Tariff Investigation Order and \nFurther Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 31 FCC Rcd 4723, 4866, para. 364 (2016) (Tariff Investigation Order or \nFurther Notice) (stating that a \u201cproductivity-based X-factor . . . had been a fundamental feature of the Commission\u2019s \nprice cap system from the system\u2019s inception in 1987 until the adoption of the CALLS plan\u201d).\n\n 2 Id. at 4876, para. 403.

Price cap regulation sets a ceiling on the prices that a firm may charge. One attractive feature of price cap \nregulation, relative to rate-of-return regulation, is that it improves the firm\u2019s incentives to reduce its costs, because \nthe firm is allowed to keep the savings it obtains as profit. A simple example of a price cap is a requirement to hold \nprices constant. In that circumstance, if the firm reduces its costs and maintains its sales volume, its profits rise by \nthe amount of the cost reductions.\n\n 5. Price cap regulation works best when it is based on factors that measure a firm\u2019s performance but are largely \noutside the firm\u2019s control. For example, suppose that a regulator adjusts a firm\u2019s price cap for the next year based \non the firm\u2019s profits during the current year. In that case, price cap regulation would function much like (and suffer \nfrom essentially the same basic shortcomings as) rate-of-return regulation: the firm would recognize that, were it to \nearn high profits in the current year by reducing its costs and charging the maximum prices allowed under the \ncurrent cap, the following year\u2019s cap would be lower, and the firm would have to find a way to reduce its costs again \njust to maintain its profit level. Thus, the firm\u2019s incentives to reduce its costs would be dampened.8\n\n 6. Because changes in economy-wide conditions, such as changes in the rate of inflation, can affect a price \ncapped firm\u2019s capacity to recover costs, price caps typically are set using a formula that incorporates a general \nprice index as well as an adjustment factor\u2014sometimes called the \u201cX-factor\u201d\u2014that captures inherent differences \nbetween the determinants of economy-wide prices and the determinants of industry-specific (but not firm-specific) \nprices.9 Under this formulation, price caps will automatically adjust to the general inflation rate (which captures a \nrange of effects, including economy-wide changes in productivity) while continuing to provide incentives for each \nregulated firm to outperform the overall economy.\n\nhttp://www.bea.gov/iTable/indexnipa.cfm\n\n\n 7. From an economic standpoint, the regulation of firms with market power is designed to produce outcomes that \nresemble the ones that would prevail in effectively competitive markets. In such markets, firms expect over the long \nrun to just recover their opportunity costs, and thus to earn zero economic profits.10 If the zero-economic-profit \ncondition is maintained across time periods, the growth rate in a firm\u2019s prices equals the difference between the \ngrowth rates of the firm\u2019s input costs and productivity level.11 This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n 7 1990 Price Cap Order, 5 FCC Rcd at 6792, 6807-10, paras. 48, 166-90. Exogenous costs adjustments allow a \ncarrier to modify its price cap to reflect changes outside its control and include, for example, changes in Universal \nService Fund or TRS contribution amounts. The carrier can choose whether it wants to collect such amounts \ndirectly from its end users through rate adjustments. See id. at 6807, para. 166.\n\n 8 See, e.g., John R. Haring and Evan R. Kwerel, Competition Policy in the Post-Equal Access Market, FCC Office \nof Plans and Policy Working Paper No. 22 (Feb. 11, 1987),            \n 9 See, e.g., Ian Bradley and Catherine Price, The Economic Regulation of Private Industries by Price Constraints, \n37 J.

A firm earns zero economic profit when its profit equals its \nopportunity cost.

Equation (1) \nsuggests that a regulator that wants to enforce the zero-economic-profit condition through an adjustable price cap \nought to continuously set the cap so that its growth rate over time (denoted by\n\n ) equals the difference between the observed growth rates of the firm\u2019s input costs and productivity:\n\n (2)\n\n This approach, however, would nullify the firm\u2019s incentives to reduce costs and improve efficiency, thereby \ndefeating the purpose of price caps. Under such an approach, if the firm were to reduce its costs, it would gain \nnothing, as the price cap would require the firm\u2019s prices to fall reflecting those lower costs. Similarly, if the firm \nstopped trying to hold its costs in check, thereby allowing costs to rise, it would lose nothing, as the price cap would \nloosen, allowing the firm\u2019s prices to rise to capture the new higher costs.\n\n 8. The staff calculations presented in the Business Data Services Further Notice use a formula derived from \nEquation (2)\u2014the variables of which are based on industry and economy-wide data largely beyond the control of \nthe regulated firm\u2014with the aim of providing cost-reduction incentives that mimic competitive-market outcomes.12 \nIn particular, the calculations use a measure of the economy-wide rate of inflation based on a national price index \n(i.e., GDP-PI) adjusted to account for the (historically observed) difference between the growth rates of national \nprices and estimates of BDS specific input prices less BDS productivity growth.13 In short, the price cap index is \nestimated as follows:\n\n (3)\n\n where\n\n is the economy-wide rate of inflation (i.e., GDP-PI),\n\n is the projected difference between the economy-wide rate of inflation and the growth rate of industry input prices, \nand\n\n is the projected growth rate of the industry\u2019s productivity level.14 The X-factor, which is the sum of\n\n and\n\n , may be interpreted as a correction term by which the projected growth rate of economy-wide prices (as estimated \nby the historical change in those prices, P) is adjusted to account for historically observed differences between the \nbroader economy and the business data services sector.\n\n 9. An X-factor may be calculated by subtracting the historical changes in BDS prices from the historical changes in \nGDP-PI (thereby obtaining a projection,\n\n , of what that difference will be in the future\n\n , and adding the historical change in BDS industry total factor productivity (TFP) (which provides an estimate of\n\n\n\n . Consistent with our decision in the Report and Order, we use the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis\u2019 (BEA\u2019s) chain-weighted GDP-PI as the measure of economy-wide inflation.15 The calculation \nof the X-factor can be expressed by the following formula: (Continued from previous page)\n\n (1957); and Dale W.

The X-factor analyses presented by the parties generally follow this approach.16 Sprint consultants Drs. David \nE.M. Sappington and William P. Zarakas favor a different approach, but do not reject the approach in Equation (4). \nThey argue that, while, \u201cin practice, it can be difficult to predict accurately the rates at which productivity and input \nprices will increase in an industry\u2026, it often is less difficult to forecast the extent to which productivity and input \nprices will increase more rapidly in the industry than in the economy as a whole.\u201d17 They therefore recommend that \nthe X-factor equal the sum of two differences:\n\n X-factor = (% \u0394 Industry TFP \u2013 % \u0394 Economy TFP) + (% \u0394 Economy Input Price Index (5) \u2013 % \u0394 Industry Input \nPrice Index)18\n\n 11. We agree with Sappington and Zarakas that, for certain variables, industry-level deviations from economy-wide \nvalues can exhibit greater stability over time than the actual industry-level values, and hence that projections based \non the deviations can be more accurate than projections based on historical values. We believe, however, that this \nstatement is more likely to hold for input prices than for total factor productivity levels. Because the economy-wide \ninput price index is an average that comprises input price indexes from different industries, there is a systematic \nrelationship (which is admittedly prone to time-varying shocks in other sectors) between the economy-wide input \n\nhttp://www.bea.gov/iTable/indexnipa.cfm\n\n\nprice index and the industry-specific input price index. On the other hand, total factor productivity, at both the \neconomy-wide and industry-specific levels, is generally computed as a residual\u2014a ratio of outputs to inputs\u2014and \nhence is likely to include more unexplained variation at both levels. As a result, any systematic relationship between \neconomy-wide total factor productivity and industry-specific total factor productivity may be more difficult to measure \nprecisely.19 Thus, while we do use deviations (i.e., by using\n\n in Equation (3))\u2014as is consistent with the view of Sappington and Zarakas\u2014to predict the growth rate of industry \ninput prices, we use historical estimates of actual values (by using\n\n in Equation (3)) to project the growth\n\n 16 See Letter from Kyle J.

E, Sappington & Zarakas Decl. at 16-17.\n\n 19 Our calculations support this conclusion. In particular, we use U.S. Dept. of Labor, Bur. of Labor Statistics (BLS) \nestimates of the following four time series, each of which spans the years 1987 through 2014: (1) economy-wide \ninput-price indexes, (2) economy-wide multifactor productivity levels, (3) industry-level input-price indexes, and (4) \nindustry-level multifactor productivity levels. The first two time series cover the private nonfarm business sector \n(excluding government enterprises) and are drawn from the Private Business and Private Nonfarm Business \nMultifactor Productivity Tables. The last two time series are drawn from the Nonmanufacturing Sectors and NIPA-\nlevel Nonmanufacturing Industries KLEMS Multifactor Productivity Tables, specifically for the broadcasting and \ntelecommunications (NAICS 515, 517) sectors. See BLS, Multifactor Productivity Tables (1987-2014),            \nhttp://www.bls.gov/mfp/mprdload.htm. Based on these time series, we estimate the correlation coefficient between \nthe economy-wide input-price index and the industry-level input-price index to be about 0.889 and the correlation \ncoefficient between the economy-wide multifactor productivity level and the industry-level multifactor productivity \nlevel to be about 0.779. That is, the industry-level input-price index more closely tracks its economy-wide analogue \nthan does the industry-level multifactor productivity level.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 132\n\n rate of industry total factor productivity. In addition, we note that the appropriate choices of economy-wide \nmeasures of input prices and total factor productivity are not obvious and, due to the aggregation across industries, \nare likely to be more difficult to measure precisely than their industry-level counterparts. For this reason, we prefer \nto avoid using economy-wide measures of input prices and total factor productivity; the only economy-wide \nmeasure that is used in our approach is GDP-PI. In short, we prefer the approach that is set forth in Equation (3) \nand operationalized in Equation (4) to the one that Sappington and Zarakas propose in Equation (5).\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/mfp/mprdload.htm\n\n\n 12. TFP is the relationship between the output of goods and services to inputs,20 and is commonly used to \nmeasure productivity growth in the economy as a whole. 21 In the past, the Commission has relied on staff studies \nof the historical TFP growth rate among incumbent LECs in setting a productivity-based X-factor.22 TFP studies \ntypically measure productivity using the ratio of an index of the outputs of a firm, industry, or group of industries to \nan index of the inputs used to produce the outputs. Productivity growth is measured by changes in this ratio over \ntime.23 Multiple outputs, such as DS1s and DS3s, are aggregated into a single index by weighting the sales made \nof each, for example, by revenue shares.24 The resulting output index shows changes in the level of output over \ntime (that is, provides the growth rate of the measured output). Multiple inputs, are treated similarly to create a \nsingle index for inputs. The growth rate of the aggregate input index depends on the combined growth rates of the \nindividual inputs, such as capital, labor, energy, materials and services, weighted, for example, by input \nexpenditure shares.25\n\n 13. In the Report and Order, we use TFP analysis to calculate a forward-looking X-factor but conclude that a catch-\nup adjustment is not warranted. The forward-looking X-factor will ensure that the price cap indices will properly \nrecognize future productivity gains, relative to growth in the general economy.\n\n III. DATA SOURCES\n\n 14. In the Further Notice, the Commission invited comment on three datasets that could be used in determining a \nproductivity-based X-factor and any catch-up adjustments.26 We describe those datasets as well as an additional \ndataset suggested by Sprint.\n\n A.

Meitzen and Schoech point out that the Commission has in the past used \u201cindustry-wide productivity growth\u201d to \ndetermine the X-factor for a narrower group of services.36 They suggest that \u201c[b]ecause of the significance of joint \nand common costs in the provision of telecommunications services,\u201d narrower measures of productivity \u201cfor a \nsubset of services generally are not uniquely defined from an economic perspective.\u201d37 They state, however, that \n\u201cgiven that BDS is largely provided with legacy technologies and demand growth for services using these \ntechnologies is declining relative to the total bundle of services provided by current telecommunications plant, it is \nlikely that telecommunications industry-wide TFP growth represents an upper bound for the TFP growth realized by \nBDS services.\u201d38 AT&T asserts that this dataset \u201clikely overstates productivity gains for the small subset of TDM-\nbased DSn services\u201d because \u201c[m]ost of the telecommunications productivity gains captured in the BLS measure . . \n. are likely attributable to productivity gains in other telecommunications services that are the focus of far greater \n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag517.htm\nhttp://www.bea.gov/faq/index.cfm?faqid=192\n\ninvestment and technological dynamism than legacy DSn services, including wireless services, broadband \nEthernet services, and cable and wireline Internet access services.\u201d39 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau assert that \nthe Commission\u2019s estimates \u201clikely [. . . ] overstate very significantly the cost reductions that suppliers of DS1 and \nDS3 services experienced\u201d because the telecommunications sector is \u201ccharacterized by very different segments\u201d \nsuch as wireless and cable services \u201cfacing different cost conditions.\u201d40\n\n 18.

Several commenters criticize KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) as a tool for determining an X-\nfactor and catch-up adjustment because that database is not limited to business data services, but rather \ncommingles statistics from the telecommunications and broadcasting industries.44 Sappington and Zarakas argue \nthat sources including KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) could lead to \u201cinappropriate inferences \nabout productivity trends in the telecommunications industry because of distinct and irrelevant productivity trends in \nthe\u2026broadcasting industries.\u201d45 Ad Hoc argues that KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) understates \nbusiness data services productivity growth \u201cby using too broad a segment of industry.\u201d46\n\n 20. Commenters note that the telecommunications subset of the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) \ndatabase commingles data from the telecommunications sector as a whole, including wired, wireless, satellite, and \ncable telecommunications.47 While favoring KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications), AT&T argues that \nmost of the telecommunication productivity gains are likely attributable to services other than legacy DSn services, \nincluding \u201cwireless services, broadband Ethernet services, and cable and wireline Internet access services.\u201d48 \nSchankerman and R\u00e9gibeau agree and assert that KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) overstates \nproductivity growth in DSn services.49\n\n 21. Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau state that based on 2014 employment and wages data, the broadcasting sector \naccounts for only about a quarter of the overall KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) sector data so any \nbias should be limited.50 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau point out that from 2005 to 2014 average annual labor \nproductivity grew faster in broadcasting than in wired telecommunications, and they therefore dispute whether the \nbroadcasting component of KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) has lower productivity growth than the \nwired components of that database.51 AT&T echoes these statements, adding that \u201c[g]iven that labor productivity is \nsuch a large component of TFP, these labor productivity data strongly suggest that wired TFP has lagged combined \nindustry TFP,\u201d which in turn suggests that productivity growth in business data services lagged behind the growth \nin the combined industries; therefore the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications)-based X-factor should be \nlower.52\n\n 42 Letter from Kyle J.

The Commission\u2019s October 7, 2016 fact sheet proposed a 3.0 percent X-factor despite an implied 2.0 percent \nX-factor based purely on KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data.53 AT&T asserts that the \nmethodology behind this proposal \u201capparently relie[d] on the fact that the X-factors the Commission adopted in \n1990, 1995, and 1997 were higher than the [X-factors derived from KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications)] data for the years in which those X-factors applied, and assume[d] that the difference \nestablishes some sort of constant \u2018FCC additive\u2019 that remains today.\u201d54 AT&T contends that \u201ceven if it is true that \nthe Commission\u2019s higher X-factors in the 1990s were more \u2018accurate\u2019 than [X-factors derived from KLEMS \n(Broadcasting and Telecommunications)] data from the same period, there is no reason to believe that such a \nrelationship remains constant two decades later\u201d particularly given the \u201crapid decline\u201d in TDM services since the \n1990s.55 AT&T claims that those X-factors represented not special access but \u201cinterstate access services as a \nwhole\u201d which was \u201cdominated by switched access,\u201d which experienced \u201cextremely rapid growth\u201d during the relevant \nperiods compared to \u201cspecial access.\u201d56 AT&T emphasizes that the 1990 and 1995 staff productivity studies upon \nwhich the X-factors were based did not include \u201cspecial access.\u201d57\n\n 23. In contrast, Sprint suggests that an X-factor based solely on KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) \ndata would be too low. Sprint points out that in the 1999 Price Cap Performance Review proceeding, the \nCommission staff computed X-factors for each of the years 1986 through 1998 using price cap LEC-specific data \nthat were significantly higher than the X-factors that would have been computed using KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) data.58 Sprint maintains that the differences between these X-factors suggest a potential \ndownward bias in X-factor results based on KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) data that the \nCommission must take into account in any analysis that relies on those data to determine an X-factor.59\n\n 24. Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau contend that no adjustment to the KLEMS (Broadcasting and \nTelecommunications) results is necessary for several reasons.60 First, they maintain that the \u201cindustry has \nundergone transformative change in the . . . decades\u201d since the 1999 Price Cap Performance Review proceeding, \n\u201cwith wireless services largely replacing wireline telecommunications, switched access minutes declining with \naccess lines, special access transitioning from TDM to IP packet-based services, and increased competitive entry \nfrom CLECS and cable companies.\u201d61 Second, they argue that the X-factors adopted in the 1980s and 1990s were \nbased on Automated Reporting Management Information System (ARMIS) data, embedded with \u201carbitrary\u201d joint \ncost allocations, primarily comprised of switch\n\n 53 See Chairman Wheeler\u2019s Proposal to Promote Fairness, Competition, and Investment in the Business Data \nServices Market, FCC Fact Sheet,            https://wwwfcc.gov/document/chmn-wheelers-update-business-data-\nservices-rules (Oct. 7, 2016) (FCC Oct. 7, 2016 Fact Sheet).\n\n\n 54 AT&T Nov. 10, 2016 Letter at 2; Letter from James P.

Sappington and Zarakas conclude that the new price cap regime should employ an X-factor of at least 4.4 \npercent, as \u201ca conservative estimate of the extent to which the price cap LECs are likely to experience more rapid \nproductivity growth and less rapid input price growth than other firms in the U.S. economy in the near future\u201d74 This \nproposed going-forward X-factor reflects the application of equation 5, above, to the KLEMS (Telecommunications) \ndata for the period 1997-2010.75\n\n 29. Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau on behalf of CenturyLink argue that the KLEMS (Telecommunications) approach \nis inappropriate in part because \u201cdata that appears under the \u2018Telecommunications\u2019 heading in the [KLEMS \n(Telecommunications)] data for the US does not isolate the telecommunications sector.\u201d76 Schankerman and \nR\u00e9gibeau are critical of the KLEMS (Telecommunications) TFP measure because it is based on \u201cvalue-added, not \ngross output\u201d which needs to rely on \u201cvery restrictive assumptions on the shape of the underlying (gross output) \nproduction function\u201d to be meaningful.77 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau assert that \u201ceven if these conditions were \nsatisfied, the rate of growth in TFP obtained on a value-added basis will systematically be higher than the true rate \nof growth in TFP based on gross output.\u201d78 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau also note that KLEMS \n(Telecommunications) does not include inputs such as capital and labor \u201cwhich make up most of value-added and \nmore than half of total costs\u201d which leads to inconsistency \u201cbetween the TFP measure (which is based on value \nadded) and the input price index used.\u201d79 Connect America Cost Model (CACM)\n\n 30.

The second dataset discussed in the Further Notice applies the \nunderlying cost structure for telecommunications supply found in the Connect America Cost Model (CACM) to a \nrange of input price changes.

Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau argue that cost simulation models like CACM vary across companies, and \nchoosing one over any others for the purpose of price cap regulation is \u201cdifficult to justify.\u201d97 First, they assert that \nbecause cost simulation models vary across companies, it is difficult to justify a single model for calculating the \nprice cap. They assert that such models are highly sensitive to model structure and assumptions.98 They also \nargue that the CACM peer review cost categories are \u201cnot exhaustive.\u201d99 Furthermore, they note that CACM was \ndesigned for residential services, not business data services.100 They state that CACM does not provide its own \nmeasure of TFP, and it is a model for estimation, not a record from experience.101 They oppose including an input \nprice index and productivity measure from different sources arguing that a \u201cproperly derived measure\u201d of total factor \nproductivity should correspond to the index of input prices.102\n\n\n 39. Sprint CACM Dataset. Drs. Chris Frentrup and David E.M. Sappington suggest, on behalf of Sprint, several \nrefinements to the CACM dataset used in the Further Notice which they assert is superior to KLEMS (Broadcasting \nand Telecommunications) for estimating business data services productivity growth relative to productivity growth \nin the overall economy. They replace the TFP measure used in the Further Notice with the TFP measure from \nKLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications).

Although the input price changes for \nresidential broadband and voice services developed during the CACM peer review process differ BDS input price \nchanges, Frentrup and Sappington state that the CACM peer review measures reflect changes \u201cfor a wireline \nnetwork rather than for the entire broadcasting and telecommunications industries combined, and so are likely to \nbetter reflect BDS input price growth rates than are the corresponding rates calculated using [KLEMS (Broadcasting \nand Telecommunications)] data.\u201d104 Frentrup and Sappington also modify the CACM dataset used in the Further \n\n\n\nNotice to account for depreciation and the cost of capital, operating expenses attributable to plant investment, and \noperating expenses that cannot be attributed to specific plant investment.105\n\n 40. AT&T and CenturyLink assert that the KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) dataset is preferable to \nthe CACM dataset because the former provides a consistent methodology.106 Frentrup and Sappington respond \nthat \u201c[a]lthough the calculations would be consistent, they would pertain to the combined broadcasting and \ntelecommunications industries, not the BDS industry, and in this sense could well be \u2018consistently incorrect\u2019 for the \npresent purpose.\u201d107 In the absence of a \u201csuperior alternative that is publicly available,\u201d Frentrup and Sappington \nargue that they were \u201ccompelled to use\u201d TFP data from KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications).108 \nFrentrup and Sappington argue that CACM data provide \u201ca viable alternative\u201d that pertain to the wireline \ntelecommunications sector, rather than the combined broadcasting and telecommunications industries.109\n\n 41. Based on this refined CACM dataset, Frentrup and Sappington recommend a catch-up adjustment of 17.1 \npercent.110 Based on data for 1997 through 2014, they propose an X-factor of 3.94 percent. They use this period, \nrather than 2005 to 2014, because the recession during the latter period decreased productively growth and using \nthat period \u201cmay well understate the TFP growth that is likely to prevail during the upcoming phase of price cap \nregulation.\u201d111\n\n 42. Meitzen and Schoech assert that the Frentrup and Sappington proposal is internally inconsistent. They state \nthat using KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications)-based TFP data to develop the TFP growth rate, on the \none hand, and input price growth estimates and national CACM-based capital input proportions developed by \nCommission staff during the CACM peer review process to develop the overall input price growth rate, on the other \nhand, results in a mathematically and economically incorrect mismatch.112 Meitzen and Schoech argue that the \nTFP and input price growth\n\n 103 Letter from Jennifer Bagg, Counsel for Sprint, to Marlene H.

Meitzen and Schoech argue that the data sources on which the Commission staff relied in the Further Notice \n(and on which Frentrup and Sappington rely) is incomplete because it reflects wages, but not other types of labor \ncompensation that account for a large fraction of labor costs.117 Specifically, Meitzen and Schoech assert that from \n2001 to 2014 fringe benefits increased much faster than wages.118 They add that this understatement has a large \neffect on Frentrup and Sappington\u2019s calculations because they assume that capitalized labor costs are almost 60 \npercent of all capital costs, and higher fractions of operational expenditures.119\n\n 44. Meitzen and Schoech argue that the proportions that Frentrup and Sappington use to weight different capital \ncosts are the proportions of these costs developed in the staff response to the CACM peer review, and that these \ndo not reflect the proportions of capital inputs actually used by incumbent LECs to supply price-regulated BDS \nservices.120 Meitzen and Schoech further argue that these capital inputs reflect a national run of a \u201cscorched node \nproxy model that instantaneously places a new uniform network using the existing wire center locations of the \nincumbent provider using forward-looking, least-cost technologies.\u201d121 They add that the CACM \u201clinks these wire \ncenters to customer locations, assuming all-at-once optimized cable routes and cable sizes along roads now \nexisting.\u201d122 In contrast, Meitzen and Schoech contend that \u201cBDS networks have been built over the past 50 years \nusing the blend of technologies that was available at the time.\u201d123 Meitzen and Schoech further argue that BDS \nnetworks, unlike the network represented by the CACM model, neither connect to all residences and businesses, \nnor provide mass-market, best-efforts broadband service.124 They add that BDS networks\n\n (Continued from previous page)\n\n Christensen Associates, Christensen Associates: BDS X-Factor Issues (dated Aug. 12, 2016), at 3-7 (filed Aug. 16, \n2016) (AT&T Aug. 16, 2016 Ex Parte).\n\n 113 AT&T Sept. 22, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 3-7.\n\n 114 Id. at 10.\n\n\n\n 115 Id. at 10-11.\n\n 116 Id. at 9.\n\n 117 Id. at 11-12.\n\n 118 Id.\n\n 119 Id.\n\n 120 Id. at 12-14.\n\n 121 Id. at 13.\n\n 122 Id.\n\n 123 Id.\n\n 124 Id.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 144\n\n provide \u201cspecially engineered and designed circuits individually built to serve the idiosyncratic and highly variable \nBDS demand that has existed and evolved at each particular location.\u201d125\n\n 45. Meitzen and Schoech argue that Frentrup and Sappington\u2019s estimates of the economic user cost for the \nvarious capital inputs incorrectly ignore the cost-of-removal and salvage value, changes in finance costs or taxes, \nand technological or price changes for newer, substitutable inputs.126 Meitzen and Schoech conclude that Frentrup \nand Sappington\u2019s input price index does not accurately measure capital input price changes because of these \nerrors.127\n\n 46. Meitzen and Schoech argue that Frentrup and Sappington assume, without justification that labor accounts for \nan \u201coverwhelming []\u201d fraction of operating expenses.128 At the same time, Meitzen and Schoech assert that energy, \nmaterials and services account for none of Frentrup and Sappington\u2019s operating expenses, even though energy, \nmaterials and services account for 45 percent of the total KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) \nexpense.129 Based on Frentrup and Sappington\u2019s assumptions, Meitzen and Schoech claim that \u201clabor not only \naccounts for 59.6% of total capital costs, but also 99% of non-plant-based [operating expense] costs, and very \nsignificant portions of plant-specific and plant-non-specific [operating expense] costs.\u201d130\n\n\n\n 47. Meitzen and Schoech contend that the Frentrup and Sappington argument for using the 1997 to 2014 data \nperiod rather than 2005 to 2014 (i.e., that the shorter period of data are too affected by the recession) to estimate \nthe X-factor is incorrect.131 Meitzen and Schoech argue the recession period, 2007 to 2009, only accounts for one-\nthird of the shorter period.132 Meitzen and Schoech further argue that \u201conly if the recession reduced \ntelecommunications TFP growth by more than it did national TFP growth would the recession have an effect on the \nX factor. But it did not.\u201d133 Moreover, Meitzen and Schoech assert that the data Frentrup and Sappington actually \nuse are \u201cfrom inconsistent time periods and none is tethered to 1997 to 2014.\u201d134\n\n 48. In response to criticism from Meitzen and Schoech that Sprint\u2019s CACM cost estimates are too forward-\nlooking,135 Frentrup argues that \u201cit is reasonable for a regulatory agency to reflect the cost changes that an \nefficient supplier is likely to experience during the upcoming period of price cap regulation.\u201d136 Frentrup adjusted \nSprint\u2019s CACM analysis in response to Meitzen and Schoech empirical critiques and finds that the net effect would \nbe an increase in the productivity factor from 3.94 to 4.31 percent, and an increase in the catch-up adjustment from \n17.12 to 20.50 percent.137\n\n 125 Id.\n\n 126 Id. at 15-17.\n\n 127 Id. at 15-17.\n\n 128 Id. at 17-18.\n\n 129 Id. at 17-18.\n\n 130 Id.\n\n 131 Id. at 19.\n\n 132 AT&T Sept. 22, 2016 Letter, Meitzen & Schoech Decl. at 17-18.\n\n 133 Id.\n\n 134 Id. at 19-20.\n\n 135 Id. at 3.\n\n 136 Letter from Dr. Chris Frentrup, Senior Economist, Sprint, to Marlene H.

Meitzen and Schoech respond that while \u201cthe X factor should be forward-looking,\u201d it should also \u201creflect the \nlevel of productivity growth that firms actually providing BDS may be expected to achieve,\u201d which is \u201cbest \ndetermined by looking to recent history of what productivity levels BDS producers have actually been able to \nachieve\u201d as opposed to CACM \u201chypothetical\u201d productivity.138 They contend that Sprint\u2019s revised CACM approach is \nstill \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d because \u201cthe estimates of TFP that one obtains depend crucially on the index of input \nprices used;\u201d different input price indexes lead to different estimates of TFP.139 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau \ncharacterize Sprint\u2019s CACM proposal as combining an input price index derived from CACM, with some \nmodifications, and a TFP index derived from KLEMS (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) in order to narrowly \nfocus the dataset on BDS productivity as opposed to the broader dataset.140 Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau assert, \nhowever, that \u201cit is a basic and well-established principle in productivity measurement that the index of TFP and the \nindex of input prices \u2013 which are key elements to determine reset and X-factor \u2013 must be derived from a unified \nframework.\u201d141 They purport to show that if \u201cone properly adjust the TFP index to maintain consistency between \nthe input price and productivity indexes, there is no change to the X-factor.\u201d142 Meitzen and Schoech agree with \nthe Schankerman and R\u00e9gibeau critiques, asserting that combining CACM-based input prices with KLEMS \n(Broadcasting and Telecommunications)-based TFP \u201cviolates the economic principle of duality.\u201d143\n\n C.

Our final dataset discussed in the Further Notice combines data from TDS Metrocom\u2019s (TDS\u2019s) incumbent LEC \noperations with data from our CACM calculations, as described above. In an ex parte filing, TDS divided its \nincumbent LEC\u2019s costs into four categories: labor, real estate, switching, and transmission.144 We used these \ncategories as an alternative set of input categories. While the labor and real estate categories correspond to \ncategories in the staff\u2019s response to the CACM peer review, we mapped the remaining eight CACM categories to \nthe TDS categories for switching and transmission. Specifically, staff combined the CACM fiber, poles, conduit, \ndrop, ONT, and fiber pedestals categories into switching, and combined the CACM splitters and electronics \ncategories into transmission.145 The category shares in our third set of calculations reflect TDS\u2019s cost shares. \nStaff\u2019s calculations otherwise mirror those in the CACM peer review approach discussed above, using the same \nhigh and low estimates for changes in costs and productivity.\n\n 138 Letter from Keith M.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA)149, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility \nAnalysis (IRFA) was incorporated into the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further Notice) for the business \ndata services (BDS) proceeding.150 The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the \nFurther Notice, including comment on the IRFA. The Commission received no comments on the IRFA. Because the \nCommission amends its rules in this Report and Order, the Commission has included this Final Regulatory \nFlexibility Analysis (FRFA). This present FRFA conforms to the RFA.151\n\n D. Need for, and Objectives of, the Rules\n\n 2. In the Further Notice, the Commission proposed to replace the existing business data services regulatory \nstructure with a new technology-neutral framework and sought comprehensive comments on the proposed new \nframework.152 This Order, therefore, provides a new framework for business data services that minimizes \nunnecessary government intervention and allows market forces to continue working to spur entry, innovation and \ncompetition.153\n\n 3. Based on the 2015 Collection, the Commission makes findings as to the relevant market for analysis, trends in \ncompetition, and the presence of market power. Significantly, the Commission finds competition in the provision of \nthe following business data services to be sufficiently widespread that pricing regulation would be \n\nhttp://www.bea.gov/iTable\nhttp://www.bls.gov/mfp/mprdload.htm\n\n\ncounterproductive: packet-based business data services, optical transmission services with bandwidths in excess \nof a DS3, and TDM transport services. The Commission, therefore, declines to adopt, and where applicable ends, \nex ante pricing regulation for such services. With respect to the provision of TDM end user channel terminations, \nthe Commission adopts the following competitive market test. For a particular county if: 50 percent of the buildings \nin that county are within a half mile of a location served by a competitive provider based on the 2015 Collection or \n75 percent of the census blocks in a county have a cable provider present based on Form 477 data, the \nCommission finds that ex ante pricing regulation of that county would be counterproductive. The services relieved \nof ex ante pricing regulation will be subject to permissive detariffing for a period of 18 months at which time they will \nbe subject to mandatory detariffing.\n\n 4. For counties that do not meet the competitive market test, the Commission will retain price cap regulation for \nincumbent LEC provision of DS1 and DS3 end user channel terminations and apply the principles of Phase I pricing \nflexibility to these counties, which will permit the carriers to offer volume and term discounts, as well as contract \ntariffs. These services will also be subject to a productivity-based X factor of 2.0 percent and restrictions on the \nincumbent LEC\u2019s use of non-disclosure agreements.\n\n 149 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 603. The RFA, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-612, has been amended by the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L.

Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA\n\n 5. The Commission did not receive comments specifically addressing the rules and policies proposed in the IRFA.\n\n F. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration\n\n 6. The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to this proceeding.\n\n G. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will Apply\n\n\n\n 7. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of the number of small \nentities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.154 The RFA generally defines the term \u201csmall \nentity\u201d as having the same meaning as the terms \u201csmall business,\u201d \u201csmall organization,\u201d and \u201csmall governmental \njurisdiction.\u201d155 In addition, the term \u201csmall business\u201d has the same meaning as the term \u201csmall-business concern\u201d \nunder the Small Business Act.156 A small-business concern\u201d is one which: (1) is independently owned and \noperated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the \nSmall Business Administration (SBA).157\n\n 1. Total Small Entities\n\n 8. Our proposed action, if implemented, may, over time, affect small entities that are not easily categorized at \npresent. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three comprehensive, statutory small entity size standards.158 \nFirst, as of 2013, the SBA estimates there are an estimated 28.8 million small businesses nationwide\u2014comprising \nsome 99.9% of all businesses.159 In addition, a \u201csmall organization\u201d is generally \u201cany not-for-profit enterprise which \nis independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.\u201d160 Nationwide, as of 2007, there were \napproximately 1,621,315 small organizations.161 Finally, the term \u201csmall governmental jurisdiction\u201d is defined \ngenerally as \u201cgovernments of cities, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a \npopulation of less than fifty thousand.\u201d162 Census Bureau data for 2012 indicate that there were 90,056 local \ngovernmental jurisdictions in the United States.163 We estimate that, of this total, as many as 89,195\n\n 154 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(b)(3).\n\n 155 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(6).\n\n 156 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of \u201csmall-business concern\u201d in the Small \nBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies \n\u201cunless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after \nopportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the \nactivities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.\u201d\n\n 157 See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632.\n\n 158 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601(3)-(6).\n\n 159 See Small Bus. Admin., Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions about Small Business 1 (2016),            \n 160 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(4).\n\n 161 Indep. Sector, The New Nonprofit Almanac and Desk Reference (2010).\n\n 162 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(5).\n\n 163 See U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder, Local Governments by Type and State: 2012,            \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=COG2012ORG02.US01&prodTyp\ne=table (last visited Oct. 19, 2016).\n\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 150\n\n entities may qualify as \u201csmall governmental jurisdictions.\u201d164 Thus, we estimate that most governmental \njurisdictions are small.\n\n 2. Wireline Providers\n\n 9. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (Incumbent LECs). Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a \nsmall business size standard specifically for incumbent LEC services. The closest applicable size standard under \nSBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a business is \nsmall if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.165 According to Commission data,166 1,307 carriers reported that they \nwere incumbent LEC providers.167 Of these 1,307 carriers, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees \nand 301 have more than 1,500 employees.168 Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of \nincumbent LEC service are small businesses that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 10. We have included small incumbent LECs in this present RFA analysis. As noted above, a \u201csmall business\u201d \nunder the RFA is one that, inter alia, meets the pertinent small business size standard (e.g., a telephone \ncommunications business having 1,500 or fewer employees), and \u201cis not dominant in its field of operation.\u201d169 The \nSBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy contends that, for RFA purposes, small incumbent LECs are not dominant in their field of \noperation because any such dominance is not \u201cnational\u201d in scope.170 We have therefore included small incumbent \nLECs in this RFA analysis, although we emphasize that this RFA action has no effect on Commission analyses and \ndeterminations in other, non-RFA contexts.\n\n 11. Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (Competitive LECs), Competitive Access Providers (CAPs), Shared-\nTenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed \na small business size standard specifically for these service providers. The appropriate NAICS Code category is \nWired Telecommunications Carriers, as defined in paragraph 6 of this FRFA. Under that size standard, such a \nbusiness is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.171 U.S. Census data for 2012 indicate that 3,117 firms \noperated during that year. Of that number, 3,083 operated\n\n 164 The 2012 Census data for small governmental organizations are not presented based on the size of the \npopulation in each organization. As stated above, there were 90,056 local governmental organizations in 2012. As a \nbasis for estimating how many of these 90,056 local organizations were small, in 2012 we note that there were a \ntotal of 861 cities and towns (incorporated places and minor civil divisions) with populations greater than or equal to \n50,000. See U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder, Subcounty General-Purpose Governments by Population-\nSize Group and State: 2012,            \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=COG2012ORG07.US01&prodTyp\ne=table (last visited Oct. 19, 2016). If we subtract the 861 cities and towns that exceed the 50,000 population \nthreshold, we conclude that approximately 89,195 are small.\n\n 165 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517110.\n\n 166 Federal Communications Commission, Wireline Competition Bureau, Industry Analysis and Technology \nDivision, Trends in Telephone Service, tbl. 5.3 (Sept. 2010) (Trends in Telephone Service).\n\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=COG2012ORG07.US01&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=COG2012ORG07.US01&prodType=table\n\n\n 167 See Trends in Telephone Service at tbl. 5.3.\n\n 168 See id.\n\n 169 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(3).\n\n 170 Letter from Jere W. Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, to William E. Kennard, Chairman, Federal \nCommunications Commission (filed May 27, 1999). The Small Business Act contains a definition of \u201csmall business \nconcern,\u201d which the RFA incorporates into its own definition of \u201csmall business.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632(a); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n601(3). SBA regulations interpret \u201csmall business concern\u201d to include the concept of dominance on a national basis. \n13 CFR \u00a7 121.102(b).\n\n 171 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517110.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 151\n\n with fewer than 1,000 employees.172 Based on this data, the Commission concludes that the majority of \nCompetitive LECS, CAPs, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers, are small entities. \nAccording to Commission data, 1,442 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of either competitive \nlocal exchange services or competitive access provider services.173 Of these 1,442 carriers, an estimated 1,256 \nhave 1,500 or fewer employees and 186 have more than 1,500 employees.174 In addition, 17 carriers have \nreported that they are Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and all 17 are estimated to have 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.175 Also, 72 carriers have reported that they are Other Local Service Providers.176 Of this total, \nseventy have 1,500 or fewer employees.177 Consequently, based on internally researched FCC data, the \nCommission estimates that most providers of competitive local exchange service, competitive access providers, \nShared-Tenant Service Providers, and other local service providers are small entities that may be affected by rules \nadopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 12. Interexchange Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a definition specifically for \nproviders of interexchange services. The closest NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers as \ndefined in this FRFA. The applicable size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 \nor fewer employees.178 U.S. Census data for 2012 indicates that 3,117 firms operated during that year. Of that \nnumber, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.179 According to internally developed Commission \ndata,180 359 carriers have reported that their primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of \ninterexchange service. Of this total, an estimated 317 have 1,500 or fewer employees. Consequently, the \nCommission estimates that the majority of interexchange carriers are small entities that may be affected by rules \nadopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 13. Operator Service Providers (OSPs). Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business size \nstandard specifically for operator service providers. The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is for the \ncategory Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or \nfewer employees.181 According to Commission data, 33 carriers have reported that they are engaged in the \nprovision of operator services. Of these, an estimated 31 have 1,500 or fewer employees and two have more than \n\n\n\n1,500 employees.182 Consequently, the Commission estimates that the majority of OSPs are small entities that \nmay be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 172 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census, Information: Subject Series - Estab & Firm Size: Employment \nSize of Firms for the United States, NAICS code 517110            \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType\n=table (rel.

Prepaid Calling Card Providers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business \ndefinition specifically for prepaid calling card providers. The most appropriate NAICS code-based category for \ndefining prepaid calling card providers is Telecommunications Resellers. This industry comprises establishments \nengaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of telecommunications networks \nand reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services (except satellite) to businesses and households. \nEstablishments in this industry resell telecommunications; they do not operate transmission facilities and \ninfrastructure. Mobile virtual networks operators (MVNOs) are included in this industry.183 Under the applicable \n\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\n\n\nSBA size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.184 U.S. Census data for 2012 \nshow that 1,341 firms provided resale services during that year. Of that number, 1,341 operated with fewer than \n1,000 employees.185 Thus, under this category and the associated small business size standard, the majority of \nthese prepaid calling card providers can be considered small entities. According to Commission data, 193 carriers \nhave reported that they are engaged in the provision of prepaid calling cards.186 All 193 have 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.187 Consequently, the Commission estimates that the majority of prepaid calling card providers are \nsmall entities that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 15. Local Resellers. The SBA has developed a small business size standard for the category of \nTelecommunications Resellers. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.188 Census data for 2012 show that 1,341 firms provided resale services during that year. Of that \nnumber, 1,341 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.189 Under this category and the associated small \nbusiness size standard, the majority of these local resellers can be considered small entities. According to \nCommission data, 213 carriers have reported that they are engaged in the provision of local resale services.190 Of \nthese, an estimated 211 have 1,500 or fewer employees.191 Consequently, the Commission estimates that the \nmajority of local resellers are small entities that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 16. Toll Resellers. The Commission has not developed a definition for Toll Resellers. The closest NAICS Code \nCategory is Telecommunications Resellers, and the SBA has developed a small business size standard for the \ncategory of Telecommunications Resellers.1 Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or \nfewer employees.192 Census data for 2012 show that 1,341 firms provided resale services during that year.

According to Commission data, 881 carriers have reported that they are \nengaged in the provision of toll resale services.194 Of these, an estimated 857 have 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.195 Consequently, the Commission estimates that the majority of toll resellers are small entities that \nmay be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 17. Other Toll Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a definition for small businesses \nspecifically applicable to Other Toll Carriers. This category includes toll carriers that do not fall within the categories \nof interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling card providers, satellite service carriers, or \ntoll resellers. The closest applicable size standard under SBA rules is for Wired Telecommunications Carriers as \ndefined in paragraph 6 of this FRFA. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.196 Census data for 2012 shows that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year. Of this total, 3,083 \noperated with fewer than 1,000 employees.197 Thus, under this category and the associated small business size \nstandard, the majority of Other Toll Carriers can be considered small. According to internally developed \nCommission data, 284 companies reported that their primary telecommunications service activity was the provision \nof other toll carriage.198 Of these, an estimated 279 have 1,500 or fewer employees.199 Consequently, the \nCommission estimates that most Other Toll Carriers are small entities that may be affected by the rules and policies \nadopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 18. 800 and 800-Like Service Subscribers.200 Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small \nbusiness size standard specifically for 800 and 800-like service (toll free) subscribers. The appropriate size \nstandard under SBA rules is for the category Telecommunications Resellers. Under that size standard, such a \nbusiness is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.201 The most reliable source of information regarding the \nnumber of these service subscribers appears to be data the Commission collects on the 800, 888, 877, and 866 \nnumbers in use.202 According to our data, as of September 2009, the number of 800 numbers assigned was \n7,860,000; the number of 888 numbers assigned was 5,588,687; the number of 877 numbers assigned was \n4,721,866; and the number of 866 numbers assigned was 7,867,736.203 We do not have data specifying the \nnumber of these subscribers that are not independently owned and operated or have more than 1,500 employees, \nand thus are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of toll free subscribers that would \nqualify as small businesses under the SBA\n\n 193 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census, \"Information: Subject Series - Estab & Firm Size: Employment \nSize of Firms for the United States,\" NAICS code 517911            \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType\n=table (rel.

Consequently, we estimate that there are 7,860,000 or fewer small entity 800 subscribers; \n5,588,687 or fewer small entity 888 subscribers; 4,721,866 or fewer small entity 877 subscribers; and 7,867,736 or \nfewer small entity 866 subscribers.\n\n 3. Wireless Providers \u2013 Fixed and Mobile\n\n 19. The rules adopted in the Report and Order may affect wireless providers. As a general matter, the number of \nwinning bidders that claim to qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction does not necessarily represent \nthe number of small businesses currently in service. Also, the Commission does not generally track subsequent \nbusiness size unless, in the context of assignments and transfers or reportable eligibility events, unjust enrichment \nissues are implicated.\n\n 20. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). This industry comprises establishments engaged in \noperating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves. \nEstablishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular \nservices, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.204 The appropriate size \n\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\n\n\nstandard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.205 For this industry, \nCensus data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year. Of this total, 955 firms had \nfewer than 1,000 employees.206 Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission \nestimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications carriers (except satellite) are small entities. Similarly, \naccording to internally developed Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision \nof wireless telephony, including cellular service, Personal Communications Service (PCS), and Specialized Mobile \nRadio (SMR) services.207 Of this total, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees.208 Thus, using \navailable data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be considered small.\n\n 21. Wireless Communications Services. This service can be used for fixed, mobile, radiolocation, and digital audio \nbroadcasting satellite uses. The Commission defined \u201csmall business\u201d for the wireless communications services \n(WCS) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 million for each of the three preceding years, and a \n\u201cvery small business\u201d as an entity with average gross revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding \nyears.209 The SBA has approved these definitions.210\n\n 22. 218-219 MHz Service. The first auction of 218-219 MHz spectrum resulted in 170 entities winning licenses for \n594 Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) licenses.

For that auction, the small business size standard was an \nentity that, together with its affiliates, has no more than a $6 million net worth and, after federal income taxes \n(excluding any carry over losses), has no more than $2 million in annual profits each year for the previous two \nyears.211 In the 218-219 MHz Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order, we established a small \nbusiness size standard for a \u201csmall business\u201d as an entity that, together with its affiliates and persons or entities that \nhold interests in such an entity and their affiliates, has average annual gross revenues not to exceed $15 million for \nthe preceding three years.212 A \u201cvery small business\u201d is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and \npersons or entities that hold interests in such an entity and its affiliates, has average annual gross revenues not to \nexceed $3 million for the preceding three years.213 These size standards will be used in future auctions of 218-219 \nMHz spectrum.\n\n 23. 2.3 GHz Wireless Communications Services. This service can be used for fixed, mobile, radiolocation, and \ndigital audio broadcasting satellite uses. The Commission defined \u201csmall business\u201d for the wireless communications \nservices (\u201cWCS\u201d) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 million for each of the three preceding \nyears, and a \u201cvery small business\u201d as an entity with average gross revenues of $15 million for each of the three \npreceding years.214 The SBA has approved these definitions.215 The Commission auctioned geographic area \nlicenses in the WCS service. In the auction, which was conducted in 1997, there were seven bidders that won 31 \nlicenses that qualified as very small business entities, and one bidder that won one license that qualified as a small \nbusiness entity.\n\n 24. 1670\u20131675 MHz Services. This service can be used for fixed and mobile uses, except aeronautical \nmobile.216 An auction for one license in the 1670\u20131675 MHz band was conducted in 2003. One license was \nawarded. The winning bidder was not a small entity.\n\n 25. Wireless Telephony. Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications services, and specialized \nmobile radio telephony carriers. As noted, the SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wireless \nTelecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).217 Under the SBA small business size standard, a business is \nsmall if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.218 According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were \nengaged in wireless telephony.219 Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more \nthan 1,500 employees.220 Therefore, a little less than one third of these entities can be considered small.\n\n 26. Broadband Personal Communications Service. The broadband personal communications services (PCS) \nspectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through F, and the Commission has held auctions for \neach block.

There were 90 winning bidders that \nclaimed small business status in the first two C-Block auctions. A total of 93 bidders that claimed small business \nstatus won approximately 40 percent of the 1,479 licenses in the first auction for the D, E, and F Blocks.224 On \nApril 15, 1999, the Commission completed the reauction of 347 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block licenses in Auction No. \n22.225 Of the 57 winning bidders in that auction, 48 claimed small business status and won 277 licenses.\n\n 27. On January 26, 2001, the Commission completed the auction of 422 C and F Block Broadband PCS licenses in \nAuction No. 35. Of the 35 winning bidders in that auction, 29 claimed small business status.226 Subsequent events \nconcerning Auction 35, including judicial and agency determinations, resulted in a total of 163 C and F Block \nlicenses being available for grant. On February 15, 2005, the Commission completed an auction of 242 C-, D-, E-, \nand F-Block licenses in Auction No. 58. Of the 24 winning bidders in that auction, 16 claimed small business status \nand won 156 licenses.227 On May 21, 2007, the Commission completed an auction of 33 licenses in the A, C, and \nF Blocks in Auction No. 71.228 Of the 12 winning bidders in that auction, five claimed small business status and \nwon 18 licenses.229 On August 20, 2008, the Commission completed the auction of 20 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block \nBroadband PCS licenses in Auction No. 78.230 Of the eight winning bidders for Broadband PCS licenses in that \nauction, six claimed small business status and won 14 licenses.231\n\n 28. Specialized Mobile Radio Licenses. The Commission awards \u201csmall entity\u201d bidding credits in auctions for \nSpecialized Mobile Radio (SMR) geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands to firms that had \nrevenues of no more than $15 million in each of the three previous calendar\n\n 221 See Amendment of Parts 20 and 24 of the Commission\u2019s Rules \u2013 Broadband PCS Competitive Bidding and \nthe Commercial Mobile Radio Service Spectrum Cap; Amendment of the Commission\u2019s Cellular/PCS Cross-\n\n\n\nOwnership Rule; WT Docket No. 96-59, GN Docket No. 90-314, Report and Order, 11 FCC Rcd 7824, 7850-52, \nparas. 57-60 (1996) (PCS Report and Order); see also 47 CFR \u00a7 24.720(b).\n\n 222 See PCS Report and Order, 11 FCC Rcd at 7852, para. 60.\n\n 223 See Alvarez Letter 1998.\n\n 224 See Broadband PCS, D, E and F Block Auction Closes, Public Notice, Doc.

The 900 MHz SMR auction began on December 5, 1995, and closed on April 15, 1996. \nSixty bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard won 263 \ngeographic area licenses in the 900 MHz SMR band. The 800 MHz SMR auction for the upper 200 channels began \non October 28, 1997, and was completed on December 8, 1997. Ten bidders claiming that they qualified as small \nbusinesses under the $15 million size standard won 38 geographic area licenses for the upper 200 channels in the \n800 MHz SMR band.235 A second auction for the 800 MHz band was held on January 10, 2002 and closed on \nJanuary 17, 2002 and included 23 BEA licenses. One bidder claiming small business status won five licenses.236\n\n\n\n 29. The auction of the 1,053 800 MHz SMR geographic area licenses for the General Category channels began on \nAugust 16, 2000, and was completed on September 1, 2000. Eleven bidders won 108 geographic area licenses for \nthe General Category channels in the 800 MHz SMR band and qualified as small businesses under the $15 million \nsize standard.237 In an auction completed on December 5, 2000, a total of 2,800 Economic Area licenses in the \nlower 80 channels of the 800 MHz SMR service were awarded.238 Of the 22 winning bidders, 19 claimed small \nbusiness status and won 129 licenses. Thus, combining all four auctions, 41 winning bidders for geographic \nlicenses in the 800 MHz SMR band claimed status as small businesses.\n\n 30. In addition, there are numerous incumbent site-by-site SMR licenses and licensees with extended \nimplementation authorizations in the 800 and 900 MHz bands. We do not know how many firms provide 800 MHz or \n900 MHz geographic area SMR service pursuant to extended implementation authorizations, nor how many of \nthese providers have annual revenues of no more than $15 million. One firm has over $15 million in revenues. In \naddition, we do not know how many of these firms have 1,500 or fewer employees, which is the SBA-determined \nsize standard.239 We assume, for purposes of this analysis, that all of the remaining extended implementation \nauthorizations are held by small entities, as defined by the SBA.\n\n 31. Lower 700 MHz Band Licenses. The Commission previously adopted criteria for defining three groups of small \nbusinesses for purposes of determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits.240 The \nCommission defined a \u201csmall business\u201d as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has \naverage gross revenues not exceeding $40\n\n 232 47 CFR \u00a7 90.814(b)(1).\n\n 233 Id.\n\n 234 See Letter from Aida Alvarez, Administrator, SBA, to Thomas Sugrue, Chief, Wireless Telecommunications \nBureau, Federal Communications Commission (filed Aug. 10, 1999) (Alvarez Letter 1999).\n\n 235 See Correction to Public Notice DA 96-586 \u201cFCC Announces Winning Bidders in the Auction of 1020 Licenses \nto Provide 900 MHz SMR in Major Trading Areas,\u201d Public Notice, 18 FCC Rcd 18367 (WTB 1996).\n\n 236 See Multi-Radio Service Auction Closes, Public Notice, 17 FCC Rcd 1446 (WTB 2002).\n\n 237 See 800 MHz Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) Service General Category (851\u2013854 MHz) and Upper Band \n(861\u2013865 MHz) Auction Closes; Winning Bidders Announced, Public Notice, 15 FCC Rcd 17162 (2000).\n\n 238 See 800 MHz SMR Service Lower 80 Channels Auction Closes; Winning Bidders Announced, Public Notice, \n16 FCC Rcd 1736 (2000).\n\n 239 See generally 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517210.\n\n 240 See Reallocation and Service Rules for the 698\u2013746 MHz Spectrum Band (Television Channels 52\u201359), GN \nDocket No. 01-74, Report and Order, 17 FCC Rcd 1022 (2002) (Channels 52\u201359 Report and Order).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n\n\n 158\n\n million for the preceding three years.241 A \u201cvery small business\u201d is defined as an entity that, together with its \naffiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding \nthree years.242 Additionally, the lower 700 MHz Service had a third category of small business status for \nMetropolitan/Rural Service Area (MSA/RSA) licenses\u2014\u201centrepreneur\u201d\u2014which is defined as an entity that, together \nwith its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $3 million for the \npreceding three years.243 The SBA approved these small size standards.244 An auction of 740 licenses (one \nlicense in each of the 734 MSAs/RSAs and one license in each of the six Economic Area Groupings (EAGs)) \ncommenced on August 27, 2002, and closed on September 18, 2002. Of the 740 licenses available for auction, 484 \nlicenses were won by 102 winning bidders. Seventy-two of the winning bidders claimed small business, very small \nbusiness or entrepreneur status and won a total of 329 licenses.245 A second auction commenced on May 28, \n2003, closed on June 13, 2003, and included 256 licenses: 5 EAG licenses and 476 Cellular Market Area \nlicenses.246 Seventeen winning bidders claimed small or very small business status and won 60 licenses, and nine \nwinning bidders claimed entrepreneur status and won 154 licenses.247 On July 26, 2005, the Commission \ncompleted an auction of 5 licenses in the Lower 700 MHz band (Auction No. 60). There were three winning bidders \nfor five licenses. All three winning bidders claimed small business status.\n\n 32. In 2007, the Commission reexamined its rules governing the 700 MHz band in the 700 MHz Second Report \nand Order.248 An auction of 700 MHz licenses commenced January 24, 2008 and closed on March 18, 2008, \nwhich included, 176 Economic Area licenses in the A Block, 734 Cellular Market Area licenses in the B Block, and \n176 EA licenses in the E Block.249 Twenty winning bidders, claiming small business status (those with attributable \naverage annual gross revenues that exceed $15 million and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three \nyears) won 49 licenses.

In 2000, in the 700 MHz Guard Band Order, the Commission adopted size \nstandards for \u201csmall businesses\u201d and \u201cvery small businesses\u201d for purposes of determining their eligibility for special \nprovisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.252 A small business in this service is an entity that, \ntogether with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the \npreceding three years.253 Additionally, a very small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates and \ncontrolling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three \nyears.254 SBA approval of these definitions is not required.255 An auction of 52 Major Economic Area licenses \ncommenced on September 6, 2000, and closed on September 21, 2000.256 Of the 104 licenses auctioned, 96 \nlicenses were sold to nine bidders. Five of these bidders were small businesses that won a total of 26 licenses. A \nsecond auction of 700 MHz Guard Band licenses commenced on February 13, 2001, and closed on February 21, \n2001. All eight of the licenses auctioned were sold to three bidders. One of these bidders was a small business that \nwon a total of two licenses.257\n\n 35. Cellular Radiotelephone Service. Auction 77 was held to resolve one group of mutually exclusive applications \nfor Cellular Radiotelephone Service licenses for unserved areas in New Mexico.258 Bidding credits for designated \nentities were not available in Auction 77.259 In 2008, the Commission completed the closed auction of one \nunserved service area in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, designated as Auction 77. Auction 77 concluded \nwith one provisionally winning bid for the unserved area totaling $25,002.260\n\n 36. Private Land Mobile Radio (\u201cPLMR\u201d). PLMR systems serve an essential role in a range of industrial, business, \nland transportation, and public safety activities. These radios are used by companies of all sizes operating in all \nU.S. business categories, and are often used in support of the licensee\u2019s primary (non-telecommunications) \n\n\n\nbusiness operations. For the purpose of determining whether a licensee of a PLMR system is a small business as \ndefined by the SBA, we use the broad census\n\n 251 See Auction of 700 MHz Band Licenses Closes, Public Notice, 23 FCC Rcd 4572 (WTB 2008).\n\n 252 See Service Rules for the 746\u2013764 MHz Bands, and Revisions to Part 27 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, WT \nDocket No. 99-168, Second Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 5299 (2000) (746\u2013764 MHz Band Second Report and \nOrder).\n\n 253 See id. at 5343, para. 108.\n\n 254 See id.\n\n 255 See id. at 5343, para. 108 n.246 (for the 746\u2013764 MHz and 776\u2013794 MHz bands, the Commission is exempt \nfrom 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632, which requires Federal agencies to obtain SBA approval before adopting small business size \nstandards).\n\n 256 See 700 MHz Guard Bands Auction Closes: Winning Bidders Announced, Public Notice, 15 FCC Rcd 18026 \n(WTB 2000).\n\n 257 See 700 MHz Guard Bands Auction Closes: Winning Bidders Announced, Public Notice, 16 FCC Rcd 4590 \n(WTB 2001).\n\n 258 See Closed Auction of Licenses for Cellular Unserved Service Area Scheduled for June 17, 2008, Notice and \nFiling Requirements, Minimum Opening Bids, Upfront Payments, and Other Procedures for Auction 77, Public \nNotice, 23 FCC Rcd 6670 (WTB 2008).\n\n 259 Id. at 6685.\n\n 260 See Auction of Cellular Unserved Service Area License Closes, Winning Bidder Announced for Auction 77, \nDown Payment due July 2, 2008, Final Payment due July 17, 2008, Public Notice, 23 FCC Rcd 9501 (WTB 2008).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 160\n\n category, Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). This definition provides that a small entity is \nany such entity employing no more than 1,500 persons.261 The Commission does not require PLMR licensees to \ndisclose information about number of employees, so the Commission does not have information that could be used \nto determine how many PLMR licensees constitute small entities under this definition. We note that PLMR licensees \ngenerally use the licensed facilities in support of other business activities, and therefore, it would also be helpful to \nassess PLMR licensees under the standards applied to the particular industry subsector to which the licensee \nbelongs.262\n\n\n\n 37. As of March 2010, there were 424,162 PLMR licensees operating 921,909 transmitters in the PLMR bands \nbelow 512 MHz. We note that any entity engaged in a commercial activity is eligible to hold a PLMR license, and \nthat any revised rules in this context could therefore potentially impact small entities covering a great variety of \nindustries.\n\n 38. Rural Radiotelephone Service. The Commission has not adopted a size standard for small businesses specific \nto the Rural Radiotelephone Service.263 A significant subset of the Rural Radiotelephone Service is the Basic \nExchange Telephone Radio System (BETRS).264 In the present context, we will use the SBA\u2019s small business size \nstandard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), i.e., an entity employing no more \nthan 1,500 persons.265 There are approximately 1,000 licensees in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, and the \nCommission estimates that there are 1,000 or fewer small entity licensees in the Rural Radiotelephone Service that \nmay be affected by the rules and policies proposed herein.\n\n 39. Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service. The Commission has previously used the SBA\u2019s small business size \nstandard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), i.e., an entity employing no more \nthan 1,500 persons.266 There are approximately 100 licensees in the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service, and \nunder that definition, we estimate that almost all of them qualify as small entities under the SBA definition. For \npurposes of assigning Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service licenses through competitive bidding, the Commission \nhas defined \u201csmall business\u201d as an entity that, together with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual \ngross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million.267 A \u201cvery small business\u201d is defined as \nan entity that, together with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding \nthree years not exceeding $15 million.268 These definitions were approved by the SBA.269 In May 2006, the \nCommission completed an auction of nationwide commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service licenses in the \n800 MHz band (Auction No. 65).

Neither of the winning bidders claimed small \nbusiness status.\n\n 40. Aviation and Marine Radio Services. Small businesses in the aviation and marine radio services use a very \nhigh frequency (VHF) marine or aircraft radio and, as appropriate, an emergency position-indicating radio beacon \n(and/or radar) or an emergency locator transmitter. The Commission has not developed a small business size \nstandard specifically applicable to these small businesses. For purposes of this analysis, the Commission uses the \nSBA small business size standard for the category Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), which \nis 1,500 or fewer employees.270 Census data for 2012, which are the most recent Census data available, show \nthat there were 967 firms that operated that year.271 Of those 967, 955 had fewer than 1,000 employees, and 12 \nfirms had more than 1,000 employees. Most applicants for recreational licenses are individuals. Approximately \n581,000 ship station licensees and 131,000 aircraft station licensees operate domestically and are not subject to \nthe radio carriage requirements of any statute or treaty. For purposes of our evaluations in this analysis, we \nestimate that there are up to approximately 712,000 licensees that are small businesses (or individuals) under the \nSBA standard. In addition, between December 3, 1998 and December 14, 1998, the Commission held an auction of \n42 VHF Public Coast licenses in the 157.1875-157.4500 MHz (ship transmit) and 161.775-162.0125 MHz (coast \ntransmit) bands. For purposes of the auction, the Commission defined a \u201csmall\u201d business as an entity that, together \nwith controlling interests and affiliates, has average gross revenues for the preceding three years not to exceed $15 \nmillion dollars.272 In addition, a \u201cvery small\u201d business is one that, together with controlling interests and affiliates, \nhas average gross revenues for the preceding three years not to exceed $3 million dollars.273 There are \napproximately 10,672 licensees in the Marine Coast Service, and the Commission estimates that almost all of them \nqualify as \u201csmall\u201d businesses under the above special small business size standards and may be affected by rules \nadopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 41. Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) (1710\u20131755 MHz and 2110\u20132155 MHz bands (AWS-1); 1915\u20131920 MHz, \n1995\u20132000 MHz, 2020\u20132025 MHz and 2175\u20132180 MHz bands (AWS-2); 2155\u20132175 MHz band (AWS-3)). For the \nAWS-1 bands,274 the Commission has defined a \u201csmall business\u201d as an entity with average annual gross revenues \nfor the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million, and a \u201cvery small business\u201d as an entity with average \nannual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15 million. For AWS-2 and AWS-3, although \nwe do not know for certain which entities are likely to apply for these frequencies, we note that the AWS-1 bands \nare comparable to those used for cellular service and personal communications service. The Commission has not \nyet adopted size standards for the AWS-2 or AWS-3 bands but proposes to treat both AWS-2 and AWS-3 similarly \nto broadband PCS service and AWS-1 service due to the comparable capital requirements and other factors, such \nas issues involved in relocating incumbents and developing markets, technologies, and services.275\n\n 270 See 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517210.\n\n 271 U.S. Bureau, 2012 Economic Census, Information: Subject Series - Estab and Firm Size: Employment Size of \nFirms for the United States, NAICS code 517210 \n\n\n\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType\n=table (rel.

(continued\u2026.)\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 162\n\n 42. 3650\u20133700 MHz band. In March 2005, the Commission released a Report and Order and Memorandum \nOpinion and Order that provides for nationwide, non-exclusive licensing of terrestrial operations, utilizing contention-\nbased technologies, in the 3650 MHz band (i.e., 3650\u20133700 MHz). As of April 2010, more than 1270 licenses have \nbeen granted and more than 7433 sites have been registered. The Commission has not developed a definition of \nsmall entities applicable to 3650\u20133700 MHz band nationwide, non-exclusive licensees. However, we estimate that \nthe majority of these licensees are Internet Access Service Providers (ISPs) and that most of those licensees are \nsmall businesses.\n\n 43. Fixed Microwave Services. Microwave services include common carrier,276 private-operational fixed,277 and \nbroadcast auxiliary radio services.278 They also include the Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS),279 the \nDigital Electronic Message Service (DEMS),280 and the 24 GHz Service,281 where licensees can choose \nbetween common carrier and non-common carrier status.282 At present, there are approximately 36,708 common \ncarrier fixed licensees and 59,291 private operational-fixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the \nmicrowave services. There are approximately 135 LMDS licensees, three DEMS licensees, and three 24 GHz \nlicensees. The Commission has not yet defined a small business with respect to microwave services. For purposes \nof the FRFA, we will use the SBA\u2019s definition applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except \nsatellite)\u2014i.e., an entity with no more than 1,500 persons.283 Under the present and prior categories, the SBA has \ndeemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.284 The Commission does not have \ndata specifying the number of these licensees that have more than 1,500 employees, and thus is unable at this time \nto estimate with greater precision the number of fixed microwave service licensees that would qualify as small \nbusiness concerns under the SBA\u2019s small business size standard. Consequently, the Commission estimates that \nthere are up to 36,708 common carrier fixed licensees and up to 59,291 private operational-fixed licensees and \nbroadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave services that may be small and may be affected by the rules \nand policies adopted herein. We note, however, that the common carrier microwave fixed licensee category \nincludes some large entities.\n\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ5&prodType=table\n\n\n 44.

See 47 CFR Part \n74. Available to licensees of broadcast stations and to broadcast and cable network entities, broadcast auxiliary \nmicrowave stations are used for relaying broadcast television signals from the studio to the transmitter, or between \ntwo points such as a main studio and an auxiliary studio. The service also includes mobile TV pickups, which relay \nsignals from a remote location back to the studio.\n\n 279 See 47 CFR Part 101, Subpart L.\n\n 280 See 47 CFR Part 101, Subpart G.\n\n 281 See id.\n\n 282 See 47 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 101.533, 101.1017.\n\n 283 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517210.\n\n 284 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517210 (2007 NAICS).

The Commission is unable to \nestimate at this time the number of licensees that would qualify as small under the SBA\u2019s small business size \nstandard for the category of Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). Under that SBA small \nbusiness size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.286 Census data for 2012, which are \nthe most recent Census data available, show that there were 967 firms that operated that year.287 Of those 967, \n955 had fewer than 1,000 employees, and 12 firms had more than 1,000 employees. Thus, under this category and \nthe associated small business size standard, the majority of firms can be considered small.\n\n\n\n 45. 39 GHz Service. The Commission created a special small business size standard for 39 GHz licenses \u2013 an \nentity that has average gross revenues of $40 million or less in the three previous calendar years.288 An additional \nsize standard for \u201cvery small business\u201d is: an entity that, together with affiliates, has average gross revenues of not \nmore than $15 million for the preceding three calendar years.289 The SBA has approved these small business size \nstandards.290 The auction of the 2,173 39 GHz licenses began on April 12, 2000 and closed on May 8, 2000. The \n18 bidders who claimed small business status won 849 licenses. Consequently, the Commission estimates that 18 \nor fewer 39 GHz licensees are small entities that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 46. Broadband Radio Service and Educational Broadband Service. Broadband Radio Service systems, \npreviously referred to as Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service \n(MMDS) systems, and \u201cwireless cable,\u201d transmit video programming to subscribers and provide two-way high speed \ndata operations using the microwave frequencies of the Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational \nBroadband Service (EBS) (previously referred to as the Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)).291 In \nconnection with the 1996 BRS auction, the Commission established a small business size standard as an entity that \nhad annual average gross revenues of no more than $40 million in the previous three calendar years.292 The BRS \nauctions resulted in 67 successful bidders obtaining licensing opportunities for 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs). Of \nthe 67 auction winners, 61 met the definition of a small business. BRS also includes licensees of stations \nauthorized prior to the auction. At this time, we estimate that of the 61 small business BRS auction winners, 48 \nremain small business licensees. In addition to the 48 small businesses that hold BTA authorizations, there are \napproximately 392 incumbent BRS licensees that are considered small entities.293\n\n 285 This service is governed by Subpart I of Part 22 of the Commission\u2019s Rules.

In 2009, the Commission conducted Auction 86, the sale of 78 licenses in the BRS areas.294 The Commission \noffered three levels of bidding credits: (i) a bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that exceed $15 \nmillion and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years (small business) received a 15 percent discount \non its winning bid; (ii) a bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that exceed $3 million and do not \nexceed $15 million for the preceding three years (very small business) received a 25 percent discount on its \nwinning bid; and (iii) a bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that do not exceed $3 million for the \npreceding three years (entrepreneur) received a 35 percent discount on its winning bid.295 Auction 86 concluded in \n2009 with the sale of 61 licenses.296 Of the ten winning bidders, two bidders that claimed small business status \nwon 4 licenses; one bidder that claimed very small business status won three licenses; and two bidders that \nclaimed entrepreneur status won six licenses.\n\n 48. In addition, the SBA\u2019s Cable Television Distribution Services small business size standard is applicable to \nEBS. There are presently 2,436 EBS licensees. All but 100 of these licenses are held by educational institutions. \nEducational institutions are included in this analysis as small entities.297 Thus, we estimate that at least 2,336 \nlicensees are small businesses. Since 2007, Cable Television Distribution Services have been defined within the \nbroad economic census category of Wired Telecommunications Carriers; that category is defined as follows: \u201cThis \nindustry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities \nand infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired \ntelecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of \ntechnologies.\u201d298 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category, which is: all such firms \nhaving 1,500 or fewer employees. To gauge small business prevalence for these cable services we must, \nhowever, use the most current census data that are based on the previous category of Cable and Other Program \nDistribution and its associated size standard; that size standard was: all such firms having $13.5 million or less in \nannual receipts.299 According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there were a total of 996 firms in this category that \noperated for the entire year.300 Of this total, 948 firms had annual receipts of under $10 million, and 48 firms had \nreceipts of $10 million or more but less than $25 million.301 Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered \nsmall.\n\n 294 Auction of Broadband Radio Service (BRS) Licenses, Scheduled for October 27, 2009, Notice and Filing \nRequirements, Minimum Opening Bids, Upfront Payments, and Other Procedures for Auction 86, AU Docket No. \n09-56, Public Notice, 24 FCC Rcd 8277 (2009).\n\n 295 Id. at 8296, para. 73.\n\n\n\n 296 Auction of Broadband Radio Service Licenses Closes, Winning Bidders Announced for Auction 86, Down \nPayments Due November 23, 2009, Final Payments Due December 8, 2009, Ten-Day Petition to Deny Period, \nPublic Notice, 24 FCC Rcd 13572 (2009).\n\n 297 The term \u201csmall entity\u201d within SBREFA applies to small organizations (nonprofits) and to small governmental \njurisdictions (cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, and special districts with populations of \nless than 50,000). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601(4)-(6).

In 1994, the Commission conducted an auction for \nNarrowband PCS licenses. A second auction was also conducted later in 1994. For purposes of the first two \nNarrowband PCS auctions, \u201csmall businesses\u201d were entities with average gross revenues for the prior three \ncalendar years of $40 million or less.302 Through these auctions, the Commission awarded a total of 41 licenses, \n11 of which were obtained by four small businesses.303 To ensure meaningful participation by small business \nentities in future auctions, the Commission adopted a two-tiered small business size standard in the Narrowband \nPCS Second Report and Order.304 A \u201csmall business\u201d is an entity that, together with affiliates and controlling \ninterests, has average gross revenues for the three preceding years of not more than $40 million.305 A \u201cvery small \nbusiness\u201d is an entity that, together with affiliates and controlling interests, has average gross revenues for the three \npreceding years of not more than $15 million.306 The SBA has approved these small business size standards.307 \nA third auction was conducted in 2001. Here, five bidders won 317 (Metropolitan Trading Areas and nationwide) \nlicenses.308 Three of these claimed status as a small or very small entity and won 311 licenses.\n\n 50. Paging (Private and Common Carrier). In the Paging Third Report and Order, we developed a small business \nsize standard for \u201csmall businesses\u201d and \u201cvery small businesses\u201d for purposes of determining their eligibility for \nspecial provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.309 A \u201csmall business\u201d is an entity that, \ntogether with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $15 million for the \npreceding three years. Additionally, a \u201cvery small business\u201d is an entity that, together with its affiliates and \ncontrolling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $3 million for the preceding three years. \nThe SBA has approved these small business size standards.310 According to Commission data, 291 carriers have \nreported that they are engaged in Paging or Messaging Service.311 Of these, an estimated 289 have 1,500 or \nfewer employees, and two have more than 1,500 employees.312 Consequently, the Commission estimates that the \nmajority\n\nhttp://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?code=517110&search=2012\n\n\n 302 Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act \u2013 Competitive Bidding Narrowband PCS, PP \nDocket No. 93-253, GEN Docket No. 90-314, ET Docket No. 92-100, Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and \nFurther Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 10 FCC Rcd 175, 196, para. 46 (1994).\n\n 303 See Announcing the High Bidders in the Auction of Ten Nationwide Narrowband PCS Licenses, Winning Bids \nTotal $617,006,674, Public Notice, PNWL 94-004 (rel.

An auction of Metropolitan Economic Area \nlicenses commenced on February 24, 2000, and closed on March 2, 2000. Of the 2,499 licenses auctioned, 985 \nwere sold. Fifty-seven companies claiming small business status won 440 licenses.313 A subsequent auction of \nMEA and Economic Area (\u201cEA\u201d) licenses was held in the year 2001. Of the 15,514 licenses auctioned, 5,323 were \nsold.314 One hundred thirty-two companies claiming small business status purchased 3,724 licenses. A third \nauction, consisting of 8,874 licenses in each of 175 EAs and 1,328 licenses in all but three of the 51 MEAs, was \nheld in 2003. Seventy-seven bidders claiming small or very small business status won 2,093 licenses.315 A fourth \n\n\n\nauction, consisting of 9,603 lower and upper paging band licenses was held in the year 2010. Twenty-nine bidders \nclaiming small or very small business status won 3,016 licenses.316\n\n 51. 220 MHz Radio Service \u2013 Phase I Licensees. The 220 MHz service has both Phase I and Phase II licenses. \nPhase I licensing was conducted by lotteries in 1992 and 1993. There are approximately 1,515 such non-\nnationwide licensees and four nationwide licensees currently authorized to operate in the 220 MHz band. The \nCommission has not developed a small business size standard for small entities specifically applicable to such \nincumbent 220 MHz Phase I licensees. To estimate the number of such licensees that are small businesses, we \napply the small business size standard under the SBA rules applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers \n(except Satellite). Under this category, the SBA deems a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer \nemployees.317 The Commission estimates that nearly all such licensees are small businesses under the SBA\u2019s \nsmall business size standard that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Order.\n\n 52. 220 MHz Radio Service \u2013 Phase II Licensees. The 220 MHz service has both Phase I and Phase II licenses. \nThe Phase II 220 MHz service is subject to spectrum auctions. In the 220 MHz Third Report and Order, we \nadopted a small business size standard for \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cvery small\u201d businesses for purposes of determining their \neligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.318 This small business size \nstandard indicates that a \u201csmall business\u201d is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has \naverage gross revenues not exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years.319 A \u201cvery small business\u201d is an \nentity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that do not exceed $3 \nmillion for the preceding three years.320 The SBA has approved these small business size standards.321 Auctions \nof Phase II licenses\n\n 313 See id.\n\n 314 See Lower and Upper Paging Band Auction Closes, Public Notice, 16 FCC Rcd 21821 (WTB 2001).\n\n 315 See Lower and Upper Paging Bands Auction Closes, Public Notice, 18 FCC Rcd 11154 (Wireless Tel.

Of the 908 licenses auctioned, 693 were sold. Thirty-nine \nsmall businesses won licenses in the first 220 MHz auction. The second auction included 225 licenses: 216 EA \nlicenses and 9 EAG licenses. Fourteen companies claiming small business status won 158 licenses.323\n\n 4. Satellite Service Providers\n\n 53. Satellite Telecommunications Providers. Two economic census categories address the satellite industry. The \nfirst category has a small business size standard of $32.5 million or less in average annual receipts, under SBA \nrules.324 The second has a size standard of $30 million or less in annual receipts.325\n\n 54. The first category comprises firms \u201cprimarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other \nestablishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications \nsignals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.\u201d326 The category has a small business \nsize standard of $32.5 million or less in average annual receipts, under SBA rules.327 For this category, Census \nBureau data for 2012 show that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.328 Of this total, \n299 firms had annual receipts of less than $25 million.1329 For this category, Census Bureau data for 2007 show \nthat there were a total of 570 firms that operated for the entire year.330 Of this total, 530 firms had annual receipts \nof under $30 million, and 40 firms had receipts of over $30 million.331 Consequently, we estimate that the majority \nof Satellite Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the \nOrder.\n\n 55. The second category of Other Telecommunications comprises, inter alia, \u201cestablishments primarily engaged in \nproviding specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar \nstation operation. This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal \nstations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting \ntelecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.\u201d332 For this category, Census \nBureau data for 2007 show that\n\n 322 See Phase II 220 MHz Service Auction Closes, Public Notice, 14 FCC Rcd 605 (WTB 1998).\n\n 323 See Phase II 220 MHz Service Spectrum Auction Closes, Public Notice, 14 FCC Rcd 11218 (WTB 1999).\n\n 324 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS Code 517410.\n\n 325 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS Code 517919.\n\n\n\n 326 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 NAICS Definitions, 517410 Satellite Telecommunications,            \nhttp://www.census.gov/ cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?code=517410&search=2012.\n\n 327 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.201, NAICS code 517410.\n\n 328 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census, Information: Subject Series - Estab & Firm Size: Receipts Size \nof Firms for the United States, NAICS code 517410            \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ4&prodType\n=table (rel.

Cable Service Providers\n\n 56. The description above of wireline providers should encompass cable service providers that also provide \nbusiness data services. Out of an abundance of caution, we describe cable service providers below as well as \nother types of firms that may provide broadband services, including MDS providers and utilities, among others.\n\n 57. Cable Companies and Systems (Rate Regulation). The Commission has developed its own small business size \nstandards for the purpose of cable rate regulation. Under the Commission's rules, a \u201csmall cable company\u201d is one \nserving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide.335 Industry data indicate that there are currently 4,600 active \ncable systems in the United States.336 Of this total, all but nine cable operators nationwide are small under the \n400,000-subscriber size standard.337 In addition, under the Commission's rate regulation rules, a \u201csmall system\u201d is \na cable system serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers.338 Current Commission records show 4,600 cable systems \nnationwide.339 Of this total, 3,900 cable systems have fewer than 15,000 subscribers, and 700 systems have \n15,000 or more subscribers, based on the same records.340 Thus, under this standard as well, we estimate that \nmost cable systems are small entities.\n\nhttp://www.census.gov/\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ4&prodType=table\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2012US51SSSZ4&prodType=table\nhttp://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?code=517919&search=2012\n\n\n 58. Cable System Operators. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, also contains a size standard for \nsmall cable system operators, which is \u201ca cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the \naggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities \nwhose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.\u201d341 There are approximately 52,403,705 \ncable video subscribers in the United States today.342 Accordingly, an operator serving fewer than 524,037 \nsubscribers shall be deemed a small operator if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual revenues \nof all its affiliates, do not exceed $250 million in the aggregate.343 Based on available data, we find that all but nine \nincumbent cable operators are small entities under this size standard.344 We note that the Commission neither \nrequests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose\n\n 333 U.S. Census Bureau, 2007 Economic Census, Subject Series: Information, \u201cEstablishment and Firm Size,\u201d \nNAICS code 517410 (rel.

The open video system (OVS) framework was established in 1996, and is one of four statutorily recognized \noptions for the provision of video programming services by local exchange carriers.346 The OVS framework \nprovides opportunities for the distribution of video programming other than through cable systems. Because OVS \noperators provide subscription services,347 OVS falls within the SBA small business size standard covering cable \nservices, which is \u201cWired Telecommunications Carriers.\u201d348 The SBA has developed a small business size \nstandard for this category, which is: all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees. According to Census Bureau \ndata for 2007, there were a total of 955 firms in this previous category that operated for the entire year.349 Of this \ntotal, 939 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees, and 16 firms had employment of 1,000 employees or \nmore.350 Thus, under this second size standard, most cable systems are small and may be affected by rules \nadopted pursuant to the Order. In addition, we note that the Commission has certified some OVS operators, with \nsome now providing service.351 Broadband service providers (BSPs) are currently the only significant holders of \nOVS certifications or local OVS franchises.352 The Commission does not have financial or employment information \nregarding the entities authorized to provide OVS, some of which may not yet be operational. Thus, again, at least \nsome of the OVS operators may qualify as small entities.\n\n 6. Electric Power Generators, Transmitters, and Distributors\n\n 60. Electric Power Generators, Transmitters, and Distributors. The Census Bureau defines an industry group \ncomprised of \u201cestablishments, primarily engaged in generating, transmitting, and/or distributing electric power. \nEstablishments in this industry group may perform one or more of the following activities: (1) operate generation \nfacilities that produce electric energy; (2) operate transmission systems that convey the electricity from the \ngeneration facility to the distribution system; and (3) operate distribution systems that convey electric power \nreceived from the generation facility or the transmission system to the final consumer.\u201d353 The SBA has developed \na small business size standard for firms in this category: \u201cA firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily \nengaged in the\n\n 345 The Commission does receive such information on a case-by-case basis if a cable operator appeals a local \nfranchise authority\u2019s finding that the operator does not qualify as a small cable operator pursuant to \u00a7 76.901(f) of \nthe Commission\u2019s rules.

Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities\n\n 61. Recordkeeping and Reporting. The rule revisions adopted in the Order include changes that will necessitate \naffected carriers to make various revisions to business data service tariffs and Tariff Review Plans. For example, \npacket-based BDS, transport services, and counties that are deemed competitive for end user channel \nterminations will be relieved of price cap regulation and will be subject to permissive detariffing for a period of 18 \nmonths at which time they will be subject to mandatory detariffing.\n\n 62. In addition, the Commission amends the price cap rules to allow all price cap LECs in non-competitive counties \nto lower their rates through contract tariffs and volume and term discounts in a manner consistent with the \nCommission\u2019s current Phase I pricing flexibility rules. These incumbent LECs will be required to maintain generally \navailable tariffed price cap regulated rates available to all subscribers. For the small number of counties that had \nreceived Phase II pricing flexibility that are now treated as non-competitive, those price cap carriers will be \npermitted to retain Phase II relief for those counties but will be required to offer generally available rates for those \nservices as long as those services remain under tariff.\n\n 63. The Commission also incorporates a productivity-based X factor of 2.0 percent for DS1 and DS3 end user \nchannel terminations subject to price cap regulation on a going-forward basis. Affected LECs will be required to \nrevise their rates and tariff review plans, including adjustments to price cap indices, for business data services in \nfilings with the Commission to reflect the new X-factor. These revisions are required of all affected carriers, \nregardless of entity size. The adopted rule revisions will facilitate Commission and public access to the most \naccurate and up-to-date tariffs as well as lower rates paid by the public for the affected services.\n\n I. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities and Significant Alternatives \nConsidered\n\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/mb/ovs/csovscerhtml;\n\n 64. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in reaching its \nproposed approach, which may include (among others) the following four alternatives: (1) the establishment of \ndiffering compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small \nentities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule \nfor small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of \nthe rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.357\n\n 65. Competitive Market Test. The Commission proposed to replace the existing regulatory framework for granting \nregulatory relief to incumbent LECs in price cap areas with a multi-dimensional\n\n 354 13 CFR \u00a7 121.201, NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122, n.1.\n\n 355 See U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder, Utilities: Subject Series - Establishment and Firm Size: \nSummary Statistics by Revenue Size of Firms for the United States: 2007, NAICS code 221122,            \nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov/ \nfaces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN2007US22SSSZ5&prodType=table (last visited Feb. 18, \n2016).\n\n 356 See id.\n\n 357 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(c).\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 171\n\n competitive market test to identify specific markets as competitive or non-competitive, thereby dictating the level of \napplicable regulation for both circuit-based and packet-based business data services.358 The Commission also \nsought comment on the separate but related issue of whether in non-competitive markets, heightened regulation, \nincluding possible restrictions on rates, terms and conditions, should apply to just the market leader or additional \nproviders, which could have potentially included a substantial number of small businesses.359\n\n 66. In the Order, the Commission explains why it adopts a test that departs from the proposals in the Further \nNotice. Rather than intrusive pricing regulation, it takes a dynamic and forward-looking approach to evaluating the \nbenefits and costs of regulation. It identifies specific markets as competitive or non-competitive and applies \nregulation only where competition is expected to materially fail to ensure just and reasonable rates. The result is a \nsimple, sustainable framework that is far less complicated than the market test proposal originally contemplated. \nThe Commission adopts a structure that eliminates unnecessary pricing regulation for a significant portion of the \nbusiness data services provided by price cap incumbent LECs to allow competition to promote increased \nefficiencies, investment, and growth in new technologies and services to benefit consumers and business. \nAdditionally, the Commission declines to impose rate regulation on other business data services providers besides \nthe market leader. In particular, unnecessary regulation exacts administrative compliance costs on carriers that \nreduce capital available for building new networks and infrastructure, inhibiting competitive entry and deployment.\n\n 67. Packet-based Services. The Commission declines to re-impose any form of price cap or benchmark regulation \non packet-based business data services. The market analysis does not show compelling evidence of market power \n\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov/\n\n\nin incumbent LEC provision of packet-based business data services, particularly for higher bandwidth services. \nMoreover, even if the record demonstrated insufficiently robust competition, proposals to apply price cap regulation \nto packet-based services were complex and not easily administrable and did not reflect the fact that costs to serve \nindividual customers vary.\n\n 68. Anchor or Benchmark Pricing. The Commission minimizes the economic impact of its rules on small entities \nfirst by declining to impose anchor or benchmark pricing regulation on incumbent LEC packet-based business data \nservices. This eliminates the proposed requirement to calculate anchor or benchmark prices for a wide range of \npacket-based business data services, and to post publicly generally applicable rates, terms and conditions. \nBecause our market analysis shows that packet-based business data services are subject to competition, anchor \nor benchmark pricing would be unnecessary and could actually inhibit investment in this dynamic market.\n\n 69. X-factor. Incumbent LECs that file tariffs under the price cap ratemaking methodology are required to file \nrevised annual access charge tariffs every year, which become effective on July 1. The annual filings include \nsubmission of tariff review plans that are used to support revisions to the rates, including revisions that pertain to \nthe X-factor. To ease the burden on the industry, and because base period demand and the value of GDP-PI \nreflected in the price cap indices typically are not updated during a tariff year, the Commission permits incumbent \nLECs to use, in their filings implementing the 2.0 percent X-factor, the same base period demand and value of \nGDP-PI as in the July 1, 2017 annual filing.\n\n 70. Price Cap Regulation. The Commission applies price cap regulation in the form of Phase I pricing flexibility to \nDS1 and DS3 end user channel termination services provided by incumbent LECs in counties that we have \ndetermined are non-competitive. Requiring Phase I pricing will enable incumbent LECs, including those that may be \nsmall entities, to respond to any competition that develops in these markets through contract tariffs and volume and \nterm discounts. In addition, incumbent LECs, including any small entities that previously received Phase II pricing \nflexibility in counties we now deem\n\n 358 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4837, para. 259.\n\n 359 Further Notice, 31 FCC Rcd at 4848-49, paras. 308-11.\n\n Federal Communications Commission FCC-CIRC1704-04\n\n 172\n\n non-competitive will be permitted to retain Phase II relief for end user channel terminations and other special \naccess services, rather than having to incur significant costs of trying to recreate price caps.\n\n 71. Periodic Data Collection. Related to the competitive market test proposal, the Commission also proposed a \nfuture periodic data collection to allow for market test updates for determining competitive and non-competitive \nareas. The periodic collection could have resulted in a significant reporting burden on small entities. Instead, the \nCommission adopts a process for updating the competitive market test every three years using the data from Form \n477 that is already routinely filed by providers and thus entails no additional burden.\n\n\n\n 72. Wholesale Pricing. The Commission also minimized the impact of its rules on small entities by declining to \nadopt rules proposed by certain parties that would have required business data services providers to comply with \ndetailed requirements regarding the pricing of their wholesale business data services.\n\n 73. Forbearance. To help level the playing field and promote regulatory parity for all business data services \nproviders, the Commission extends the forbearance from section 203 of the Communications Act of 1934, as \namended. This expands forbearance previously accorded certain price cap LECs to all price cap LECs, including \nthose that may be small entities, in the provision of any packet-based business data service or circuit-based \nbusiness data service above the DS3 bandwidth level. This action is also taken to promote competition and \nbroadband deployment. To level the playing field among price cap LECs providing packet-based and optical \ntransmission business data services, the Commission conforms the forbearance provided Verizon and its \nsuccessors in interest to that provided other price cap carriers.\n\n 74. Detariffing. To minimize economic impact, the Commission provides a transition period to provide price cap \nincumbent LECs, including those that may be small entities, with sufficient time to adapt their business data \nservices operations to a detariffing system. The Commission does not intend its actions to disturb existing \ncontractual or other long-term arrangements, which must continue to be adhered to for the length of the contract, \nand the Commission adopted a grandfathering rules for such contracts.\n\n J.
