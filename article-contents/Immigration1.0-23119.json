{"title": "Extreme measures won't fix immigration", "body": "\nMichael Medved's recent commentary \"Who should stay? Who should go?\" divides illegal immigrants up into those \nwho deserve to stay and those who deserve to be deported (The Forum, Wednesday).\n\nFrom what I understand in talking with people who deal with illegal Mexican immigrants, most of them do not want \nto stay but they do seek to save enough money to buy a small home back in Mexico so they can return and offer a \nbetter life to their families. Therefore, I think a better way of looking at it is to divide illegal immigrants up into those \nwho want citizenship and those who just want to make some money and leave.\n\nThe extreme views are either full deportation or full amnesty. Medved recognizes that trying to find and deport \nsome estimated 11 million people -- roughly the population equivalent of Los Angeles and San Francisco counties \ncombined -- would be impossible. To force them to leave voluntarily by cutting off jobs would only result in a huge \nincrease in crime by turning people who are working hard at low-paying jobs into thieves and killers. This is no \nanswer. Offering amnesty is not the answer either, as it unjustly penalizes those who have gone through our \nnaturalization process. I reject these two extremes as being unacceptable.\n\nWe need a simple but voluntary solution to the issue.\n\nFor those who want to become U.S. citizens, allow them to buy citizenship by a program of federal \"citizenship\" \nloans, to be paid back over several years while they work toward citizenship. For those who want to return to their \ncountry of origin, we should make sure that they are documented and that they pay their taxes while here. In \nexchange, they would get some benefits afforded citizens, such as schooling for children.\n\nKenneth J.
