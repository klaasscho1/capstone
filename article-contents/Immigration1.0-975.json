{"title": "JOY & CAUTION IN CITY ON BOSNIA AGREEMENT", "body": "\nImmigrants from war-racked Bosnia voiced cautious optimism yesterday as they hailed a long-sought agreement \nthat promises an end to the bloody, 31/2-year civil war dividing their homeland.\n\nBut New York-area Serbs, Muslims and Croats, while saying all sides were ready for peace, warned that the accord \ncould come undone with renewed fighting.\n\n\"We are hoping this will be a real peace, but the concern is there still seems to be so many loose ends that need to \nbe tied up,\" said Mila Lazarevich, president of the Serb Unity Congress in Manhattan.\n\nThose loose ends, she said, include the precise division of Bosnian territory.\n\n\"We have great reservations because there is so much that is unclear in terms of how it can all be resolved,\" \nLazarevich said.\n\nThe Rev. Anton Bozanic, a Croatian-born priest at Most Precious Blood Church in Astoria, Queens, said he and \nCroat parishioners frequently \"prayed that peace would come, and it did.\"\n\n\"Nobody agreed with this war,\" Bozanic said. \"Now we have to find a way to live together.\"\n\nNenad Peleksic, a counselor at the Bosnian government mission to the United Nations, said he and other Bosnian \nMuslims hope the agreement signals a permanent end to the fighting.\n\nBut Peleksic said his optimism was dampened by agreement terms that would stop many refugees from eastern \nBosnia from returning to their homes.\n\n\"We have already seen many peace agreements and ceasefires which didn't hold up much,\" Peleksic cautioned.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nREUTER PRINT IT: A Sarajevan reads paper with a headline that translates: \"America at the end of patience\" \noutside cafe sporting American flag.\n"}
