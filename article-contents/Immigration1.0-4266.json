{"title": "LOCAL IMMIGRANTS HAPPY WITH RESULTS", "body": "\nMexican immigrants in Sunset Park yesterday hailed the news of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' election victory as \nMexico City's mayor as a long-awaited historic moment.\n\n\"I wanted Cardenas to win, of course,\" said Marisela Sosa, 33, who was running errands along Fifth Ave.\n\"I was too young to vote when I left Mexico 13 years ago, but he has been the only candidate who seems promising \nand different.\"\n\nLike Sosa, dozens of other Mexican immigrants in this neighborhood anxiously followed reports that the ruling \nInstitutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) had lost its exclusive 68-year grip on power throughout Mexico in Sunday's \nmayoral and legislative elections.\n\n\"I turned on ECO Mexico on cable [TV] as soon as I got up to get the latest,\" said Leovigildo Florencio, 54, who \nemigrated from Mexico 30 years ago.\n\n\"Cardenas has a good pedigree. His father was one of the few [presidents] who did a good job,\" offered Adan Cruz \nPantaleon of Chinantla, Puebla, manager of the Mi Mexico Pequeno II bakery.\n\n\"My mother pays closer attention to politics there than I do,\" said Alfredo Chamol, 25, over the din of a banda record \nhe was playing for a customer at La Pachanga Records. \"But from what little I've followed, I'd say the PRI will feel \nthe change the most, even more than the people just yet.\"\n\nBut Florencio was more optimistic believing that Cardenas' victory marked the beginning of a new political era.\n\n\"I think maybe in my lifetime we might see a president who is not from the PRI,\" he said.\n"}
