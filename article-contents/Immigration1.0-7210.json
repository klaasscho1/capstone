{"title": "Sending Babies to Be Raised in Child-Friendly China", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n\"Squeezed by Debt and Time, Mothers Ship Babies to China\" (front page, Sept. 14) should have mentioned that \nunderpaid workers in Chinatown are not the only parents who are sending their children back to China. When my \nwife, who is Chinese, and I have a child, we plan to do so because China is much more child-friendly than the \nUnited States.\n\nWhen I lived in China, I knew of a number of children being raised by grandparents while their parents were in the \nUnited States, Hong Kong or Britain. Two well-educated couples I met told me they wanted their children to be \nraised by extended families and away from the dissipating excesses of Western culture.  There is a trade-off, of \ncourse, but I will take schools without air-conditioning and computers over schools with guns and drug pushers any \nday.\n\nSTUART ZIMMERMAN\n\nFairfax, Va., Sept. 14, 1999\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
