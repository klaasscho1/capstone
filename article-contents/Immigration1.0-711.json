{"title": "NEW ASYLUM GUIDELINES RECOGNIZE GRAVITY OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE CLAIMS", "body": "\nThe Clinton administration issued new guidelines Friday to immigration officers to help them identify women who \nshould be granted asylum in this country because sexual violence has been used for political persecution in their \nhomeland.\n\nBy issuing the guidelines, the United States joined the United Nations and Canada in recognizing that women \nmay experience gender-based discrimination that in some cases rises to the level necessary for refugee status, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service said.\n\nThe new guidelines \"educate asylum officers about gender-based discrimination and provide them with \nprocedures and methods for evaluating whether individual claims meet the refugee standard,\" said Immigration \nand Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner.\n\nU.S. law says asylum or refugee status can be granted only to those who show a well-founded fear that returning \nhome would subject them to persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular \nsocial group or their political opinions.\n\nHarvard Law School instructor Nancy Kelly, who coordinates the school's Women Refugees Project, hailed the \nguidelines, along with a recent decision by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals, as \"a major breakthrough for \nthe recognition of asylum claims for women.\"\n\nThe immigration service said the new guidelines were based on a proposed set of guidelines submitted by Kelly's \nproject last year and on those issued by Canada in 1993 and by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThe guidelines \"recognize the need for more sensitive and thorough interviews of women asylum applicants, \nmany of whom suffer psychological and physical trauma from their experiences of rape and other forms of sexual \nviolence,\" Kelly's project said in a statement.\n"}
